We bought the phones for xmas. Everything on the phones work very well (range, caller ID, phone book, phone page, etc) except that it sounds like you're on a cell phone when you use this phone. One problem is that if you and the caller ever start talking at the same time, it's impossible to hear what the person said so you have to keep saying, \\"what was that?\\". I've called home and my husband sounds like he's talking on a cell phone - it's not static at all but just unclear. We've heard that from friends and relatives too. Maybe ours is defective but now we're stuck with it and will have to swallow the cost and start looking for a new one...live and learn I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cordless Phone Ever!!!","review":"I purchased this phone to replace a single handset 900 Mhz Uniden phone that I loved. Since I am a gadget junkie I decided to go with the 2.4 Ghz, and to my surprise it was much worse. I read someone else's review that compared it to a cell phone, but my cell phone is more clear. I would recommend no one purchase this phone. It is a great concern that you can not even count on consistency from the manufacturers of cordless phones. Every time I buy a new phone, I always end up buying a different brand in order to find the quality I am looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent volume and big directory!","review":"If your looking for a phone with clarity, volume and the ability to hold up to 100 names and numbers in the directory, look no more!Advantages:* The caller ID and directory share the same memory so let's say if you have 75 names in the directory you have 25 memory slots left for caller ID info. As your directory grows your caller ID slots grow shorter.* Lots of clear volume.* Easy to read displayDisadvantages:* Cannot send directories to other phones* Cannot add any more phones to system (2 phone limit)* No speaker phone in base* Wish phone had caller ID and directory matching. When someone calls thats in your directory it would come up on the display as it is shown in the directory* END button is really to small. I wish Uniden would have just used the TALK button made to also end the call.With everything considered these phones work well and should be considered when looking for a 2.4GHz cordless phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and range - missing 2 key features though...","review":"I've owned a variety of multi-handset 2.4Ghz phones, the last pair being Siemens. This one (in my environment) provides greater range than other models and good clarity.Beware two shortcomings compared to a Siemens: (a) You cannot use both handsets simultaneously. Although you can transfer a call between handsets you can't pick up on a call in progress from the unused handset. (b) There is no visual indication of remaining battery life. If you are like me and don't like to charge the phone until it is almost dead - you have to guess.I still like the phone, though, and would recommend it to anyone who needs superior range and wall-penetration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging of the Phone","review":"I have noticed that neither phone will not charge in its base unit. When you rest the phone on the cradle, it will not charge unless you provide additional support to keep the phone on the charging contacts. At present we use a popcicle stick to position the phone so it will charge. This is a trick we learned from a previous Uniden phone purchase. That phone took 2 years for the problem to develop, this phone set took 3 months. We have always liked the Uniden phones for their clarity and sound quality, but a phone that won't recharge is of little use, no matter how great the sound quality. This will be the last Uniden phone that we purchase. At least with this phone the keypad didn't stop working too, unless that will happen in the next few weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! Incredible!","review":"This CD was one of my first introductions to Vegan Straightedge. It is an awesome piece of work. It hit a chord in me even all the way here in Cali! The lyrics are so powerful and thought-provoking. I was especially impressed by the raw, unbridled energy of this band. You'll notice it from the opening track all the way to the very end. It may have only six tracks, but it plays like a full-length album. That's how good it is! Their sincerity really shows through, as well. I spent many a night jumping around in my bedroom to that \\"More Hate Than Fear\\" song. It's a great CD to do that with! I'm sorry these guys broke up. They could have put out some seriously mind-blowing tracks, but I guess it was all for the best, eh?

Back to the drawing board, UniPatch. For me back to the old fashioned carbon gel patches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few more negatives about this book","review":"Some of the previous reviews have pointed out some serious problems with Stars & Stripes Triumphant. I just finished reading it, and I noted some more discrepancies.Count Iggy could not have gone to the Royal Naval College Greenwich before the Crimean War, since it wasn't established until 1873. Moreover, it was not a place for training officer candidates (that was done at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth, started in 1863). The courses taught at Greenwich were for mid to upper-grade officers, lieutenant commanders and above.The river running through Cork is not the River Lee but the River Lea.Ulysses S. Grant was known to his contemporaries as \\"Sam.\\"In the 1860s there were two battalions of the Royal Fusiliers, not 25. Only during the massive expansion of the British Army during the First and Second World Wars did certain regiments grow anywhere near that large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stars and Gripes Triumphant","review":"Stars and Stripes Triumphant was a weak, brief, and very predictable conclusion to an otherwise great series. Harry Harrison may have bitten off more than he could chew, technologically, for the military innovations were fairly limited. I know I was waiting for the submarine that never surfaced. While it was satisfying to see the histrionic and arrogant British aristocracy get their decidedly un-Ambersonlike comeuppance, it was oh-so-expected.The book suffered from failure to further develop (or even use) most of the main characters from the previous two books. New characters also could have used a quick personality and body-building session, especially Gladstone and Disraeli.The book was disappointingly short; there was plenty of room for all that was lacking.Fans of the series will need to read the book, just for closure's sake. But wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing conclusion to a good trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the premise of this series when it first came out, but this book reminds me of an old Monty Python album, titled - \\"Contractual Obligation\\". That's the way this book seems to be.After the US and Confederates have send the English packing from North America, they kicked them out of Ireland in the second book in this series. So guess where the English are being confronted in this book? Yep - England.Most of the plot was laid out for the reader, but the end (invasion) was anti-climatic. You knew it was coming and you knew how it was going to be done. A few twists or turns would have been nice. Just something that would have made the light in the reader's head go on when reading for a second time.The pace of the book was good, and the plot wasn't bad, but the depth of some of the characters was missing, and it was just too short.If (or when) this series comes out as a single volume, that would be worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Police (circa 1865)","review":"The concept of this trilogy was fun. It's a Civil War alternate history about a re-united United States at war with a bellicose Great Britain. Lots of fun in the first book, more of the same in the second. Some of the characters were very interesting, and it created a stage on which to explore some interesting political ideas. But unfortunately, by the third book, Stars & Stipes Triumphant, it has turned into a horrible imitation of contemporary politics, with the USA using its superior technical and industrial might to dictate to the world just what kind of democracy the world's nations need. Our kind! It doesn't mater to the first Republican president of the US that the nation he sets to invade (without first declaring war) is already a democracy. The only true democracy is a U.S. style democracy! Let the world tremble at American Might!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Beating of the British","review":"My Overall opinion of this book is that it was lacking in the suspense part, I knew that the U.S. would once again trouce Britain and once again American Ship designs would trouce the Warrior Class. However it was a solid ending to the series. Anyone who calls this insulting to Britian really ought to go to hell. Personnaly I think they could have done better by putting Britain out of the picture. It was kind of a Good Guys triumph book, but it is a pretty good book.

Once a great band with an amazing vocalist and good songwriting has turned into a band with subpar songwriting (are u there Snake and Rachel?!?!?!)and mediocre vocals...and worst of all it doesn't sound like Skid Row. I could've never believed Skid Row trying to sound like Goo Goo Dolls, losing their edge or even defecating in their past with the autoparody \\"I Remember You 2\\". Maybe Sebastian Bach isn't the nicest person to work with, but it's pretty clear The Skids have lost the fire, passion and attitude they were famous for. Yes, it's a shame...this isn't Skid Row anymore. If you wanna listen to the real Skids buy their first album, \\"Slave To The Grind\\" or \\"Subhuman Race\\" and avoid this one...and if you already have'em don't waste your time and money.

I saw them open for Kiss a few years ago, and he sounded great live also.This album is very good. Several tracks are strong. New Generation, Lamb, Thick is the Skin, Born a Beggar, and Hittin a Wall, are the best, and would fit wonderfully on Slave to the Grind. The only difference is that they sound more mature, which is not a bad thing.See you Around is a good, mid-tempo \\"ballad\\", and Remember you Two is also okay. My least favorite tune is Ghost, which sounds too much like Nickelback, who I'm not fond of so I skip that one.All in all this is an excellent album. It just lacks that certain edge of previous Skid albums, probably just because these guys are a little older. However, I'd recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is not bach","review":"I have been a SKID ROW fan for many years, the cd is good,and should have been in the spotlight more.. the only thing that is missing is the voice of Bach..all the tracks on this cd are very well written and put together,but the remake of I REMEMBER YOU is was not LL that great.. evertime I listen to the cd, all I keep saying is that bach could have done better, the new signer has a good voice, but I think the band really tired to replace bach...(you know that can't happen)I am glade I got the cd, it is cool to jam to but I do wish Bach would come back......it is worth picking up..but just keep an open mind when you hear it......"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"SKID NO\\" Doesnt come close..","review":"On the premise of.. if you can say nothing nice don't say anything..

I know why. This cd needs all the help it can get and it's NOT coming from this tune. Ruined it totally. The new vocalist is lousy. Has absolutely no vocal range. On a couple tunes, I thought he was trying to impersonate Dee Sniders Widowmaker type vocal style. By that, I mean an older Dee Snider. The musicianship isn't really to bad, which is why I rated this cd 2 stars. Otherwise, would've only gave it 1. This cd will not sell all that well even if radio picks up on it. The only reason this will sell at all is from past laurels."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no Skid Row without Sebastian Bach.","review":"Skid Row is one of my favorite metal bands from the late 80s/early 90s and first made it big with the singles \\"18 & Life\\", \\"I Remember You\\" and \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" and things get heavier on \\"Piece of Me\\". Skid Row became the first metal band to have an album debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 Albums with Slave to the Grind and produced classics in \\"Monkey Business\\", \\"Slave To The Grind\\", \\"Quicksand Jesus\\", \\"In a Darkened Room and \\"Wasted Time\\". Their next album, Subhuman Race in 1995 was a great album with \\"My Enemy\\", \\"Breakin' Down\\", \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Into Another\\" leading the way. Sebastian Bach was Skid Row and this new album fails to measure up to any of these albums.

It is a tremendously hope filled, warm, book that attaches itself to its reader and rekindles feelings of joy and growth.This is a book that looks like it's written for children, with marvelous illustrations taken from original batik works. In fact, it is for people of all ages. I suppose it's a creation myth story based on what more mechanical types would call the \\"big bang\\" theory. It goes much further than suggesting a more biological, gentler approach based on \\"the everything seed.\\" It proposes that the seed is still going about its business, growing new things, plants, and animals.

There is so much interference. I can't have a phone conversation without hearing 3-4 other conversations at the same time. The most irritating part is that the interfering conversations are crystal clear, while my conversation is static-y and oftentimes lost completely due to the interference.

It is not an exaggeration to say that these headphones sound like they are playing in mono.I had trouble accepting that headphones from a reputable brand like JVC could sound this bad, so I gave JVC the benefit of the doubt and assumed that the first pair was defective. I exchanged them for another pair, and tried them out, only to hear the same tinny, lackluster sound.Please note, I am not comparing these headphones to more expensive ones which may cost two, three or five times as much as the JVCs. Quite simply, the JVCs are terrible by any standard, in any price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much fun as a fork stuck in your ear","review":"I bought these just to try them out for the heck of it, based on the reviews here. Although I own Westone UM2 in-ear monitors and Etymotic ER4s as well, good sounding earbuds for cheap is still something I'm interested in.The bass of these JVC buds is respectable, but the mid-range is harsh and almost painful if you're used to high quality sound. You may find some mixes they sound good with, but I sure didn't find any.Everyone's entitled to an opinion, but I'm hard pressed to imagine what prompted the other positive reviews.

I was told that Amazon wants to wait for the palette to be full before having shippping company picking the entire palette (?).Anyhow, this is the 2nd time this happened to me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened to other Amazon customers, too. More than 6 months ago, I ordered two T-mobile phones and had the same problem. In both times, when I called, all they can do is apologizing.I myself a long time customer of Amazon, but I've decided not to buy from this company anymore.

Beware when you order!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loathe these headphones","review":"I don't understand all the wonderful reviews here.These headphones may fit in one's ears better than others, and yes, they are inexpensive, but there is absolutely no high end or low end audio to be heard while using them.I use my headphones exclusively for my ipod, and these are considerably worse than the original headphones that the ipod came with. True - I don't have to crank the volume on my ipod as much, but the sound of all my music now sounds very hollow & tin-like.

They beat the creative EP-630 and sennheiser CMX-3000 IMHO and of course, they outperform the EX51 and EX71."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound and good isolation","review":"For the price I give them a **** rating. These JVC Marshmellow ear buds sound decent, and have pretty good noise isolation. I'm currently in near a noisy rack of computers at work and I needed something to take the sound level down. I tried some Accoustic Research ARH500 noise caneling headphones (active cancelling) and they didn't block out nearly as much sound as these JVC's do.I've been using Sony EX-71L's for a long time, these JVC's don't sound quite as nice, but they were also about 1/4 of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun how-to book","review":"This is a fun book for any spy fans interested in tradecraft secrets.

A classic for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I've seen this movie in Europe before, and it was such a finely done film by Zeffirelli. I'm glad to know that they're releasing it in DVD in the United States. And the leading actress, Fanny Ardant, was such a fine interpreter of Callas' role in life as a woman. From her fire to her passion for work, it was as if Callas was being called back from her grave to give one final testimony to the world about what her art was really about--and that was an achievement Franco Zeffirelli was truly able to capture on film. From her vivacious, fiery Carmen, to her jealous Tosca, to her Norma and her Butterfly, all her great roles were played in this movie to give audiences a glimpse of what the great Greek opera singer was really like. And, since Zeffirelli and Callas were friends, it was no doubt that he would somehow paint a portrait of her life in one of his artistic films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving the other side","review":"This movie was extremely entertaining and with wonderful performances. I have been waiting for the DVD version since I saw it late last year. The whole theater stood up and applauded the experience and i think you will find it well worth the effort. I don't usually write reviews but was appalled that on the basis of one rather snide report this movie was being rated as a non event. This movie has not found the audience distribution it so richly deserves and I hate the idea that based on this other slanted review, it would also be overlooked by the DVD audience. The scenes of Carmen in the movie are worth the money alone and the performance of Fanny Ardant in the title role is a tour de force."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgraceful, muddled mess. . .","review":"That a film \\"about\\" Callas starts with rock music should be your tip off. The gay sub plot has so little to do with Callas: although shewas surrounded by gays and adored by them, she was essentiallyconfused and irritated by homosexuality. Although Ardant is agood actress, and occasionally LOOKS like Callas, she never soundslike her. I'm not sure the technology \\"used\\" in the film to create\\"Callas Forever\\" (the Carmen film) even existed in 1977: the whole concept is cartoon-ish andembarrassing to those of us who appreciated Callas for the supremeartist that she was. The money spent on this film would have beenbetter spent making an authentic film about Callas, or a definitivedocumentary. Zefferelli is a true genius of film and theater, butlike some other ghastly mistakes of his, this film is simply painful andembarrassing. All copies should be bought up and destroyed! Ardant may be forgiven for her noble attempt, but Ironsand Plowright should have known better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film","review":"I love this movie.

If only Callas had been properly filmed in performance instead of leaving behind one creaky black-and-white version of part of \\"Tosca\\"! If only her voice had lasted a few more years! If only her friends could have done more to pull her out of her shell at the end! Never one for understatement, Franco Zeffirelli gives lavish expression to his deep sense of loss by fantasizing on what might have been. Does he succeed in conveying to younger generations what the world has lost? Or is his creation both too stagey and too personal?

I am afraid that too many people will take this book seriously, and think that they have the right to start lecturing anyone who sneezes near them on the subway. It's a horrible book, written by a woman that I wouldn't want to have anything to do with, ever. Her interpretation of \\"modern manners\\" is disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Be Rude","review":"That is essentially what this book teaches. If you were socially challenged before you read this book and actually inclined to follow the instructions, you'll soon wonder why random strangers and old friends alike seem to hate you. This book details perfect examples of most, if not all, unpleasant encounters I've observed with what I considered to be extremely rude individuals. However, that appears to be its rather well masked intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helped me at work!","review":"I purchased this book recently after seeing the author on \\"World News Now,\\" as her commentary sparked my interest. I was especially interested in office etiquette, as I recently started a new job. In this regard, I found the section on e-mail and how to handle a overly chatty coworker especially helpful! This book answered every question that I had with respect to modern office etiquette...and then some. The book was also highly readable and fun to discuss with friends. In fact, I keep it on my coffee table, as it is a great conversation piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the book I've been looking for all these years!","review":"I've been searching for a modern etiquette book for a long time and this one fits the bill perfectly! I was attracted to its handy size but it's the info inside that really delivers. Ms. Tiger tackles all the pesky situations we find ourselves in everyday and gives practical advice on how to get out of it gracefully. Shutting up chatty coworkers, handling cretins who pull out their cell phones in inappropriate places, dealing with drunk friends, regifting presents. This book has it all! And the author's tone is conversational and friendly. I feel like she's whispering advice into my ear, a pal watching my back. Get a copy of this book before you find yourself giving stinkeye over dinner to a jerk glued to his cell phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious book on manners","review":"For someone to claim to have \\"impeccable manners,\\" this book must obviously be a joke. No one with \\"impeccable manners\\" would ever make suggestions of retalition - some of which could actually cause physical pain to the recipient.Take this book for what it is - a parody of proper behavior. But even in that sense, it fails as it takes itself too seriously and is totally devoid of any real comedic relief.There are far better books which are either good manuals on manners or good parodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT FOLLOW UP","review":"THIS IS A BRILLIANT FOLLOW UP TO THE DREAMING SEA,SHE HAS PROVEN THAT SHE CAN STAND ALONE WITHOUT CAPERCAILLIE.

Then I got amazed when having heard her singing two songs on Secred Garden's album \\"Once In A Red Moon\\" and I decided to obtain her solo albums, too. In comparision with her debut solo release, \\"Time To Fall\\" has more jazz spirit and it sounds more sophisticated. Karen wrote most of her songs about love, they are deep, touching, but also melancholic.My favourites are \\"All The Flowers of The Bought\\", \\"Moonchild\\", but mostly \\"Whispered Reason\\" and \\"Time To Fall\\" - I always get goosebumps when listening to them...If you buy this CD, you will get a collection of fair and pleasant songs which can warm your evenings..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"Karen Matheson has without question one of the finest voices to ever utter a note. On the other hand, a great singer alone does not make a great, or in this case, even good album. With the exception of Morning, which is not that bad of a song, but still somewhat bland, the lyrics are just boring and the music being played to accompany the lyrics are nothing to get excited about either. One of the songs uses Robert Burns' writing as lyrics, but again the music just fails in every aspect.If you wish to see Matheson at her best, find her tracks that appear on almost every Secret Garden CD, or any Capercaille album, her voice is just beautiful. This, unfortunately is the complete opposite other end of the spectrum.

I would keep it in and it would play alright for a while, but after a week or so, I would take it out and see that it had multiple scratches. After a while, it just stopped reading CDs all together. The speakers are awful. They always sound muffled and the range isn't adequate.

That's exactly what we're going to do with this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal Stories","review":"Unless you are totally ignorant of the various areas of the occult, this book will be of no real help to you. There is no Scriptural treatment of the subjects with little logical or critical assessments given of the areas either.

A quick read of the introduction and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The content of the book turns out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and unsophisticated review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves one with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book. This is the same review I have left for another book by the same author and this is purely because the book is written in the exact same way. I have images of a little old man reminiscing about his past with a quill in his hand and an old scroll laid out next to his inkwell.

It is a good DVD if you are majorly sweating your first performance,or if you want to put on a show for someone. But if you are not new to the dance it won't teach you much that you don't already know.If you are a beginner, BUY THIS. It is a good DVD. If you are an intermediate and have never performed before BUY THIS. It will help you understand the structure of a show.

Seems like a short, because you could smack the side of the phone and it would work again for a minute or so.Disappointing to say the least. Another drawback is that the speaker phone sound quality is horrible (no one can hear you unless your mouth is literally on the mic), and you can't dial out from the base.I'm on my way out the door to return this thing ...(luckily bought an extended warranty). First of all, when buying any of the 2.4 ghz phones (they're chock full of problems), buy somewhere ...where you can purchase the extended warranty.

Unlike GW's Seasons, the songs don't hold true to a theme, and seem confused, fragmented in thought (what does \\"No Ke Ano Ahiahi\\" have to do with plains?). Funny, I felt that \\"Dubuque\\" had more of a midwestern feel than \\"Plains.\\" A serious disappointment, as I find previous works \\"Autumn\\" and \\"Winter Into Spring\\" some of the most valuable CD's in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty in simplicity.","review":"Zen Master say, \\"There is beauty in things simple\\".I think that some reviews here are suspiciously too critical.

My favorite song is \\"Graduation\\" because is has an inspirational tune to it. Some people also say that it is bad that it isn't 100% original. I think that it is GREAT that it isn't because it is from songs that we know with a twist. I think that is creative and makes it easier to memorize and hum to.

The author has made an excellent contribution to U. S. history by carefully keeping to his title topic (Catholicism and American Freedom: A History), halting his account when he has made his point, and jumping ahead ten or fifteen years. With a hundred pages of notes and a helpful index, McGreevy has fashioned a parade of people exposing their thoughts and prejudices. I had already known many of the names and events, but I found the quotations startling. Such brazen words written by such renowned men! As for wisdom and insight, Jacques Maritain stood out. I must explain the withheld fifth star: Other authors enliven their work by colorizing, presenting one view with convincing animation. This book is nuanced, more like life, therefore a bit more difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing At Best","review":"This book lacks the well written literary structure of the original series and the illustrations are terrible.

It was a working relationship. Meaningful romance and a companionate marriage took a back seat.The overload of this fine book is the redundant \\"woman good, man bad\\" theme. We are well aware of the hardships women endured during the nineteenth century by performing nearly every task at hand. She was a super human. No social life, just plain hard work all the time.We are also aware that man was responsible for the \\"other\\" duties both on the farm and while traveling the trail.

My insert seems a little too easy to pull out and its not always seated all the way down like my others and as we Zippo owners know its the little cam, thats attached to the insert that keeps the top in place when closed.

She is forced to cease her blossoming relationship with Michael because she's not allowed to bring boys over. Her grandparents might freak!But in the end, she learns to appreciate who she is and culture. Being uniqye is better than liek eeveryone else. And she and Michael end up friends, or more after all.

I have loved his work since I first saw it, and have waited eagerly for each new book. I have seen his works on gallery walls, (which is the way to study any artist's work.) But that's not always possible. This and the other books of this format reveal the images in such a manner that only a gallery show could better.If you love beautiful figurative painting of nude women - and these are NOT Pin-Ups, but figuartive works with a very fetishistic bent, you're gonna' love this book. I love his style, his attaetion to detail and his courage in putting his kinkiest ideas into the world. These books - and this one in particular are the most exciting work I have seen since I discovered the work of John Willie.Sorayama's work is utterly realistic, and not for the faint of heart, but it is utterly rewarding.

Tested it in boiling water by putting the bottom only in the water, reading was accurate. then put it on the sink. After five minutes, the reading had dropped from 208F (our elevation is 3200 feet) to 150F. The problem is that this thing takes forever to change its reading.

This thermometer takes the guesswork out of grilling, allowing me to slow roast dry-rub chicken, pork and fish, and ribs. Although I didn't think it would work as well for steaks and burgers, it did show me that my grill temperature can reach 600+ degrees on high burner settings. So by turning the burners down a little, I have had less tendency to overcook. It does accumulate spatter during cooking as others have noted. By pushing it to the corner of the grill, I have minimized this. When it did need cleaning, I used a dab of olive oil on a dishcloth and it came off easily (just be sure to wipe any oil residue off before putting it back on the grill). It's a great bargain for what it does. The only way it could be better is if it could be read outside the grill with the lid down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a disposable!","review":"Used this piece of junk one time on a new Weber gas grill. Seemed like a heavy well built item. Heated it up to 600 degrees for searing, then turned down the temp to finish cooking. The Red painted areas on the face turned black and the metal all discolored. Did not make direct contact with the flames. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This thermometer is not accurate and takes way too much time to heat up to the same temp.OK for a general idea as to how hot your grill is, but not good for accurate temps.I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This thermometer takes 15 minutes to decide on a temperature. It is way too slow to be used with a grill. After 1 smoke the lens was so charred I couldn't even see the needle through it anymore. I couldn't scrub it clean either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this to check the surface temp on my gas grill. The first time I used it the color on the face faded so bad, it is really hard to read. The temp seem to read correctly, but it is hardly usable because you can't read the dial. I won't be getting another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quick read thermometer","review":"I got two of these (one for my brother) to know for certain when to put the steaks on the BBQ. This is the slowest thermometer I have ever used. It takes forever to warm up. While you wait and wait, your charcoal is burning up and you can't really tell if the gauge is going to go up further or not. So you wait some more. Save your money and use the old hand over the grill trick to judge the temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"cooked out!!!","review":"This seemed like a solid little thermometer...til it got used a couple times!! The face and dial turned so gray that you cannot read the temps, the little hand turned the same dark color as the gauge background making it all but useless. I am sending it back to Amazon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"I suspect that the my thermometer might be faulty, will be putting it in the oven to test it out soon.Used it twice, notice that the needle moves very slow to reflect the temperature. Even under direct flame it took like 3min to get to the temp reading. Another issue is that i got moisture under the glass and the screen is all blured and yellowish.I like the design though."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"Bought two of these about 8 months ago. I grill a lot and have used them frequently. They didn't hold up very well. One got a little water in it and now clouds up whenever it's used. Both turned black and are barely legible (even if cleaned the black doesn't come off - it's on the inside of the glass). One of them reads 550 degrees when not in use. For the money, they were ok, but if you grill 2 - 3 times per week, don't expect them to last more than 8 or 9 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"OvenChek cooking surface thermometer","review":"I was a bit disappointed that this is NOT an oven thermometer as it suggests. It is a great grill thermometer, but does not work in the oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreasonable Amount of time to Register Temp","review":"I can't imagine relying on this for indoor grills and frying pans. At the rate it was going, I have to believe it would take 6 -8 minutes, minimum. I was testing it on a preheated (375 degree) griddle, and after 3.5 minutes it barely registered 200 degrees. Like another reviewer I didn't want to risk my pan or cause a smoke out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low grade product","review":"Product feels good when you get it. Put it in my grill and once it hit 500 degrees the coloring started to fade. Product works, but I became unease when a thermometer that has a top range of 700 degrees starts to show stress on the first use at 500 degrees within 30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"I recently started using a charcoal grill and this thermometer really makes life easier. You can tell when the coals are ready with just a glance and it also makes cooking indirectly a breeze. It gets a little dirty while BBQ'n but it cleans easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't survive one use!!","review":"Apparently thermometer isn't made for the heat that a gas grill creates.

This is when all 5 sisters were singing and I love the harmony. What is great about the recording is it shows flaws and all because it's live, and organic. These sisters are so gifted, and were truly in their prime on this recording. The classic is my living in vain, is just awesome, and sang with so much emotion, no other version compares to this one. Speak Lord is another stand out track led by Karen Clark Sheard, she truly let's God use her, and brings it home, gives me chills everytime I hear it. Other tracks I love include Hiya, and Salvation to me led by Jacky Clark Chisolm, I love the end of this song. Now is the time is haunting and beautiful, and arranged very well. Also Twinkie's organ playing is immpeccable as usual, just awesome. This also includes one of their other classics Miracle, to close the c.d Overall just vintage Clark Sisters.

In reality, we should have payed better attention to the other reviews of this product. It went together quickly and easily but is so cheaply made that we are concerned that it won't even last this summer season. The inadequately supportive structure combined with very thin, cheap canvas was not worth the $250 this cost us. It took us twice the time to put together our last gazebo and it lasted two years.

I setup it and it looked very nice. However, there was rain (not shower) on the 3rd day, it collapsed while I watched it. This is a design issue, I bet the company never do any structure study (or did it but choose the inferior material anyway). What happened is the rain got collected on the canopy and would not flow away. This is a significant safety concern for seniors and disabilities. Be aware!Talked with Customer service of Bond back and forth a few times, the opinion is that is out of warranty coverage and do not admit that was a design defect issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to set up...but!","review":"I was looking for something to beatify my yard and a place to sit and relax.

I have another Uniden phone, at 900 MHz, and its sound quality is about 10 times better. This 2.4 GHz technology is all about marketing B.S.---I end up having to almost shout on this phone in order for other people to hear me properly, and I don't hear them as well either.It's too bad, because the answering machine seems to work quite well, easy to use functions. The phone is attractively designed, with the handset being of a very pleasing shape and appearance.

I very much related to the mom who wrote this book. She shared in the book many of the same feelings I was experiencing. There was also excellent information provided.

However, it did not explore some of the more current methods of treatment, including pre-surgical devices, and it seems to have been sponsored by a specific support group which is never really disclosed. I found the nauseating mention of this group over and over and over again to be quite an obvious overkill, and I had to return mine copy.

Rabbi Steinsaltz takes a hard hitting, realistic look at the topics of sex, love, friendship and death to name a few. As opposed to other so called \\"New Age\\" authors of our time Rabbi Steinsaltz affords the reader the opportunity for true self exploration revealing both the ugly and beautiful sides of human nature.

Recordings.\\" It also has the track \\"Melody\\" so you are not losing anything from the (inferior) Magic Label release...I'd also like to add that I received more emails in response to that first review than for any other thing I have done on the internet; it was fascinating to hear from so many other music lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This is one of my favorite all-time albums. The band, while having great material and sound, has hints of Blood, Sweat and Tears, Chicago, and some Gary Pucket. The title track, Vehicle, is now widely used for General Motors cars commercials.Alas, this CD is a very poor shadow of the original album. The re-mastering is inept, as the sound is muffled, tinny sometimes, and overly bassy most of the time. It is not possible to adjust your equalizer to make it sound right.It hurts to listen to this poorly done CD. My advise: get the vynil if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vehicle CD","review":"Always liked this one. Use to have a 33 1/3 LP of this album; wore it out. To hear it again, without the scratches and pops associated with that medium, is nice. Quality of the recording is limited by what was available in the late 60s early 70s, but it's as good as you can get from something of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing sound quality on this \\"Magic\\" label release","review":"Quite an example of uneven sound quality that is totally unforgiveable in this current day and age. I was very excited to finally find this \\"LP\\" on CD and couldn't wait to play it...however, when the CD arrived I could not believe how poor the sound quality was...drop-outs, surface noise, distortion--simply unplayable. I have heard direct transfers from LP to CD that sound waaaaaay beter than this garbage. My happy ending is that a few years later I was lucky enough to discover the Ides of March CD on the Rhino Handmade label. It was like Magic!--What a difference professional sound quality makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"ides of march - vehicle","review":"vehicle is the only decent song on the entire album. no wonder the band never made it very far."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the un-sporty who always get picked last","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child, because I was never very athletic or the one chosen first for a team in gym. Pig hates gym class, and when the class plays capture the flag, the teams argue over whose side he has to be on. But when the chips are down, he finds that teamwork and determination may make up for his lack of speed. I give it a cautious five stars because some of this 1977 book is out of sync with today's PC society (when Pig drops a ball in gym he is called \\"butterhoves\\" and is told he is too fat... plus who lets kids pick teams today?) But it is a wonderful book, sure to be enjoyed if you, like me, are a bit too slow, or heavy, or not sports-inclined."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the art book, NOT the movie","review":"This is the BOOK related to the movie, NOT the movie itself. It contains Kurosawa's own painted and drawn storyboard of the film, thereby letting us understand the strong authorial vision for the film. I saw a copy of this book a long time ago and unfortunately don't have one at hand. However, I felt I needed to write in with something, as the other reviews talk about the movie, and this book is quite different from that as an experience.I also did not give this 4stars, as I don't know what the book is.

The author does very little to describe the events leading up to the battle and even less describing the action. The after effects of the battle are non-existent. So what do you have left?

He was best known as the creator of the long-popular comic strip \\"Red Ryder,\\" but in his late 50's he began a second career as a serious painter of the real and legendary aspects of the region. This book collects 88 of his paintings, some in color, others reproduced in BW, and ranging from charater portraits to Russell/Remington-style action pictures. Here are scouts and buffalo hunters, Indians (both Navajos and plains tribes), animals wild and tame, stagecoaches and sheep wagons, and above all cowboys and their horses. Each is on a double-page spread with a brief note describing the situation portrayed. There's also a biographical introduction that covers Harman's life and career. Lovers of Western art won't fail to enjoy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the gloom of grunge rock starts to enjoy itself again","review":"After seattle had convinced all rock fans that life was depressing gloomy and down right miserable, four lads from Bradford (of all places), England, fought back and brought some light back to our favoured music genre. This album was just so new and fresh that even though based in poppy anthems still managed to get likes of Pantera and slayer fans bouncing up and down with excitment (trust me I was one of them). Pointless lyrics on bouncy tunes made these lads hot property in the UK during the late nineties and rightly so. Every song is fun and theres not one dud, bring a smile to your face, buy it, stick in the stereo and start bouncing on your bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"invictus is fabulous","review":"The movie is fabulous.

The script struck me as simplistic, flat, and utterly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie was a bad attempt at a tribute to Nelson Mandella. Or maybe rugby, it isn't really clear. It lacked any sort of involvement or connection with any of the characters, so that it ended up being a string of one liners delivered by Freeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invictus","review":"The movie is not in English nor will not play in the DVD player.

No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invictus","review":"I was not aware of this historical event and was very happy to enjoy the performances of two of my favorite actors (Freeman and Damon)in this. The movie, purchased from Amazon.com, was exciting and held my interest for the entire length of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"This was a very good movie. If their was one living person that I would like to meet, it would be Nelson Mandela. His courage, ideas and drive brought a country together. He used anything and everything to work towards unity, this is one method that is very inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleasantly Surprised","review":"InvictusSeeing the previews on this film I was somewhere between \\"this looks really good\\" and \\"the previews probably make this film look a lot better than it is.\\" So when I finally watched the film I was blown away. The pathos between Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon is tremendous. The presentation of Mandela orchestrating the opportunities for black and white South Africans to work together is moving. The poignancy that flows out of Francois Pienaar (Damon) in his growing awareness of not only what Mandela went through but also his willingness to forgive is quite compelling. After one viewing it has become one of my favorite films. See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership","review":"There are a lot of inspirational movies based on sporting events, but this one is also shows how to lead. If you are in a leadership position, or wish to be, this movie can teach you a lot. Nelson Mandela, after 30 years in prison, leads with class, dignity, compassion, intelligence, fairness, and vision. Watch Mandela then compare him to our recent political leaders in the U.S. with the backstabbing, partisan politics that gets us nowhere. If you want to be in management, coaching, or any position of leadership, watch and learn from this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This film was a feel good movie with some action.

If I'd only known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint Eastwood strikes out -- badly","review":"Running 2 hours, 13 minutes, this movie seems like it will never end. If you have no prior knowledge of Rugby, you will learn nothing aboutthis alleged \\"sport,\\" save the one-line explanation that the ball can only be passed sideways or backwards. One never sees anystrategy for victory -- merely physical brute force as players pummel each other, and then one breaks free to kick a goal. Ifyou like to see endless scenes of crowds watching TV screens and screaming enthusiastically, this is your kind of movie, butif you want smart dialogue or dramatic tension, skip this one. In fact, if there were any clever dialogue, you would be unable tounderstand it, because the sound track is so muffled, and nearly everyone mumbles. Unless your hearing is perfect, you willhave to watch this movie with sub-titles turned on. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for T.V. Movie","review":"I was really disappointed with this film. Eastwood definitely drops the ball all the way here. I've seen better made for T.V. movies than this. The quality of the script and cinematography were really sub par. Worst of all the plot is by the numbers and telegraphs its intention to pull your sympathy and emotions this way or that. The slow mo crowd reactions shots at the end were music video quality. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandela Deserved Better","review":"I hated this film. Morgan Freeman is not cut out to play Nelson Mandela; the real Mandela deserves better representation. Freeman could not keep the South African accent going, he looked disconnected from the rest of the actors and totally awkward, no warmth, no substance, no serious undertaking of Mandela character. Matt Damon's talents were totally wasted here. And to know that Clint Eastwood directed a movie about this topic is a joke. This was sheer mockery of an important subject matter. Clint Eastwood should stick to what he knows best, and taking on a very dynamic and important man as Mandela was not something Eastwood was capable of accomplishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mandela Scores High In The Reconciliation Game\\".","review":"This is a movie reflecting the reconciliatory Nelson Mandela with the whites (predominantly Afrikaners whose favourite sport is rugby) in 1995 during The Rugby World Cup in Ellis Park, Johannesburg, South Africa.Morgan Freeman plays the great Mandela brilliantly with Matt Damon playing the captain (Francois Pienaar). His accent & mannerism match Francois Pienaar's very well indicating the brilliance of Matt Damon as an actor! The movie is produced by the legendary Clint Eastwood. Recent events in South Africa (the brutal murder of the right-wing leader Eugene Terre'blanche & Julius Malema's antics of ANC Youth League), may indicate the failure of the South African society to continue where Mandela left off but not the failure of Nelson Mandela himself. A great movie about a selfless story by Nelson Mandela to reconcile a nation devided by decades of Apartheid, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me - Maybe for you, maybe not.","review":"I really enjoy movies with Morgan Freeman in them and I do enjoy sports films. However, I could not get into this one, the movie did an excellent job showing the power struggle going on in South Africa and how somewhat of a little thing like changing the colors and a name for a rugby team could really make a difference.However, I've never played rugby before and no little about the sport or the rules that are played so it was a little confusing and while you are trying to take time to figure things out you miss part of what is going on in the movie. I think it would have been better if they somehow incorporated rugby rules into the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value Lens","review":"I've been using this lens for nearly two years now and am still very impressed. The 14-45mm range is wide enough for excellent landscape shots and provides enough zoom for most situations (although you'll want more for capturing wildlife). There is some chromatic aberration in high contrast situations and some barrel distortion (only noticeable if you're photographing a brick wall or other strong grid), but given the price of this lens I think it's acceptable. Although it isn't weather/dust sealed it does have a high quality feel to it with smooth rotation.Overall this is a compact, inexpensive lens that delivers excellent results in the majority of situations. There are better lenses out there but for beginner/intermediate photographers you're better to save some money on the lens and invest in good books on technique, composure, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor QC","review":"Slow lens even for a low end DSLR, lasted two weeks before focus stopped working. Expect better than that from Olympus and after reading all the reviews elsewhere I see that it is a common problem, would not be so bad if we could even manual focus but it will not and as with all major manufacturer's they no longer have local repair so you have to pay to ship for repairs.No more Olympus for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Collection","review":"Really interesting-- this is a phenomenal collection.

(Some fashion articles in Vogue and Harper's are excellent, but it's obvious why this one worked at MLLE.) It lacks depth in the subject matter. For all the work that she pu into it, I feel like she is just skimming the surface. It's writing style is utterly irreverant. No wonder people find fashion vapid and superfluous. The points that were made in the book are nothing ground breaking or thought provoking.

On my old Olympus this rarely happened, on the A640 it was commonplace.2) Red-Eye: Many pictures indoors were plaged by terrible red eye. Again Canon did not include red-eye reduction & it is evident in many of my pictures.Overall I got some good pictures with this camera, but far too many blurry & bad photos to give this camera a good rating.

It's the camera you can take anywhere and will tend to have with you when a photo-op comes up.

The color, fast-focusing autofocus, lack of shutter delay are excellent and the movable LCD is very convenient. I love mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Leak bad customer service","review":"My camera was just out of warranty and the batteries leaked. The company agreed to fix my camera then returned it without fixing it and charged me anyway. They would not release my camera for delivery without a signature so now they have our broken camera. They finally returned the charge, but we are still dissatisfied with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disappointing","review":"This is an inferior product. I bought the A640 because my beloved S80 finally bit the dust.This camera simply cannot take pictures in low light. But all the pictures I have taken with this camera suffer from poor image quality and are often very washed out.It's possible to take some good photos with this camera using the manual settings (a big selling point for me). It does take excellent macro shots, and the video quality is superb. But if you're wanting a camera to use on vacation, or just take snapshots- go higher or lower on the price scale. This camera is a poorly designed compromise- it has a lot of great features that don't add up to a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst camera ever!!!","review":"I bought this camera last march for our trip to Europe. The pictures were never of the quality of my Canon Elph 2 mp. A couple weeks ago the button to switch from shoot to view fell off. Yesterday the camera quit working all together.

The unit only worked for a couple of days prior to having all sorts of video and audio problems. For this last month I have been on the phone with Sony who keep sending me fileware upgrade in the hope of fixing the unit. The last upgrade simply fried the unit and it no longer works. They then request I pay to ship it back to them so they could fix it and I would get it back withing 2 - 3 months.

Seems very finicky about disks with slight scratches. The \\"eject\\" button takes a long enough time to eject that you sit there wondering if you really ejected it and you hit it again, and it goes out about an inch and then goes back to tell you \\"no you hit it before I just decided to register both presses at the same time\\". Gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it actually plays disks and is basically functional, but I'd be upset if I got one for free (which I guess I kinda did).

I know this because both the Flex XP II and the Contour 5775 can use the 31S foil and cutter. I used the foil and cutter I was using on my Contour on this shaver and the shave was much faster and smoother.The auto cleaning feature thing is not that great, IMHO.

You might as well stick rubber cement under your eyes for all the good it does. It's like a clear paste that doesn't dry clear.

Learn from my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"strangely affecting book","review":"I don't know why I picked up this book; I suppose it was because it's set in the past and most of my selections are present day. Almost in spite of myself, I found myself becoming engrossed in the lives of the Hawkes family, of Ben Joe and his sisters, his looney-tunes Grandma, and his reserved but strong-willed mother. It paints an exquisite picture of small-town Southern America in the early 60's. There's a lot more going on in Ben Joe's head than ever really happens in the book. It's a lot about what people let you see and what people try to hide. I enjoyed it. It makes me want to read more Tyler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Joe needs to let go of worrying about others","review":"The guy is a self-proclaimed worrier, and when he learns one of his many sisters has returned to the family home with a baby and no husband, he feels somehow responsible and obligated to fix things. His return proves to be of more value to himself than to the houseful of eccentric (Tyler's specialty) women that have been muddling along just fine without him, thank you very much.Typically wonderful writing in this compelling family drama about love, caring, bonding, and healing. Not Tyler's best, but just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF Morning ever Comes, Anne Tyler","review":"This must have been an earlier book of the author. The characters had little personality whichis not like her other novels. Really dull reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I'd die of boredom!","review":"I hope the reviewer who said that Anne Tyler diavowed this book was right - it was a real snoozer! The characters were shallow, two-dimensional at best, and the pace was atrociously slow. I had to force myself to finish it, so I could give it a fair chance while discussing it at my book club meeting. Surely, even in the South in the era in which this was set, people had some feelings, some purpose in life, some rational thought processes that guided their lives. These characters seemed to have none of these. From Ben Joe (where was he from the time he finished college to the start of law school?) to his vacuous sisters, no character stood out as definable in my eyes. And how was it that Shelley could so easily go from one love to another, agreeing to marry someone she hadn't seen in years, and who proposed so hastily and half-heartedly? I wanted to change the name of this book to: \\"If the End of This Book Ever comes, I'll Be Happy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"I like Anne Tyler, this book was a huge disappointment. It was written over 40 years ago and it seemed like it. Not sure what the point of the plot was. Rambling story with flaky characters, but it won't deter me from reading other Anne Tyler books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"When morning finally came...","review":"...Ben Joe Hawkes left his hometown as unenlightened about his family as he was when he arrived. On top of that, he's got in his baggage a new/old love, who seemed to be adding to his confusion. This story could have gone in a number of directions. Personally, I would have liked to know more about Philip Hawkes, Ben Joe's deceased father, through the recollections of his mother, grandmother, and Philip's mistress, as well as the relationships between the three women. Perhaps then Ben Joe would have shed some light on his past, and we as readers would have more light on him and his future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant as ever","review":"I just love Ann Tyler. I did find myself wondering if she had written this as a period piece and it was not until the end I realised it was one of her early books. It is a conceit on my part to think that the portrayal of complex emotions belongs to modern times. Unspoken family secrets are timeless in their ubiquity. As is the dilemma of leaving your family behind to make your own way in the world. Ann Tyler captures so well the risks we take in moving on and the impulse to remain as we are however unsatisfactory. On the way we meet some entertaining characters. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy about it!","review":"The book was written skillfully just didn't do for me what i thought it would do.

My wife passed the book to me with the comment, \\"You like mysteries, this book drives me crazy\\". The assertion is true, but I feel her implied criticism is unwarrented. Good mysteries do not obscure by twisting the time sequence of each chapter so that the reader is confused as he reads sequentially. This is fakery and gratuitous reader manipulation. This could be a good read, but it is not. An editor should have said, \\"Maxine, what are you trying to say? Where is the 'mystery'? Have you thought about the impression your book will leave on the reader?\\" There are some good descriptions of the land right next to some pedestrian prose (unusual for a poet).

Liz, on the other hand, tries a new 'image' and ends up improving herself but only for her ambitions to be shot down by Leona.

I was very disappointed that writers are taking characters that work well together to solve a mystery with clean language, fun spooks, and great 'monsters', and turning them into the usual Hollywood mess that is out there now.

While moving the stylus on the corners of the screen it gets stuck on the screen protector film. Bubbles get under the film really easily while installing and it gives the screen too much glare.

The musician, Yatri, has really devoted herself to this project, creating a beautiful compilation of sonic improvisation. This album is not too long, so hopefully there will be more recordings by Yatri using this unusual instrument. Some listeners, not used to such a depth of harmonic overtones, might find this type of music unsettling, although I really enjoyed it. Historically, this instrument was known for being soothing and even trance inducing, like regular quartz crystal singing bowls that are used by sound healers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love all Hanky Panky","review":"This is well made and great fitting.

The premise--to rephotograph sites that Stimsom had already photographed decades earlier--is hardly original. Prospective buyers should be aware that this is really nothing but a coffeee table book, and it is substandard even for that genre. The rather mediocre photos are only loosely tied together by commentary that is hardly more than poorly written fragments. Even the used book price... is excessive, considering the paltry contents. Even compared to other works in the coffee table book ghetto, this one is surprisingly shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Exciting","review":"Having been soured on the genre by some Ottmar Liebert CDs, I did not look forward to auditioning another nuevo flamenco recording with any enthusiasm, but Calima proved to be a truly exciting musical discovery that I want to recommend with as much enthusiasm that this energetic recording deserves, which is mucho indeed! Guitarist N��?ez is joined at various times by bassist John Patitucci, pianist Danilo P��rez, and percussionist Arto Tuncboyaciyan, with Carmen Cort��s providing energetic handclaps. Guitarists Strunz and Farah also join N��?ez on one of the cuts. All of the music is by N��?ez, and it's all good. The title cut is outstanding, worth buying the CD for right there--and there's not a dull moment on the whole CD. To make Calima even more recommendable, the recording quality is excellent--dynamic and well-balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nunez is one of the best guitarists around!","review":"The most amazing record from what I think is the best nuevo flamenco guitarist around!

I got a 12 inch x 9 x 4 box for a 4 inch tall product that wasn't even breakable.My main complaint is that, unlike the misleading picture above, the protectors dont cover the whole screen. I have about a half a centimeter gap at the top of my m130, and a small gap around the other edges. I suppose they could improve your handwriting, but all they do is make your stylus move slower. There are little bubbles all over the screen, and the credit card-like thing they give you to smooth them out doesn't even fit your palm correctly, and doesn't work well. In under a minute of writing, the screen was already very scratched up.Unless you are loosing sleep over your palm screen or having problems with people putting their fingers on it, I wouldn't recommend buying these (they are also very overpriced)."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice baby carrots","review":"Had them before, like them, very nice when you do not have much space, and when you cook a stew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"Simi and Jackson's love story was so amazing I couldn't put it down.

It also has 5K, 10Km half and full marathon training plans.

There are some issues with each lick playing through & then having to go back to the main menu to repeat it or go to the next lick. The player on the dvd is very good, and I do like the way the earlier licks are shown slow & fast. What I don't like about the dvd is probably not a fault of the product, but a misperception on my part.

This game sucked. The story was way past kewl and I kept wanting to know what happened next and stuff. However, I didn't want to actually play the game to get there. I wasn't having any fun. The gameplay was just atrocious. I was forced to control characters I didn't like and watch as the computer (poorly) controlled the ones I did like. In fact my control was laudable. There was an \\"autofight\\" button that I had to rely on in order to maximize my battle score. Yes each battle is scored, meaning that the less time it takes to win, the better your rewards may be. Thus using the autofight button is almost required. It just took all the fun out of it. BTW, forget how much I disliked the gameplay, how is this a greatest hits in 2011 when it was released in spring of 2010? Why isn't prototype a greatest hit or mass effect 1? Well that was a waste of $20.

Its possible to figure it out, but it was a terrible way to set up a leveling system. Combat is not great, but it can be fun (just don't plan on selecting which team members go with you, the storyline does that part for you).Maybe someday I'll try to finish it, but it left such a bad taste in my mouth, I think it will collect dust until the day I make it a set of coasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is the worst final fantasy game I have ever played you are led around don't get to free play and the characters suck it's a boring game don't buy rent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Turtle Fight 13","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series since I was in grade school. I love the story, the characters and most importantly the planning and depth that goes into the combat in the games. This latest installment has barely enough of the first two to call itself by its own title. If you like farming (or killing over and over for items) then this is the game for you. In order to make your characters strong enough to kill the last extra boss you will be farming for over 40 hours. On the same enemy. With little to no drops most of the time.

If you like real Final Fantasy games, go buy VI or IX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of fun.","review":"I've played most of these Final Fantasy games but they just seem to be getting worse.

I think this one has done it for me with the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runaway as fast as you can","review":"So, whether you like Jrpgs or play Final fantasy series, this game will be on the bottom of your list. The worst part of this FF is the fact that its so linear. When my ps3 died and I realize I had to replay ff13, I decided to sell it.The reason why I sold it was:1. Its basically the same game every time you play it( especially the first 13 chapters)2. There is nothing unique about each characters( Similar sphere grids based on the class)3. Story was just ok.Many people didn't like 12 but at least in 12 I was playing the first same every time I start over. 12 did not hold my hands I could runaway open maps and talk to people in the city.Whats Missing from this game:1. Cities, World map, NPCs2. Replay valueI hated the weapons and armor system. The battle system was just ok. Music was great though. Square-Enix please stop holding our hands, don't dumb down jrpgs and bring back exploration.

To put it plainly: this is a horrible, horrible game. The characters are incredibly annoying(especially Hope), and the story is non-existent. I have played the game for about 20 hours and it has gone nowhere. There is no interaction with anyone outside of the main group. Speaking of which, the party is almost never together. You have to deal with them all going off on their own and you are left with multiple angles of the story that just gets frustrating. Oh, and let me add that this is the most overly dramatic game I have ever played. Again, I have only played for about 20 hours, but I am going to return the game today. After this and FF12, I'm not sure that the creators really know what the hell they are doing anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forward, X and a side of L1","review":"As my title states, this is the whole game until you reach around 25+ hours (Chapter 11). Can you last 25 hours of mediocre drywall characters with a story that will put you a sleep? There is no minigames, no towns, etc. You are literally just in a huge endless tunnel dungeon crawling with cutscenes.I accomplished this and reached chapter 11... as everyone says it gets so much better then. It does not get better. It is just now a huge field to explore with the same boring characters and story.Oh well, hopefully Final Fantasy 13 vs will be a much better game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy XIII","review":"Final Fantasy XIII is a solid game with a compelling story.

Things have definitely gone downhill from there, and XIII wasn't worth the plastic it was printed on. It has such a boring combat system, and boring gameplay. The open-world of FF VII was what I loved about it and that is very much gone. This is basically an extended dungeon crawl with cut-scenes between it.Visually and musically this is an amazing game, and I wish the gameplay matched. Sadly, it does not.

If I wanted to play a game that has nothing but battles and prevents me from doing anything else I'd purchase something like COD or some other shoot 'em up game. The graphics are nice, but being interrupted with a freakin' mini ever few minutes is hella annoying ESPECIALLY since all you're able to do is battle, battle, BATTLE!I loved FF8,9 and 10...I don't understand why this crap was made and I am not interested in FFXII-2 either. Also, the characters SUCK! I can't stand Snow, but I detest Serah.Bring back what works, leave out what doesn't. If you're new to FF, you will probably love this crap.

PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!","review":"There is almost nothing about this game that is Final Fantasy... This game has very limited RPG elements and is really only a RPG in name. At no point in time can you walk around and talk to anyone (no missions or secrets to find). It plays literally like a linear action game. No incentives to level up or find new weapons or armor it's all pretty much the same. You can literally beat the game holding X and the Analog stick forward, no need for srtategy. You level up automatically too.The game does look amazing but its made to reach a large audience that do not necessarily enjoy true RPG's. What makes it really bad is the amount of time they had to perfect this game. After watching the success of Fallout and Oblivion you would think FF would have come out swinging for the fences. THIS IS NOT A FINAL FANTASY GAME IT IS AN ACTION GAME WITH A FINAL FANTASY NAME!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly...","review":"Tired of game developers being forced to dumb down games based off the casual market. Square-Enix takes a beloved franchise and surgically removes practically all identifying characteristics. Your left with a boring husk that shares the name and technological prowess of the series with and action rpg mechanic. Boss fights are easy with only a handful of difficult ones to challenge you. Summons once again find little reason to exist (seems to be an issue since FF9). Music I actually loved, and graphics of course. The characters were actually pretty well designed but many do not have the development needed to make you care. By the end of the game your just so invested that you force yourself to complete to see the end, but your terribly bored. The combat is at first interesting but it becomes tedious and boring because its simply a race to staggger the opponent then quickly destroy them. Just disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great RPG Game for all!","review":"I am a huge final fantasy fan so it was no surprised that I would love this game.

This is just plain too much work - and combining things without the least guidance is merely chance. the aprts are too abstract to understand why this goes with that, etc. And the boss battles are very unforgiving and leave you very frustrated. Die and restart until you figure out what you have to do differently to beat them. I still have no idea why I was able to beat the 2 Sisters! But I did, after 2 nights and 8 tries. And there are TOO many cut scenes. I feel like when I am just getting into the groove of the battle system, it stops and forces me to watch a cut scene...then go READ THE INCLUDED ENCYCLOPEDIA. READ! I will buy a book if I want to read - and I felt I had to read the stuff just to comprehend the convoluted story.Waited to buy and when I did, felt like I wasted my money. I was actually hurt that Square-Enix let me down.

If you go into this game with the mentality of a beatemup with a good story by action game standards you will have fun. Challenge yourself to get 5 stars on every fight and it's a good action game. If you want a story, interesting characters, and exploration look elsewhere. The level design is awful, you are travelling through a narrow walkway 95% of this game no exaggeration at all. There is very little story in the middle of the game, out of a 50 hour game only the beginning 10 hours and last 2 or 3 have anything happening. The characters annoyed me personally but that's very subjective, I know a lot of people liked them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Graphics, Terrible Battle system","review":"Lets start with the very worst this game has to offer, with three characters, only one is at risk. Even with all of the available strengths other character possess, you will be in \\"game over\\" if that one character is lost. So, you will find battles very difficult or very easy, however you do not get to complete the story or enjoy a \\"game\\" only a repeated button mashing and changing paradiams. Don't even bother to start. Whoever developed this silly \\"Battle system\\" must be reassigned and put in charge of another highly repetitive and meaningless task, maybe sweep the parking lot.The Best, once again great graphics, but you can get that with God of War III, Red Dead Redemption or Uncharted, so, not really a reason to blow $60 on hours of repetitive button pressing, unless you enjoy thumb exercise.What does this all mean?

I spend no more money on your games!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"I had looked forward to this for a while. I was ecstatic when I got it, and utterly disappointed when I played it. From my perspective, it was all eye candy and little substance. Where are the sprawling cities with neutral characters? Why does my hand have to be held through so much of the game? Why so serious all the time? The characters in the final fantasy universe have never started out so dry and uninteresting as the ones in this game. I prefer the battle system of FFX over the real time battle system employed here. Everything has been streamlined, which in my opinion takes the depth and fun right out of the game. Maybe it is because I am older and some of my imagination has left me, or maybe it's because this is a dismal effort of a game. It has the name going for it and everything else about it is hollow. The developers need to return to their roots.

We paid so much for this awfull game and is not PS3 worth it!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as its predecessors","review":"its hard to start on this game but the main issue i have is the lack of story and what little there is to it is very difficult to understand and get into. the gf/eidolon fights later in the game are way to difficult with the only two people available at that part of the game. way to much upgrading you have to do for each class for every character. if the party leader gets ko'ed then you start over from the last checkpoint or replay the fight. the only upside to ff13 is the graphics and that it. this is not a final fantasy in my book and it just uninteresting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"It is an amazing game, excellent graphics, good story, been playing for 30 hours now, and no disappointment till the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy, SE strikes again with a HIT!","review":"cant say anything bad about this game. graphics are 10+++++.good story line, easily able to get 100 hours of play time out of this game.only downfall is upgrading into relic weapons. why would SE make an item only obtainable by a mob with a 1% drop rate grrrrrr 0/25 so far.but great buy. worth every penny"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this game","review":"Yeah, sensitive topic, you either hate it or love it. Well, I am 32, been playing Final Fantasy since the first one came out on the NES and the only Final Fantasies that I have liked have been the first one on the NES, the second part on the SNES and the VII on the PS. The other ones pretty much sucked for me. I hated Final Fantasy X, I found it too boring. Anyway, having said that, I have been playing this latest one and I really like it so far, not perfect but not as bad as the PS2 ones. I have been enjoying myself quite a lot. I do recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse Final Fantasy ever","review":"I would say this was the worse Final Fantasy but I am told Final Fantasy II was worse. Graphically this game was beautiful, it's eye candy. As far as everything else it's just bad. Save you're money, move on, play an old Final Fantasy or pray that the series gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Years of waiting for this?","review":"Ill keep this short for all you folks wanting a straight to the point review.Pros:*New battle system is decent*Great graphics, truly beautiful to look at.Cons:*Most annoying characters of any FF that I played (6 and up)*Story line is complete garbage*Too many cut scenes, it starts to get really annoying.*More linear that other FF games.All in all this game is a true pleasure to look at, but it gets really boring after a while. I found myself wanting to game to end less than half the way through; I never wanted the previous FF's to end. The first half of the game is complete junk and its just not what Ive come to expect from such a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Take In","review":"The excellent graphics, experimental music, and surprisingly good voice talent don't compensate for the game actively wrestling away exploration, experimentation, investigation, or really any kind of variable gameplay from you.The story's a sham. Characters are poorly written, willing to drop three minute speeches about promises or friendship, hammering in the most obvious of story points while pretending to have anything close to believable emotions. It is -embarrassing- to be within earshot.To sum it up, the game's technicolor stupidity will give you a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st 10 hours of FF XIII are really DULL--- by kaji","review":"This review applies only to the first 10-12 hours of play. If you like to explore expanded areas and have some fun, with some timely fights, don't expect to get it with this game. I don't know what happens later, but for at least 10-12 hours you spend walking a crooked line in a canyon fighting bad guys every ten steps. Other than the start of a basic story with some nice cut scenes thats it. If it takes this long to teach you a new fighting system, then what does that tell you. Since I forked out the bucks I will continue, but if I were you I would rent or borrow from a friend. God,I hope it gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics vs. real RPG experience","review":"In all honesty what we have here is a game that is visually stunning with a dumbed-down combat system. Character development is minimal at best, vastly reduced from the other previous FF's. This game is neither challenging or fun, just button pressing, walk, video and repeat. It's seems all the genres now days are about making something as visually amazing as possible with no substance along the same lines as half of today's movies. This game is great for a kid say 14 and under."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Games Ever Made","review":"I like the final fantasy games, and I was so excited for this to come out, well it was worth the wait.

However, as everyone says it is linear, so... sooo sooo linear. THe story is satisfactory, and the only standing out part really is the battle system. FF13 is a good buy, but dont expect it to be another FF7 or FF10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the old FF titles...","review":"Perfect condition when I received it. Good game over all. I'm not as into it as I was the older FF games. Awesome purchase for the price. I'm about 50+ hours into it and still only half way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best FF Games!","review":"I LOVE this game! I fell in love with this game when I first saw Cutscenes and the gameplay on YouTube. I consider myself an RPG gamer as i grew up with only RPG Games. My first RPG Game was Final Fantasy I and I fell in love with the series since then. The only ones I never played were III, IV, and V. My favourites though had been VII, VIII, X, X-2, and NOW number XIII.The battle system and storyline are the two reasons why I fell in love with this game when I first saw it in action. Now that I finally have a PS3 and got to play XIII I fell in love with it more. This game you only control one character during battle which makes it quite challenging. If you love the Final Fantasy Series you'll love this game. I recommend it if you love the series or ove RPG Games overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"kind of like heroine hero","review":"I loved this game. The combat is awesome. The game is a hallway but it's pretty to look at and story driven. This came at a time when I was looking forward to the combat but not intending to spend too much time exploring. Even so I 100% the game because of how fast and entertaining the combat was. Good game regardless of what some would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"final fantasy XIII","review":"this game sucks big time thay totley droped the ball on this one. been a final fantasy fan from the start. and thay f&%$#@up on this one big time. waste of my money and time. dont be fooled by the good reviews. this is not final fantasy. its crap. use in the bathroom to wipe your but. if you are like me and dumbenofe to waste your money on this game. totle let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a movie than a video game","review":"I like to actually play video games, interact with them via a controller... with Final Fantasy 13 you can start up the game and do other things, I'm \\"playing\\" Final Fantasy 13 as I write this in fact! Wow, I am able to be much more productive at doing other things with this video game. I cooked dinner and they even will fight without you.... you just have to occasionally toss your team mates a potion so they don't die and you'll get a 5 Star rating on your fighting skills!They should have made this game in a similar style of FF10, that game had a good balance between game play and videos... but this one has just been totally taken over by videos to the point where I just do other things until it's time to fight something. Just boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing game","review":"I was relunctant to purchase this game because of all the bad reviews out there even though I was always a fan of the FF series. Then few weeks ago I said to hell with the reviews I am gonna buy it and give a try.After playing the game for a while, I really wonder what goes through some people's minds when they assess a game.This game is simply AWESOME!!! from the amazing graphics to the story line to the battle system everything works just perfectly. I think people who downrate such a game either dunno how to play it or they just like to say bad things so that they attract attention to themselves.IN SHORT BUY THIS GAME!!! cant wait for the next FF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Fantasy","review":"This game was very disappointing. I am an avid Final Fantasy fan. The graphics are nice, however, it doesn't make up for the lack of story that Final Fantasy used to have. I couldn't even finish the game due to lack of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Time Killer Game","review":"From all of the FF games that I have played in the past, this was no doubt one of the great editions in this series. It is a little lengthly but if you are a type of person who loves games that goes on and on for a long amout of time, this is one of the games to go to. Story line was killer, but some of the boss battles on this game can really fustrate you. Other than that, overall a great game to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a back to basics FF!!","review":"Oh Final Fantasy, how did you get so lost? You lost track of yourself!This game is just borringly linear, starts so god-damn slow that bores you to death for a long lenght of the game... Battle mode, level-up grid and everything is just bad. Especially to a game with the history of the Final Fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"For 13 and under","review":"The FF franchise seems to be targeting younger and younger gamers, the T rating on this game is an overstatement by far. If you have children this might be a good RPG for them to start with. If you are a lifelong FF fan from the Nintendo era, this will disappoint you greatly. I will admit freely that I was not too fond of 11 or 12 of this series either, it just seems to be losing the character development that other RPGs have, notably Fallout New Vegas. This game should be classified as a game-movie as you are really just playing a level to watch a movie more than you are fulfilling a role. I will not be buying anymore from this series, sad to say. I miss the Moogles"},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love it, or hate it.","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have been following the Final Fantasy series since FF9, and I have beaten every single FF game (excluding the online one). I love this series. I was very excited for this game, but I waited 6 months before buying it due to the negative reviews I read.The first few hours of this game are REALLY repetitive. It seemed like all I did was just keep hitting X. That will pass. Up to chapter 9, this game is pretty mediocre. Give it a chance and you will either love it or hate it.GRAPHICS: 5/5 this game has gorgeous graphics.GAMEPLAY: 4/5 fairly linear at firstBATTLES: 5/5 the battles in this game is what makes it so great. They are all so diverse.TOTAL RATING: 4.7/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"FF13 Fall from grace","review":"I dont think the creators of this game spent enough time on the gameplay.

If health low, hit L1 and switch to heal for 5 seconds.4. Win fight.5. Move main character forward. If fork in the road, go towards treasure first. Else, goto #16. Repeat for 20 hours.To keep you from throwing the disc away, half the time you watch beautiful if inane conversations between cartoon teenagers. They have better dialogue in the average sitcom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics, but gameplay lacks","review":"This game was a huge disappointment. I am a fan of the Final Fantasy series, but this game just flat sucks. The gameplay is reduced to hitting x as fast as you can and occasionally changing paradigms with L1. I never thought a Final Fantasy game could be classified as a button masher, but this one is. The gameplay is too linear. There is very little variety. There are no towns or npcs to interact with. Overall this game disappoints in every aspect except graphics. I would not recommend this game to anyone. I liked FF12 on the PS2 better than this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"I like RPGs, Mass Effect 1 and 2, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Dragon Age, and most recently Skyrim are amongst my favorite games ever, so when i choose to try out FF i was expecting something very different, just walk, fight (mostly pressing x) and walk again and fight again, and if you turn back the same enemies are expecting you. After around 10 hours of this i decided to give up and made the decission that this game was not made for me.The game is beautiful, is the best thing it has, the graphics are amazing, the enviroments and model all look great.Its too bad, i was starting to get interested in the story, but the repetitive gameplay made me quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woulnd't purchase","review":"I used to love playing Final Fantasy games. We recently bought a PS3 so I thought it would be a lot of fun to play. There are way too many movie clips. Maybe I have just been on PC games too long but the experience of playing this game is like trying to play a movie. Even though you can skip most of them, it is a very linear game (run from one end to the other) with cut scenes and movies on both ends. I gave up after about 2 hours and am not sure I will pick it back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a 57 year old Grandma who loves Final Fantasy. I have played every one of them,some versions more than once. I am going to trade in my FFXIII for an Amazon credit, I will never be interested in playing this game again. What a major disappointment this was. I usually spend at least 100 hours on a FF game, I want to complete every quest and side quest, I love exploring and discovering new towns and areas etc. This game has nothing like that. The graphics were amazing but it only made me more disappointed because I couldn't go explore this beautiful world. The L'Cie, Fal'Cie or whatever they are was absolutely ridiculous. I hope S/E will go back to what made FF great."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Final Fantasy DON'T buy this game.","review":"The game is a disgrace to the Final Fantasy name. The only thing good about it is the graphics. It's bad enough that the gameplay is so linear and simplified but the story is even worse. All of the characters are a bunch of crying fags, the summons are freakin' transformers, the first one is Sheva which is a transforming motorcycle, the next one is a transforming pony, and it only gets worse as you keep going. Final Fantasy X was the last final fantasy. The folks over at Mistwalker are shaking their heads at this crapy company ruining their masterpiece, Sakaguchi must be disgusted. If you're looking for a strategy rpg than pick up Resonance of Fate. And if you're looking for Final Fantasy you're gonna have to buy a 360 and pick up Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, or a Wii and wait for The Last Story to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad music, story killed the game","review":"I've played many of Finals fantasys.. but this one is the worst. ..Pros:1.

Let's face it, the best ones are 7, 9, and 10 International Edition. That's it! I can't believe how they changed things so much in this game. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!! It was so good back then and now it's utter garbage. Squaresoft needs to just go back, get the same game engine, get a better story line and don't ever leave out summoning aeons. Also, leave the linear gaming out of it!!In the meantime, get Demons Soul's for the PS3. It's more challenging, you have more control over what you do and where you can go, it's free to play online and it's addictive (but again, challenging and hard...only for true gamers).Peace out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment and then some","review":"What was Square-Enix thinking when they decided to sit down and create this RPG?!?

Most of their games are very good to great. This is not one of the great games. It came out with so much hype and great reviews that I was excited to play it. I gave up on the game after 5-10 hours. Pass on this game. The audio is really annoying, and the game-play changes detract from the fun. It sounds like FF14 is a dud as well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some flaws but overall a great game","review":"I understand some of the flaws of the game such as Linearity and cheesy lines by some of the characters. Those things bother me too but at the end of the day, I look at how much time I spend on the game and do I keep going back for more. The answer is yes, I have spend more time on this game then any other games in years and I just love playing it. Top notch graphics and music. This is just a very enjoyable game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Disappointing","review":"I'm going to make this short and to the point. First of all I haven't seen a game this linear since the Mario Brothers. Second of all you can't level grind. They constantly put temporary ability and attribute(strength,magic,ect..)caps. You unlock as you go. Third of all the story is ok, but not Final Fantasy deep. At least not compared to its predecessors. I was very disappointed with this game. I don't consider this an RPG. That's why I consider this to be misleading. It's more like an action/strategy(Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry) except with turn based combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like I remember","review":"I used to love Final Fantasy 10 years ago.

This game has no exploration, no choice control, no individuality, you can't even interact with NPCs! If you don't know what a NPC is then this game may be just what you're looking for. If this game did not have the title of Final Fantasy then perhaps it could be enjoyable. Having such a name dishonors all the great gaming which came before this abberation! You can't control party leader, give commands, or freely explore. My apologies for the rant, it is such a shame that this ONCE great franchise has fallen to such lows.

I was so excited for FF13 and then i started to play it. Wow, was i sad after that. I haven't even gotten to the half way point in the game and ive had the thing since its release date. Not worth the money, the time, or the effort. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Tried this Final fantasy game after hearing all the hype.

There is no real game here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly okay but linear","review":"I found the game for the most part enjoyable. The battle system was a nice change and the skill upgrades in this final fantasy were interesting enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Past the Beginning","review":"I was really looking forward to playing Final Fantasy XIII when I first got my PS3 but almost immediately I realized this game was not going to provide the experience I was hoping for. The battle system starts off as beyond simplistic, the \\"world\\" is just one long corridor and the characters alternate between being either bland or annoying. I hear the game gets better eventually, a friend of mine swears things really pick up after about 30 hours of game-play. I don't have the time or energy to slog through 30 hours of unenjoyable game-play to get to the good part. I can say, however, that the game is absolutely beautiful to look at. The non-corridor areas you see are spectacular and the character models are fantastic. As pure eye candy the game succeeds, but I'm more interested in games that don't take so long to open up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Auto battle is a bore. I mean if everything is auto why even make me push the button?Linear game play is painful.pointless itemspointless upgradespointless skillspointless gameThe plot is so boring and it repeats itself in every cut seen so many times I couldn't take it any more.Truly a horrible game. Pretty graphics to not make up for the lack of fun.An utter utter disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible.","review":"I somehow managed to push myself through 9 chapters of this game. How? I have no idea. I will say that the thought of playing it once more feels like going to the dentist. This is EASILY the worst Final Fantasy ever, and also just a plain bad game regardless of the Final Fantasy title.Here's what's good in this game: Graphics, voice acting, some of the music.What's bad? Everything else. It is not fun, the story is not interesting, there is no sense of a world since you just appear in new areas magically and nothing is connected, the battle system is for a 5 year old and beyond boring, the characters are lame, the lack of anything to do other than walk forward in a line and fight is pathetic and the upgrade system is completely worthless. You can beat this game without upgrading 1 item at all, without a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stimulating","review":"This game is great the first night I played till 4 in the morning.

No complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I've been a long time fan of Final Fantasy and I was utterly disappointed by this installment of the franchise. Beneath a glossy package of superb graphics and good voice acting is a very linear, tedious game. The story is mediocre and it's often lost by the grinding you're inevitably going to have to do in this game. It's certainly not an easy game to master. I was also extremely disappointed by the score for the game. The music is not up to par with previous installments of the franchise and is instead too pop. While this game shows promise in a few places, the cons are far too rotten for me to say this was a mediocre game. It was a waste of my money and I don't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear trainwreck","review":"I am a HUGE final fantasy fan, and have been playing them ever since FFIV. This is not final fantasy. It is painfully linear, with boring and tedious combat.Here's a sample of gameplay: Run in a straight line. Get in a fight. Continue on your straight line. Get in another fight. Keep going on the same straight line. Maybe see a cutscene. Keep going on the same straight line...I am returning this immediatly, what a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eating Glass","review":"Playing through the first decade of chapters is horrendously boring. It is as if I am starving and eating glass. I want to like this game so much, but gameplay is nothing I was expecting at all. If you are new to the series and are expecting a lot in the form of an RPG or adventure-esque type, look elsewhere or wait until Versus comes out.The map is pretty much linear with a trail and some enemies in the way. Not much for exploration or environment interaction. I have not yet finished the game, nor can I stand to put it back into the PS3. It's sad to see a waste of $60 and even worse the disappointment of the game itself. I wish I could return it and just wait for Versus.FYI, playing the game for the story line isn't worth it either. Go watch a korean sci-fi drama instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring but beautiful","review":"So to sum this up as short as I can. This is a Beautiful game with lackluster story, annoying characters, and bad voice overs. There was a point in this game where every 10 min of game play there was a 3 min video that accomplished nothing. I saw a preview the other day for this game and their big line is \\"The battle within begins\\". I agree with that line completely. I battled with myself for days trying to find the desire to finish this game. I would not recommend this game to the majority of gamers. Stay away and wait for something worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 1st Final Fantasy Disappointment","review":"Well, I've been waiting for this game for a very long time, however, it just didn't pay off for me. Can I just say, that I really tried to like this game! I have been playing Final Fantasy since I was a kid when the very first Final Fantasy came out on the original Nintendo. While, the characters and story and graphics are amazing... the battle system just kills the game for me. I know that Final Fantasy was probably trying to appeal to a new demographic, and perhaps the series has left me behind. I have tried over and over again to like this game, I just can't get past the \\"over and over\\" battle tubes... I feel like this game is just one repeat after another. I just wasn't able to keep interest in the game. For the first time, Final Fantasy has disappointed me, and for the very first time, I won't complete a Final Fantasy game. I wish Final Fantasy would go back to their roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not final fantasy","review":"Between the butchered battle system and making the game accessible to the ADD-FPS crowd the game is all style and no substance.The story is not intriguing, the battle system is tedious and exploration hardly exists.Save your money because unless all you care about is graphics there isn't much to like here.Its funny I used to be this hardcore square fanboy and I've now watched the Final Fantasy series spiral all the way down the toilet.Square-Enix was more focused on sales rather than making a good game and it shows.I dont understand why it took so long to release this game when there isn't that much to it. Besides the graphics which are pretty amazing there isn't much to enjoy.Dont eat this tripe thats sold to you as steak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Pros:- Graphics are kinda nice.Cons:- Very plain, stereotypical, forgettable characters.- Dialog attempts to be poetic, but winds up downright incomprehensible.- Extremely boring story.

If you're into girly jap-pop and just want to see some neat colors and shapes on your TV, buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Square Enix killed Final Fantasy","review":"I have played every single FF game ever made and this game killed the essence of Final Fantasy. Buy this game ONLY if you are looking for a \\"movie\\" video game. There is ZERO...ZERO strategy here.

The only reason I'm giving this game 2 starts is that the story is ok and the graphics are incredible. But get this, all you will do is go from A-B, That is it, nothing more. If you are like me you will buy this game anyway just because we have been waiting for a long time but you will be disappointed.

When you ask peolpe that Don't play the FF games, but have tried the game. Usually they will tell you the game is too complicated. I haven't seen a review claiming that yet. I guess it was a brilliant way to make some extra money.

They take away the towns, replace freedom with very linear ultra restrictive invisible wall environments, take away the leveling up system, give us 100 battle tutorials to understand, explain the storyline properly only through waves of text instead of the cutscenes/dialogue itself, give us the most uninteresting characters, doesn't let us control our parties, doesn't let us level up our weapons until much later and replace shops with simple menu screens from a save point.With all this how can any normal fan like this? Even if one was to enjoy the combat the game is way too linear especially when you feel like doing something else besides battles to take a break from it.Sorry Square Enix but you really dropped the ball on this one, first FF game ever where I'm compelled to sell it within a week of owning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel.","review":"My gf loves the game so much that it's been difficult to get some quality play time. However, what I have witnessed so far is that the graphics are great. The game smooly transitions from exploration, to fights, to cut scenes. The story is very tangible and makes you feel for the main characters and what they're going through. My gf cried during one of the earlier scenes in the game. All in all the game is an excellent addition to the FF series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Final Fantasy Game you'll either love or hate","review":"I bought ff13 when it first came out a little over a year ago, and I would have to agree with the reviews that state that the game is repetitive and boring. I myself have stopped playing the game due to the repetitiveness of the game and the story line is not really engaging and difficult to follow. This is one game that you'll either love or hate. I myself don't hate the game but i sure don't like it. It would be nice if square would go back to it's roots when it came to the final fantasy series. i've read that the next installment of final fantasy is going to be online and according to the trailer the cinematics look good, but we will just have to wait and see how ff14 pans out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome vistas beautifully rendered; dense, LONG","review":"My first FF game played more than a little, and I have to say that I appreciate the depth of the story and the fabulous graphical renderings of the fantasy world of Pulse. For someone without the patience (or time) to work out all the special combinations of technique required to defeat the higher level foes the \\"Official Guide\\" has been invaluable. (Though I'm not sure it really is saving me time 'cause I actually read it!) I realize I'm only up to Chapter 11 (a bit over half way?), but I'm confident I'll continue because I am interested in the story as much as I'm enjoying the game play. I'm not a big MMO fan, but I may actually consider FF XIV if it's as fun as this has been! A definite 4.7/5 RPG for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Put It,Bluntly....The Game Stinks","review":"I specifically bought a PS3, to play Final Fantasy games. If FF13,is any indication,I have wasted my money. This game is a spruced up edition of Sir Tech's\\"Heart of the Maelstrom\\",without the humor or the challenge. If you want to run down an endless dungeon,with endless,annoying cutscenes,fighting the same monsters,over and over and over,again...enjoy. No real storyline,it drags up various previous charaters from FF(beautifully portrayed,I do admit)....but if they had spent more money on the actual game dynamics...rather than the graphics....it might have been passable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy ti spend!","review":"I thought that this game was different from the other final fantasy games, but I was wrong. Nothing has change since final fantasy X, the game keeps repeating the same circunstancies. Final word a little bit boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disappointed.","review":"I have to say, I missed FF9 for ps1 and other series before and after 9. For me FF9 have the best storyline, music, characters design, characters' personalities, and more. This game is nothing compare to that, the music is okay and the characters is quite annoying at first and each one of them do not have a personality like those characters in FF9 or FFX and so on. The game is quite boring because there is nothing to explore, all you have to do is walk straight on in every map and you will complete that chapter. Just like most of the things in this world, there must be an end and I think the FF series had ended at FFX-2 for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you like the previous Final Fantasy games!","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a game. This is nothing like the previous Final Fantasy games! It has little depth and very little options. The worst part is that you can only really play one character at a time and that character is set to auto attack. They should have just made this into a mini anime movie and not worried with the fake game portion. I agree that it is beautiful graphically but who cares when you have no control what so ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"a title for your review","review":"I found a new copy of this game for $9.99 when it was usually selling for $19.99. I immediately bought it. Due to certain circumstances, I was told I had to wait about a month to receive the game. Luckily, they were able to ship it three weeks faster than they had planned. Gotta love Amazon. This isn't my favorite Final Fantasy (that award goes to IX or X), but it is a good game. Definitely worth $10, even $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night!","review":"One cannot read Melancholy Whores without thinking of Dylan Thomas' famous poem...Our ninety year old is only ninety in body and years not in spirit...How and why does that work? That it works for Gabriel Garcia Marquez's nonagenarian should be a great illumination for all of us under ninety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I am a great fan of Garcia Marquez. A tremendous writer. This book not only exceeded my expectations, but it was everything I did not expect it to be. A great love story. I am always reading, so for me I read it in 2 hours, but it left such an impression. Haven't met one person who disliked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I will just echo the other assessments of Garcia Marquez's latest book. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

A bit horrific to think of all the books dealing with older men yearning for such young flesh (i.e lolita) but the truth in the words is non-the-less breathtaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a fan, but this cannot be his work!","review":"I feel like I have been cheated of a beautiful, Sunday, albeit cold and snowing afternoon. I am a big fan of Marquez but this book has hints that he wrote this, but only that. The characters are not well developed, I am not sure where the plot resides? At times, the writer seems to ramble on about nothing. I wonder why he wrote this garbage! I felt like I paid for a Pulitzer Prize winner and what I got is a middle school S.A. I believe that Marquez has lost his mind or he did not write this story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing here.","review":"I have never written an Amazon review before, but I'm utterly incredulous that anyone could give this awful book five stars.This book is terrible. This is just a bunch of meandering gibberish about a geriatric fool who falls in \\"love\\" with a child who he has no interaction with. It is utterly unbelievable, nonsensical and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make the reader whore melancholic","review":"Disappointing. Apparently not Marquez' masterpiece. Not enough about [...], too much about music, aging, bicycle, and a lugubrious pimp. And apparently not enough melancholy either. Contrary to other readers, the subject matter does not disturb me, albeit difficult. In fact, the novella would be a hazardously illuminating literary feat if the narrator follows through with the protagonist's unflinching sexual appetite (in other words, failure to consummate) from the very beginning...rather twisting his pillars of yearning into some rambling barren sentimental crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty","review":"Perhaps it's what I do for a living, I'm a psychotherapist. This book was a disappointment to me. The whining of a dsyfunctional geriatric male. To call what he experienced \\"love\\" is quite dsyfunctional. There is no \\"love\\" Do you call that a \\"relationship?\\" I am not sure what this book was- but it was rather misogynist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Mr. Marquez why?","review":"I do not want to be too harsh because I admire his talent. I wish I had never read this book. Great novelists, like Mr. Marquez, have the power of portraying eccentric, volatile yet real essence of life with pure, ordinary elements of everyday routine. One feels enriched upon reading such masterpieces. This book did the opposite. It gives a dull message using fantastic set of events and cartoonish characters. The message is forced and everything is patched together to poorly fulfill the minimal requirement of coherence. It is alienating to the reader. For example, Rosa Cabarcas character portrays more saint-like sister than a vicious veteran madam. There are pages one even senses a juvenile urgency to insert isolated pieces before the book ends.I do not know why Mr. Marquez thought this is a finished work ready to be read by the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the Point","review":"I don't write reviews but I have read many of these as well as the negative NYT review. I am writing because I wonder why people feel compelled to react like critics rather than humans. I liked this book. It made me think. I liked To Have and Have Not, as well. Why must we compare each effort by a great writer to that writer's masterpiece? Don't we want our great writers to keep writing?To me the book is about the surrender of ego, something we should all contemplate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from a great author","review":"Although beautifully written, I found the protagonist just too unlikeable. He goes through a change but in my opinion never actually achieves transformation or real love, since he prefers his lover when she's asleep and therefore not a real person. I guess I should have guessed by the title that I wouldn't like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting Memories","review":"I was really dissapointed with this readable but mediocre piece of work from Garcia Marquez. Self-plagiarism is written all over it, the story just re-writes ideas already explored in his previous works. Seems he needed to publish something to fullfill a contract, not because he was inspired to write. Characters are dull and not believable, all relationships are shallow. At the end, the book left me with pity for the main character, a 90 year old pedophile who confused infatuation with love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet...","review":"A quick and very enjoyable read, though I would not put this book among the author's best work. It has some of the tenderness and whimsy of his masterpiece \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" but feels a bit cursory and perhaps a bit predictable if you are familiar with GG Marquez's work, though without the wild flights of imagination of \\"100 Years of Solitude.\\"I won't bother with a plot synopsis since that's what most of the other reviewers have done already, but will say that if you have never read Marquez before, you are likely to be impressed by this book much more than I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of my Melancholy Whores","review":"This short book, really a short story, reinforced my conviction that Marquez is my all time favorite author. Totally enjoyable, a wonderful use of language, and a depth of character. I will read anything that this guy writes. 100 Years of Solitude is still my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should not be interpreted literally","review":"As I sit down to write this review I think to myself; how as a women do I comment objectively on a story whose plot revolves around the desire of a ninety year old man to procure himself a 14 year old virgin so he may deflower her? It should be added that the girl doesn't just fall into his lap so to speak, she is unwillingly offered up to him for a price by the village madam. If I think of this novella strictly in those terms the premise simply becomes too perverse as to taint any objectivity I may have. If I think of it more along the lines of an unrequited longing for the beauty and innocence of youth, coupled with a bittersweet look back on a rather unfullfilled life, I fare far better. Still, not even remotely close to his other works in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to par with his great works","review":"This book is not up to the level of any other major work by Marquez. Characters are mechanical, the main protagonist appears to be one dimensional and boring, and there is no excitement in this book. More importantly it is difficult to feel any empathy towards any of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The desires of an older man","review":"A book about the desires of an older man and the reflection of is own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled and shallow... is this really Marquez ?","review":"The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: \\"No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure\\" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the girl?","review":"I'm amazed, and dismayed, that among all the reviews, both positive and negative, I found not a word about what I thought most troubling, and reprehensible, in this novel. Not a word about the devastating poverty that had led this young girl to prostitute herself to an old man in order to help her family. She is the figure for whom we ought to be concerned. Instead, there's not a word of sympathy for her plight or that of the hundreds of others whose bodies this John has bought. Instead we are supposed to feel empathy for, and share in the joy of, this old lecher as he drugs and uses a young girl (and many before her) in pursuit of a weird sort of attachment. The only authentic moment in the book is when the old pederast meets a prostitute from his past, with whom he thought he had a special relationship, and she has no clue who he even is. If there ever was a book written purely from a macho, misogynist perspective, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not compatible","review":"This will not work with the latest version of OSX - won't even load.

I love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like I do.Here's another trick. Put Scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen, then have someone bring in the family pet.

My main complaint is that the plastic feels very flimsy. I have many glass spice containers and I wouldn't want to let go of the drawer after pulling it all the way out. I don't trust that the tiny plastic pieces that keep the drawer in could support the weight of all that glass. Luckily it is not onerous to hold the drawer with one hand and get the spice with the other. Overall I am very satisfied with this product, I only wish it had sturdier looking stoppers at the backs of the drawers so that I could feel comfortable leaving a drawer hanging out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Saver","review":"The spice stack is awesome! It's a huuuuge space saver for someone like me that has easily 40 different spices/bottles. Don't buy those graduated steps - bleacher like rackes either - the spices just fall off. This holds bigger bottles in the back - keeps everything neat and tidy - looks great, saves space and easy view/access with no fumbling around. Highly recommend for anyone who loves to cook with spices. So simple, yet genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"This spice organizer is great. It even comes with a set of labels to stick on - some labels are pre-printed with all the popular spices and there are blank ones to write in your own. I only wish all the spice slots were the same size so it could fit more of the standard sized ones, instead of having the back row for larger spices. My larger spices don't fit in there anyway because they are too long or fat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spice organizer - not a space saver","review":"This product did a great job of organizing my spices for easy locating and retrieval. It replaced my lazy susan. It held most of my spices. I have three or four larger containers that did not fit.I have completely filled the Spice Stack. The provided labels were useful as were the two additional blank half-sheets. I printed four new labels for items that weren't in Tagco's list.I had a (possibly unrealistic) expectation that it was going to save space in my cabinet. It did not, however nor did it take up too much room. I am still happy with the purchase. The organization alone provided by the Spice Stack is worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice way to organize your spice cupboard","review":"This was a wonderful solution to my cluttered spice cupboard. I had been using a lazy susan, but it was over loaded and some of the spices would fall off behind it making it hard to turn. I also ended up crowding some spices in front. It was a headache to dig out rarely used spices from the back.With this product I eliminated all of my cluttered spices AND have only used about 50% of the capacity of this item. It is sturdy and easy to use.It holds the small, medium and large spice containers well, but I have one extra large spice container (the largest seasoning salt container) that doesn't fit in this rack. For 95% of the spice bottles out there you'll be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"This spice rack saves space in my kitchen cabinet, and makes finding spices while I'm cooking SO much easier.

I don't cook a lot and don't have a ton of spices, but WOW, what a difference in how I feel when I open that cabinet! It looks clean and organized and I know where my most used items are! Totally worth the $35. Two things to mention, there is a small amount of \\"dead space\\" on the one side of the spice rack behind the cabinet door frame which is necessary to be able to slide the drawer out and pull down as pictured. Another note is that some of the spices come in taller bottles (Chef Paul Prudhomme's for example) or wider or odd shaped containers, these do not fit, but the normal sized ones do as well as the small ones pictured on the left-and you can stack two of the smaller ones to save space-like the nutmeg and ginger that are rarely used (at least in my kitchen).Love the look and feel of being organized, and like I said, totally worth the $35!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to organize spices","review":"I don't like clutter on my counter, so I was searching for something I could put in my cupboard that would not take up too much room and would allow me to see what I have.

Otherwise, the rack works great in my RV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spice Stack a Hit","review":"This rack is perfect - you can get 9 spice skakers per drawer.The top half of the drawer holds four 5 1/2\\" tall shakers - while the bottom half of the drawer holds five 5\\" shakers.

I think it works well and I've never had a problem with it.The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is quite bulky. It takes up more space than I had considered it would. However, I can place more spices in the spice rack than I would be able to in the amount of space the spice rack takes up.I'm trying to find a more efficient way to organize my spices and this product did not help me as much as I thought it would. If I had an abundance of cabinet space and several of these spice racks then that would be doable. However, I only really had room for the one spice rack I bought.I would totally recommend this product to anyone else, because it's well made and well thought out. I just need something a bit less bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for the cooks in your life","review":"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my parents who love to cook together. They love it! Mom reports that it stores more for the shelf space than the double-tier carousel they were using. They now have 18 5\\" and 10 2\\" bottles but it can still hold 8 more shorties.

Hello?","review":"Anyone who gives this album a one-star is on glue, and the four star rating is crazy in itself. It's a five if there ever was one. It's incandescently joyous, but with just the right touch of melancholy and weariness (especially for this day and age in America) underneath the surface. \\"We Shall Overcome\\" is a beautiful, mature work that still manages to feature an intensity and rowdiness not found on any recordings Bruce has put out since his earliest days as a professional musician. And it's his best recording in at least two-and-a-half decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce's new sound","review":"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. We usually buy every new Bruce release on the first day but we held back a little on this one. Wasn't sure he liked the folksy direction but it's become a huge favorite with him. Bruce can do no wrong in his eyes/ears?? Great listen, relaxing and enjoyable.

He simultaneously taps into the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" soundtrack crowd and continues the fake-populist stance he's taken since \\"The Rising,\\" an album that did nothing but crassly capitalize on the 9/11 disaster in order to bring back what was frankly a failing career.Seeger's name stuck on this album is especially insulting. The songs have little to do with Seeger, and Seeger always had the courage of his convictions. Springsteen, on the other hand, has shown that he's perfectly willing to fake a populist stance in order to reap the financial rewards and renew his career.I used to like and respect Springsteen. No more. This is the bottom of the barrel, and shows that in the long run he's no more principled or worthy of notice than any wanna-be abusing a cover song on American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"love it or hate it, i hate it","review":"I do not love this at all. Actually, I gave the CD away. It's just not anything near what folk is about or what Bruce is about.The arrangements completely take away from the spare ness that give folk its style and sound. The music is beyond tedious, bordering on grating. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refusing to Give Credit Where Credit is not Due...","review":"Boss...give it up. Anyone who believes that this music even comes close to the epic beauty of the Boss' catalog of the 70's/80's is sadly mistaken. His last three studio releases have been almost un-listenable. If Bruce really wants to get into something \`different but similar', a cover album of early Dylan would likely be a better-conceived project. This is just pure crap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Orleans style, but not Bruce's style","review":"A completely new sound for Bruce. It might be something you would listen to if you were in the mood for zydako music, a sort of New Orleans Jazzy sound. At times Bruce slurs his words like Dylan, and other times he sounds like he ought to be singing \\"gitty up horsey\\". This is a very strange combination of songs, and after listening to it, I would unlikely buy it for my Bruce collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"disc doesnt work !!!","review":"ive bought 2 copies now---both times the music tracks are all distorted !!! weird noises thoughout--- its prob combining dvd and audio on one disc- you\`d think this billionaire phony could make a disc w out ripping people off - a product that works !!!!! through the haze of distortion the music sounds ok-- am i the only one who had this problem--w 2 discs now ??????????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sum of the parts doesn't make it!","review":"Hard to imagine taking the talents of Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen and coming out with this raucus and almost untunefull collection.

We are more than surprised at the great reviews this has received.

Seeger needed no overblown production or rambling cross-cultural arrangements to get his point across. He was just Pete and he was just magnificent.I preface the next passage by saying I'm a huge Springsteen fan, but here's the caveat - it's obvious from this recording that he and his co-conspirators have no feel for traditional or \\"folk\\" music. The accompaniment on this recording is so heavy-handed that the melodies get totally lost, not to mention the message that many of these tunes carried in their original form. It's just way too much of a not-so-good thing.Traditional music is about simplicity. This project is far too complicated for its own good and more is definitely not better in this case. If I could give it less than one star, I would.Sorry, Boss."},{"rating":"1","title":"real weak","review":"Bruce Springsteen gets a A for effort,but a Major \\"L\\" for dropping this Album. this Album sounds like lost outtakes from Springsteen than anything that remotely reminds you of Folk Music or Peter Seeger.

The disc crashed and would not play on our Mac. It is incompatible with ipod. Bruce needs to address this because it is absolutely incompatible with his personal politics. He should go to another company, or at least disavow these corporate policies.And Seeger would be apalled. It dishonors him."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Play it a Lot","review":"An exciting chunk of genuine Americana. Bold, robust and earthy... It somehow transcends the straight, square feel of the Folk music from the revival era. The man weaves so many great sounds together and reaches so far into his bag of on-hand talent... One listen will tell you that he has a firm handle on things all the way through. He has managed once again to tap into the American spirit of will-power and sacrifice, and the striving for a freedom that will not be denied.I've played this thing so much that I hear it in my sleep, but I'll tell you something... It's one disc that I'm pretty sure lovers of the E-Street band thing won't like. Just like they didn't with Tom Joad. That's too bad, too... Because Bruce just keeps getting better and fuller with age. Just like any person who's living a full life should. And what he gives through his music is a reflection of that.

So long story short I come back up the elevator to my overly lit cubical and pop in the cd with excitement, only to find out that it won't play!!!!!I feel bad about the 1 star because it's not completly your fault, but at the same time I will feel no guilt in returning this POS when the whistle blows at 5 o'clock.It is absurd and outrageous that an artist has chosen to share his art through a suspect medium such as this.

Yes, you tapp your foot to some pleasant rhythms, but why the misleading allusion to Pete seeger and social change? Both the songs' selection and the musical interpretation tell us nothing about Bruce's musical and/or world view about the area which he is supposed to explore here.

Let's hope the tour will be a lot better then this album.You can make a better use of your hard earned money by buying the wonderful Hammesmith Odeon concert from 1975 - which is the best official live album from Bruce by a long shot.

This was not to be and despite the reviews in the papers today, at least half of the crowd were booing. This was borne out by the inactivity and relative silence of the crowd which is not what anyone would expect at a concert by The Boss. Even the rare 'old' song such as Cadillac Ranch was performed in the genre of folk! In despair my husband and I left early, unable to tolerate any more.Bruce you are no longer The Boss but someone who has lost their way and many fans.

Get it soon it is really the best thing he's done in ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"great old-time folk jam","review":"Very ragged, loose and fun. Some familiar standards, usually done with a twist.

This album feels like it comes from another time and place in such a refreshing way, and the musicians are fantastic. Whether he is doing stadium rock, intimate acoustic performances or the Seeger Sessions, he is utterly convincing... Overall, I love the album... To any other Bruce fans or fans of the Seeger Sessions, I highly recommend checking out AOL Music because AOL is currently broadcasting \\"18 Nights of Bruce\\" where one song from each of Bruce's 18 U.S. shows (handpicked by the Boss himself) are broadcast via AOL. You feel like you are in the crowd - the experience is a stellar compliment to the Seeger Sessions CD. ROCK on Bruuuuuce!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUMMER!!! Unless you have a brand new DVD/CD player...","review":"Don't buy this unless you have a brand new DVD/CD player. It won't play. Maybe you can get one track to play on the computer, but forget about kicking back and enjoying the music if you are old enough to remember hearing Pete Seeger live, and your CD player is not brand new.Seriously disappointed. Hey... not everyone has a house full of state-of-the-art audio equipment. I have hundreds of CDs which play just fine. This one? I can always put it in a yard sale I guess.DLPhillips"},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast of energy from start to finish","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer that stated that if you've seen Bruce do this material live, it makes the album that much better.I saw Bruce and the Seeger Sessions band at Madison Square Garden in NYC and they knocked my socks off.Great fun and a rip-roaring party of a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Springsteen breathes life into folk music","review":"When I first heard that Springsteen was releasing a CD of songs originally done by Pete Seeger I thought so what? Another CD without the E street band and a follow-up to last year's lackluster effort, DEVILS&DUST. But then I saw the documentary on the recording of the sessions and I changed my mind completely. I went out the following day and bought the CD. From the opening strains of \\"OLD DAN TUCKER\\" my feet began tapping and never stopped. If you can sit still through O MARY DON'T YOU WEEP,JOHN HENRY and JACOB'S LADDER you need CPR to get your heart going. Bruce has done a great job of mixing folk tunes with spirituals to create an infectious, spirited collection of music. Don't hesitate ! Go out and buy this CD now !! Your feet will thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot play the CD side at all","review":"This gets 2 stars because the DVD side is worth 5, but I can't play the CD side on my computer AT ALL. I'm using an iMac G5, and iTunes doesn't seem to be able to be able to read the CD, though iDVD has no problem with the DVD side. The disc doesn't seem to be actually defective--I can play it on my car CD player--so I have to conclude that it's a format problem. It's still unacceptable, because I don't want to have to be in my car to listen to the disc. In fact I listen to music mostly on my computer and on my iPod, and if I can't get iTunes to read it, I can't get it on my iPod either. I have no idea what to do about this--having bought the CD, I don't want to have to buy it again through iTunes. Needless to say, I'm steamed, and it'll be a long time before I'll consider buying another dual-format disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars for dual disk","review":"The DVD side of the dual disk would not play on my machine and the CD side would not transfer to my computer. If you want the CD to put on an iPod or other MP3 players, then I recommend that you make sure to get a single-sided disk. As for the music: Although I am a lover of traditional versions of folk songs (e.g., Pete Seeger, early Joan Baez, Woody Guthrie, Ian and Sylvia, Janis Ian, early Bob Dylan, etc.), I adore this album. I play it in my car with the windows closed and the volume turned high and sing along with Bruce Springsteen and his friends. \\"Mary Don't You Weep,\\" \\"John Henry,\\" and \\"Old Dan Tucker,\\" are gems. Five plus stars for the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUALDISC--just say no","review":"I almost bought this.

A similar rant will be posted for the DualDisc version of \\"DEVILS & DUST\\".Not only can I not use these discs in my PC, and I have gotten to the point where I do a LOT of my listening while on the PC, but I have found that the discs also will not play in certain stand-alone players. Wanna import into your iPod??? FORGET it!!!The ONE good thing I'll say about the DualDisc format is that it's not being foisted on the general public anymore!!Not to defend Sony, but they do warn right on the package that the DualDisc format MAY not work in all players. Now if they would just reissue this album, as well as \\"DEVILS & DUST\\" on a standard CD format I would be happy. Make that *happier*! As it is, I can't get either album into my iPod and, rather than pay iTunes for a digital download, I would rather pay for a *real* CD version of each album for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"bruce and folk music","review":"After listening to the album and seeing the show, my wife summed it up best. Only Bruce could take folk and have you dancing in the aisles. What a great album and show. If you get the chance, go to the show. You will leave feeling good. My hands still hurt from all the clapping we did. I hope he takes more folk songs and does another album. Bruce seems happy and that makes his music better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it - Springsteen fan or not.","review":"I've only been a casual Springsteen fan over the years. I was drawn to this by the fact that it's roots music with a modern feel - like Clapton's Me and Mr. Johnson and the O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack. This is of the same ilk: top-flight musicians interpreting great songs from the American songbook. Highly recommended. Springsteen and crew make (mainly) raucous foot-stomping music that satisfies the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Springsteen goes folk","review":"What can I say?This is not the Bruce Springsteen most people know and love.It isn't better, it isn't worst, it's just different.It sure is different from most what you hear on the radio today, and there probably won't be a hit single, but still I like it (a lot).Listning to the album and seeing part of it being recorded is just amazing.It's the soundtrack for a wedding, a funeral, a bbq, a party, a night at the pub, or just you and a cold beer in the your backyard looking at the setting sun.I bet Johnny Cash is smiling in his grave"},{"rating":"1","title":"SELF-INDULGENT....BUY SOME PETE SEEGER CD'S INSTEAD.","review":"Today's big names have gotten so lazy and self-indulgent.

Wait and get that CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dual disk format bombs!","review":"I heard the music and liked it a lot. However, when I got my \\"dual disk\\" home, my CD player wouldn't play it! In very tiny letters that blend into the cover, the producers indicate the disk is not formated like an audio CD and may not play on some players! Well, I got my money back and that sale was a lost one. I cannot buy a new player just because the production company is too cheap to make seperate DVD and audio CD in one package. Sorry, Bruce. Guess I'll not be able to buy your new music any more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is fine but DualDisc makes it worthless","review":"Because Sony chose to use the Dual Disc format, which does not follow the published CD specification, I cannot have this song play on my iPod.

So much for rewarding honest buyers...But then the music is great. Myself not being an American, I can listen to that music without any heartfelt nostalgy, and still I have to admit it is just awesome. All these songs that I have heard many years ago interpreted by some artist or other, are performed by Bruce in an way that remains true to his very own style while revealing the full sadness and gravity of the vast American landscape and its people.A masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Dual Disk.","review":"I LOVE the music but the cd, which comes with a Dual Disk warning/disclaimer doesn't play in my Sony cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Interesting..........","review":"coming from Australia, I've never heard of most of these songs before although I do remember singing to one of these songs when I was in primary school!Having been a big Bruce fan for a number of years I, like many people here, was a bit apprehensive with this release. I wanted another E-street record or the possibility of 'Tracks 2' sounded appealing. However, I like this album, it sounds like Bruce is having fun on it and its a great listen. Its good to see Bruce doing what he wants to do with his music.One strange thing, my dualdisc copy is labelled the wrong way. The labelled DVD side actualy the cd content on it while the CD side has the DVD content on it!?!. Ah Dualdisc,..didn't like it when JEBEDIAH released a single on that format 3 years ago and I don't like it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"right band wrong voice","review":"The songs are timeless masterpieces, of American folk music. The band fits the songs quite well. Sprinsteen's vocals on the other hand, do not. He sings, like he is singing to a typical filled to the rafters, stadium mob. The material does not lend itself to that approach. I love the song Shenandoah, this is by far, the worst version I have ever heard. Had he used the sense and good taste, to mold himself to the music, this could have been spectacular. As done, it is just a horrible mismatch of stadium rock vocals on front porch songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money - I all ready did","review":"I saw the documentry on CMT and was very excited to buy the record. I bought it but I can't play it. Judging by the documentry, it would have been at the top of my playlist. It is a great concept and a great sound. If I was told upfront I needed new equiptment to play it, it would not have bought it. Shame on Bruce for allowing the record company to rip off his fans. Very disappointed. I TIVOed the documentry, so I guess we are even."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another horrible record!","review":"Congratulations Bruce, you've put out the worst album two years in a row. I thought you couldn't get any worse after last year's \\"Devils and Dust.\\" I was wrong, you topped yourself again. This CD is impossible to listen to. I'm so happy I didn't buy it and waste my money. If you want to hear music from Jersey that rocks and will make you feel upbeat, buy \\"Into the Harbour,\\" by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. It's a shame it won't sell close to what this will or receive any acclaim from the so-called critics. There are quite a few members of the Jukes horn section on \\"The Seeger Sessions.\\" Too bad they wasted their talent for something like this.In closing, I hope Springsteen still has a good rock album in him. Bring back the E Street Band and give your fans what they want. \\"Tunnel of Love\\" was a strong album, even though it was mostly acoustic. Anything but this and your previous release. They make \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Ghost of Tom Joad\\" seem like party records."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A LETDOWN","review":"I am a huge Bruce Fan, and a connoiseur of traditional folk, bluegrass, American roots music. I was perhaps too excited to listen to this gem. I gotta kick out of \\"Old Dan Tucker\\", a song I hadn't heard in perhaps twenty years, but the rest of the album ended there for me. I even \\"gave it a chance\\", so to speak, leaving it in my car's CD player for a few weeks.Unfortunately, it is annoying noise to me still. Anyone wanna buy it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my!","review":"I don't know if I'm more disappointed with Springsteen for recording this dreck or with my idiocy for actually buying it! Probably me. It was at a moment of weakness at a local Starbucks where it was on display. The only redeeming song is We Shall Overcome, which is admittedly a moving rendition. Aside from that however, the entire album is an abominable affectation. I swear that if Bruce put out a version of William Shatners greatest hits, EVERYBODY from Rolling Stone to Newsweek would applaud the creative genius behind it and undoubtedly would give it four stars for being such a daring, brilliant move. And even worse, I suspect that all of you brainwashed lemmings would eat it up! Not me, not anymore, no thanks! P.S. And what exactly is up with the hillbilly accent? Last time I checked, Bruce Springsteen was born and raised in Freehold New Jersey. My two cents, take it or leave it. Keep the rubber side down, and I'll see you in Sturgis.

(Neither my mac nor my PCs can read the disks.) These misguided copy protection schemes (and the \\"dual disk\\" format is just that, a disguised copy-protection scheme) don't help anybody. It's easy enough to create a digital copy of the music using an SPDIF output from a high-end CD player, so it will not take long for pirated copies of the music to hit the net, but those of us who are happy to pay for the music, who actually want to be honest, are stuck with choosing between a high-fidelity version that won't work on the iPod, or the low-sound-quality version that Apple provides. (Either that, or pay for the music twice.) I feel as if I'm being punished for being honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is awesome but the CD is useless","review":"As another reviewer wrote, the CD does not work on the vast majority of players. We've returned the disk 3 times, but each one does NOT work in any of our players - they just skip mercilessly. Not worth the money. They need to offer *just* a CD, not the DualDisk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Bruce has outdone himself this time. I can't seem to get enough of this album.

One evening at my home I played this cd by Springsteen and they both said,\\"who is that singing and how can we get that cd?\\"This cd took me back to those wonderful years when folk music reigned supreme. Bruce's gravellly voice and those great musicians with him make this cd one of the most powerful I have heard in years.His \\"Mary Don't You Weep\\" will get you out of your chair to sing along and \\"John Henry\\" will have you once again rooting for John Henry to beat that evil steam hammer.It's a great collection of songs and if you are a child of the60's and remember what a Hootenanny was---you need this cd.And if you like music that stirs your soul regardless as to the age of your soul---you also need this cd.Roddy GrayAbbeville, SC"},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FUN!","review":"This is the most upbeat album of the year. I am so thrilled that Springsteen is keeping this music alive. My favorite songs on the album are \`Mrs. McGrath' and \`My Oklahoma Home'.

For those who have trouble playing the dual disc in some of their older CD players...they need to simply make a copy of the CD for the older player, as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of 'Boss'...","review":"Is Boss 'funnin' with us, having fun, or both? I don't care for the music makes it impossible to sit still! It truly is folk music, raw and moving. We love the format, too, one side is a DVD and the other a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one, Boss","review":"The exuberance this album exudes is thoroughly infectious - it reminds me of what Dylan and The Band were doing with folk music in the Basement Tapes era. The nod to Pete Seeger is a nice gesture on Springsteen's part, even though several of the songs have scores of other versions, some of them pre-dating Pete. Sony/BMG has evidently devoted quite a bit of resources to promoting The Seeger Sessions, and deservedly so. But isn't it a bit odd that the company should do this while sitting on a treasure trove of Seeger originals - would you believe it, most of Pete's superb Columbia LPs from the '60s have never been reissued on CD! If this travesty is not hastily remedied, it might be a nice idea for the Boss to have a word with the relevant executives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce waves at Pete on his way by, but doesn't stop","review":"I loved this album. It is one of those rare CDs that I can start listening to again right after the last song plays. However, I will say that I was disappointed that there wasn't actually any Pete Seeger here. Anywhere. For an album titled \\"The Seeger Sessions,\\" I would have expected Bruce and Pete to sit down, shoot the bull, play a little, and have a picture taken of them smiling together. I don't even think Bruce went to visit the guy in the nine years it took to make this album. There's an awful lot of good music on this disc, but Bruce pays more homage to Dixieland jazz than dear old Pete.To hear Bruce tell it (on the liner notes), he had never heard of Folk music, and was shocked to sit down with a bunch of musicians and be able to play traditional songs right off the bat. Imagine!Bottom line, this is an excellent album, despite Bruce coming off as a couple bricks short of a load."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple & Powerful Music","review":"Hearing a track on an NPR staion, I bought the cd/dvd album because this music is about the most spiritual I've ever experienced. It's not that the music pays homage to Seeger, which it sure does, but because the band's spiritual connections with one another make the songs come alive. It's truly a celebration of Seeger's stewardship in bringing old music to modern day souls. Felt like it was a concert in the \\"New Orleans Church of Jazz\\". Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the Springsteen catalog","review":"Much of Springsteen's music has always had folk bent to it. And, if you read early interviews and his biography then you know that Seeger, Guthrie and Dylan were early influences of his. Now that he's \\"made it\\", he is able to take risks and pay homage to his roots. Others have done the same, Clapton, Mellencamp, Susan Tedeschi, even Led Zepplin's first album was basically a tribute to the early bluesmen. So kudos to Bruce for paying homage to Pete Seeger and other early folk artists and for rejuvenating an interest in these American classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"like a live celebration","review":"Of course, it helps that I've seen this band in concert! That MADE the album for me. But it was recorded in 3 one-day sessions in Bruce's living room, so it certainly has a live feel. The horns, the banjo, the fiddles, the backup vocals, and Bruce himself. This is a FUN album. I have listened to it almost everyday for a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americana At It's Best","review":"Springsteen's tribute to folk legend Pete Seeger manages to update Seeger's music while being totally reverential to it.

Well, if he had ever actually spent time at any bluegrass or folk festival, he would realize that that's how it is done from coast to coast. This album seems to me to be a \\"hook\\" for another excuse to put out an album that might grab additional audience. Too bad it was so terrible. The musicians behind him were great to listen to.

I thought she looked great during the BITCH session, should have stuck with that look, the music was better then!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow up, one of the best EVER!","review":"This is my favorite out of Meredith's 2 albums. Like the review below mine, she certainly has been working hard soo not to be labeled \\"a wonder\\" or a \\"has been\\" cause of the smah song B**tch or the moderate hit What Would Happen. Her songs are produced way much better maybe even because Meredith produced on this album something she never did on Blurring The Edges. The thing about this album (one of the many reasons I like this album) there isn't 1 song I dislike I mean some I can label more single-worthy than others but on Blurring The Edges I disliked the way (not the song just parts in the songs like a bridge or chorus) 1 or 2 songs had some of the work done in them but none of that is here. I find it hard to do this but people who like to listen to songs that are usually good as a single I recommend Shout, Lay Down (excellent rap hook Queen Latifah did), Cosmic Woo Woo, or All For Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooks rules; Deconstuction Lacks","review":"I am a hugh Brooks fan and I have all of her cds, but this album is so unbalenced. It has too much of a range. That could be good for some people, but not me. I'm used to one kind of Brooks that sometimes tend to go out on a limb on some songs, but on the Deconstuction cd, it was too diverse. There are so great songs on this album, but I just think the few songs are worth buying the cd used. Love Meredith Brooks though."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Girl!","review":"I haven't gotten this cd yet but i can bet a million $ on it that it will be as good if not better then \\"Blurring The Edges.\\" I love Meredith Brooks and she is such a great guitar player. If you only buy a couple of cd's make sure you buy hers! You will fall in love with her just like i have."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Bitch rocks!","review":"Note: I'm not a fan of the first CD, though Bitch is still a great song. This is a deconstructed and remade Meredith -she's like a new person! I love the glamorous and sexy new image. The voice is stronger and easier to listen to, the lyrics are insightful and fun and overall the music sounds her own, more accessible, more focused and creative. Favourites are the opening rocker Shout, the wonderful Lay Down with Latifah, the Sheryl Crow leaning I Have Everything and All For Nothing. The enhanced CD allows a glimpse of the woman at work. She deserves to be a Star! Hesitate no longer -buy this CD and celebrate her return!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meredith rocks on second record","review":"On this second record Meredith really comes out of the shadow of \\"Bitch\\" She has made a record that sounds even better than Blurring The Edges. While BTE was a great record, I think Deconstruction really shows Meredith growing as a songwriter and a person. Songs like \\"I Have Everyting\\" and \\"Back To Eden\\" really show a growth in Merediths song writing. I suggest this record to anyone wanting a great guitar, singer/songwriter record. Meredith ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good follow up","review":"This CD was a great follow up to \\"Blurring the Edges\\". My favorite song is Sin City, and I have really no clue why. The only song that I really don't like is Back to Nowhere, which is pretty boring. The rest, however, range from fun but badly titled (Cosmic Woo Woo), to serious (Nobody's Home), which talks about a girl with bad parents who commits suicide. Inbetween are other really good songs, including the catchy Back to Eden. (Hey hey, now now.) The song All for Nothing sounds like it was co-written by the Spice Girls, but it too is good. I recommend this album for anyone who likes pop music. Also, stop comparing Brooks to Alanis Morisette. Alanis doesn't do pop. She does \\"my boyfriend left me so I'm gonna wreak his life\\". Not that there's anything wrong with that. ~Nishana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the \\"regular\\" Jason books","review":"Jason X was a pretty fun movie. But after reading now all the books, I have to say no one has really figured out how to mesh horror and sci fi nearly as well as the movie managed. A lot of bogging down in pseudo-scientific detail here, at the expense of making most of the characters interesting. And the dialogue really stuck out poorly in my mind. Klunky and artificial. There was also a bit too much interest in setting up a sequal- the last quarter of the novel doesn't so much explain why things are happening as they do, as try to create a sense of mystery we're presumably supposed to be curious about.I'd read pretty much any of the \\"modern\\" Jason books again and enjoy. Jason X is off the the used book store for trade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"The face, mechanics, etc. are great. Easy to read.

That makes me a 37 year old believer. A missionary for most of that time. In those 37 years I have artfully dodged the Sabbath - quick to point out the the Sabbath was made for man. I am a finicky reader. The fact that a book on the Sabbath rest can grab me from page one speaks for itself. It's as if the author is about two pages ahead of me for all my questions. My only regret is letting so many decades slip away and cheating myself of the richness and promise of Sabbath rest. Now I actually look forward to my weekly Sabbath. Too soon old. Too late smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"labor\\" to get through....","review":"Some authors only have one book in them and I believe that may be the case with Mark Buchanan.His classic debut, YOUR GOOD IS TOO SAFE is tremendous. But the follow-ups, THINGS UNSEEN and THE HOLY WILD are more \\"musings\\" than well thought out works. I believe he really wants to write novels because the writing loses focus a lot and he enjoys telling stories but rarely do they add to the focus of what he's supposed to be writing about.This book sort of went on and on and on and on and never really added much to the need for a Sabbath. I recommend (HIGHLY!) Lynne M. Baab's SABBATH KEEPING. At 120+ pages, it has so much \\"more\\" to it than this bloated, unfocused book."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This is the worst book that I have read in a while.

Save you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging and realistic!","review":"This author gives us hope and understanding for keeping the Sabbath. The book is excellent and needs to be read.Perhaps more would keep the Saturday Sabbath if they understood what it is all about.According to the author what you do on that day is more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rest Of God","review":"I loved this book. It covered everything I need to hear... not only about keeping the Sabbath, but about resting in other ways and how important it is to decrease my \\"busy life style\\" and to increase my \\"rest\\". I gave a book to each of my daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I stand in awe at a sheer masterpiece.","review":"I cannot believe this book. Those who have read it will not be surprised to hear me share that I am in awe and am only in the first chapter. It took me two weeks just to puruse the introduction (puruse, with it's true meaning of \\"to read carefully\\") because it was so incredible and rich I just couldn't stop reading it. The part about repentance was so amazing and freeing, and the way he described upholding and cherishing godly committments which are often assumed to be mere leagalizm, was absolutely beautiful. I was stunned. My only worry was how he could keep up his incredible, fresh, and stirring style for an entire book? Could one person truly posess such talent, creativity and ability to skillfully exert such brilliance with his words? Wow, I think he just might. God has gifted this man with a rare talent. I am online to order more copies to share... Truly, a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book so good I bought 20 to give to friends and my Bishop!","review":"I find books on spirituality and living in a relationship with God difficult. They are either too cheerful peppered with memorized versus or the author isn't authentic. In this book Buchanan shares his own struggles with his hubris about keeping the Sabbath. He helped me to see that keeping the Sabbath allows me to learn that I am not God and why that is comforting! By his personal examples of being too busy etc, and then what he has learned about the \\"rest of God\\" along with the really good stuff that comes from the discipline of the sabbath resonated with me. Very rarely do I find myself referring back to a book so often during the weekn even after having finished it two months ago!For any people who are too busy to take sabbath, or too important to take sabbath, this is a must read. It goes hand in hand for any working a 12 step program as well.Very Well Done! A blessing to this workaholic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This album sucked. There were two tracks that were okay, but the rest was a waste of time, money, and electricity. Maybe that was his whole intent with a title like \\"down with the scene,\\" but I didn't find it appealing. Don't get me wrong, Kid 606 is good, just not this album. I would recommend \\"who still kill sound\\" or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike Patton, what were you thinking?","review":"This album is unlistenable! It is sad to hear Mike Patton (former guru of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle) degrade himself by trying to sing over the cacaphony laid down by this incompetent producer.Save money on this record by recording the sound of your toilet flushing on both sides of a 60 minute cassette tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times","review":"Comparisons between Kid606 and Nurse with Wound may be warranted to a degree, as they could both be considered noise experimentalists. However, Kid606 takes a much more beat oriented approach to his experimentation than NWW, straying into an almost hip-hopish territory much of the time.This is challenging music, and not something most will have the ears for. Imagine newer Autechre meets Merzbow meets Doormouse, and you may begin to have an idea of what this sounds like. If that sounds like your style, I recomend you pick this up as soon as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated!","review":"I know that Kid606 has developed a cult following among the IDM crowd, but I find his music damn boring! He utilizes a lot of the same sounds (like the one that's akin to digital noise being flushed down the toilet -- you know what i mean!). The music is just really predictable after a while -- the same sounds are recylcled over and over. That's one reason why I love Autechre: they can't be accused for recycling the same old tunes. Anyway, this is basically a Merzbow meets Alec Empire meets Autechre album, but done in a really predictable fashion. But if you're really into this sound, I'd suggest picking up a Cex CD (Kid606's labelmate). Much more fluid."},{"rating":"1","title":"For true fans only","review":"The Stranglers were a great live band but this album is really for true obsessives of the band only. In 1980 lead singer and guitarist Hugh Cornwell went to jail for possession of heroin. In his absence the other three members held two concerts at the Rainbow in London. To replace Cornwell they called in various friends to sing and/or play guitar. These included Hazel O'Connor, Toyah Willcox, Richard Jobson (Skids), Nicky Tesco (members), Ian Dury and Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers). As a result the album is unique in the history of the group and like no other live performance. Unfortunately only one of the songs really lives up to expectations and that is Jake Burns' growling rendition of 'Down in the Sewer'. The rest will be of interest only to obsessive fans either of the Stranglers or of those friends performing with them. If you want a true Stranglers live show choose 'Live X-Certs' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No intentions of enlightenment.

Although you can't get to heaven through works alone, you can condemn yourself by corrupting the youth.

I ended up returning it before I gave it too him because it was pretty scary!

I'm not a devout Christian in any way and I found this book offensive. It's almost pornographic in its depictions of some of the scenes. Plus - I don't think that this is in the Bible - \\"Why to keep the law?

Bestiality and homosexuality are depicted, although slightly out of focus, (the Flood, p.56). A threatened homosexual gang rape is included (Sodom and Gommorah, p. 102). Violent events are graphically rendered, albeit in Legos, (e.g. drowning people in the flood and skeletons scattered around the ground when Noah and his family finally disembark; blood spilled everywhere when Cain slays Abel). Yes, these events are biblical, but they are not appropriate for children, particularly the younger ones for whom someone might unwittingly buy this book.Not only is the book inappropriate for children, but the mocking tone of the self-proclaimed atheist author is objectionable for anyone looking for a tool to teach or reinforce the Old Testament stories in a Christian setting.I just want the buyer to be fully aware of what he is purchasing-- this is not a children's Bible storybook from the local Christian bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Buyer beware... Smith is an athiest with an agenda. The book is subtle in how it detracts from the truth of scripture, but the deception exists. On the surface, this looks like a charming book for children -- a way to get them interested in Bible stories.If you don't want to take my word for it, read the October 6, 2005 issue of Rolling Stone -- it describes how the lego figures Adam and Eve have sex, doggy style.These books may be cute or entertaining, but they are certainly not for children, or for anyone who has true reference or fear of the Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution, not suitable for everyone.","review":"The Brick Testament books are Bible stories in Legos, but just because they are Bible stories using children's toys, that does not make them suitable for children. As a Christian and a Sunday School teacher, I enjoy seeing the various ways artists and authors use the Bible as their subject. Bruegel, Rembrant, Leonardo di Vinci, Michangelo all use Bible stories as the subject of their work, and all do it differently. Brendan Powell Smith is another in a long line of artists, he is working in a new medium. Whether or not his pictures will still be viewed hundreds of years from now is not our responsibility to determine. That he has created illustrations of Bible stories that make others think is what is important. While I have shown the Brick Nativity to children, Genesis is not one I will share with those under about 12. Likewise, I would not teach some of those stories to the under 12's either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever","review":"The author's use of legos to depict an often boring story helps readers learn and remember the stories of the bible.

However, I found this book to only contain 25 deals, and everyone of them contained atleast one mistake. The most irritating part is that Mr. Andrews goes to a special point to mention every single card someone plays, wastes space talking about the wrong things, and he also writes in the passive voice. Most of his card logic is also ill concieved for the game of spades (perhaps more applicable to bridge only). The only advanced technique he mentions is finessing, but he offers no guidelines or helpful lines of thinking when on considers a finesse. In fact, most of the finesses taken in his 25 deals are practice finesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"sourly disappointed","review":"I play regularly in MSN's competitive rooms, and though I do not consider myself to be expert at anything, I do think I'm an advanced spades player.

I was looking forward to reading how the author would have played the hands differently, but there's not much input except on the bidding. He really promotes conservative bidding.

You might get lucky and install it without stripping the threads the first time, but at some point if you ever remove and reinstall it, the threads will get stripped. I was careful enough during the first install that it worked well and I didn't have any leaks. However, I just moved to a new house and when I removed the fitting I could see that some of the threads were a little \\"smushed,\\" for lack of a better word. Installing it in my new house was nearly impossible, it leaked terrible, and when I removed it to apply the pipe-sealing tape, I saw that it was irreparably damaged.

Back it goes and I'm off to find something that is more reliable.Update: I returned the sprayer and found one with a metal valve. It works much better. I agree with the person who left the comment(s) that it *is* worth the couple extra bucks.Now it seems Amazon is offering the sprayer with a metal valve. If that's the case when you are looking at this page the buy it with confidence.

I am not very handy at all when it comes to household plumbing jobs but this was so easy to install. Granted, the fixture would be nicer if it was metal and feels somewhat flimsy. But you can't argue with results, and it works beautifully. I just store the hose attachment under the sink until needed, pop it onto the connector and it's ready to go. So easy! I have shelties and getting their water-resistant double coats soaked and rinsed is always a chore, this makes it so much faster and easier.

I have been bathing my 10 pound Shih Tzu in our kitchen sink using the sprayer with our sink and I was worried I wasn't getting all of the shampoo out so after reading alot about this product I decided to give it a try. Got it within a week and my husband attached it to our shower with no problems but when we turned it on, there was hardly any pressure to it and I was disappointed from that so he let go of the button to spray and when he pushed it again nothing came out and we could hear loud noises behind the wall. Immediately, he let go and we had to go into the bedroom and take the paneling off the wall to see if a pipe had blown off and sure enough it did.

Each chapter has many, many formulas/equations, but at most a dozen or so worked-out examples. I learn best by doing, and having the answers to the problems in the back just wasn't enough. I needed many more worked-out examples than this book provided--I needed to know WHY I was getting incorrect answers. I found this book to be extremely long-winded. I only wish I'd had an adequate substitute for my class. There were conceptual problems at the ends of the chapters to which the book failed to provide the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one to get","review":"I've tried em all, and Goya's is not the one to get.

Of course we are always missing some favorites, for me these are Oh, Babe and Mr. Sandman, to name two. The quality of the mastering is overall very good. Still there are some minuses. For instance, the track The Battle Of Kookamonga is not stereo as listed, it is in perfect stereo on BMG's American Dream - Best of the 50's Volume 2. Also the track No Hair Sam is in poor shape and can be heard in perfect three track condition on BMG Special Products Homer & Jethro 36 All-time Greatest Hits.Since my last review, BF has re-released the CD with the stereo version of The Batlle Of Kookamonga and a drop-out free No Hair Sam.The CD is subliem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The guys who influenced Weird Al","review":"For those of us who like the deranged music of Weird Al, these guys will probably trip your trigger too! I grew up listening to my parents' old Homer and jethro albums, and got the biggest kick out of them. Listening to them now on CD, instead of scratchy old vinyl, is a Godsend. For the longest time I'd been hoping for some Homer and Jethro CD releases, and finding their albums is getting harder.Some of their material might be considered a bit dated, and younger listeners might not get some of their jokes, but for the most part, they're still hilarious. This compilation is not typical of their standard songs, which were more country, but one listen to 'She loves You', and 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' showed they could cross-over to rock just as well. H&J; could take hit records, and totally murder them, in the same vein as Weird Al, only they did it first. Never are they silly, but always funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"still funny","review":"Homer and Jethro's material is becoming dated but they are still clever and funny. Their send ups of hit songs will still appeal to those who remember the originals and Jethro's brilliance with the mnadolin is still breathtaking.It would be nice if the rest of their catalogue were to be re-released. The same songs keep appearing over and over on the collections that have been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Drew 75th Anniversary","review":"I love being the detective myself.

In a word it is excellent... a nice mix of his funky country, chamber rock, and full throttle styles. The first selection or 2 have a bit more echo than I would prefer (need to make sure I listen to the stereo audio, not 5.1), but from there on the audio quality is quite good... on a par with a CD. There are some nice 'extra' selections where the audio is definitely less stellar, but very welcome for the chance to see Steve some years earlier.Highly recommended!

The bass lines used in these songs are a huge help in keeping the beat going and keeping your head moving. And to top it all off, with all the beats kept by the drums and the energy you can tell is behind it is a definate body mover. This CD is really good from beginning to end and you can sing right along with good ole' sXe Joe when you see them live.

It is good enough to use on conference calls from a car or noisy environment, an achievement not one of 8 different behind-the-ear bluetooth headsets I've used can claim.

Some people experience so much pain they need to systematically detach from reality to live a normal, happy, but delusional life. Her system reminds me of christian science where one rationalizes away pain and mental stress by adopting a new truth where pain and discord do not exist. For many people this system will appear to help them, and for day to day living it will, but sooner or later people have to face the reality in their lives that there actually is pain and cruelty and suffering. There is light and dark, good and bad. When people are ready to face reality, they won't need to take refuge in this temporary shelter. And when they come out of it, they will be more alive. Not necessarily happier but more real and awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loving What Is","review":"My shrink suggested I read this book so I bought it and tried to read it. I've only been able to get through a quarter of the book so far because the main message seems to be: \\"It's not what happened to you, it's how you look at what happened, so forgive the person who hurt you and let it go.\\"I guess that's a nice idea but I don't think that works under all circumstanaces. I mean if somebody hurt you very badly, it may be nice to forgive them but I'm not sure that helps to keep it from happening again.I would like to make sure I take better care of myself by keeping it from happening again and just looking at something differently doesn't really seem to do that. I've forgiven myself for letting it happen but I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. How does looking at something differently do that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every word rings with TRUTH","review":"Absolutely the best \\"self-help\\" book I've ever read! Byron Katie doesn't preach or force her opinions on others, but instead facilitates a powerful method designed to get us to recognize our own truth and that of others. How do we know reality should be the way it is? Because that is how it is. Any story we tell ourselves about how reality should be causes us suffering and is insane. This is not a book on complacency. This is a book on acceptance and loving what is. Freeing energy to direct attention toward the one person who can truly make a difference in our lives -- ourself. This books shows the way out of \\"victim mentality\\" and woundology that is so prevalent in our culture. You don't have to read it.

I couldn't even get through the entire thing. The author may have caused her own pain, but there are some people out there who have suffered because of someone else's crime. Blaming a (genuine) victim is easy yet short-sighted and an obvious oversimplification. I honestly struggled with the ideas of self-blame that I got from this book until I read the one-star reviews. I'm thankful for the people who can get past this woman's hype and self-serving attitude of having arrived.Don't waste your money on a book that will sit on your shelf (and shoulders) weighing you down. If anything, I would recommend borrowing it from the library. If you must read it, skim it, and take her words with a grain of salt. Beware of her narcissism and need of approval from her audience.Additionally, the book is primarily based on her conferences/sessions with people, and is highly disorganized in its format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-babble","review":"I'm glad I checked this one out @ the public library instead of paying good money for it.

Following the contemplative steps outlined in this book is great for the Zen crowd, but I just have to pass. If I needed this much in depth review of myself, I would seek professional help and perhaps medication. Applying these four simple questions and working them through in detail might be possible in considering the life of my cat, but for my continuing 45 years of human existence, I would rather not.

It offers a few practical steps to help you analyze your own self-defeating beliefs, which is helpful to a point. In fact, many of the ideas she presents here are straight from Jesus' teaching (do not fear, love others as we love ourselves, don't rely on what we think we know, repent, forgive, etc.). Except that Jesus asks us to follow Him instead of ourselves, as Katie does. This path laid out by Katie cannot be sustained unless you die to yourself and become new in Christ.If you are looking for purpose, freedom from fear, healing, truth, unconditional love, and the ultimate guide to living, don't look here.

Byron Katie's four questions provide a simple process for turning around your perception of troubling situations.

The four questions are simple enough and broad in scope to apply to multiple scenarios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loving What Is","review":"The best recommendation I could give any one is to check this book out of the library rather than paying for it. The concept (and I mean singular) presented is so simple that you get it within the first 20 pages. Subsequent chapters offer transcript after transcript of various sessions between the author and different people with different problems to solve. It gets very tedious hearing these 4 questions (or variations on these questions or the additional bonus questions) asked over and over again. I'm not saying this book won't help some people change their attitudes about their lives, it's just not worth keeping in your private library. Some books you want to refer to over and over, this is not one of them.

It may sound hyperbolic, but it's true. This book can fundamentally change the way you see your life -- just by questioning what you \\"know\\" is true. Katie has hit upon a simple, get direct, method to get at underlying false beliefs which restrict people's choices and the direction of their lives. I understand from clients that the audio version of this book is also excellent. If you want to begin your journey inward, take this book along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and wrong.","review":"I love self help books. I devour them. This book was confusing to me. Not because I am not smart enough to grasp Katies' techniques, but because her ideas are so over the top and ridiculous.I knew I was done with the book when I read about her babysitting her 2 little boy nephews (i think). The one bigger boy likes to hit, but that is just who he is and that is his way. She allowed him to hit the smaller boy and never did anything to stop the boy from hitting. She then went on to say that the smaller boy that was on the receiving end of the hits said that he liked it. WTF?If the older boy were to take out a butcher knife from the kitchen and start to stab the smaller boy, Katie would allow this to happen because this is \\"his way.\\" This is not her business this is the boys business. This is who he is.This is what I don't understand.The lessons I learned reading this book were;#1) Check book out from library next time.#2) Never let Katie Byron babysit my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money, Save Your Time & Save Your Sanity!","review":"The only part of this book that I liked was the way she described the concept of: your business, other people's business and God's business-- helpful to think of things in this manner.I tried to change the star rating to 1, but it wouldn't budge! This is not even a 2 book.The book is basically cognitive therapy--challenge your thoughts/beliefs. Is it true? How do you know? etc.. There's some usefullness to that.The major problem I have with this book is where the author puts the responsibility of child abuse onto the victim! Of course, in Byron Katie's world, there are no victims, only co-conspirators. The common new-age theme of \\"you create your reality\\" runs through this book. If you're into that type of thinking, this is your book.Most of this book is plain rubbish, written by someone, IMO, who's climbed off the brink of sanity.

I knew I have wasted my money buying it before half way through it. Basically this book dresses up the prinicple of \\"how your attitude affects your well being\\" into something called \\"the work\\". I find it disturbing from the diaglogues that the author had with her subjects in that she obviously tried to steer them into answering what she deems is the answer that conforms to \\"the work\\". Whilst there are some helpful suggestions as to how to view a situation, I find the author generalized all feelings and emotions to the extent of invalidating them. I believe there are certain feelings or emotions which cannot, and should not, be \\"turnaround\\" as propounded by the author. Overall it is just another self help book which I should never have bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving deeper into self inquiry","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I received Byron Katie's book, so have been profoundly moved by it's contents. Although initial viewing of the questions would have one think, this is easy, as the book progresses and you witness others who attend Byron's workshops and the dialouge that takes place, you realise the shift that occurs from it is out there, to it is in here. Byron's language and chapeter titles bring you into a personal awareness that will engage you in a process that will set you free from blame and on the road to continaul responsibilities for all the thoughts you may think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of Suffering","review":"Read this book.

Gestalt, EST, Hypnosis, etc. and have been able to find value in most of these. However, these tapes are weird. The basic idea: that expecting that things should be different and feeling badly about this isn't going to help an individual is straight forward enough. I expected more, but if the only thing these tapes had done was reinforced this idea in a memorable way, they might interesting enough. However, they failed to even meet this minimal standard. I was disappointed. Here are the four questions: 1. Is it true? 2. Can you absolutely know that it's true? 3. How do you react when you think that thought? 4. Who would you be without that thought?. The four questions are presented with the self important phrase \\"the work\\". I can imagine a simple discipline consistently applied could be worthwhile, but I don't see this as the one.

Just don't try this at home.....I'm all for looking at my part of everything. But abusing children, is ALWAYS on the shoulders of the perpetrator - never ever should it be on the child.

Isn't it wiser to write, that criminals have their \\"own sick story\\" agenda just waiting for an opportunity? The best way for any victim to heal is to know that an attack is not personal.

It is essentially a form of cognitive therapy, which makes it clear that emotion follows thought, and that by changing our thoughts, we change our emotions and the way we relate with our world and ourselves.What's missing -- at least in the first few chapters of the book -- is a way to honor the emotions we already have, a mechanism to make it safe to change what we're feeling, and therefore who we are. Without that element, this can be a scary, even dangerous, process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book and work it describes is extremely beneficial to those individuals serious about making change in their lives.

I realize that this author is not a doctor, she has not her PhD. She is not someone whom went through years of schooling to \\"learn\\" how to manage stress or tell people how to live better lives. She is simply someone that went through most of her life expecting things to be different than they are and when that happens it inevitably causes a discord.I credit this book on helping me through things on a daily basis and basically staying sane, that being said I don't follow the 4 questions formally or all the time. There are many different ways this book can be interpreted I supposed and I guess it's not for everyone but to me it sure beats therapy, feeling sorry for yourself and moping around because your life didn't turn out the way you thought it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving What IS","review":"Great book, very insightful and a down to earth empty chair aproach to self talk and inner projecting.

But Byron Katie appears to have discovered this truth on her own, without studying Eastern religion and philosophy, and this makes \\"The Work\\" (as she calls it) all the more compelling. This book teaches you to deconstruct your thoughts and find freedom, an exit from samasara, in the here and now.

But, to repeatedly say there is nothing we can do but accept what is goes against who we are as human beings. There are so many statements in this book that are just infuriating. One of the worst is on page 235 of the paperback edition. \\"People who know there is no hope are free.\\" This is just outrageous and not what human life is about. Are we all to just throw our hands up and declare there is no hope? If that's a fact, why live at all? This book can be a cop out for some and a bit dangerous for others.

Assuming you have a decent amplifier, you can expect really clean highs, mids, and lows to a lesser extent. The low-end isn't a problem for me because the vacuum tube amplifier I now have them hooked up to puts out an insane amount of base, but when they were running off my Pioneer Elite amp they came in a little soft in that department. What I really love about these guys is their mid-range. It's a lot more fleshed out than any other budget towers I've heard, and could probably give some of the more entry level audiophile speakers a run for their money.

How many more \\"non-country\\" fans does she have to sway to her music?Brooks seems too afraid to go completely pop/rock, hence the character. When will you come out from behind the wig, Garth?

Millions of fans will agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky and Musically Weak","review":"Chris Gaines or not,this album is a soft, \\"Ive-heard-it before\\", piece of hype.The strongest cut on the album is probably \\"Right Now\\", an amalgum of the Youngbloods' \\"Get Together\\", and Cheryl Wheeeler's \\"If It Were Up To Me\\".Yet,with heavy-handed artistic licence, Brooks significantly alters-or rather, butchers-the Wheeler original.By omiting the last line of the song:\\"If it were up to me Id take away the guns\\", Brooks dismisses entirely its essence.Wheeler wrote the song in response to the senseless Jonesboro killings of 1998.It is a powerful comment on our times.Listen to it on her album\\"Sylvia Hotel\\", and forget Chris Gaines"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the alternative look?","review":"I have been a long time fan of alternative music and am sickened by Garth Brooks' new project. A friend of mine made me listen to this CD and he misses the alternative music direction all together. What a joke of an CD. You can dress Garth up like an alternative rock star - but even there he fails. But the music on this CD really misses. I am insulted that he thinks people are foolish enough to fall for this stunt. But sadly I bet millions will."},{"rating":"1","title":"AARGH!","review":"Will the real Garth Brooks please be seated? Brooks'latest musical offering is appropriately overshadowed by his inappropriate marketing strategy. Puleeeze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Rock Garbage!","review":"This has got to be the worst CD I have heard in years. Garth stick to country/pop or better yet get back to your country roots and put out the type of music that made you famous. Remember \\"No Fences\\" ??? This project is pure trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent Garbage","review":"Garth Brooks would have an easier time convincing me that he's Claire Daines than a hip rock star named Chris Gaines in this poor collection of retreaded, unimaginative psuedo-pop. If this album had to exist, it should have been released as a regretable soundtrack in accordance with the release of \\"The Lamb.\\"Brooks would have been smart to have looked to the failed attempt of Bruce Willis to invent a similar musical entity in the '80's. Maybe we would have been spared this piece of ... music."},{"rating":"1","title":"More controversial would've been better....","review":"Don't get me wrong. Garth brooks is very talented and has a great voice. However, this is basically a commercial sounding pop album...and not a very good one at that. There are a couple of good songs on here, especially the first track. Other than that, it is an overproduced, adult contemporary type sound. From the looks of the cover, you would think this CD would have a harder edge to it. Perhaps Garth should have leaned more towards hard rock, or even a heavy metal soundtrack. Hey, I believe that Garth Brooks has a good enough voice to do it. That would have got my attention! All in all, this is quite a dissapointment. If you find this in a bargain bin somewhere, it is worth a listen for a couple of bucks. Other than that, only buy it if you're a die hard Garth Brooks fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth showing his true colors for the world to see!","review":"The idea of a \\"country\\" performer performing rock is not new in country music. Many were doing it before they knew there was such a thing. Many artists who were big in country tried it on as rock. Buck Owens became \\"Corky Jones\\" and George Jones tried it on as \\"Thumper Jones\\". So, even though I'm not a big Garth fan, quit criticizing the man for trying it on as a rock star. My criticism would be, though, he's finally showing his true colors. The man claims KISS as one of his influences-very far removed from country. The man has never been capable of anything but watered down country to start with, so why should this thing be a suprise?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a bad attempt","review":"I think Garth is just getting bored and was attempting something new in this project of his. Although there were a few interesting tracks like \\"Snow In July,\\" the majority of the C.D was boring and basicly lifeless. The whole album sounded as if every song had been edited over and over until the only thing left was a hollywood production. Not a C.D I would buy or even bother to check out, nice try Garth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fooled by vh1","review":"I cant belive it,gulp hook line and sinker the life and times of chris gaines as told by vh1 a great story of a fairytale cleche rock musician presented in a true story setting. who wrote this i dont know but i almost bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure trash","review":"GARTH BROOKS has always sucked and now i hope that more people will see this. the (man) has ruined country music now he wants to trash pop music. wich is fine with me. everyone needs to listen to some real music, so type in MOTORHEAD and hit GO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth sells out","review":"\\"Lost in You\\" sounds like a song that N\\"Stync would cover and the rest of this \\"album\\" suffers because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that's wrong with the music business.","review":"What Brooks has done is a reflection of society - he who has the most money and fame can make any kind of record they want, push it where they want, chart on the jazz charts if they want, screw valid-real artists who don't even have a chance if they want. When is it enough ?! Kudos to Garth Brooks...a \\"real\\" American living the \\"real\\" American dream...money and power. BTW; This album is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent change in music for Garth Brooks!","review":"If Garth was looking to change his style, he sure chose the right path to do so.I found this album rather fresh and new for him, you can't help but notice his new approach to music. And the fact that Garth it seems is telling his own story through the eyes of the fictional character Gaines. Hats off to a new start Brooks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"As usual Mr. Brooks shows his tallent in all its glory. Just another album to show just how tallented he is. Great work Garth, Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Playin' It!!!","review":"Listen - I don't care whether or not you like Garth Brooks, but the CD is just plain excellent! Although he is taking a lot of heat on this project, it is an excellent idea and the music rocks. For those of you who don't like it, listen to it one more time... WITH AN OPEN MIND! If you still don't like it, many of us do."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Art?","review":"I have to say I NEVER thought I would purchase a Garth Brooks CD. I heard \\"It Don't Matter to the Sun\\" on the radio and really liked it, so I bought the CD. Some songs are a bit of cheez in a can but on the whole I think it's a great effort. As an artist you can't knock him for trying something new. I always heard the mark of true art is it triggers strong emotions...from reading the reviews most people either love it or hate it and I think that says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go, Garth, or Chris","review":"I'm not really a fan of country music, but I remember when the single on this album was released and when no one really knew it was Garth Brooks. I recently found this cd at a flea market and got it. If I had known what it would be like, I would have paid full price when it was first released. I really like the songs and it's really nice to see a country singer do something other than what he is famous for. I just wish they had done the movie which was supposed to follow the album. I'd give this one a definate thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album shows the amazing versatility and talent of Garth","review":"This album demonstrates the amazing verstitly and talent of Garth Brooks. The vocals and music are fantastic and span various music styles from60's to 90's all good. It is one of the few albums I've owned in which I enjoyed all the songs. Several Snow In July, The Way Of the girl, and Lost in you (which Garth sings in falseta) are fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth shows his versatility","review":"Garth Brooks has done it again.

Great album, good hooks and catchy melodies really show this musicians talent..... Thanks Garth, Chris and MOM........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This album, in my opinion, is one of Garth's best. Too bad the movie deal for this fell through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Musician!!!!","review":"Only a true musician can come out of his comfortable element and explore other aspects of his music and his soul. Garth Brooks has a gift only few musicians explore. To be able to play many types of music and deliver a powerful message in the process. God Bless your gift and your message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be one of the signs of the apocalypse","review":"So how does someone sing with twang then lose it? The track \\"Right Now\\" is a blatant attempt to be radio friendly and feel good friendly. Unfortunately it bastardizes the original version of Cheryl Wheeler's \\"If It Were Up to Me\\", conveniently omitting the strongest line of the entire song. Regardless whether you're for or against gun control, what Garth did was destroy a song's original intent in the name of airplay and record sales. It proves whether he's country or rock, he's all about selling records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth ventures into pop music...and mostly succeeds","review":"This is an interesting and eclectic album. It starts out strong with R&B and funk rhythms. Two of my favorite tracks are, \\"Snow In July\\" and \\"That's the Way I Remember It\\". The centerpiece of the recording is the song, \\"Right Now\\" which is being released to Top 40 radio stations in the near future. Whether these radio stations actually play it is another matter. But it is an excellent song. The last third of the album, however, isn't quite as strong as the rest. They sound too much like late 80's rock. Of course, they're supposed to sound like that because that's what Garth (Chris) wanted. But I would have preferred that the entire album be as funky as the first several tracks. Overall, though, this is a very enjoyable listen and Garth's voice sounds fantastic. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Enjoyment","review":"I have followed Garth for along time, have all his CD's. Gone to 4 of his concerts. The man is amazing. This is his best work todate. The songs and music arrangements are unbelievable. I admire Garth for his guts and imagination for doing this CD. There isn't another artist out there who would have the courage to do this. Garth musical range is amazing, he has the ablity to sing in so many different styles and this CD shows his talent. This Cd is a great collection of music from an entertainer who never bores you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, mediocre music","review":"I was looking forward to hearing this album, especially after I heard it was produced by Don Was. The concept of creating the music of a fictional artist was very interesting to me. However, after listening to the actual music I am disappointed. I do like several of these songs, but nothing here stands out to me as something that will hold up to the test of time. Rather than creating a separate musical persona, most of these songs sound like parodies of well-known pop artists. Sometimes I wonder if the songwriters and musicians who worked on this project were intentionally trying to make Chris Gaines an unoriginal artist with second-rate material. If so, they succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"I saw the special on TV which made me curious enough to buy the CD. I can admire Brooks for his attempt at something musically different. But, I will not be listening to this one again. He sounds like Prince trying to do Country. Yuck. I was expecting something a little more sincere, rock, or raw. The music just doen't have any \\"sparks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"Bought this out of curiosity. What a joke. This guy's opinion of himself is way over inflated. He should of had enough respect for real rock musicians, and not made this farce. His implication is that he's so talented he can do anything. GUES AGAIN GARTH. Buy this and you'll really have a good time. LAUGHING, at this country clown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break!","review":"I loved Garth Brooks the country singer, but that was almost a decade ago.

Really shows how versatile he is!","review":"This might be his best cd ever. Garth really has a good pop voice and he proves how good he is. This just goes to show that Garth is unquestionably one of the top singers ever. This cd was really worth it cuz, like his other cds, every song is one you'll wanna listen to. Theres not one bad song on this cd. A real good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over yourself, Garth!","review":"What a waste of time! Garth took a big risk in making a pop/rock album and, after listening the songs (at a record store....I certainly didn't buy it), it seems to be a bigger risk than ever. On some songs, it sounds like he is trying to imitate the N Sync or the Backstreet Boys while on other he seems to be trying to get in touch with his \\"hippy\\" roots. A few of the songs are okay, but it's clear that Garth is NOT a rock star, no matter how hard he tries. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"attempt to reinvent seems bland","review":"I respect Garth Brooks tremendously as an entertainer, a businessman and a marketing genious, but his new project seems to fall short of his usual greatness. I find the songs (predominatly written by the same writters) to be extremely bland with little variation. Any garth fanatic will love the album..basically the guy could sing nursery rhymes and it would go triple platinum, but I just find the tunes to be a bit dull"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over it, amazon.com!","review":"Sounds like the amazon.com reviewer has a bad case of sour grapes.... this was a decent CD, and I thought GB had a lot of fun assuming another identity to broaden his range. Aren't we all surprised to hear that sound out of him? Would we have bought the CD if we thought it was another ol' country bob Garth Brooks? Sure, he was indulging his fantasy of being a rock star... wouldn't you if you had the chance? Besides, this is ENTERTAINMENT, not a medical ethics. Lighten up & enjoy the sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Gaines is my idol!","review":"This is the best album of all time. The Beatles wish they could have been as innovative as this. Anyone that does not like this obviously does not have any knowledge when it comes to great music. This is an instant classic. I waited in line at Wal-Mart for 2 hours to buy this and it was worth every minute. Long live Chris Gaines and REAL music with emotion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter trash ....","review":"Garth doesn't even do country good ... now he is totally making a fool of himself trying to do soft-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I bought the CD, as I'm sure many others did, simply out of curiosity. But I'm pleasantly surprised by the music.My favorites on the CD: \\"Lost In You\\" (who knew Garth had a falsetto like that?), \\"Maybe\\", and \\"Unsigned Letter\\". \\"Right Now\\" is also very catchy, but I can see me tiring of that track a little faster than the others.If you're looking for a new rock sound here, you're looking in the wrong place. Garth uses the Gaines character to record songs that pay homage to the classic rockers that inspired Garth when he was younger. But that doesn't take away from the quality of the album. Listen and judge on the music itself, not on your opinion of Garth Brooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Food for Thought","review":"I believe this is one of the Best records Garth has put out. Sorry Chris Gaines. Each and every song makes you think about something or the other. As in \\"Right Now\\" is about the World and what we as people need to do, to the love song \\"It don't matter to the Sun\\". I admire what he has done. He ventured to a new area of music and I believe he can and will make it. It is a record that I will recommend to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album really shows Garth is more than a country star.","review":"I haven't bought the album yet but I did watch the TV special. I realize many Garth fans may not relate to Garth doing Rock style music. The thing I appreciated about it was how Garth showed true versatility in his music styles and the range of his voice. He has some rock, funky and r&b music on one album. He had me convinced there was a Chris Gaines. I deducted one star because some of the lyrics were hard to understand. I am convinced Garth's heart is in his music no matter what the style is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Touching Lives","review":"No matter what genre of music Mr. Brooks decides to align himself with in any given time, he still has the ability to touch lives. Every CD Mr. Brooks has released has touched me in some form or fashion and \\"In...the Life of Chris Gaines\\" is no exception. Personal favorites include \\"That's The Way I Remember It\\", \\"Lost In You\\", \\"Drifin' Away\\", and \\"It Don't Matter to The Sun\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow in July is correct - this stuff is very luke warm!","review":"This album is being promoted as being \\"hot.\\" However, it is very luke warm. Snow in July (one of the psedo-funk songs) is an accurate description of the album. However, once you really listen to it you see that Garth is just acting out a fantasy of his. So why not let him have his fun?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth Brooks Channels A 70s Icon","review":"Schlock pop soft rock of the cloying variety, this album needs to go out of print.

Garth Brooks has never been about country music, and this \\"Chris Gaines\\" marketing ploy should be your final wake up call. Garth's \\"country\\" albums have been as dishonest as this piece of product, and none of you have understood this. When I first saw a Garth Brooks in-concert video, and watched him smash his guitar and amp, I thought to myself: \\"I saw Peter Townsend do this on the Smothers Brothers show in 1969! This isn't country\\". You want country, then pick up the latest Dixie Chicks, listen to Lee Ann Womack, or check out Charlie Robison's \\"Life of the Party\\".

You hit the nail on the head, Garth did ruin country. Loved your theory on his next Latin project. This guy's about money and that's it. You can't take away his marketing ability, in that he's great. As a musician he is poor. This Chris Gaines thing is proof of that - absolute. Can't wait for his La Vida Loca cd due out soon no doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true oddity...","review":"It has been said there is nothing better than seeing a lost performer find his way home. This cd is the exact opposite. The amount of ego in this cd is sad, and I think it only works to cover for Garth's insecurity and personal knowledge about his career. He knows he is the result of marketing. Any album, such as Sevens, that has to sell seven million copies to make up for the cost of advertising, is a marketing tool and not a work of art. Garth's career, although impressive at times, is nothing more than marketing and gimics. Limited edition sets, box sets, double disc sets priced at $10 a pop, etc...Christmas albums rereleased a year later with 3 new tracks...In the end Garth is nothing. What happened to the movie this cd was supposed to represent? Garth is a true failure...his fans can hide behind statistics...but marketing is what has propped him up."},{"rating":"1","title":"can i give it a -1?","review":"what is he doing? garth, no offense or anything, but um, don't you sing country in your cowboy boots and hat? pop is just not for you, mr. brooks. you still have that cowboy wail that you can't take back. so put that hat back on. all us kids will appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many","review":"This album is something that should never have been released. Just because he likes another band, and wants to write a song in their style (but of much lower quality) does not make for a good album. He must be bored with his country-pop songs and want tp \\"experiment\\". However, if you lack talent and/or imagination, one should not do this. He should be happy he sells records when he wears a cowboy hat and a belt, and stick with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cowboy Has Gone Schizo","review":"This is the type of thing you dream about.

Garth Brooks is so out of touch with himself that he doesn't even know who he is anymore-he thinks he's someone named Chris Gaines. I thought his first 2 albums were very, very good, and since then he's made various good songs. However, After \\"No Fences\\", his album quality has been inversely proportional to his inflated ego. What is the big deal over this guy? He has totally marketed and self-promoted his way to unwarranted superstardom. He doesn't care about his fans, he cares about the quantity of albums he sells so he can break some meaningless record. The question is,\\"Does he realize he's making terrible albums?\\". Or is he secretly laughing his hat(which he doesn't deserve to wear anymore) off that his idiotic fans are blindly buying this garbage?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Anyone See Through This?","review":"The fact of the matter is that this is nothing but a bland, soft-rock rip-off of what David Bowie did with his \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" persona in the '60's. The difference is that Bowie was using the \\"glam\\" and the idea of a \\"manufactured\\" rock star to send a message, whereas this is a weak attempt by Garth Brooks to break into a different genre and increase his audience. If Garth Brooks thinks a depressed-looking expression and a bad haircut are going to convince people that he knows how to rock, he's going to fall flat...and deservedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity Crisis?","review":"Brooks has been one of the leaders of a pop-country movement that has practically destroyed the form by replacing good music with good marketing. Although one can understand why he would want to be someone else, Garth cannot stop being himself. This time, though, he is going to find the sledding a little bit tougher. Pop music is already loaded with frothy fluff, and as for that new \\"look\\"--big deal. The only thing weaker than this album will be his \\"acting\\" in that upcoming flick, no doubt financed by himself. Move over, Michael Jackson, there's a new weirdo in town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea- Poor Execution","review":"What a wonderful concept- a fictional artists and his \\"greatest hits\\". What a wonderful concept gone wrong!This \\"greatest hits\\" collection is awful. If this is supposed to be the body of work of a superstar, we are all in trouble. Chris Gaines comes off as a wimpy soft rocker without an ounce of charm or charisma.I don't get it. I looked forward to this release with more anticipation than any other. It just doesn't work.As a tried and true Garth Brooks fan, i couldn't stand this set. I can only imagine what non fans must think.Garth really strikes out with this set for the first time in his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is still the best","review":"I think this CD adds a good twist to Garth. I love his country CDs and I love this one. Not too many artists can sing different types of music and have the same great affect on people as he does. I found this CD to be another hit for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD!","review":"I have been a Garth fan since before he was Garth. I was skeptical when I heard he was \\"crossing over\\", however I think that country is pretty much pop these days, so it comes as no surprise that Garth is wonderful in this genre. Friends tell me he should stick to country...please Garth, don't listen and stick to what you feel like doing. You've earned the right."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely wonderful","review":"Garth as Chris Gaines....I had my doubts but just like anything else DO NOT believe any review with out checking it out for yourself. I love the whole album. It is nostalgic of the 80's -there are wonderful ballads like \\"lost in you\\" and \\" it don't matter to the sun\\". Buy the album,enjoy the music and forget the wig- it is just a way to get you to see another side of Garth and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke, that isn't even funny","review":"With the release of the painfully horrible CD, Garth Brooks proves once again that his ego knows no bounds.What is obvious is that Brooks hopes to abandon country music. Country music has seen steadily declining sales over the past few years, a trend that, not coincidentally, seems to tie in with its selling out it roots in favor of a bland, safe, suburban guy in cowboy hat feel (which, of course, was led the way by Garth). Now that these sales are off, Garth hopes to jump ship into the pop field. Chris Gaines is merely his testing ground. If it is a big success it is bye bye Garth and hello Gaines. If it is a bomb, he can return to country music, (or his bland version thereof) claim that was Gaines, not him, and then plot his next manipulative gimmick that he must rely on to sell CDs since his horrible music can't stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"P. T. Barnum was right","review":"After hearing these songs, watching the TV special, and trying to figure it all out, I've come to a rather obvious conclusion: This CD is the biggest display of rampant ego disguised as a \\"concept album\\" in the history of music. This comes of the heels of Garth trying to be a \\"baseball player.\\" The American public truly deserves Garth Brooks, Adam Sandler, and Dawson's Creek to go along with their overconsumption of soft cheese. Disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all..Pretty good","review":"I liked it. It is _NOT_ Garth's normal style, so I wouldn't recommend it to a pure country enthusiast.

His range allows him to sing many types of songs. This CD, \\"Garth Brooks in the Life of Chris Gaines\\" scores a big number one with me. I heard on my country music radio station this morning that sales of this CD are slowing down and that Garth's traditional country fans aren't buying it. Well I thought the whole idea of this album was to cross over into another music arena. So what if his country fans don't like what he did with this CD. Garth will make a whole new set of Pop/Rock fans with this piece of work. This country fan thinks the CD is awesome. If amazon.com had a rating of 10, this one would be right up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bullet to the foot","review":"Garth Brooks has never been particularly endearing to me, but this horrid \\"concept\\" album just about kills any empathy I could have had for him. The idea is addlepated for openers, and the music... feh.

Coming soon to cutout bins across the land."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Garth Brooks seems to be getting worse at singing all of the time.

No doubt each of these songs was put before a focus group for approval rather than put together to make some sort of artistic statement. Like his attempts at \\"country\\" (and baseball) Garth's atempt here fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for less pop and more fire.","review":"Comparing Garth Brooks to Chris Gaines should be like comparing apples to oranges... but I'm going to do it anyway. A big GB fan, the idea of Garth creating a new persona intrigued me and I purchased the album as soon as it was available. For the most part, I feel the album lacks a certain amount of soul. I guess it could be expected from someone who doesn't really exist. I was hoping for an \\"In Pieces\\" which kept my heart dancing throughout, but instead found \\"Right Now\\" wonderful, \\"Maybe\\" and \\"My Love Tells Me So\\" good, and the other 10 songs just not striking a resonance with me. I guess I was hoping for a little less pop and a little more fire. Garth may have been keeping one eye on the safety net with this risk, instead of just closing his eyes and letting go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent change of pace","review":"Garth Brooks has always been outside the traditional country cicles. That is why he is so successful at what he does. This CD was a great way to expand his fan base without alienating his country following. The album is great to listen at anytime, and the booklet in the case is almost worth the cost of the CD itself. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth's finally where he belongs: OUT OF COUNTRY MUSIC!!","review":"First, Amazon, Garth Brooks has absolutely no credibility in country music anyway, so he has nothing to \\"put on the line\\"! Garth is a master of showmanship, PR, and ego. He has absolutely no place in country music, and those of us who love genuine country music are appalled that he's getting so much airplay on country stations. I wish he'd partner up with Shania Twain pursue rock/pop/whatever you want to call it FULL TIME and get OFF the country stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a musical style Garth!","review":"Music is okay, lyrics okay...can't figure out if I'm listening to Back Street Boys or the Wallflowers...Come back to country Garth..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth is a great showman!","review":"The man has a gift no matter what kind of music he is performing. I bought this CD out of curiosity, and am I glad I did. He had fun with this album, and so did I. The more I listen to it the more I like it. So many different sounds. I appreciate real talent and his ability to pull this one off proves that's just what he is, a real talent. Way to go Garth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please... Stick To Country..","review":"While Garth can compose great country & western, This cd tries too hard to duplicate a sound that to put it mildly, has past. Legend? Perhaps time will tell. Garth seems possessed trying to unseat Elvis as the # 1 selling artist of all time. It's a long climb & country should be the path, not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooks doesn't suck when he writes rock","review":"As an avid hater of country music, I bought this album knowing that it would be better...Brooks has been quoted as saying he prefers rock but could not break into that market. It's too bad, because this is one of my favorite albums, and I am someone who likes Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd, and Coldplay.This is a diverse album of easy listening and easy rock tunes with lots of different sounds, styles, etc. It probably illustrates that Brooks was TOO diverse for rock. Whereas Country can handle these variations, rock is a little too narrowly defined.I gave this a five out of five deliberately. I really do like all of the songs, some better than others. The guitar work is expert, the beat is solid and the songwriting is first rate. Great songs include \\"That's the way I remember it\\", \\"Driftin' Away\\", \\"Unsigned Letter\\", and \\"It Doesn't Matter to the Sun\\".Brooks took some krap for crossing over to the dark side, but its the best stuff he has ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"INNOVATIVE! <snicker>","review":"What a great idea, invent an alter ego and create an album based on his life and music. Amazing, what will Garth do next? You should tell David Bowie about this idea of yours, he'd probably like to give it a try also. Aside from the sarcasm, this is still a bad album. What Garth is trying to pass as Rock and Roll comes across more as something of a lame joke that nobody gets. As a result he's forced to go on talk shows and Good Morning America to promote this trash. but I guess his target audience watches shows like that so it's probably a good move. And while Garth will never fit into the Artist category, he is still quite the cash-machine, with a Christmas CD already on the way. So if you like your music empty and bland then Garth should fit your bill. If you want some really incredible music then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Convertee","review":"I never listened to Garth Brooks songs and never so much as seen a Brooks album. I'm completely indifferent to Country- not that i dont' like it- just have had no exposure to it.Well let me get personal just a little: i'm listening ot the radio, a soft rock channel, and i come across the song \\"Lost in You, \\" and fell in love with it immediately. I didn't have clue who sings it. I've asked around, no one knew what song i was talking about. So how mazed was i when i found out that it was Garth Brooks who sang it? You knwo the country dude, the funny guy who comes on SNL every now and then, whom ladies adore?I bought the album instantly and i love it. Lost in you is a wonderful, right now, my love tell me so, all of these songs dispaly the musicianship and smooth, vibrant vocals i never knew Garth Brooks owned. This man's voice surpasses all the boy bands singing and it was refreshing to witness this phenomenom of human clout, makes me wish i had the singing ability tha tgarth has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Away Garth","review":"This is the worst kind of dreck from the most souless artist to come along since Michael Bolton and Kenny G. What's next Garth?, you gonna go crawlin' back to country music (which you ruined) or wait, the latin thing is kinda hot right now, you can call yourself Senor Gartho and wear a sombrero, a whole new market to milk! So take off the wig, forget the Chris Kringle or Gaines or whatever and start \\"livin la vida cheesy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth Blows","review":"Garth - I like the way you hold your guitar on stage. Please don't try to play it. Nobody outside a trailer park has ever bought this cd. That's where I heard it.

I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ranked Up There","review":"I rank this Chris Gaines cd, and in fact all Garth Brooks cds right up there with my Barry Manilow, Billy Ray Cyrus, Monkeys, Bay City Rollers, and any Kenny Rogers duet.

I purchased it for songs # 2 and # 4. Song number 4 does not play at all. After Song # 3, the entire CD skips all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I saw the special first on NBC to make up my mind to buy the CD. Loved the special, bought the cd Thursday. What a great CD. No one could pull this off except Garth Brooks. Many people have given Garth a hard time for doing this CD. I say they are clueless! Garth has truly reinvented himself in this CD and has done an excellent job with it:) I hope he gets the chance to actully play the part of Chris Gaines in The Lamb when it comes out. Love the cd cover too...Garth looks so cool with the hair and outfits he wears!Way to Go GARTH!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A man of expression and feeling. His music sums it up.","review":"when I saw his special on TV recently, I didn't like that style of music coming form Garth. He said there will be those of you that don't like this Garth, well i was one of them. Then I watched the tape the next day and i really like his R&B \\"It Don't Matter To The Sun\\". He sounds like Prince at times. I bought the CD and have played it over and over. I can't wait to see him in the movie as he appears on the CD. Its hard to believe that it is him. The eyes tell it all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The artist formally know as Garth","review":"O.K. I know what you're saying, \\"Garth Brooks? Really?\\" I was shocked by it as well but to tell the truth this is a fantastic album. I have never been a \\"Garth fan\\" but this album reached me. I bought it after hearing it one time, a rariety. I play \\"Chris Gains\\" more than any of my other CD's and have even gone as far as to purchase one of his other albums. Unlike many pop creations I hear these days, this guy has some talent and I'm happy to see him reach out to the rest of us.Even though it has a retro feel there is nothing uncomfortable or clich�� about this CD. It's fun and touching at the same time. Old but fresh. I just wish there was a guitar book to accompany it. Oh well maybe later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Recording","review":"It's ashamed that this recording flopped; it is absolutely excellent. If Garth had only recognized the narrow mindedness of his own fans, he would have anticipated the backlash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Getting, owning, listening to....","review":"It's well done, smooth, pop, yada, yada. I can hear pieces of Garth but the average country fan won't like it because it has nothing written about dead dogs, losing your job, getting drunk or what ever it is country people think music should be about. Instead, it's well crafted pop, nice structure, relaxing to listen to and covering a LOT of ground. My Partner is a major country fan, has met Garth and many other performers. She and I both love the album but for different reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmmmmm,,,,,,","review":"This has to be the Ziggy Stardust of the 90's.The TV special was unusual to say the least and well,,,,so is this CD. Stick to country music Garth or get into Pop as a real person! Weird!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best cd ever made","review":"I think the cd was completely great. I just happened to get lucky and get the last one. I love it. Now people can't judge country singers because Garth Brooks changed how i felt about country. I love it........"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DID HE CHANGE HIMSELF LIKE THAT?","review":"Garth Brooks was my favorite artist. I have every CD that he has ever made and now he has changed so much. On the cover of his CD, he looks so sickly and looks like he is about to die. I just wish he would go back to his old self as Garth Brooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth has done it AGAIN!","review":"I purchased the CD on my way to work the day it was released and haven't been able to stop listening to it. With all of the different \\"styles\\" of the songs, it really sounds like an artists greatest hits. The first time I heard \\"Lost In You\\" I couldn't believe it was Garth. WOW! I told a friend that \\"Lost In You\\" would be the perfect Bride/Groom song. I am lucky enough to have found my \\"God send....my angel from above\\". To all of the negative reviews I have this to say - Garth is merely \\"stretching his wings\\" and \\"going outside the box\\". It's a wonderful thing - maybe you should try it some time. Listen to the CD with an open mind, it really is fantastic. Garth cares enough to give us his \\"heart and soul\\" and he isn't \\"just diggin for gold\\"!! Way to go GARTH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost . . . His mind.","review":"Anybody who gives this pathetic, poseur album five stars would give five stars to an album called \\"Toilet Sounds -- as Recorded Live at the Truck Stop Bathroom.\\" What is wrong with you people? The only explanation is that Garth is entering all of these ridiculous comments by hand, himself. It'd be a better use of his time than making the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth, we hardly knew ye.","review":"After millions of albums sold, Garth has finally lost his mind. The persona is stupid. The music is worse. Garth is doing this so all the critics look at him and say, \\"Wow, he's really brave. He really wants to be an Actor, and he's SOOOO into his role.\\" And he talks about Chris Gaines in the third person. \\"Well, Chris cut the Triangle album with more of an R&B Feel.\\" Stupid.Your act is wearing thin, Garth. You're a phony, and the humble act won't work anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da!","review":"In a lot of the reviews here, the writers refer to Garth \\"influences\\" like The Beatles, Bob Seger, Sir Elton John, The Rolling Stones. Please... DA! These are talented musicians. Garth is a well-crafted businessman who has taken from these artists - not by mistake. He's better at holding a guitar than playing it. He's turned country into a complete JOKE. That fact is only proven on this Chris Gaines cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"cynical rubbish","review":"This album is a shockingly cynical attempt by Garth Brooks to expand his musical boundaries without having to risk losing his country music base. The whole Chris Gaines image - as epitomized by the VH1 \\"Behind The Music\\" special - trivializes the sacrifices and difficulties of real people with real lives, as typified by his \\"father\\" dying of cancer, the death of a (fictional) best friend, etcetera. This isn't Hollywood escapism of the sort you might see in a movie, but a rather disgusting ego trip for Garth Brooks. As far as the music itself, if you think Richard Marx is one of the great musicians of the last 30 years, you will love this album. I didn't and don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Life Of A Big Phoney","review":"Garth, stick to less complicated music like country. Of course even that is too complicated for a guy like you who basically just holds a guitar and is a front-man for a corporation called Garth Brooks Inc. There is nothing creative here, and the music is dead and listless. Give it up people, this cd sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Garth Fan","review":"I bought the cd to add to my Garth collection. I regret not listening to it first. I was very disappointed to say the least. My husband told me not to buy it and I should've listened. We listened to the cd driving to our vacation destination. We couldn't stand it! It was more enjoyable to listen to static on a radio station. Garth needs to stick to country because he IS great at it. He needs to leave pop, or whatever you would call this, alone forever! I hated this cd and wish I would've saved my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Garth I know and love.","review":"I used to believe if a country star sings a song it is country. This is not the case with Garth's latest project. I have all of Garth's CDs with the exception of his Christmas Album. This new one I don't own, yet. It is not likely to join my collection and sit with Garth's and country stars. Garth keep in country please. This isn't country."},{"rating":"1","title":"babyface meets prince not on this mess","review":"garth brooks is a great business man period.right along with puffy,mariah,celine dion,michael bolten. now as far as music he has always been way overrated and this disc proves that point further.trying to look like prince and sound like babyface? i don't think so.if he had come out like this 10 years back they would have had what ever happen to garth on vh1 back in 94? cuz that style played out along time ago not to mention the music that he is trying to hustle over onto to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth meets teeny bopper music","review":"This is one of the worst albums ever released by a major artist in any format. After reading the reviews, I come to the conclusion that if his goal was to go after the N-sync or backstreet boys fans then he suceeded, half the reviews mentioned how much they love garth and his look, I think most of those reviews were done by teenage girls who listen to their music with their eyes and not their ears.I also feel that Garth needed another personna since his ego won't fit into one body.If you like Garth, get his early stuff, skip this album and get something good. He should be embarrassed to release this. Hopefully, he will learn from the bad feedback and go back to his roots and do an great album that he is capable of doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought garth was real..but now I know the truth he isfake","review":"Garth.

It was a waste of my time and my money. Stick to what you do best, Garth; this sure ain't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best Garth albums i have ever heard","review":"Out of all the Garth Brooks Hype i thought that this album turned out one of his better ones. It dosent matter that the music is a little different, if you stop and think he has been doing this stuff for years.look at what he did with \\"The Fever\\" and he has been known to sing songs by Billy Joel at his concerts. While in New York he even did \\"Bye Bye Miss American Pie\\". So in reality this is nothing new for Garth, just a different name. David Bowie did the same thing in the 70's the only difference is David Bowie stuck to rock. Garth is the only country singer to try this and he is pulling it off quite well. I have to congratulate Garth for Doing this.Thanks Garth and keep up the good work"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I DONT' KNOW WHAT GARTH THINKS' HE'S DOING TRYING TO GET INTO POP.

I say to myself, \\"what a waste of time and money.\\" But then I read all the positive reviews and think maybe I dismissed the CD too soon. But after several listens I still don't feel excited about this cd or any of the cuts on it. It's not that they are bad so much as they are just not good. Perhaps I'm missing something. And maybe, just maybe, Garth's fans are hyping the cd up to keep from admitting that the cd is just not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"GARTH BROOKS....IN THE LIFE OF CHRIS GAINES","review":"THIS CD BLEW ME AWAY.

I ENJOY THIS CD SO MUCH THAT IT IS MY MOST LISTENED TO CD AND I HAVE ABOUT 300 CD'S OF ALL KINDS OF ARTISTS. I HAVE ALL OF GARTH'S CD'S. THE MAN IS JUST AMAZING. HE'S SOOOOOO TALENTED. I SAW HIM IN PERSON TWICE IN CHICAGO AND HIS STAGE SHOWS ARE PHENOMINAL. THEY ARE FUN FOR ALL TO EXPERIENCE. I HOPE HE WILL DO A TOUR OF THE LIFE IN CHRIS GAINES CD. IF IT'S IN CHICAGO, I'LL BE THERE. HE IS TRUELY ONE OF THE GREATEST TALENTS OF OUR TIME. VERSATILITY, STAGE PRESENCE, AND HIS SONGS ARE STORIES TO MAKE US FEEL ALL DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE. HE CAN SING TO ME ALL NIGHT THAT'S FOR SURE."},{"rating":"2","title":"artist bucks country genre saddle","review":"What a great effort by Mr Brooks and Producer Don Was. It is a great showcase of vocal and arrangement/ production talent which I'm certain will have the country bumpkins totally confused. This is the first \\"Garth\\" album I have purchased having found the country rut a bit too derivative. Mr Brooks shows that he must have enough money and personal confidence to stretch out of his cliche for this fine musical effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, horrible finish","review":"I can relate to most of what I've been reading here. Anyway, while I started using words like 'genious', 'daring', etc., from 6th song on it turned to 'American high school pop-rock', 'Rick Springfield rip-off' (and I already think Springfield sounds like 'American High School pop-rock), etc. Garth shows his talent and will to broaden his musical horizon, but doesn't live up to his own high standards (he sets for his country albums). I give him 5 stars for the first 5 songs, and will forget he ever recorded the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' that Babyface sound!","review":"Garth Brooks has made me a fan. I used to not be a big fan of country music, and to a certain degree, I'm still not, but I am so intrigued by all this hooplah surrounding Chris Gaines that I went out and bought the album. I have to say that I was impressed. My main musical tastes are hip-hop and R&B, but Garth (Chris) has found himself a new supporter in me! Tracks 2 and 4 show a real Babyface flavor that I am simply in love with. I'm glad Garth and Face teamed up to do some tunes. I hope this is the beginning of a long-lasting collaboration for those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a nice surprise!","review":"As both a country fan and a rock fan this album totally blew me away.

He put too much politics and political correctness into his songs and now he's trying to be too 'deep' or something. I know Garth (or Chris, if that's who he wants to be now) has lost me and a lot of others as fans and buyers of his CD's. Too bad because the mid 80's music was GOOD! The music on this CD is definitely out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"who cares what genre it is...it's garth and it's wonderful","review":"I watched the special and I have bought the album. No matter what he sings, Garth is the man and the music is as always wonderful. Who can tell me that they wish to do other things in life, but are too scared to do them?

I will play this album over and over.....will probably buy two because I will wear the first one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great Music - Very Artistic !","review":"Garth (excuse me, uhh Chris) has done it again..Garth's remarkable talent shows up not only in the music on this CD but in the overall presentation to the market - the television special last Wednesday, the upcoming movie of the character performed by Garth and the diversification of music on the CD. He touches on a multitude of musical styles. He's truly amazing! This CD is refreshingly great to soothe yourself with, to jam with and to rock out with. Look for this one to have multi-track hits. Some of the best money I've spent on entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musician who knows and loves music...","review":"Let me think here...The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Charlie Daniels etc. I have listed artists that are difficult to classify, why??? Because they did not fall into a specific genre. I think today's music is over catagorized. I remember when in the early 70's when on the top 40 you heard, a country artist, followed by soul, then rock. It didn't matter what is was, if it was good music, then it was good music. Now today, since Frampton Comes alive the record companies have one purpose in mind. Got to make more money, so let us cut out more records like cutting cookies and forget muscial integrity. At least Garth Brooks has enough guts to try something like this and you know what, it works. Nashville may not like it but they didn't like Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings either. I guess some country fans will have to go through twang withdrawl and listen to Billy Ray Cyrus (the utter epitome commercial country.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth Brooks doesn't have the raw musical emotion.","review":"The music of the great rock bands of the past drip with musical emotion--Plant's voice and Page's rythums, Clapton's soles, the piongancy of the Who and Beatles, or the wild bad boy images of the Stones and Aerosmith ferrmenting in their music. Garth doesn't. In fact, Garth doesn't even have such qualities as bad rock stars of today like Smash Mouth. Why, because if not in chronology, atleast in a sense of maturity, Garth is to old for rock and roll. Yes, Steve Tyler is near fifty. Mic and Keith have the angel of death cirlcing over their heads. But they are still young and wild in spirit--a spirit that comes thru on stage and in recordig seesions. Garth's music is not raw and somehow \\"youthful\\"; it's not rock and roll.

The pen is nifty, but I don't personally need a pencil, black ink, and red ink ... only thing I've used is the stylus and the one on the iPAC is more convenient.

This is a powerful story that examines a woman's role in a country that believes women should be submissive, and though this isn't the main focus of the story by any means, it definitely is examined through Megan.

With this one, not only did I see some moves I never had before, but she shows and breaks down several moves I've never seen outside of a studio situation. She also offers some different variations on some common moves. All of her instruction is clear and easy to follow, but she doesn't spend a huge amount of time on one thing, to the point where you get bored.

I actually like this CD better than the Cannons although there are songs on Cannons I like, some of the background music I think is too much. I prefer him and his guitar, some drums . . .

His voice to me actually sounds very similar to Jason Morant as well as alot of the stylings and lyrics of his worship songs. Phil does add enough of his own sound to make him stand out and should make him many fans.All in all Phil Wickham puts together a solid release of worship songs without sounding like every other worship album.

It actually fits in the palm of your hand. Now that I have it I'm glad I spent the extra money, this is the kind of clock I'll be able to keep for a long time. The plastic is tough enough to survive a fall onto a hard surface without damage. The clear plastic on the face is just as tough. The cover, normally the most likely thing to snap off on most travel clocks, is also well done.

It only holds about 20 sheets of paper and the feed mechanism is poor. After a few months of use I got a paper jam and realized that there is no way to get to the crumpled paper inside the machine. The customer service agent advised that I turn over the machine and vigorously shake it for 20 seconds. While the sheet didn't dislodge, it did stick out a bit from the rollers and with great difficulty I managed to rip it out piece by piece. Now I still get the paper jam notice and I'm just going to throw this unit out. One more thing, the ink for this unit was really expensive. These companies don't make much on the machine but on the replacement ink cartridges. I'm going to pick up the highly rated Brother MFC-490CW at a local Office Depot or Staples for $129 and have the ability to easily take it back if it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Installation Problems","review":"This installed fine on my desktop computers but Lexmark's installation setup crashed my Acer Travelmate notebook over and over with Blue Screens of Death. Lexmark's troubleshooting faq was no help. Finally solved the problem myself by doing an uninstall followed by a Windows Restore and then doing the install in Safe mode with Networking.The printer is kind of heavy and clunky. Place it somewhere solid, otherwise it will shake and vibrate whatever its placed on.The Install has a lot of BLOATWARE associated with it. Do the Custom install and you can eliminate some but not all of it. No easy way to just install a driver without all the bloatware.But it is one of the most economical wireless solutions available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time if you have a Mac","review":"Bought for $30. Turns out it was a fair price... It works OK with Windows PC, but a bit temperamental at times. Can't get WiFi to work with Mac at all. Online search showed ongoing problems for Mac users for over a year now (feel free to google it). Lexmark appears unwilling or unable to supply Mac drivers that work. After what I paid I view it as a disposable printer. Was it worth $30? Probably. Would I pay $30 again? Very doubtful. Final advice would be to rather look elsewhere if you have a Mac until Lexmark wakes up.

The initial setup was easy and it seemed to work fine, for a while. Print quality for the price is good.First problem, 6 months in, was it would only print the last page of multi page documents. Pain in the ---, but I just printed one page at a time. Now, it has stopped scanning from any machine. I checked online and it seems that others are having this problem as well. It says, \\"unabale to download applications list\\". I tried all of the 'solutions' offered both by users and Lexmark. Updated the drivers then uninstalled and reinstalled all of the software- twice. Lexmark owes me 4 hours of my life back.

I don't like this printer mainly for the cost of ink cartridges; Lexmark has made it so an average non-techie like me cannot use aftermarket ink cartridges or refill those of a Lexmark brand. My second reason is I've had a \\"low color ink cartridge\\" error displayed, and repeated back to me everytime I print something, for the past 6 months (not an exaggeration).I would not reccomend this printer.

This book tells you why you need to change your thinking and how to go about doing it. It not only tells you how to change how you think about the world but goes into technical details on shorting, calling, and putting stocks. True, Kiyosaki is mighty proud of his boardgame, Cashflow 101 in all his books but that shouldn't distract you from learning how to change your context. Kiyosaki gives practical easy to follow advice in this nice follow-up from the Rich-Dad series.

You can get any more practical financial advices from other Do-it-yourself personal finance book. I just want to say: if you want to be the rich dad, don't buy the book and save the money in money market fund, at least you earn a penny a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype?","review":"In brief, if you have read any of the other Rich Dad books then this does not add anything. The content is a rehash of the earlier Rich Dad books but with very annoying tendencies to shamelessly plug other Rich Dad books, a Rich Dad game and the website. If the author is as rich as he claims, why does he need to do this?All the Rich Dad books have as the central theme that people are wasting their time trying to become affluent or rich by means of working in a regular job. Instead the way to affluence is through entrepreneurial activity. This is a welcome change from the regular financial books that stress 401(k) investments in the stock market and the Rich Dad series are worth reading just to get this alternative perspective. There comes a point, however, when excessive hype can destroy the message and this point may have been reached in the Rich Dad series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few specifics, lots of repetition","review":"This book is okay. Mostly it encourages you to get your mind ready for being rich rather than just assuming that you never will be. Unfortunately, it spends the first 200 or so pages doing that. Eventually, it gives cursory treatments of real estate investing, stock options, and building businesses. Unfortunately, it never tells you *how* to do anything.If you are hoping to educate yourself on how to make a plan for retiring young and rich, do not buy this book. If you want a feel-good book to get you pumped up about retiring young and rich, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here.","review":"Just another real estate huckster hawking the \\"Quit your job and buy Real Estate and my other products\\" approach.

The main point that Kiyosaki left me with was, \\"Hey, if I want to get rich, maybe I should write a book about how to get rich?\\" I will say that the motivational aspects of this book may help those with a seemingly incurable self esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't worth the paper its written on","review":"Luckily I checked this out of the library first All he does through out the entire book is repeating and reiterating the same concepts over and over.

KIYOSAKIAND IT IS NOT REALLY MUCH DIFFERENT FROM \\"RICH DAD,POOR DAD\\"I REALLY BELEAVE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HIS RICH DAD WRITE A BOOKBECAUSE HE ALWAYS USES HIM AS HIS REFERENCE.

Actually, the best thing that I inferred from the book is the best way to retire young and rich is to write a mediocre book about planning for retirement.I don't intend to be overly mean, but the book has the tone of a late night television huckster peddling real estate investment scams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just milking it...","review":"Read \\"Rich Dad's Guide to Investing\\" and forget about Kiyosaki's other books - the third book in the series captures all the ideas this man has. If you must, browse through the other books in the bookstore - you will realize that the information is repeated, and that you can save a lot of money by not buying his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"This book should be free since it offers little more than Robert Kiyosaki selling his other books and games. If you want to retire young and retire rich, own a little real estate and write a lot of lousy books. That is the message I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"This book is a bit too abstract. I would have liked it if he had described a bit more the sweat and heat of running a business. And he says he retired at age 48. To me, retiring young is more along the lines of what Eddie Murphy said, \\"I always knew I'd be a millionaire by age 21.\\" That's young! And if Kiyosaki didn't retire until age 48 (and he retired on a fairly unimpressive five-figure passive income) EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN COACHED BY HIS RICH DAD SINCE AGE 9, a reader older than 9 can tend to feel it's too late to start the multi-years process of getting rich, which for Kiyosaki involved being homeless in his late 30's. And I confess, I'm older than 9 myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Guy is a Con Artist!","review":"This guy is the latest in a forever march of con artists trying to sell kook ideas with a book. I read the book and researched the writer, his background cannot be verified nor can his income, but I am sure it is much higher after selling this book.He is a low middle class reaching for the upper class, by givingmiddle-middle class the \\"shakes\\" on how they will die pennilessand destitute in future unless they end their $inful way. There are two ways to make money, you either earn it or inherit it. So that making yourself nervous and get busy doing one of these, hell go find a rich wife or husband!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja vu","review":"I read this one after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad - the first in the series. I can't say I learned anything new. The author's point of view is made clear enough by the first book, and as I put this one down I got the feeling it was time to move on to books by others, and broaden my perspective on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retire Young, Retire Rich is disappointing","review":"This was my first foray into the \\"Rich Dad\\" series. I decided to pick this up to see what all the hoopla was about. This book is long on concepts and improving your mindset and short on telling you HOW to accomplish the goal.Kiyosaki drones on, frequently referring to his other books. After the first few chapters, I gathered that his plan is to invest in real estate and start your own businesses, but there is no substance to tell you where to start DOING any of these things. I guess that I was expecting more of a \\"how to\\" guide to achieve the end result.Now that you know what you SHOULD do, skip this one and go find a nuts and bolts guide to real estate investing or starting your own business."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetition of the very first book","review":"This book is very interesting and teaches a lot of common senses. Unfortunately - like most other books of the Rich Dad series - Robert repeats his messages over and over after 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' without adding extra value in the new books. His message is: be your own boss and that can be found in his first book. Another weak point is all his books tell you the 'why' but not the 'how to'. My advice: read only the first book in the serie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the beef?","review":"Although this book covered some very interesting and some what complicated concepts (such as Context vs. Content; different types of leverage), I find this book contains way too many fillers and self promotions. Not only did the fillers wasted a lot of the readers' time, it also hurt Mr. Kiyosaki credibility as an financial educator. We all know that Mr. Kiyosaki is getting rich by selling books like this one. I feel he is milking his ideas too much. I know one thing, he just lost me as a returning customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Could Have Just Written a Pamplet for the Content","review":"I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and loved it. This book however is a lot of fluff. He regurgitates the same ideas and words 5-10 times throught the book. A lot of self-praise for himself (and Kim). Not enough original work to justify a whole new book. Looks like the \\"Rich Dad\\" product name is getting extended a little too much.Do yourself a favor and just stick to the original book. For the first time ever, when I finished this book I immediately threw it into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice","review":"Kiyosaki's inspirational, easy-to-read books are written to excite the reader about available financial opportunities. And they do excite the reader. It is easy to get caught up in the author's enthusiasm. The generalizations are great and allow the reader to dream, but more details are needed. In this recent book, Kiyosaki stresses the need to protect your assets. He spends an entire chapter (17) on how stock options can, and in his opinion, should be used by all investors to gain that protection. His discussion was convincing, but again, there were not enough details. I recommend THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS to learn those details. The reader would then be in position to follow Mr. Kiyosaki's good investment protecting advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"..OH PLEASE!!...THIS IS GETTING OLD...","review":"I did like Rich Dad Poor Dad, and started to read cashflow quadrant...this book is nothing but the same concepts in a little more detail....but all the same watered down concept of the first book...I glanced at a few other books, and have caught on to this....save your $$$$, The only thing you should know is that your contributing to the wealth of one man, who makes a living out of suckas's who pay for these way too watered down, and tired concepts......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Reading","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, I just want to say this is not 'How to Retire Rich for Dummies'. This book was my first in the Rich Dad series, so I cannot compare it to the others. Personally, I found this book enlightening and inspiring. The author is writing to intelligent individuals to spark desire and motivation, not teach step by step instructions. I am planning to read other books by this author. For those who say the author is trying to sell more products -- might I suggest going to your library and borrowing them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on theory, short on specifics","review":"While there are some good general concepts to be learned, the entire book (335 pages) could be shrunk 75% (easily) and there would still be ample room to get the points across. Lots of wishy-washy, big picture stuff (nothing wrong with that if that's what you need, of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to retire","review":"A great book to point out some possible improvements to my current plan. I do not agree with all the points but did like most of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Read this book in a weekend and was not impressed at all. The author repeats ideas over and over again that were dated even when the book was initially published. This wasnt the life changer that so many people have said it was. I left my copy in a navy laundry room library in northeastern Africa. Maybe someone else can get some use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary of his popular books","review":"I am avid read of Rich Dad Book series and have read the other popular series like the Rich Dad Poor Dad, Guide to Investing, CashFlow etc. This book contains a good summary of all the wisdom of other books put in a nutshell.The book also mention on the Options Vs Stocks which I really liked. There is not much details about it on Options but gives one of the most simplest explanation on benefiting over trends ( Options ) than owning the stock. Rightly said, Rich people control everything but own nothing and Roberts shows with good real examples.Not the book to start understanding what Robert is trying to explain, but if you want to refresh all the concepts its a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"This book repeats itself so many times it becomes an annoyance. The book could have been written in about 50 pages. Really the mantra is: Own a business or real estate or stocks. Being employed is bad. Yep, got all that. It does manage to make you think about how truly aweful it is to be an employed toady, but like most books of this ilk there is very little there to help you get started. It read like a multi-level marketing meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiyosaki owes me 1 star","review":"Robert Kiyosaki does a disservice to his readers by presenting unrealistic scenarios of easy profits. If it truly were so easy, the deals would have been snapped up by now. His comments on stock tips, housing depreciation, and expensing watches and vacations as business costs are not only inaccurate, but ILLEGAL. His disdain for education is reflected in his poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Only Knew Fred","review":"Although I have not read Fritz and Etta Mae's book I encourage you to read \\"The Half Mile Miracle\\".

You can somewhat hold them in place and pull out the cork after the two side pieces break off (and trust me, it's 100% guaranteed that they will based on the construction of this model). But it's not worth your money. Screwpull apparently makes some better versions of this product. I bought it because two friends have one in red that they say has lasted for years. But when I looked at it recently, it's not the same construction as this piece of junk. Like so much else, this company seems to have designed later models to break so you'll replace it. I did replace, but with a different brand. It wasn't expensive.

This is the cheapest, easily breakable contraption I've ever bought from Amazon. It takes a lot of strength to push down and get the corkscrew going into the bottle and I thought I'd break it the first time. And also the two pieces don't even connect together, so it is super easy to lose the handle/screw part from the part that goes around the bottle's neck. There is no way to connect them for storage.

The warm-ups and techniques were superb. As an inter-disciplinary dancer, this did the trick. I learned sooo much and I have taken classes at FCBD. I haven't seen many more DVDs that really cover this amount of material and so thoroughly. I suggest you get this DVD and skip a lot of the rest. If you are a beginner, take your time. It will come.

And while all the songs are great and the lyrics bring me to tears, best of all...its the sound of Monica's voice.

But he has had no interest in this one, and I can't blame him. It made the whole process seem much more complicated than a 2 year old needs it to be. It raises questions that he wouldn't think of, and is really much more suited to an older child - who of course doesn't need potty training. For a toddler, it's all about accomplishment, like \\"I did it myself\\". The digestive process and waste water treatment, which are hinted at, are not where a toddler is focusing. There was no sense of a toddler's perspective in this.I have to agree with another reviewer, who thought this was simply a way to make more money off of the 'what to expect' series, which does include some very good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference for Parents - Not for Toddlers","review":"From the Word to Parents introduction to Angus the Answer Dog activities, Heidi Murkoff presents information on toilet training in a way that is both clever and comprehensive. But what would you expect from the author who also wrote What To Expect When You're Expecting, the must-read for mothers-to-be? Murkoff's potty book answers ten toddler questions about the process. Rather than read it to your toddler from cover to cover as you would a typical story book, keep it on hand as a quick reference guide. When your son asks \\"Where does poop go when you flush?\\" you can point to Laura Rader's colorful illustration of four flushing toilets leading to a big underground tank. Or when your daughter wonders how to wipe, try the activity Angus suggests and practice her technique on a doll.After reading over two dozen potty books, I think this is a good instructional guide. For similar book, read You Can Go to the Potty by Dr. Sears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very advanced","review":"I think by the time your child will understand this book he will be 6 yrs old and hoepfully potty trained!

When they have a question it can come in handy as a referance for the parent. By the time they are old enough to ask these questions they have conquered potty training.

It is written in a FAQ fashion, not as a story. It may be useful to parents who don't know what to say when their child asks about poop.

Along with the 13th Floor Elevators, The Sonics, The Balloon Farm, Love, The Lemon Drops, The Magic Mushrooms, Mouse & The Traps, and The Lollipop Shoppe they gave the underground world some of the best music of the time. Music that blows away plenty of the \\"hits\\" and well-known songs we all know so well. To bad limited exposure and poor promotion doomed many of these bands.This CD is a good overall listen to the work of the CWB. However, like the other reviewer states, not including \\"Let's Talk About Girls\\" is like putting out a KISS compliation without \\"Rock And Roll All Nite!\\" And, with NO LINER NOTES whatsover, it cheapens the experience a good bit. Check out \\"At The Love-In-Live\\" for a much better packaged disc that includes ALL the bands best songs!

How do the authors think readers can turn to this book to look up the syntax and usage of a function without an index to find it? I own a copy of the 2nd edition (that has an index) that is falling apart. This one is not useful for more than a paper weight unless you plan to read it like a novel.

The volume is huge, the coverage of topics much too broad, to warrant the name Core PHP Programming.XML and Generating Graphics are certainly not a core piece of any programming language. Core means syntax, grammar, concepts and the indispensable basics. A mere 100 pages covers eight (8) different databases. There are more than one thousand (1000+) pages in the book ! Database connectivity and processing is probably the single largest application of PHP. You won't learnd much here. The coverage of XML, for example, is similarly shallow. This is certainly not suitable as a textbook. A sad performance by two very important people in the PHP community. From him to whom is given, much is asked.

One not so positive note: I had hoped to help my husband enjoy the benefits of self-hypnosis by listening to the tape too. He started to listen and he couldn't stand the lady's accent. She has what appears to be a British accent. He thought it sounded snobby-just in case you don't like this accent you are forewarned.

This book could have been cut by at least 100 pages and still would have taken too long. Mr. McFarland would have done better to drop the attempt at intellectual symbolism and just get on with the ghosts. More words were wasted on the central character's life-long mistakes than the actual spookiness (ha, ha) at hand.

We paid $40 million for this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"unedited\\" version needs editing.","review":"This version of the Starr Report appears to have been printed directly from a download from the Internet. The problems are apparent, especially in the footnotes. For example, at one point an underline for \\"id.\\" causes ALL of the following footnotes in that section to be underlined. Also, the footnote numbering does not agree with the other two versions of the Starr Report, which are consistent with each other. These problems were no doubt due to the speed of publication, but they are distracting. Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that this is the most legible of the three versions of the Report, with large print and a clean font."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke","review":"Starr manages to waste our money and our time.

We share the hopes and dreams, the frustrations and despair of the first generation of Mexican immigrants, and the slow, steady drift of their children away from the barrio and into the mainstream culture of America. Funny and poignant by turn, these stories touch the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect a Lot","review":"Yes, this book is a warmly written and detailed chronicle of Mexican Americans in southern California. But it is more: a richly imagined and compassionate exploration of human aspiration. Houston-Davila's characters want what all of us want: love, home, a sense of meaning. Seeking these things in a transplanted, impoverished environment, the odds would seem stacked against them.But they succeed. Again and again, with humorous, bold and poignant leaps of faith. This book is a rare treat: enjoyable, yet good for you. It nourishes the soul, expands compassion and understanding of what it means to be human.The author has a rare ability to paint characters who are in a profound sense innocent, yet never insipid. He helps us see, through them, what really matters.While appreciating the author's unique insights into the culture and times of its characters, don't miss its deeper truths.Expect a lot from this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful collection of stories","review":"Reading Malinche's Children was a very humbling experience for me; I grew up in one of the \\"jewels\\" next to Carmelas, and attended Ramona School through 8th grade. In fact, I think the home my dad bought in 1955 might have been the very home that served as the development office mentioned in one of the stories. I didn't live in Carmelas, but I played there with friends, visited some of their homes, attended their birthday parties, fell for their sisters, bought candy at the Mexican Store, and even pulled a little red wagon down those dusty streets selling newspapers on Sunday morning when I was five years old.And still, I knew very little about their history, and their beliefs. Daniel Houston-Davila is a wonderful writer, and I thank him for each and every jewel he has written for this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stripped out immediately,","review":"Immediately upon attaching a blade with the little screw, it stripped out. No I did not over tighten. It's a poor design to begin with to expect the little screw and washers to hold the blade in place tight enough not to spin. If both center of the blade and the peg the blade slips on were square (anything but round) then it would not spin at least. Since I only needed these for a small one time job, I used a glue gun to hold the blade in place long enough to complete the simple job of cutting off a screwhead but it took a long time and i had to re-glue it a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"cut off wheels","review":"I bought these for a tile job for possible trimming when needed.I tried to use them on tile to grind 4 small lines into a square knock out for a small pipe.The tile laughed at it!!!!didn't do anything but over heat and melt the small nylon mounting washers.It may work on cheap soft ceramic tile but it didn/t work on the material i was using."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"these work great! i use them to cut through glass and they seem to be doing really well. unfortunately there are these fiber washers that come with it and the 2nd time i used these with the washers put in, the washers seem to just about had it. i had to buy new ones but couldn't find the same ones so i bought different ones that hopefully hold up better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 1\\"x1\\" mosaic glass tile work...","review":"Good quality item.

If I hadn't been a psychology major in college, I would have been completely lost if I had been relying on this book alone.

I'm sure I was faster and more confident taking the GRE because of this book, and being relaxed probably helped me pull a better score.The math section is terrible. I had to pull out my stats textbook for a proper review.There were some sections where I wanted to argue with the book because I thought it was simplifying matters so much that they were misrepresented. That's always going to be the case with reviews, but you'll still want to think critically about what you're reading.Overall, I'd say it was a very good use of my time and money.P.S.

If you prefer strict word-pair memorization as a method of study, Cracking the GRE is fine. But if you're like me, and find it easier to remember a term if you feel you understand the term's full meaning, go with the Kaplan book. It just has way more information, which really helps me remember things.Don't get me wrong, this book will probably help you score more points on the test, but I feel the Kaplan book helped me much more.

Expected better quality.","review":"I purchased the DW317 This saw is not good enough to justify $105 with tax or the bonus sander to boot. The motor runs good its a bit noisy. The black plastic for the orbiting settings seems cheap. It is very unfortunate that the saw's shoe base vibrates out of adjustment because it has no notches or indentations for pre set angles. The saw base also has a huge slotted bolt head making it very difficult to tighten and loosen. Customers will need to file or grind a very wide screwdriver thicker for it. The included T shank style blade can be pulled out with finger tip strength alone. This saw will however securely hold the U shank blades rock solid and only let go when the blade release is pulled. Finally the saw does not cut straight with a good blade in it. The blade holder has side to sided movement almost 1/8\\" on a new saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wandering blade","review":"This is a very disapointing tool (and was my last dewalt miss fortune).It is very hard to do a straight cut wihtout having the blade wandering.

I'm left handed, and the blade lock is on the left side of the handle. The button is convex, so everytime I tried the saw the blade would lock in a running position. Funny, but the contractor's model (which is about $30 more) has a concave button which doesn't cause issue. Apparently Dewalt values the fingers of contrators more than do-it-yourselfers.

When I did finally get the blade to stay in it long enough to try and make a cut, the saw wouldn't even cut a straight line.Needless to say I took the POS back to Lowe's and bought a Porter-Cable saw that was $10 cheaper after reading reviews about it (on my iPhone while standing in the Lowe's store).

Besides 4 or 5 songs (including \\"Yitho Umlilo Ovuthayo,\\" \\"Sohlabelelu Hosana,\\" & \\"Jesus Is My Leader\\") this album is total bore.

That's why I was so disappointed when I opened the package I received from this seller. The incense box was already open, and the sticks appear to be VERY old and degraded. Half of the material has fallen off most of the sticks, and they appear to be mostly dry.Because it is very obvious that the seller knew this when they packaged the incense (open box, contents literally falling out), I will definitely not be making another purchase from them.

Even if you've never smelled it, once you do you'll recognize it as familiar. It's popular and it's ubiquitous but the problem is that the product just isn't good anymore. At least not like it once was. The formula was changed a few years ago and now, when burned, Satya Nag Champa smells nothing like it does out of the box. There's nothing of the sweet, creamy, spicy and herbal scent once you light it. Now it just smells like sweetened burned wood, even in a well-ventilated space. It's a shame, because even though there are several alternatives that have a truer, purer champa aroma, none of them really comes close to replicating this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sai Baba","review":"Nag Champa might very well be the premier incense maker in the world.

Great product,fair price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Has Gone Down HIll","review":"I have been a user of this incense for about 10 years, burning at least one stick a day. Quality has always been impeccable until now. After purchasing two 250 gram boxes (both dated 2012), it almost seems as though it is different incense. There are two major issues I have noted with the 2012 runs of this product:1) 90% of the sticks wont stay lit. I sometimes need to relight them 2 or 3 times, even.2) The smell is not the same. It often smells like wood burning rather than nag champa. My guess is, the company is using more sawdust for it's base then it did in the past.I am sad to say that after a decade of using this product daily, I am going to have to find a new incense to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fewer Sticks Now","review":"The last time I ordered this, Amazon sent me a bunch of little boxes of Nag Champa instead of one big box, which is what I had always received in the past. Apparently the big boxes aren't being made any more, and so Amazon is making a substitution. I took out the sticks and counted (and it's a big pain opening all those little boxes and pouches), and there were a little less than 200 sticks, where the big boxes were always more like 225 to 250 sticks. So it's also a big rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best incense on the planet","review":"As far as I am concerned this is, by far, the best smelling incense on the planet and I simply cannot live without it.I always recommend it to others.

Beware if you're sensitive to sound or are using it in a quiet environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a great fan for the first 6 months.","review":"After 6 months, the rotating feature stopped working. Then the fan motor got weak and we had to take a long object to kick start the blades, and finally after about 1 year, the fan died. A fan that expensive should last longer than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan With Options!","review":"My friend had purchased this fan from a local retailer. When visiting, I loved the quietness of the fan and so I went on a hunt and found it here at Amazon. The fan actually has options, there is the straight normal fan, there is a breeze option which fluctuates the air flow and direction and best of all, there is a remote control for all the options and for turning it off and on. My only disappointment is that for some reason my fan is not as quiet as my friends, just normal fan sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fan for all rooms","review":"This is a light weight box fan that is very easy to move from place to place.

I wanted to use it on top of my dresser, but it takes up too much room. If you put it on the floor, it doesn't direct the air where I want it. I would give it a better review if it was quieter. I do like the remote control feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fan...but \\"goofy\\" operation","review":"The only reason I didn't give this fan 5 stars is because figuring out all the buttons is a bit much. You can set everything to high, but then it will run high, then run low, then run high again. We have yet to figure out the right combination of selections. But, it does work remarkably well - better than any box fan we've ever owned. If you can find a good deal, it's definately worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blizzard","review":"Holmes is suppose to be good, but in this case I think they forgot to put the blizzard in the machine.

Although McKeown's voice is at time awash in reverb, and there are some synthesizer lines in the background, the overall feel of this music is acoustic in nature, with a dazzling variety of instruments, and handsomely recorded. The tunes are mainstream Celtic, sung in McKeown's clear, unaffected voice. For those who enjoy Irish/Celtic music with a bit of a world music twist, this CD is warmly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ginsu Slicer","review":"Not what I expected I have another I have had for years this is not the same much heavier and teeth of knife not very long or indented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Ginsu Slicer 9 Inch Knife","review":"Wonderful knife, they are the best on the planet.

Some stitches ripped the first time I put the cowl /cape piece on, even though I wasn't particularly rough with it.Don't buy it unless you're desperate for a cheap Space Ghost costume.

I found it very useful. The hands on training in the form of color tutorials was very useful for learning flash. This book is only an introduction to flash as is shown by the fact that you only learn how to use preexisting Actionscript rather than program your own code. Also, the new version of flash (CS3) uses a different version of Action Script so what you learn here will not be useful. Still, this book is more than adequate even for the new version of flash.

It is a great book and I am happy the teacher recommended it.The chapters are arranged in easy to follow exercises that teach all the basics of Flash. I really liked this style of teaching because it forces you to open up Flash and do the exercises. Much more useful than a book that you just sit and read.The author of the book is also very good about telling you multiple ways of doing something. In the course of the exercises there are little colored boxes that will talk about how you could have done the above action this way or this way or this way. The fact that these tips are usually separate is nice if you don't care and want to skip the additional information.So far I am about 3/4 the way through the course and the book and have been very happy with it.

From the description I was expecting the book to focus on the people of Iran. The book is mostly about how Hobson got around in Iran. The lengthy description of her journey into the mountains on an old moped put me to sleep. Hobson's views on Iran are also generalized and out of date. I was hoping her book would give insight on what it is like to travel through Iran as a Westerner, but she just keeps rambling on about how difficult it was to keep pretending to be a boy. I was also dismayed at the way she lied to get into religious sites closed to women and carelessly violated many of the cultural codes.She thought her own curiosity was more important than respecting the culture of Iran( which she claims to admire) I would recommend almost any book in the world over this one. With people like Sarah Hobson on the loose I'm amazed that English travelors are still allowed to set foot in other countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, it's ok.

This is total 80's trash but that alone makes it perfect for some low brow entertainment. A film this bad deserves wacky commentary from the viewers, Ala \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\". It's a total winner in that regard. I guess Gene Simmons wasn't winning any Oscars with this role but Ozzy Osbourne's role as a preacher is funny enough because you could still understand him then. You shouldn't have to pay for this dvd, they should pay you instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard '80's teen horror fare","review":"Not much to be said for \\"Trick Or Treat\\", really. It's a dumbed-down little artifact that may provide some mindless time killingfor aging baby boomers (nostalgia factor) and 10 year olds. Nota dvd for horror fans as there is absolutely nothing scary orsuspenseful going on here. On the up side, it's not awful as faras '80's teen fodder goes, and is actually a notch or two abovemost of what this genre was offering. There are a few laughs tobe found here and there, not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it when I was 12...","review":"I was a heavy metal fan and a horror fan, but even back then, this movie was a 2 star product at best, except for one shining segment.

What a Kick A** movie.Me and my wife watch this DVD as a love for metal music I still get this flim. My wife is a fan of 80s horror. When the movie was over I ask her how she like it and she said it was o.k. I told her this is the way the music was look at and how it was treated back then.For any new fan out there, I think this is a must see.

He was given a tape that when played backwards, tells him how to kill. The movie had a few good speical effects but other then that, this was a lame throw away 80's horror movie.

The thing that got me is that it arrived already broken in one corner and peeling all over the seams. I have contacted the seller and will get back to you on how this is handled.Over all, though the sign (would) be cute, it's not exactly a 'steal', a little pricey for just one sign.

It is for that reason, I'm guessing, that they decided to compromise their artistic integrity so that they could sign a record deal. After seeing the band perform numerous times before their huge hiatus and then a few times after I can't help but feel sorry for them. It's the almighty dollar at play. I think they need to unplug themselves from the money and greed and get themselves back to what really matters. the great music they once made. I gave the album one star for Keith's brave performance on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Vertical Horizon is a talented group, but their music is too generic. My husband is a big fan of their group, but I think their songs sound too much like all the other songs that are out there on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typifies the bland","review":"Theoretically this could be a good album. In fact, if you liked the recent outings by Del Amitri, Tal Bachman, and so many other artists you hear on Adult Contemporary radio, you'll probably enjoy it. This album typifies all of that. The problem is, we've heard all of this so many times before. There's nothing here that's groundbreaking. Sure, it was great in 1992 when Del Amitri recorded this album and called it \\"Change Everything.\\" But if I want to hear that album, I'll just put it on, and not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This is not groundbreaking lyrically or musically. Upon initial listen, the potential for something with talent appears to be heard, but then nothing ever happens. The songs are of tired issues and the musicianship is clean but very forgettable. Do not waste money on a \\"derivitive\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff from Start to Finish","review":"When I think of totally solid albums I have to start with Who's Next by the Who and Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. What made these albums so outstanding was that they had great music from the first cut to the last: a monumental rarity. Vertical Horizon has accomplished this Everest like feat with Everything You Want. All too many times we buy albums for one to two good songs and the rest is filler. Not here. Yes they do sound somewhat like REM. I consider that high praise. Another Automatic for the People isn't such a bad thing is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Everything I Wanted","review":"I bought this CD quite a few weeks ago and was greatly dissapointed. I had heard the song \\"Everything You Want\\" on the radio and liked it. I bought the CD and listened to it.....let's just say I didn't care much for it at all. It's probably just because it really isn't my kind of music.....but even so the songs are pretty generic and redundent. Especially \\"You're a God.\\" I regreat spending money on it. It's my own fault, but I thought I should let some people know so they won't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike any artist I've ever heard.","review":"I found this album to have the right mixture of rockin' songs and slow songs. The lyrics seemed as if to come straight from the heart and be very sincere. You can tell from reading the lyrics and hearing the songs that Vertical Horizon definetly knows what they're doing. With their first single \\"We Are\\" on the charts, I think we'll be seeing more of them in the future. If you like their album, you should definetly check out their live shows. Definetly an experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I have been a fan of this band since 1995 when I randomly heard Runnin on Ice in a store. This was back when they were an acoustic rock band with great songs and musicianship. Now, with this newest album and their big time record deal, you can see that this was the work of a big studio making a great band average. They sound now like any other band on the radio and they have all but lost the sound from their previous albums. I hope that this is not the permanent thing with Vertical Horizon because I do love their other stuff, just not any of the stuff on this album. My plea to the band is to not sell out, there is something to be said for great song writing and having a unique sound. If you like great, heart-felt music, check out There and Back Again, Runnin on Ice, or Live Stages, not this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may like it","review":"Vertical Horizon is a good name for a band, especially when the band's become that popular. The name now means really much for everybody, but does their music?It's very nice, and professionally made, and impresses with some catchy tunes and almost smart lyrics, but does this music have its deepness and meaningness to sound really impressive and memorable? I would doubt it.The standouts on the cd are definitely We Are, You're a God and Shackled, these are a piece of a beautiful pop-rock. The rest are a good standard pop music, sometimes awesome, sometimes boring, the routine pop stuff, in short.If you're into a pop music, you'll love this. If you prefer slightly harder or more serious tunes - you may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love every track even after 10 years","review":"Windows Media Player ranks all the songs as 3 stars :((I only listen to a few CD's from the past but this is one of them. Also, my 17 and 22 year old sons LOVE this CD. I also like Weezer from this time frame.GOTTA LISTEN!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that an Airforce Term?","review":"I loved the first 5 tracks of this CD, but after that, well it's all the same and certainly not worth the price I paid for it! I was very disappointed after hearing their first hits. I would certainly not recommend this CD unless you like hearing something like country over and over. Well, anyway, the first five tracks are okay. Take your chances, it's your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted","review":"I just switched which radio station I listen to recently (I listen to just about anything-classic, rock, country, folk, whatever else you can imagine). One of the first songs that I really liked was \\"Everything you want\\" It's really what hooked me. I also really liked \\"You're a god\\" and \\"best I ever had\\". It wasn't until last week, when I was trying to figure out who sang them, that I realized they were all by the same group! I thought \\"wow! These people are awesome!!!\\" and bought the CD figuring if I loved the only 3 songs I'd heard, I'd like the rest of the CD. I was right! My favorite song is probably \\"We Are\\", but they're all really awesome. I can't believe this whole time I've had a favorite band I didn't even know about!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album.","review":"This is a great album. The songs are all very well written and well performed. Everything you want; You're a God; and The Best I Ever Had are some of the best songs that I have ever heard. They are truly memorable. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes alternative music because alternative does not get much better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call it what it is - their big breakthrough.","review":"If \\"selling out\\" and \\"abandoning the grassroots\\" is how highly talented, immensely listenable bands like Vertical Horzion hit the big time, well, I just wish it'd happen more often. This is, quite simply, beautiful music. There's been so much baggage hung on the whole alternative music, it's refreshing to see a return to the basics of harmonious composition and great singing. There isn't a bad moment anywhere, not one bit of sappiness, annoyance, boredom, insufferability, or any other of the failings that have doomed countless promising albums. In a nutshell, if you love music, this album quite literally has everything you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the best","review":"I just recently received the Vertical Horizon CD from Amazon.com about a week ago and I have been listening to nothing but it ever since. This CD is one of those rare ones you find with more than 1 or 2 good songs on it, this one has like 10 good songs that you don't mind listening to after your favorite song is finished.

You gotts to get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding CD demonstrates band's maturity and talent","review":"As a long time fan of VH, I've watched them develop and mature as musicians, and this CD represents a quantum leap for them. Matt and Keith's songwriting skills remain as strong as ever, and Ed and Sean have added excellent depth and breadth to their sound. Complaints that EYW is \\"over-produced\\" or that the old VH passion is gone are off-base. Just listen to \\"Send It Up,\\" \\"You're A God\\" or \\"Shackled\\" to hear the powerful passion that has always defined the band. What's new is the improved production quality and the subtlety of the mixing. The boys have matured, and their music has too. This record will be the breakthrough they have long deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"If you like music with a little bit more of the edge than most so far, than you need this CD. I tend to find myself skipping tracks on CDs, and buying CDs for one or two songs. On this however, I bought it for the great content beyond the main two singles on it. It's a great CD and if you would like a new CD, stop reading this review and BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"ok, we're ALL tired of hearing \\"Everything You Want\\" they play that song every hour on the hour here on the radio stations. so if you like Vertical Horizon, and you liked \\"Everything You Want\\" when it was popular, then check out #2 \\"You're A God\\". it's more upbeat, and it talks about a guy liking someone, but the person he liked was so perfect that he thought he wasn't good enough for them, so it was just better for him not to be with them. and i've noticed alot of Vertical Horizon's songs on their newest CD talk about heartbreak. when they make a song that talks about a GOOD relationship, i'll give it a GOOD review."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"ok i'm not denying that this album has great songs but for god's what's all the great hype about ! there are some songs that are worthy of buying this album, still all the songs have a thing which i hate, the chorus \\"IS\\" the song, there are few lyrics in one song and it lacks emotion, all they do is keep the rhyming. & they tend to make the chorus words long (like, weeeee arrrrrrre) & repeat that til the song ends or whatever.it's catchy music but you get bored of it too soon, i was taken away with the whole thing i admit & if i wrote this review 2 months ago i would've given it more than 5 stars. if you liked the singles (a lot) then you like the rest of the album, just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Has Happened to the VH I Once Knew?","review":"I am a fan of VH's from the old school. Their first 3 albums captivated me and lead me to see them in spectacular live performances several times. Upon hearing their new release, \\"Everything You Want\\", I was very, very disappointed. It lacks the straight-forwardness and complexity of their previous recordings; in other words, it seems they have begun to mock the awful \\"popular\\" sound you hear so much on the radio. You think they would have learned from the demise of their friends in Jackopierce. Unfortunately, they didn't and may fall to the same fate...I would think it's for the better at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, boring pop","review":"Mindless angst-ridden drivel.

This whole cd is ful of songs that you will love. Vertical horizon has got every aspect of talent, looks, sound, lyrics. It's one of my few cd's that I can listen to the whole thing, and actually enjoy the whole cd. This band is just absolutely awesome. I can't even compare this band to anyone really. they have thier own style, but their music is good- from track 1 - all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan of Rock!","review":"I purchased this album after hearing \\"We Are\\" and \\"Everything You Want\\" on the local Top-40 radio here in Rochester. Vertical Horizon has a sound that is becoming quite rare in today's mix of teen-pop, and rap. Although it's good to finally hear good music on the radio, \\"Everything You Want\\" is far from the best song on the album. \\"Miracle\\", and \\"Shackled\\" are particularly brilliant.In all honesty, I was very pleased with \\"Everything You Want\\". At first, I thought it was \\"OK\\". However, after spending some time really listening to it and reading the lyrics, I've grown to love this album. The insightful lyrics and superb musicianship are a welcome change from everything else that's out there right now.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome cd!","review":"When I heard \\"Everything You Want\\" on the radio, I previewed the other songs, and realized that I had to have this cd.

You won't be able to stop playing this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD you don't have to skip songs on!","review":"I love this CD, the last CD I bought was Third Eye Blind, which we like, but not like this one. I heard Everything you Want in traffic, waited for the band name, wrote it down while driving, went to Amazon, previewed it and liked what I heard. ( isn't it great to listen to snippets of the music before you buy?)I wasn't that keen on their other album This one though has got the potential for all of the songs to be Top Ten. So enjoyable to listen to, somehow they manage to not sound the same, and I love the thoughtful and interesting lyrics. Having good lyrics also makes this alot of fun to sing with .I can not remember the last time I bought music this good. Any age could love this one! Get it. If for some weird reason you don't love it, all your friends will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brink of stardom","review":"If you've only heard their radio singles then you haven't heard the best of Vertical Horizon. This is a very solid CD, well worth buying, especially now that it is cheap. The first 7 tracks are all excellent as well as the album closer shackled. If you like quality melodic rock music, you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"i bought this cd a couple days ago because i had heard \\"everything you want\\" on the radio and i fell in love with it. the first time i listened to the whole cd, i skipped through most of the middle tracks. they got sort of repetitive and boring. the song that i have listened to over and over again is \\"shackled,\\" #11. it has a completely different vibe than the rest of the tunes- more rock instead of pop. and there's a different lead vocalist (the guitarist?) anyway, if you're into the pop stuff, you'll like most of the tracks, most of them have radio hit potential. my favorites are tracks #1, #3, #11. enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par at all","review":"Far be it for me to criticize musical creativity. If this is where the band wants to go, OK. However, what I enjoyed from the first 3 albums was tremendous creative guitar playing, creative poetry and outstanding singing (especially the harmonies). The new album still has good lyrics, but the formula musical mix and much heavier distortion drowns out the musicality. What's with the voice? Did Matt get replaced with a grungie? This may be part of getting a deal with Sony, but is not a memorable album by any means. Glad I have the first 3 albums. They get played all the time. Just hope the next one is a bit more accoustic and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I was a huge Vertical fan and loved their music....but when i listened to EYW, I couldn't believe it was Vertical Horizon....did they go to Jackopierce school during their hiatus?...the songs are far from original (listen to Jackopierce's Finest Hour, which itself is another bad album), Matt's voice sounds more like a Backstreet Boy than his previous rich baritone, and the lyrics are honest, but too sing-songy.....How can one lose artistic integrity so fast....perhaps the money...needless to say, a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"from folk-rock to buble gum","review":"This band has completely sold out to the commercial music industry.

Although I'm more inclined to listen to hard rock, \\"Everything You Want\\" delivers in each and every aspect of musical creativity. With its soaring ballads, raucous rockers and addictive chouruses, this masterpiece stands above the rest of the crowd by virtue of its great harmonies and musical chemsitry. If you like this album, I recommend you get \\"Live Stages\\", which is essentially a greatest hits of their earlier work. I also recommend seeing them live; they put on an awesome show! To find out when the band will be playing in your backyard, visit their official website, \\"Vertical Horizon.com\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album from an incredible band!","review":"I got the chance to see Vertical Horizon live this past summer, and I must say, they are INCREDIBLE live!!!!!!!!!!!! You DO NOT know V.H. till you've seen them in concert! Anyway, this cd is their debut as a big electric alternative band(They used to be an acoustic folk rock duo), and what a fabolous debut it is! Everything You Want is no-where NEAR the best song on here- theres so many others- We Are, You're A God, Best I Ever Had, Finding Me, i could go on forever! Definitely a must-add to any alternative collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto the DC guy","review":"Check the comments of the first guy to review the CD--he's right on.

What are you waiting for? Get this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs now. I like 10 of the 11 songs on it. (the one I don't really like is the 4th song: Best I Ever Had) Other than that song, the rest of them are excellent. My favorites are We Are, Everything You Want, You Say, and Miracle. I had never heard of Vertical Horizon until I heard their song Everything You Want on the radio, now I can't stop listening to them! This CD is for you if you like Third Eye Blind, REM, Matchbox 20, and other bands like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want the old VH back","review":"This CD sounds like Matchbox 20 or Third Eye Blind, but I remember the previous CDs in which they sounded like Dave Matthews and Jackopierce. This CD has some good catchy songs, but none are even close to the quality of songs on the albums \\"There and Back Again\\" or \\"Running on Ice\\". It seems that on the \\"Everything you Want\\" album, that Keith Kane is taking the back seat and Matt has taken the driver seat, because all except one song was written by Matt. I don't know what came to them with this cd now they have a full band. I loved it when they were an acoustic duo....so if you like this cd, you should check out the older ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I Loved this CD. It is great! I would recommend it to anyone! Everything you want is a TERRIFIC song. I Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VH changing sound not a winner with all fans","review":"This new record is exactly the kind of music one hears on the radio. It's fairly catchy, poppy, simple, un-passionate music. For the radio, it's a fine album. But it's a big departure for VH. Matt Scannell and Keith Kane used to share writing responsibilities, but on EYW, Kane has only one song, which in fact is the most passionate and original (\\"Shackled\\"). The rest of the record outside of a few nice tunes, \\"We Are,\\" \\"Everything You Want,\\" is just Scannell's over produced vocals and lots of electric guitar. Kane's role is diminished as Scannell is the complete front man. if you like VH's older material, this record is not for you. but if you like stuff you hear on the radio which is four chords, repetative lyrics, few harmonies and a lot of electric guitar, this will do you fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"One legendary song and 10 recycled pop radio 'hits'.","review":"Ok, I must have missed the boat here. This group has talent... but they're not using it. If these guys put their minds to it, they could be a good band. There's only one thing that makes this album worthwhile - the very last song, Shackled... a song worthy of 6 or more stars all in itself (this one song justifies buying the album, even though the rest of it is horrible). If the rest of the album were along those lines, there wouldn't be enough stars on amazon to describe it. The other 10 songs sound like 80's pop guitars with REM vocals... bad combination. I noticed that Shackled was written by the guitarist (Kane, I think), who pulled vocal duty on the song as well. I hope he goes solo, or takes the band over, because the current singer is going absolutely nowhere, considering that he wrote the other 10 songs. Altogether, it wasn't a total waste... but prepare to be disappointed if you're looking for quality alternative music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang the DJ","review":"I don't know. I really don't like this. I don't think this really sounds like REM. I think this is safe, middle of the road stuff that might appeal to fans of Jewel. It's not the worst thing I heard all year though. If you would like a good melodic, mellow band with good songwriting, listen to Belle and Sebastian or The Continental Drifters. Sorry, this doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely irrefutable documentation","review":"John Hantz's review is right on the money where it always has been!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent effort but needs more texture","review":"While I liked the hit \\"Everything You Want\\" just from radio play, I didn't buy it until I was in the store and decided to give the album a listen on the headphones. I stood there for the entire album (something I rarely do)! That is a sign to buy if there ever was one.This is an enjoyable album and seems to hold up with repeated listens but I wish there was more variety in the songs. The slow \\"Best I Ever Had\\" is especially well placed to change the pace. I was quite impressed by the last track \\"Shackled\\" by the other guitarist/singer, Keith Kane. I wish he had more tracks on this album since his voice is just different enough to add a needed alternate texture to the album.That said, this is still a great CD to own. The songs have catchy hooks and they really grow on you. I'll be keeping an eye on this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you want? YEP","review":"Bought the CD for just the one song...Everything You Want...and to my surprise, I enjoyed all the songs. The tunes were nothing like your average alternative music.

I love it.If you like rock and roll it's the cd to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great CD for any kind of music listener","review":"After hearing EYW on the radio I fell in love with it and couldn't get it out of my head, I think that the song describes love between opposites (but that's my opinion)anyways I found out that this song was by a group named Vertical Horizon so I got the album and loved practically all the songs, I loved the lead singers vocals and the guitars were tight! My whole family liked this album including my cousin who usually likes rap hip hop and R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertical's Horizons are widening...","review":"\\"Everything you Want\\", the latest from Vertical Horizon, offers the pop rock listener an offbeat and interesting mix of music. With the release of the hit self-titled single, the band has hit mainstream running, exposing the scene to their milder and more eclectic style. Though they may not break ground with originality or unprecedented musicality, they are the epitome of the lilting college radio rock that is always good to keep around. Decent instrumentation highlighted by introspective lyrics, with a twist of studio synthesization frames the foundation Vertical Horizon stems from. Lines like, \\"Don't tell me how to be, 'cause I like some suffering...\\" (from \\"Finding Me\\") just stick into your head and help support the addictive nature this band's music insights...Other delicious songs include \\"You're a God\\", \\"Miracle\\", and \\"Best I ever Had\\". Just a great everyday album that will never explode, but burn steadily for years to come... enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could","review":"After seeing Vertical Horizon in concert, I decided I -had- to have their CD. I've got to pat myself on the back for making that decision. Honestly, each track on this CD is my favorite. I love their diverse sound, ranging from the Top 40ish \\"Everything You Want\\" to the tear-jerking \\"Best I Ever Had.\\" It's one of the few CDs you can own for a year and still love as much as the day you brought it home."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is Everything You Could EVER Want!","review":"After hearing \\"Everything You Want\\" I immediately bought this CD and since then, it hasn't left my CD player. Vertical Horizon offers amazing beats, clean lyrics, and plenty of deeper messages than most artists today have. The group has re-defined the music scene and has come a long way from their original \\"There and Back Again\\". I guarantee that if you compare Vertical Horizon to any other so-called \\"musicians\\" they will be the ones that are still listened to and remembered decades from now. If I still can't convince you, check out their web site, and listen to the songs for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you Everything He Wants?","review":"Vertical Horizon is a spectacular band that I have been following for the last two years. Over the past two years, I have followed closely in detail each word and guitar chord. The music that Matt Scannell and the rest of Veritcal Horizon express is extremly emotional. The CD \\"Everything You Want\\" is not only beautifully spun, but also the lyrics are meaningful and give advice within themselves. In each song there are words expressing how \\"Love can be so boring, or \\"How they remember the girl which leaves them down and lonely.\\" Vertical Horizon makes their music real and helps you to intensify your listening skills. So, next time you're out and about, don't forget to purchase this amazingly thoughtful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything YOU want!","review":"I saw Vertical Horizon for the first time live last year at a concert at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. Before this I only knew Vertical Horizon from the recent radio play. They absolutely blew me away at the concert and I have been hooked ever since! There latest Album \\" Everything You Want\\" is incredible. Once you hear the songs you'll be hooked! From the upbeat song \\"We Are\\" to emotional \\"Best I Ever Had\\" Vertical Horizon gives music fans what they really want. There album is not like all the new music that is out there now. They have there own style and have a variety of music styles on all their albums. Trust me purchase this album and you will not be sorry. I guarantee you'll instantly be hooked to their music and come back to buy there other albums. This is definitely a purchase you won't be sorry you made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb effort for VH","review":"This cd has the depth and meaning that most artists never seem to reach in their careers. Their style and sound is somehow similar to R.E.M. But somehow it leaves you more inspired than R.E.M.The Explosive entry of We Are, sets the cd off right. Then the frustration of You're A God hooks you and makes you want more. That leads right into Everything You Want. If you haven't heard it by now, then you are probably very lucky. It was overplayed, like most songs, but if you look past that then it is a great song about failed romance. The real gem of this cd is next. Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning). The slow sad melodic voice of Matt Scannel. You Say is another great song. Finding Me is another great song that catches the mood. Another favorite of mine is All Of You. It seems to almost catch you off guard but it sounds great.Overall, A great cd that merits a good listen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Is Brilliant","review":"An absolutely superb album. Worth the money. I am more into rock, but this is more alternative rock and its good. Its a very good easy listening album, and it has those great choruses which stick in your mind for the rest of the day. My personal favourites are 'Send It Up' and 'Miracle'. Both brilliant songs, especially to sing along to, but all of them are good. Its a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO MANY GREAT SONGS!","review":"Vertical horizon's cd Everything You want has many hits that you hear on the radio all the time. After you listen to these songs over and over again you find that all of the songs are great and you start listening to the whole cd and you will love every song. This is a great cd and you will never get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you need","review":"After two independent albums and one live album, Vertical Horizon came back in 2000 with their major label debut Everything You Want. And that is a very suitable title for this album because this album is 46 minutes of good quality music, which is what anyone would want.The beginning of the album is mostly songs you've all heard already: the catchy title track, the infectious \\"You're A God\\", and the mellow \\"Best I Ever Had\\". But don't skip out on the rest of the album. There are also funky tunes like \\"Send It Up\\" and \\"All Of You\\", as well as soft rockers like \\"Give You Back\\".I don't know if I can honestly pick a favorite track on this album, but for right now I'll have to say \\"Send It Up\\" and \\"Best I Ever Had\\". Actually, every time you listen to this album, you'll find a new favorite. This album is really that good. Add it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Song","review":"I got interested in Vertical Horizon when I heard \\"Everything You Want\\" and ended up enjoying every song.

Congratulations to the band for finally busting out on the musio scene. If you like their release, Everything You Want, the rest of the tracks will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everything You Want\\"...the title says it all","review":"Fantastic CD! Every song on EYW is packed with powerful lyrics (well sung, too) and killer guitar riffs that will inhabit your head for weeks, especially the title track. This release is the one that made Vertical Horizon famous...and after listening to it you can definitely see why!It may take a few listens to fully appreciate some of the songs. Shackled at track 11 is weird at first, but stick with it because it is a brilliant song. If you've ever heard Everything You Want (the song) and gone, \\"hey, that's not bad\\" then you absolutely MUST get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2 stars. ALMOST A PERFECT CD.","review":"I hate N'Sync, Backstreet Boys, and Five. But there's just something special about Vertical Horizon that I love. Their music is beautiful and very moving, especially track # 4: \\"Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning)\\". Some of the singing is a bit cheesy, but the music is so beautiful that I can't help but like it. Vertical Horizon are awesome at making feel-good music. Sure, a lot of the songs on this CD are about love, but the music is very soothing to listen to. I bought this CD at Wal-Mart on my birthday last year, and it was worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"How could anybody give this album less than five stars?

The result is not just good listening but its makes for a recording that's an invaluable study aid for anyone who's trying to learn this material. Since the 48 are not just pieces of music but Bach's demonstration of styles and keyboard technique -- something that Dr. Roberts seems to understand very well -- you end up with a lot more than some CDs, a plastic case and a few sleeve notes......if you could only figure it all out, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice!","review":"I picked this CD set, totally relying on the reviews underneath, and I came to absolutely agree with other reviewers when listening to it.

Yogiraj brings forth a destined classic filled with deep revelations from the Himalayan Nath Yogis as well as many fascinating stories of his life. The stories of his experiences with these Yogi's is fantastic and most thrilling is his experience with the great Mahavatar Babaji (mentioned in Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi). I also found some compelling new wisdom in this book like detailed descriptions of the states of Samadhi along with some interesting information explaining the difference between the various levels of Enlightened Beings. While being filled with great wisdom, I did find a typo here or there in the book, but I think this is the first edition of the book. Anyway, a must read! Highly recommended!

The good thing is I didn't face any problem playing the disk in my player, as reported by some others. The storyline is okay but I found it's kinda boring sometimes. If you think about HD, the PQ is not up to the standard in my opinion. Most of time it's actually hardly distinguishable from the standard definition version. The close-up scenes are okay but the long shots are as blurry as 90's movies. Night scenes are grainy but not so bad that you will feel like skipping the chapter. The gap between two chapters could be shorter as well. So, in the end, if you already have it in SD, then HD not really worth it.

I think most people can relate to poor JoBeth Williams: trapped in a dead-end life, the only escape through the powers of her own creativity. The only person Cathy Palmer (Williams) admires is Rebecca Ryan, the outrageous heroine of a series of spy adventure novels. When Cathy wakes up after being struck by a car, she finds herself at the center of a frenetic Rebecca Ryan mystery. But is it real? The plot gets thicker, deeper, and zanier as the film goes along, but never steps over the boundary into absurdity. Plus, it manages to poke fun at every spy movie cliche to ever come out of Hollywood. Tom Conti is brilliant as the hapless, unwilling accomplice to Cathy's mad adventure. A must for romantics and adventurers at heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Dreamer","review":"I love this movie. I've watched it over and over, and never get tired of it. There's always something about it that I never noticed before, because it is so fast paced and action packed.

WHAT A PAIN!!! This is partly due to the inharently bad communication between the Palm Platform, and the windows platform. You could say that if your desk top were a large storage closet, then your Palm Piolet would at best be a small odds-n-ends drawer.

It is the reason i never go to a concert. I prefer my music pure and not adjusted for an audience. I always check to make sure not to buy live albums and this one said nothing about the songs being from concerts but many were, albeit not all.

A friend of mine sells CDs and goes to a lot of trouble to see to it that they sound good, and doesn't want to sell MP3s, and you refuse to allow sound-clips without the MP3 business: clearly you can do business any way you like, so you have to insist that the distributors/record companies provide you with adequate information, and make it available to your customers.

It was just a sad, depressing little book, but, I must admit, it did hold my interest (though mostly I felt like I was waiting for something good to FINALLY happen...) and it certainly drew out emotions (melancholic emotions).

This one was recommended in a book review, and I wish I'd skipped both. The stories of the individuals with whom Timoleon, the titular subject, crosses paths, are sympathetically described, but there is not enough about them or their futures to be satisfying. And Timoleon's fate is just too heartbreaking for an animal lover. Skip this book if you are at all tender-hearted."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapola","review":"While I did like the writing style and method of story telling I must say that the book was weak at best. It isn't about love or rejection as some reviews have suggested - it's about a pitiful man who hates himself. The stories suggest that his gayness is akin to the other character's physical abnormalities. Weaknesses that inevitably lead to ruin and isolation. The characters are not self aware or self actualized but instead weak, ignorant and beyond pity. I was very disappointed and think the book and the positive reviews are a bunch of crap! Lots of typos in the book too (did I make any?) - that's a sign of course of poor editing, but also overall poor quality to me. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Downer, Bad and Cruel!!","review":"Oh my gosh -- this book is a piece of crap and the ending is typical, uncreative, cruel, and unnecessary. And it's used just for a simple effect: to try and make the reader feel as if there was a reason that they invested so much time into reading this waste of a book.Note to author: your trick didn't work and I've never been so angry and frustrated by a book's failure to deliver.Don't believe the hype and praise of the book on its back cover. I'm sure the quotes (such as \\"the best new writer in Britain...\\") are used out of context. The full sentence probably reads, \\"the best new writer in Britain who has written an incredibly disappointing book that is far below what is expected of his talent.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"timoleon vieta com home","review":"This book sucks.

The promo for the book makes you think it's a nice bittersweet story about an abandoned dog and his weak-minded owner. Makes you hope for redeption somewhere along the line. Then you get the ultimate shock at the end when the dog is the victim of senseless cruelty. Quite a con job getting animal lovers to read this book when it will only upset them. Also, a zillion typos. Save your $, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected and was not pleasantly surprised","review":"I feel I was mislead by the book jacket and inner flap. I don't care what gay men do - but what a shock to be reading the details of someone's gay sex life when I thought I had picked up a sentimental and yet humorous story about a man's relationship with his dog. It would be nice if there had been at least a hint of the gay sex content on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Lovers Beware!","review":"Dan Rhodes is a complete jerk for writing this book and luring dog lovers with its cute cover and tempting title! The book's ending is disturbing and deplorableIt ruined my weekend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A small slice of evil","review":"By having the dog Timoleon Vieta brutally and senselessly killed, the author of this book has added to the world's supply of evil in a small but palpable way. I have never been so bitterly disappointed and angered by the ending of a book. I immediately threw the loathsome item into the garbage, an act that somehow seems too good for it. Perhaps I'll dig it out and, when I take my own dog for a walk tonight, I'll get him to do his business on it. Now THAT seems more fitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"high hopes","review":"Mr. Rhodes--chocolate is horrible for dogs; essentially poisonous. Throughout the book, the dog is repeatedly rewarded with chocolate. Why?I wanted to like this book. The dog was loveable, but his 'master,' Cockroft, was such a despicable character, I nearly put the book down before I was halfway through. Cockrofts sexual escapades and thoughts reflecting his low self esteem take precedence over anything else. Timoleon Vieta's journeys away from his master give the reader glimpses into the lives of others--some of these allowed me to continue reading, hoping for something to tie it all in. But all in all the book left me unfulfilled and irritated with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Infuriated Me","review":"A sentimental journey to what??? Fury? Anger? Incomprehension? The only reason I kept reading after the first half of the book was in the hopes that Timoleon Vieta would find someone better to love and care for him than Cockroft. Then I got sucked in by the poignant stories of the people he encountered on his ill-advised trip home. Just when I was starting to feel better about the book, it ended abruptly, violently and with me throwing the book across the room and refusing to touch it again (I made my husband put it in the trash for me). I, too, am an animal lover and hate the ending for that reason, like many of the other reviewers. This does not, however, take away from the strong feeling of deceit that lingers three days after finishing this book. I feel lured into a \\"sentimental\\" story only to be rewarded by a slap across the face. The ending ruined it for me. I'm still furious."},{"rating":"1","title":"cruel, sad little book to be avoided at all costs","review":"As I was reading \\"Timeleon Vita Come Home\\", I felt myself becoming very sad and depressed, but was hopeful that the story would be redeeming in some way and decided to keep with it mainly because the author seems to be a talented writer. Nothing could prepare me for how cruel this book ended up being, and like other reviewers, I promptly threw the book across the room, and then sat down to cry. I would recommend this book to absolutely no one and I highly doubt I'd ever pick up another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"The dog's name is Timoleon Vieta. His owner is an old man living in Italy. He is very lonely and searching for companionship. When a young man comes to stay with him he does not want to lose him despite the fact that Timolean Vieta hates the man and the man hates Timoleon Vieta. Without giving away too much, the dog ends up on a long journey and while on this trip he encounters many different people and the author intertwines their stories into this novel about the old man and the dog. Quite interesting, sad and occasionally uplifting. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did this have a point","review":"As I waded through this book I kept waiting for some sort of revelation. Rhodes skirted around it and never actually allowed the reader to make the leap until the end of the book. I get it: the dog meets a lot of people and somehow touches thier wretched lives. The reader has no idea why and further begins to wonder why they are reading this book.Regarding the ending. Skip it. It is brutal and unnecessary. Ask yourselves, would a spoiled English Brat really brutally murder a dog because he is having some undisclosed crises? No. Rhodes and the reader would have been better served had the dog lived and somehow this weak novel could have been tied together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad & Disapointed","review":"Whilst on the whole I enjoyed the book, I agree with many of the comments of a previous reviewer: that the book was made up of 2 very different halves. I wanted Timoleon Vieta to be more involved with the lives of the people he came across, rather than just being glanced at occassionally.Any enjoyment I had of the book though was completely destroyed by the unnecessary ending. Being an animal lover I could not really read the last few pages & was angry that the author felt he had to end the book in this way. Even to the point of throwing it straight into the bin - something I have never done with any book before.I'm afraid because of this I will not be reading anymore of this authors books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I got half way through this book within a fairly quickly, hoping that if I could get through it fast enough it wouldn't have the chance to bore me. Well, I didn't get to read it for a few days, and now I can't bring myself to go back to reading it. At least the other reviewers have told me the ending so I will never wonder.This is a stupid book about a man who has no life, and a foreigner who uses him....oh, yeah, and there's a dog.That's the first half, anyway. Once the book started talking about a whole new set of characters, I completely lost interest.Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book for a friend, based on the cover blurb.

The three hours spent reading this supposedly enlightening self-help book are three hours of my life I'd like to have back. I found CW Metcalf to be shallow, without substance and wholly unfulfilling. I had really expected to take away some useful ideas for stress reduction and self realization, but instead found myself wondering how much longer this author could go on, and on, and on with the same thing. Other than a few gems of wisdom borrowed from some pediatric cancer patients (any one of which could have written a better book on the topic), there was precious little one could take away as food for thought.

Such is the philosophy of Metcalf, who along with his wife Roma Felible offer a set of skills built around that claim. The book has strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the argument that humor is a healing tonic has validity. They offer evidence of recent scientific studies that support this principle which goes back at least as far as the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament. Some of the skills they offer are doable and can be applied by virtually anyone. The disappointment comes at the end of the book. The chapter about death is NOT from a Christian perspective, but from that of a Buddhdist Since Buddha's still in his grave no hope is offered, just a shallow \\"be positive\\" which is an awful substitue for the promise offered by Jesus who is NOT in His grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to break, try to avoid","review":"My RDH 124 is breaken only after a couple of times.

I spent the second half of this book actually yelling at it. Formatting is awful, sometimes I couldn't figure out who was speaking and then characters suddenly appeared and disappeared. The timeline is completely off -- it seems like the kids went to school in the summer instead of the spring. Where did Victor go in the scene when they went to look for Karina at Casey's house?

Instead it was rather flat and long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just okay for me.","review":"I think the story had a good concept, but there were a lot of parts that just seemed to drag on a bit too long for me. I sort of lost interest a bit when I hit those spots. I loved the Phoenix and IMO- I think everyone should have a man like him in their life. I thought the interaction between him and the triplets were priceless, especially when he didn't even know they were his children yet.

However, Dr. Cohn's credibility was lost in just the first paragraph. He begins by saying that Jack Nicolaus won 20 majors, in fact he won 18. He then says that Sam Sneed won 85 tournaments in his career, in fact he won 82. The reader then goes on to explain that Byron Nelson won 11 straight tournaments, which is correct. The only problem is that he called him Brian Nelson, not Byron. I was so shocked by multiple errors in just the first paragraph that I actually started the audiobook from the beginning to confirm that I had heard the misstatements correctly. Sadly, I had.I am still making my way through the book, but I am VERY skeptical about the future contents when there are so many errors already noted in the opening.

On Isolation Drills, they've never sounded better to such little avail. Since Bee Thousand in 1994, their (badly) recorded highpoint, GbV have acquired tons of studio technique. Of the five full length CDs they've released since then, I can recall a handful of songs. In comparison, and from a cursory look at the Bee Thousand back cover, I remember every track, including bad musicianship and pronounced tape hiss. Would the songs on Isolation Drills be saved by the lo-fi aesthetic? Probably not, though they could use a bit of roughing up. Perfect as they are: \\"Unspirited\\", about the road too frequently traveled, and \\"The Brides Have Hit Glass\\", about the glass ceiling also known as marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you arent part of the problem youre part of the solution","review":"Leave your things in the street and run wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dental drills, more like...","review":"I know I'm going to seem like a cranky old fan, bitter Mr. Pollard ventured into a studio rather than hunkered down in his basement. Not true. The production isn't the problem here. It's the songs. I'm not crazy about the current line-up, but they're not the problem. \\"Chasing Heather Crazy\\" isn't good. None of them are. The songwriting on GBV albums has been progressively slipping since \\"Alien Lanes\\", and this album points out just how long ago that was. The one real asset the band had was Pollards seemingly endless font of songs. I used to ask myself if they'd ever dry up, an empty concrete statue all that would be left behind.

The fountain still flows; the water, however, is undrinkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...or money.","review":"This latest album from GBV is a prime example of what it is to be totally washed up and void of anything important to say.

I'm very sick of everyone mentioning that they want GBV to go back to the 4 track. Alien Lanes and Bee Thousand are classics, and I prefer them to this album. However, Robert Pollard and Co. want to move on, it really benefits the album and makes it more cohesive now that they are not throwing in crappy filler to try and please the people who need there \\"lo-fi.\\" If you listen to this album with fresh ears and forget about the way it used to be, you will appreciate it. This is far and away there best \\"produced\\" album. In fact I think it's there best since Alien Lanes, one tier below Alien Lanes and Bee Thousand, just different. P.S.

I think this one sounded better than the last, really, more organic, less sterile than Ric Ocasek's production of the 'Do the Collapse' album. The songs are overall pleasant and melodic, but the hooks aren't as sharp as on previous releases. There's certainly nothing on here as quirky as on previous efforts. This would be a good, accessible album for a new listener, I think, likely to appeal to fans of straight power pop and mellow-ish alt groups like R.E.M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Bushes, Chasing the Stars","review":"The critical intelligentsia seems to agree on Isolation Drills being GBV's best since Bee Thousand. While I don't necessarily agree (Mag Earwhig would be my pick) I can see why this record has garnered that kind of praise. But more importantly, it's truly interesting to see how even though there is a certain overlap (\\"Glad Girls\\", \\"Chasing Heather Crazy\\") everyone seems to list a different set of favorites from the album (I personally enjoy \\"Unspirited\\" and \\"Privately\\" very much) --regardless of how they feel about Isolation Drills as a whole. That, my friends, is always a good sign: a measure of the songwriting possessing a little something for everyone, without falling into contrived and trite conventions.

The way the director Greg Mottola arrives at this is by wit and then through that, laughs. Many of the employees at Adventureland are underemployed; they need to work at the park because of financial circumstances.Although the film isn't truly a comedy, there are jokes here and there, namely by Martin Starr's character, Joel. Nonetheless, these jokes are intelligent or at least leaves one in awe as we understand how vast their knowledge is."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"This is yet another coming of age stories set in the 80's. If you're into Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg or Ryan Reynolds you'll love this film. The soundtrack is amazing. That alone makes it worth checking out. The film deals with the post college crash/no mans land some of us have experienced in which you fall way short of everyone's expectations and have to take a dead end job to survive. This time at an amusement park, only to find there's interesting people and romance there. This is my favorite Kristen Stewart film. She's ends up in the middle of a love triangle with Ryan Reynolds and Jesse. Ryan Reynolds plays a rogue who constantly cheats on his wife and works at the park while pretending to be a rock star even though he's in his thirties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"First copy ordered did not play on our BlueRay.

Its surprising in a way that I was actually expecting a Superbad type of film or one of those raunchy teen comedies, although there's a lot of sex talk and all those typical of a coming-of-age comedy, I thought the movie was effective in portraying the characters in a realistic way and the script was at least clever and interesting. I would have wanted the move to dig deeper into the relationship of the main characters, but probably not making it more complex is the movie's appeal. I think the emotional hook for me is the lead character's failed European trip; that alone brought back lots of great memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"This film blew me away, it was a great coming of age story. This film will make you want to find your soulmate and you will want to watch this film over and over again, the film is funny at parts but turns out to be a movie with a message and will warm your heart.

I tried to watch it 3 times in one day and fell alseep twice on it. The third time watching it I made it about fifty minutes in without a single laugh. Why is this called a comedy? Seemed like a horribly written drama to me. And I enjoy drama, but this was poorly written, with bad characters, and a bad plot. Nothing happens, except you falling asleep.

The plot just dragged along, the characters were fairly unapproachable in my opinion, and really, i just felt bored through most of it. The billing with the SNL cast and such was a bit misleading, since instead of being a comedy, it was a depressing drama. I literally walked away for a while to make dinner, came back, and found I really had not missed anything. There were a few good moments, but overall, i felt this movie was really just a waste of my time personally. Maybe if I felt some deep seeded depression about life and relationships I would feel different?

That's not to say it's without any laughs. The film has an excellent cast who all can handle comedy and drama well. I have only seen Eisenberg in a few films, but he shows he is an interesting and capable actor. I liked this film very much and its charming run down amusement park setting with a cool 80's soundtrack will certainly spark memories for those of us old enough to remember those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I took my niece to see this film and we thought it was a nice surprise from all of the smutty comedies out there, it actually had a good story line and I thought the theme park characters were dead on, Kristen Stewart did a wonderful job and it had a happy ending.

A person my age would think, how could a movie from 1964 have any depth? Any romance? Any suspense? Yet \\"Marnie\\" will prove them all wrong. This classic Hitchcock movie is so expressive and romantic, you will forget what time period it was filmed. The overall story and relationship between Marnie (Hedren), a theif who had a traumatic childhood, and Mark, a charming but blackmailing businessman (Connery) is universal and timeless. It covers many emotions that most people feel- fear, emptiness, the need to be loved.

It was an \\"edge of your seat\\", story of an emotionally disturbed young woman.Tippi Hedren made this part. She really captured the heart of this \\"Marnie\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marnie","review":"Marnie is filled with many trademark Hitchcock elements and images such as duality, significant use of the colors yellow and red, intellectural metaphors, swirling vortex, spiral hairstyles, and the quintessential Hitchcock icy blonde (Tippi Hendron). Hitchcock effectively creates the psychological complexity, sexual neurosis, and pathological criminal behavior of Marnie. Once again, as he did in Psycho and Notorious, Hitchcock parlays the crucial role of a domineering mother in this film. Marnie is not a \\"whodunit\\" but a \\"why-is-she-doing-it\\" type of film. Sean Connery's character, Mark Rutledge, admonishes the audience that we are \\"not supposed to get it,\\" when he defends his attraction to a thief and a liar (Marnie). His passionate obsession mirrors the one Scotty had for Madeline in Vertigo. Although the search for love, approval and an attempt at emotional closure makes Marnie different from other Hitchcock films, it is still very \\"Hitchcock\\" and well worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Hitchcocks BEST!","review":"This movie was absolutely boring. I tried to watch it, but I kept drifting away. It was not the type of movie you sit down and enjoy. It was mind-boggling, to say the least. IT has some elements of Hitchcock, but not really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Hitchcock is of course one of the great directors of moviemaking, but Marnie is just embarrassing. Nothing works, the direction is uninspired and mechanical. Tippi Hedren is unbearable. Hitchcock had a crush on her, which explains her participation. The formal old-hat textbook-psychology, that worked so well in Psycho and Vertigo, makes you laugh out loud, when Sean Connery plays mindgames with Marnie. His fascination with the troubled woman is admittedly fascinating. He's a former zoologist, set on taming the shrew, but this kind of strange love is depicted far better in Vertigo. Hitchcock is obviously tired. Instead of throwing bewildered seagulls on his beloved star, he just throws her career down the drain with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid cast & direction","review":"Very watchable and engrossing movie about a woman with a past that slowly comes to light. Sean Connery shows us why he became James Bond, with deft seemingly careless acting. Tippi Hedren does credit to the role that was originally slated for Grace Kelly (at that time Princess Grace). Hitchcock was an excellent director, and this movie is full of his personal touches -- everything from his cameo appearance as a train passenger to his almost lurid fascination with mental illness.Worth watching and perhaps buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marnie","review":"This was my first downloaded movie, and the picture was perfect. I was pleased with the rental of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a disturbing movie to someone with PTSD","review":"I have PTSD. I've locked out large chunks of my childhood. I first saw Marnie when I was 17. It didn't knock my repressions loose, but it certainly stirred them up. I saw it again when I was in my forties, and I was recovering my memories. It knocked my socks off again. This movie would probably play completely differently to someone with a different history from mine. But it really hit it for me, and all those years when I was holding things down, I think it let me know that I was not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marnie has issues.","review":"Marnie starring Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery is a deeply disturbing drama directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hedren is completely captivating in the title-role, she is so much more effective in this film than The Birds. I won't give away the ending but expect a creepy and complexed climax. This movie isn't considered a Hitchcock classic but it's definitely worth a viewing, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Facinating Hitchcock film.","review":"Tippi Hedrin plays Marnie, a compulsive thief who cannot stand to be touched by any man.

In that movie it showed the movie Marnie that she was to make for him. I hope it was her last....the movie was ridiculous and the fact that I paid an extra dollar to rent it in HD is ludicrous. The sets in the movie looked like a painting in the background....nothing HD about it. Do not waste your money or your opinion of Tippi Hedren's acting or Hitchcock's directing abilities by watching this movie. I seldom comment on things but this one needs mentioning......I was appalled....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchcock's Swan Dive","review":"Save your money. Tippy Hedren should not have given up her day job; and Hitchcock, like Chaplin, should have ended his illustrious career with his best, such as North by Northwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more praise than it's usually given","review":"This is not a Hitchcock film I had heard much about before it came on T.V. but I found it surprisingly good. There are moments of classic Hitchcockian suspense, (Marnie's shoe falls from her pocket but does not disturb the deaf janitor), and also a well executed character study. The troubled Marnie is well played by Tippi Hedren, one of the more under-appreciated actresses of her generation, while Sean Connery and Diane Baker are excellent in support as Marnie's concerned employer and husband, and the woman in love with him.I found the movie lost some of its well built of tension towards the end, as everyone got a little screechy and weepy, but overall it was an excellent, unexpected treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great package","review":"My fellow reviewers have basically said it all, so I'll only add the following: I love the way this movie manages to be both lurid and sensationalistic (as if it was adapted from a 50's Dell paperback with a title like \\"I Married an Ice Queen!\\") yet poetic and subtle, too. I found this strange, haunting film engrossing from beginning to end. The documentary that accompanies the film, \\"The Trouble With Marnie\\", is also first-rate. I particularly appreciated the fact that the 58-minute examination of the movie is no public relations puff piece. The people interviewed (which include the writers, actors, and technical people) are permitted to say whatever they wish- good or bad- about the film and the creative decisions behind it. Great movie, great extras: Universal should be commended for an excellent treatment of this lesser-known Hitchcock work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good psychological drama","review":"MARNIE was a good Alfred Hitchcock as a \\"mental movie\\", featuring a wonderful cast and a heart-touching script. \\"Marnie\\", as they call her, is a wonderful actor and is also a good thief, but not as good as a liar. When she is caught in the act by Sean Connery, who plays Mark Rutland, her mental problems seem to have more of an effect on her, but they make this superb movie even better.So, I hope you enjoy this old hit, because it is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with original reaction","review":"Marnie was considered a flop when released in 1964, though apparently its regard has increased greatly over the years. I have now seen it for the first time.Perhaps my own evaluation will change over the years as well, but for now I'm back in 1964. The story is dull as dust, Hitchcock's fake backdrops and screens, usually beautiful and surrealistic as in Vertigo, Rear Window, etc, look phony and laughable. And Tippi Hedren--- while she may have been born to play the campy Melanie Daniels in The Birds, is just plain awful here. The sentimentality is very uncharacteristic of Hitchcock and not at all appealing, the character of the Mother is really dreadful. The impression overall is of a Vertigo wannabe - even the magnificent Bernard Hermann score sounds completely derivative from that Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hitch's best.(obligatory title.)","review":"If you really think about it Sean Connery has never really been in any good movies. \\"Well what about Highlander?\\" Some obnoxious nerd who needs to get his face bashed in might say.Well nerd what about Marnie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop The Colors. What Colors? My Aim Was To Commit Suicide, Not Feed The Damn Fish.","review":"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie is an engrossing thriller that sinks its hooks into you and never lets you go until the final image fades out. The question you'll be asking throughout is, Why? What makes this person do the things she/he does? To find out, you'll have to view MARNIE. Excellent acting from James Bond himself and Tippi Hedren, and an exceptional performance by Diane Baker coupled with a masterful theme by Bernard Herrmann make this film a classic. And of course, the answer is revealed...and it may not be the one you're expecting.Rated PG (a rape scene which is depicted tastefully, mild language and some violence)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mold isn't Always a Bad Thing","review":"I really like using the seamless round aluminum molds.

I had heard it was wonderful, but I must say it isn't nearly as good as everyone has made it out to be. Take a look at the four men who are the subject of the film. Sorry, folks, they ain't all that interesting. A guy who cuts bushes to look like animals. Yawn. A guy who studies mole rats. Whatever. A guy who trains lions. Zzzzzzzzzz. There is no grand statement about life to be found here. It is all rather mundane stuff masquerading as \\"deep\\" insight into the human condition. Needless to say, I think the breathless reviews claiming that this movie is \\"brilliant\\" and that \\"it changed my life\\" are preposterous.In short, this is a mildy diverting movie that I shall forget as soon as the final credits roll. Perhaps its greatest achievement is to show just how easy it is to fool people into believing a mediocre film is a work of genius. Leave this one on the store shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"'documentary'is accessible meditation on human condition","review":"I guess this movie is a documentary - it features four (probably real) men speaking about their work. Footage of the men speaking directly to the camera is interwoven with images of them doing their work. There are other kinds of images as well, from cartoons and old movies.The men describe their work with the noblest, loveliest geekiness. The are absorbed, fascinated, knowledgeable and sincere about what they do. The details are compelling.The film moves among the men, gathering their words and images and combining them in a new way. With humor and emotional immediacy, all human endeavor is called into question, with special attention to our complicated relationship with nature, our desire for life after death, and believe it or not folks, what it means to be alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny. Challenging. Moving.","review":"Get ready for some surprises with this one. When I began watching this documentary about the lives of four men and the work to which each devotes his life, I laughed a lot. They were funny to me, these odd people and their singular obsessions. I laughed, then I started feeling a little guilty, voyeuristic, laughing at them while they were so naked about the things that moved them. And I felt a little angry with Errol Morris for exploiting them. Then slowly Morris starts overlapping one man's story with another's video, and I realize that he IS in control, his sincerety intact. Far from making mockeries of these men, he takes their disparate interests and views and makes a profound statement about life and what is at the center of it. Very funny. Very challenging. Very moving. And I fell in love with the robot maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still reading it","review":"This book has not grabbed me yet.

I took the book with me in a visit to Toronto earlier this week. I was bored out of mind at the Pearson Airport waiting for my flight. So I pulled out the book, thinking I could probably sail through the wait engrossed in Haruki Murakami's stories. After about 10 minutes, I put the book back in my carry-on thinking it is much more preferable to get bored out of mind than reading this junk.What on earth was Murakami thinking?

It translates for the American reader into something Hemingway-esque. The words are simple, the images clear. It's far from the mundane, gimmicky, prose some \\"hot\\" American authors are putting out. Along with Murakami, I have also found Yoshimoto great. Both authors cleanse my mind of the junk I am being contaminated with by faddish authors. I find Murakami's work relaxing and entertaining to read. It's easy and yet it isn't throw away fiction by any means. It resonates with the soul.Murakami writes in the introduction that he finds novels a challenge but short stories a joy. You can sense the joy in all of the stories in Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman. Particularly pleasing is the story Tony Takitani. A wonderful character. You feel sorry for him but he is by no means pathetic. The plots of all of these stories are highly original. None of the themes are recycled. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp compared to other Murakami works","review":"This is the fifth Murakami book I've read, and very well may be my last, which is unfortunate considering how great The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Kafka on the Shore, and The Elephant Vanishes were.

I didn't burst into flame, but I these stories have made me want to read more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tame early fare from Stephanie Laurens","review":"\\"A Season for Scandal\\" is a compilation of two of Laurens' early novellas. Fans of the Bar Cynster series may be disappointed; even though these are regency romances, they are far tamer than the sensual Cynster series. Nevertheless, both stories are fun and have compelling Cynster-ish heroes. I found the heroine in \\"Tangled Reins\\" annoying - one of those spunky young ladies who proves her independence by doing exactly the stupid/dangerous thing the hero warns her not to do, thus allowing him to rescue her. The heroine in \\"Fair Juno\\" was more interesting - a widow whose former husband fell into disgrace and committed suicide. Unfortunately, Laurens doesn't develop the interesting emotionally angles here as fully as she might. Despite my complaints, these were fairly innocuous stories and a light, pleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the rest","review":"I was excited to find a Stephanie Laurens book I had not previously read. However, I was very disappointed in this one. The stories (there are actually two) were slow and the plots uninteresting. This book lacked the senuality and fast pace of her other books.

Thank you, publisher for reprinting these two novels and giving me a chance to read them.Yes, these books definitely don't have the Cynster male OOOOMPH! but this is only because they are from a period where the reader received that OOOOMPH in a more subtle way, and not by reading every moment of the sexual encounter. It is apparent that these are books by Stephanie Laurens and it is interesting to see her earlier work as an author. Seduction and sex are in these two books, just as they are in the Cynster novels - just a little more quietly.These early Laurens remind me of Georgette Heyer (whom I initially fell in love with through reading Devil's Cub, Convenient Marriage, These Old Shades, and others).I gave 5 stars: good plot, good characters, good reading, good writing. All of this kept my interest and kept me reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre","review":"This book was a very ssllooww read. It was boring! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.

I bought this CD w/o ever hearing BB which was a Big mistake. I did so because I heard they were like the Melvins and even part of the Melvins now. I read up on BB including all the 5 Star reviews here. While they DO have a Melvins feel to them there's absolutely no rhythm, rhyme, or reasoning in this album. The biker bar vocals in particular are completely unbearable. If you want calculated chaos stick with the Melvins. I recommend listening to it first before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"If you are serious about playing castanets these are not the right thing to purchase. I've learned it's not an expense you can forgo by bargain hunting. If you are just looking for a prop they will do. They are pretty big and hard to play. The right one is not notched and they sound pretty much the same so you can't tell which hand is which. Needless to say, they don't sound right at all. Definitely a waste of money for the earnest student."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun!","review":"Having lived in Sevilla (southern Spain) and with my love for flamenco music I wanted my own set of \\"pallilos\\".

Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOW END PRINT","review":"While this was an inexpensive version of an old poster print subject, it did not impress me. I did not pay much for it , however, it is no special subject even in the poster line.It has clear lines and smudges from poor copying and scanning tools. It is hazy and darkened. Being primarily blue, once you stand back 15' it doesnt matter, it blends in but the picture has detail that is lost and it becomes only a blue blend on a wall. The colors which should be in it just do not show up properly. I would suggest a different print such as wheat fields rather than the beach of Sainte Adresse. It would be a very nice one if the printing process had been cleaned up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy. Nice seller thought","review":"This print out is terrible.

Thanks again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"The book is filled with pretentious paintings of an artist trying to be so much more than he is. The fact that he typically paints even the simplist theme in gigantic size points out his overriding hubrus.Bo Bartlett has technique..there is no argument there, but he simply has nothing to say...so he says it as loud as possible so no one will notice the lack of content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"The business of art is the business of selling objects d'art with little intrinsic value for huge prices to a rich, idle and foolish aristocracy. It has been this way for three centuries.Jackson Pollack, a semi-retarded alcoholic championed by a desolute upper class,brought this cynical game to its ridiculous peak in the mid twentieth century when we saw silly rich people gather in hushed awe to view and buy the most blatent trash and hang it on their walls with pride.Pollack thought them all idiots and was right.The post modern art world has retreated from this insanity but we still have artists such as Bo Bartlett practicing this silly game whose main purpose is to seperate the idle rich from some of their cash by means of hubris and pretense.This book is a propaganda piece in this corrupt enterprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching?

There, I had the wonderful experience of a workshop with several members of SAVAE, in which we sang and clapped the complex melodies and rhythms of the music, and were introduced to some of the indigenous language, as well as the various drums, stones and flutes they used for accompaniment. Later in the conference, we (some 300 of us) were treated to a sublime concert, which included some of the pieces on this recording. We also got to sight-read three pieces from their upcoming CD of Christmas music from the same era. I don't think they had ever performed before so larga and appreciative an audience. This group deserves to be discovered by lovers of Early Music everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Culturally pleasing...","review":"In the album, El Milagro de Guadalupe, SAVAE clearly demonstrate their ability to cross-cultures and to unite or fuse the commonalities without difficulty. The sacred music somehow seems so much more holy in this context. The vocalists are quite talented singers and linguists. Overall a very pleasant cd and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let tell you something...","review":"This is not what I think thatthe Spaniards would wanted done,in actual practice.

Although now we have cozy detectives who have virtually every possible profession, at the time that these novels were written it was really revolutionary to make a polite and almost stuffy Wall Street banker the hero of a detective novel.Emma Lathan's Thatcher novels may be the only mysteries I enjoy for their documentary value. Thatcher's work is explored and entwined with the mystery at hand. In this, her 15th Thatcher book, the focus is on cocoa futures. It may sound dry, but it works very well. Give it a chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Empty Coal Bucket","review":"Not too bad for a self-published volume. Readers who grew up in Shamokin, Pa., may appreciate the descriptions of their familiar home-town surroundings. (Residents of small blue-collar towns, for some reason, are often tickled to see their town's name in print.) This little collection of stories succeeds in conveying a sense of the culture of this region, which provides endless fascination for the coal coterie, but may leave others out in the cold. The coal industry which once fueled American industry is dead and gone. As this book reminds us, there is not much left but culm banks and memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great play kitchen accessory!","review":"This is an adorable toy, and a great addition to any play kitchen! Our daughter loves to \\"shake\\" these spices on her play food, and then she finds the correct space in the wooden rack for each one. The spices are different sizes, so she has to find the correct lid for each one by looking at the size and color of each one. This is great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different approach to the topic of Simplicity","review":"This is a surprisingly charming and thought-provoking book which avoids the typical \\"Simple Living\\" tips like decluttering your closet, and instead focuses mainly on how to simplify yourself from the inside out. That is, if we examine WHY we complicate our lives with so much STUFF and so many activities, we can more effective in getting rid of a lot of it.There may not be any major new ideas of breakthroughs here, but McCain has a writing style that expresses her sincerity. She just seems like the kind of woman you'd want to call friend and nothing in the book comes across as exploitative or opportunitistic (how many \\"simple living\\" books have you read that seem merely to be written just to take advantage of the current interest in the subject?)Anyway, I give it a big thumbs up for anyone (mostly women, though) wanting to have a more fulfilling and less stressful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bag sucks","review":"This is a beautiful bag in all ways but one. Unfortunately, the one way renders any positive features obsolete. THE MAGNETS SUCK! The magnets are so weak that the bag barely adheres to the tank.

The text is quite substantial and informative from a writer and a publisher with good reputations. It is lavishly illustrated in both color and black & white with photographs of shoes and reproductions of historic illustrations. As compared with catalogs and chiefly pictorial collections, it has fewer shoes and more context illustrating social attitudes and people wearing shoes and much more information.

The unit is well made and I expect it to be completely functional. As others have said of their units, there are extensive tool marks on both sides of the blade. A few minutes with a diamond hone removed most of the ones from the cutting surface -- not all but enough to create a workable blade edge. Removing the ones on the back side will take extensive work. I plan to use the device as I now have it, sharpening as required. I expect that will satisfactorily remove the tool marks over time.Overall, I'd say the quality just about matches the price - both are OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"45 minutes on a grinder, 30 minutes on various grades of sand paper, and 40 minutes on my diamond sharpening stones made this completely unusable tool function like it should. Hindsight...I would pay for my time back. I usually love Two Cherries tools, but this one took WAY too much time tuning up for the work I do. North Bay Forge is the way to go.

It's such a great book I figured volume 1 would be too--I ordered it from Amazon because it doesn't seem to be as readily available. I'm not really disappointed in this book, but in my opinion it's not as good as volume 2. Very notable selections here, but I have to agree that \\"easy\\" is a subjective term. Some of these pieces would take a lot of time and work to get them up to speed (one obvious exception is \\"Trumpet Voluntary\\"). Of course, instant gratification and learning to make music do not go hand in hand. When I was taking lessons, Mrs. Dunn always encouraged me to play each piece as slowly as I needed to, instead of pushing for speed.

By the time this record came out, the band seemed more interested in pushing \\"The Derailers\\" as a brand rather than the remarkable band they once were. Nashville production pushes the guitar to the bottom of the mix and hired guns write most of the material.

I like old-style country tunes with lyrics that take a little bit of thought to put together and maybe take a little to catch the meaning. But this record and the Derailers' last one contain so many obvious, banal tunes that I can barely stand to listen to them. With so many lines you can see coming from a mile away, it takes all the fun out of listening. For the record I realize that they didn't pen them all, and to their credit they don't fill their albums with covers of stuff like \\"Hello Walls\\". But I know enough Nashville songwriters to know that there is much better material available.

I pulled the floor mats out of the box and immediately noticed that they were were identical but for opposite sides of the vehicle. The driver's side and passenger side are entirely different in shape and the rounded part of the mat did not fit well around the squared foot rest on the left side.

Following the separate paths of Caley Burrell and Martin Maddox, the reader travels along with the two central characters, waiting for that moment when their paths intersect. And when they do, the physically shattered Caley and the recovering alcoholic Martin are funny and touching and tentative. This is a book about losses and about the possibility of small gains; it's about how fate will send you flying through the windowshield of a car, causing you to become horribly disfigured; it's about how an alcoholic can lose everyone he loves, regain them, get sober, and, even then, having done everything right, suffer unthinkable losses. That these two unlikely people find each other is surprising, and wonderful, and completely believable. A lovely, thoughtful book that delves far below the surface to find what is really important, really valuable, in human interchange. Don't miss this! It's a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangerine Dream 'Alpha Centauri'","review":"This album, is in my opinion, an excellent sample of german rock and especially german rock psychedelia. The first track \\"Sunrise in the Third System\\" begins with bird-like sounds followed by the synthesizer sounds which are prevalent all through the album. \\"Alpha Centauri\\" can be characterised as a proto-electronica work, however there are flutes, guitars and percussion which provide in tracks 2 and 3 (\\"Fly and Collision of Comas Sola\\" and the title track \\"Alpha Centauri\\"), a more natural sound.The bonus track \\"Ultima Thule Part 1\\" is a very beautiful piece, more rock-oriented with clear influences, in my opinion from groups like King Crimson or Procol Harum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-synthesizer Dream","review":"For people familiar with the synth-heavy later Tangerine Dream, this album is quite different. Preceding even the Mellotron, the album features mostly good old-fashioned electro-acoustic instruments, with a lone VCS synthesizer used only to generate weird sound effects that are not particularly connected to the music. Nevertheless, the overall impression is atmospheric, reminiscent of early Pink Floyd experimentation (which of course is what they were aiming for), heavy on the echo, guitars and drums adding up to a monomental wall of sound on track 2.

Some of the tracks are simply remixes of older stuff. Brand X fans will recognize some of the fare from the Product album, such as the rhythm track from \\"Soho\\" played with a different melody, and \\"A longer April\\", which is exactly that. The only track I mildly enjoyed was \\"TMIU-ATGA\\", which is vaguely reminiscent of \\"Why Should I lend you mine...\\" from the Moroccan Roll album.I have heard anecdotally that Percy Jones thought this album was an embarrassment, and I agree with him.

I wouldn't say pocket size but close and they are well made and heavy so a coat pocket in the winter yes otherwise they will fit into a backpack, purse very easily and come with covers for the lenses too. All in all for a small set and certainly not the highest magnification they do what they are intended to do.

I've generally used Nikon and Bushnells, so I started with those. While these Nikons are light, waterproof, and well designed, the optics are not good, I tried three pair (including the 10x25s) over a total of two months and all three were out of alignment. They gave me headaches. I finally decided on Vortex Typhoons - which are a GREAT binocular for the money. I was amazed at the quality of the Vortex over the Nikons and Bushnells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! This version is false.","review":"I saw a print of this rare film at a special screening with a large audience at San Francisco's Castro theater in the 1960's. As far as I know and remember at that viewing the print was complete. I found it a film of artistic merit, sensitive film-making by Genet, very much worth seeing. This version for sale has been hacked to bits, edited with a great loss of important footage that explained the 'plot', scenes that were once complete have been crudely cut, with original footage lost, thus damaged as a film by Genet from the genuine full print I saw in San Francisco. Now the picture makes no sense, is unpleasant to watch, shorter in length and has been completely ruined as a film work of art. Don't buy this print, an embarrasment as a genuine work of Genet, or anybody else; it isn't that by any measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"For ages 10 and younger","review":"Although this book did show potential, it lacked material that would have helped me read it faster.

Overall a pleasant movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!!","review":"Unlike most of the other reviewers I've never read the book nor am I a fan of the author. The only reason for watching this mini series was Peter O'Toole, one of the alltime great actors of our time.

I rather hold out for \\"Venus\\" to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun at times, but mostly a disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with the adaptation of Rosamunde's Pilcher's epic novel. The filmmakers simply did not have enough time to develop any of the characters. It is all \\"tell\\" and no \\"show.\\" You are told that Judith wins the Cairn Cup, but are never shown her doing anything that would indicate why she deserves it. You never see the friendship between Loveday and Judith or develop. There are some good performances, such as the actor playing Tommy Mortimer and Peter O'Toole (greatly underused) and I liked what they did with the character of Jess, but overall, it is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I am so disappointed in the so-called \\"adaptation\\" of the wonderful book by Rosamonde Pilcher. It was a real massacre of the story and changed so many things that I finally gave it up. Why was Peter O-Toole made the star of the production when, in the book, he was one of the rather minor characters? I did not expect all the characters from the book to be in the film, but why were some thrown out just to insert new ones? I guess the script writers thought they were better writers than Pilcher - well, guess again. This movie is poorly acted amd worse written. If you love the book as I do, skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect the book!","review":"If I had never read \\"Coming Home\\" I could have liked this film. It is, however, just not at all an adequate adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher's excellent novel. The soul has been cut out of the story in order to make it fit tidily into a film. The acting and such are fine, as they go, but watching this is like watching a ghost of Pilcher's fine story, and it truly does not satisfy at all. Perhaps Pilcher's books really don't lend themselves to film adaptations. I found the adaptation of \\"The Shell Seekers\\" to be an appalling desecration of that book too. They should try to make them into a mini-series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to the story line?","review":"I thought the first DVD out of the set was pretty much to the plot of the book. But, whatever happened to Judith's old friend, Heather Warren, from Porthkerris?On the second DVD from the set I was totally disappointed with how the story went. Why did they keep Edward alive? Why did they portray Walter as a nice guy? And why didn't they ship the Somervilles' out to southwest Asia and so goes for Judith? Also, it was Judith who found Gus in London. Why oh why was it Diana Carey-Lewis? Did the broadcasting company run short on budget? Were they in a terrible rush to finish the series like a botched-up plastic surgery horribly gone wrong?Overall I sort of enjoyed it, but it could have been a lot better!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charmless and shallow","review":"Having enjoyed the book (several times) despite its lack of reality and adherence to a pastoral myth of perfection in everything (come on, how likely is it that all bad things become good and every important person is totally charming and/or perfect looking, while all the horrid ones get their just desserts), I was interested in seeing the screen adaption. Yuck. Charmless, poor and wooden acting, changed story lines and themes all contributed to a total let-down. To me, it seemed to be just a cynical means of extracting more money out of a popular novel (a bit like the merchandising that goes on around all sorts of movies)and to hell with the atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I love the book.

Though the story is a little different from the novel (in the same way that \\"Message in a Bottle\\" differed), I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the series. The cast was brilliant, and the scenery was breathtaking.A friend of mine in the UK recommended this video to me after it aired there and received rave reviews, and I am stunned American television has not picked it up yet. It should air on Masterpiece Theatre, especially since it was produced by producers of \\"Rebecca.\\" The quality is as exquisite, if not more so.If you like period drama, if you are a Pilcher fan, if you are an MPT fan, if you liked Emily Mortimer in the recent Academy Award-nominated film \\"Elizabeth,\\" or if you are just looking for a wonderful movie for the weekend, THIS IS IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"This table was extremely disappointing.

I'm a fan of the \\"Everyone Loves Raymond\\" sitcom. It was interesting to read about what goes on behind the scenes on a sitcom and where the story ideas came from. Personally I liked it because I could relate to the author because he grew up watching the same TV shows that I did. I occasionally had to stop and re-read sections because I didn't understand an expression or phrase (I guess it came from \\"writing the way you talk\\").

If you've ever taken an dreadful vacation - you'll find the funny here. If you've ever had to pull a well placed knife out of your back, you'll find the funny here. If you've ever said \\"My life could be a sitcom\\" - well you'll find out why that's best left to the professionals, and why the sitcom behind the sitcom is very funny business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth is stranger and funnier...","review":"At some level, I guess we all see our lives as comedies (hopefully)-- at least on some level. Phil Rosenthal did one better, he helped turn the comedy of his life into a hit sitcom and got filthy rich in the bargain-- we should all be so lucky and funny.His recounting of the way it all happened is both entertaining and instructive; he sums up his success with three simple rules: be real, be specific, and tell a good story. Good advice, and a great read for all fans of \\"Raymond,\\" a good laugh, and the absurdity of everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't judge this book by its cover","review":"You have to go out of your way to find any humor here. After the first 50 pages, most readers will conclude \\"been there, done that.\\" There's a level of detail about \\"the guys in the room,\\" stories of successes and failures along the way, the standard smattering of back-stabbing and swipes at the network guys, etc. that even die hard fans of the show will find tough going. The fact that there is very little insight here into the cast and even less about Ray Romano (if it's possible to write any book about this how without him this one is it) doesn't help. Rosenthal comes across as an undoubtedly nice guy who is indeed lucky but seems to devote most of these pages to reminding himself that he is all of those things plus how much he loves everyone on the show and all the neat people he's gotten to meet along the way--everything but funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"The book has a very interesting title but the stories just don't live up to it.

Not only were they the most colorful personalities, but after listening to their CD, I feel they are just as talented as they are dramatic. I can only imagine how good their live show is and can not wait for them to come further North to check them out. Welcoming Home the Astronauts takes the listener on quite a ride from the rocking \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"You're so Hollywood\\" to the power ballad \\"Direct Line to the Telepathic,\\" with twists and turns from the likes of \\"Coke\\" and \\"Chloroform the One That You Love.\\" So sit back and enjoy the ride, my friends, and hope it lasts for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best unsigned band ever?","review":"This album has some decent tracks, although the lyrics seem to think they are more profound than they actually are. All in all it's a good rock album, but it's nothing you haven't heard before. I'm sure that in every city in america there is a band who plays this type of music and writes songs at the same level. These bands however, have not been on a reality-based TV show and thus will never be signed. Buy this record if Flickerstick was your favorite band on the TV show.

It works so well that you actually have to use it outside - otherwise the amount of hair it removes will entirely trash your carpet.

I bought one and tried it on my dog, but I have to admit, it was just average. A week prior, my friend had loaned me her Furminator to try. It worked really good.

However, it does make a bit of noise which my dog did not like. Also, my dog has a medium coat- not very long, but he does have some undercoat. It seemed to me this would be better for a dog with longer hair or a thicker undercoat- it just didn't really grip the hair or get it out on my dog. Now it's just sitting in a box not being used. I much prefer the Oster undercoat rake for my dog's coat- really gets a ton more hair out than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I bought this because someone else had said it was superior to a more expensive cat comb. Well, I can't speak for the other product, but I can't imagine that it's any better, and the price for this one was very reasonable. It does indeed painlessly pull massive amounts of fur from the cat, and he/she may well enjoy the grooming: one of our cats loves it. Now if I could just get the skittish one--the one who sheds the most--to sit still for a brushing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Candice","review":"Could be better. The rake is quite loud and doesn't remove much of my husky's undercoat. A combination of a furminator and slicker bush works a lot better for me. Comfortable handle and enjoyable for the dog.

Since I just had my American Eskimo groomed last Sun, she doesn't ave much dead undercoat as before, I was still able to pull out a small amount of hair by lightly brushing on her coat. It ias advertised, does NOT pull her hair. She hates the furminator especially on her fur pants (hind legs) where she has the most shedding of hair, but with this one, she hardly notice I was doign anything and do not move so much.Also the price at amazon is very very nice. I have seen in pet stores, similar product, not with rotating pins, single row rake for $23!! So this is a good buy, worth the price and get the hair out.

Not sure what changed. The elastics just don't have the right stretch to them. They just seem way too tight. I couldn't get it around a ponytail the right amount of times. Either it was too loose and the ponytail holder just fell out, or i had to force it around one more time which resulted in a snapped ponytail holder.

This book gives the show and the cast (which I think is the most interesting cast yet) more depth. The thing dealt with most in the book is something that wasn't hardly dealt with on the show, and that's Kelley and Danny's dislike of Melissa and Jamie. There's way more content than that, but that is what's focused on a bit. 'Unmasked' also put to rest the answer of some questions, such as \\"Why was Kelley not in the house a lot?\\" and \\"What did Matt really think of Julie the whole time she crushed on him?\\". All the cast members let out what they really thought about each other, and some of the results could be surprising. All in all, I found that this season and this book is the best ever.

There are funny snipits of interviews and conversations they've had with the BBC that will make you laugh. There are also a couple of songs previously unheard like John's cover of \\"Memphis, TN\\" and Paul's version of \\"Til There Was You\\" is actually better than the recorded album version on this take.But if I have this CD on my ipod I find myself skipping the majority of the songs because they just aren't as good as their best work. So this album is just okay for me.The insert is great. Lots of pictures, some previously not ever seen. Many taken at the BBC studios.If you're a die-hard Beatles fanatic, then definitely buy.

The fate of those that violate a woman. The difference here, is the woman exacts revenge herself. The brutality in this movie is graphic, and not for the squeamish. But the bad guys do get what they deserve in the end. I thought this movie was very well made and acted. If you like revenge movies that are graphic and relentless, you will dig it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The revenge can be sick ...","review":"What a bad movie, I don't understand how someone can like this. But it has the message for those who don't respect women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I'm usually quite snobbish when it comes to a remake of a film considered a classic, but not in the case of, I Spit On Your Grave. I found this to be as good, if not just a bit better than the original. I felt the characters were a bit more fleshed out in the remake and while the original might have had a grittier feel to it, this film certainly holds it own.While the subject matter may be too much for some viewiers, if you can watch this kind of film, it's definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well (re)made but completely disturbing","review":"I honestly can't recall seeing the original movie so I won't compare the stories between the two. This remake wasn't toned down at all in theme or footage, probably a good indication why the movie never hit theaters. The rape sequence(s) was so incredibly disturbing I had to fast forward through it...couldn't watch it. The rest is revenge fantasy and works well. The ending cuts out making you wonder how far she would go for revenge and whether or not that would include the sheriff's pregnant wife and kid. It's a good guess that for politically correct reasons they ended it there; not for a sequel. Truth is that this was a well made movie and the only truly horrific thing in the movie is the scope of human nature and behavior. It leaves you feeling that the revenge, despite it's gruesome nature, was justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad remake, boring, slow, no gore scenes.

You've heard the story, so I won't bore you with it again. All I can say is that if you were disturbed by the rape scene in the remake of \\"Last House on the Left,\\" honey, you ain't seen nothing compared to this one, because it goes on and on and on and on.

Crap like this should be banned...I mean there are simply some things you should NOT make movies about. Rape is one of them. Seriously, half the movie is just one big rape scene...and the rest is murder and sex. It was a sick movie back then and is a sick movie now.

The plots are basically the same. A woman is raped. Woman gets revenge. Sometimes it is an abduction or a home invasion, or in this case, a woman is taken in her cabin by a bunch of rednecks. As compared to the original, the nudity was less in the remake and the rape scene less graphic. There I said it. Oh yes, the characters are more developed and the torture inflicted by the woman is a tad better, but is that why people watch rape films, for character? The same could be said for the remake of \\"Last House on the Left,\\" they watered down the rape and nudity. I can't believe with all these silicon soft core stars, they could not have picked something with more eye candy for the starring role instead of someone who can act.Decent folks will want to stay away from this movie. Sickos would be better off with the original or a David Hess film festival.

I've never seen the original film that inspired this remake, but I did enjoy it. My attraction to this film stems from its basic idea of a victim getting their own revenge against those that brutalized them. The story is about a woman that was raped and beaten by a group of men, somehow she survived and starts murdering them very creatively. Each of the deaths of the men is inspired by his own actions during her rape/attack. I would reccomend watching this, it's a great film. I don't think I've ever watched a horror film, where I sided with the murdered."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vile And Ugly Film","review":"I wasn't a fan of 1978's I Spit On Your Grave, but I also wasn't a fan of 1972's Last House On The Left. However, I gave the remake of LHOTL a chance, and I liked it. Sure, it had a disturbing rape scene (what rape scene isn't disturbing?), but the payoff was very entertaining. Seeing the rapists get killed in crazy ways by the rapee's parents was sweet indeed. I'm not going to be as kind to the I Spit On Your Grave remake though. It's vile and ugly, and it's not just the rape that is disturbing. Even the murders of the rapists is gross and hard to watch. I could have lived my whole life without seeing a man's severed penis stuffed into his mouth. But seeing that this film has a 6.4 on imdb.com, I guess I'm in the minority."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"bad writing, bad production, no reason to watch at all. an embarrassing movie. the content is neither shocking nor offensive because it is just too poorly done. an example of the continuity: during the same scene spanning a few minutes of depicted time, outdoor light changes from pitch black to sunny. dialog seems unintentionally cliched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the original","review":"I really liked this a lot. Very well done. Strong and very gritty. Unlike the \\"Last House On The Left\\" remake which was better on a technical level, it was not as effective a horror film. But with \\"Spit\\" I thought it was much more effective than the original in many ways, and the acting is so much better.

I find this to be a completely accurate depiction of the pond-scum breeding in the deep south. Those people, if you want to want to call them that, claim to be more moral and righteous, but then they do stuff like this. This kind of thing actually happens; northern girls, usually college students, stray into the wrong part of Podunk, and get raped and murdered by the subhuman locals.

I haven't seen the 1978 original and I won't see it. The rape scenes and the characters are well done, and therefore disgusting. They make you wish the worst for the rapers, but their deaths under horrible and unspeakable tortures are even more disgusting. The level of graphical violence is frankly excessive, and I regret having seen some scenes. The movie should have been rated, as it is definitively NOT recommendable to a young audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE","review":"The first movie was better. The acting in this movie is atrocious. It seemed like the actors were reading their lines from Q cards. The violence in the rape scene was laughable. You don't feel sad for the woman.

As i watch girls in my class dress like hookers all the time, i see how horrible it is that they give away their body like that. I am a 14 year old girl, so I know what its like, and i think \\"Secret keeper\\" did a pretty good job of addressing the situation. This book, gives a new look at modesty and the deeper issues. I love how they used examples of christian rocks singers, because those women have to be up front about how they want to dress and follow God, and may young girls look up to them. I wish all my friends could own this book, but for now I will just have to let them borrow my copy.An also recommended read from me would be \\"and the bride wore white\\" by Dannah Gresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teens!","review":"This book is really good. A lot of times books that talk about modesty overlook the heart issue completely. There is so much more to modesty than what you wear. This book does a good job at bringing that out.It also has a positive tone, which is very rare as well. I like that it is realistic and offers practical solutions. For example getting guys undershirts. It is true that it's hard to find shirts that are long enough and this is a practical solution. Something that girls feel like they can actually do.

I am in full support of encouraging young women to respect themselves. I desire to see young women today accept themselves and embrace their power. However, teaching young girls that their purpose in life is to find one man to love and care for, is a big step backwards. I also firmly believe there is no excuse for a man stalking or sexually harassing a girl. The suggestion that these things happen because the girl did not pray while getting dressed that day, or the idea that by saying a prayer we can know for certain what God intended in the grey issues in the Bible is outrageous. If you are looking for a book that will encourage intellectual thinking, spiritual growth, independant decisions and confidence in a young woman's life - this is NOT the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"right on","review":"She is direct, reasonable, mature, and friendly.

In the last two years I have managed to lose about 10kgs of weight and in the process have learnt a fair deal about food, although not enough to talk authoritatively with a nutritionist.Roger Wilson's book deals mainly about how the author lost a significant amount of weight himself after trying his own diet plan. The diet he followed was eating fruits and proteins. His lack of fundamental knowledge of nutrition makes his commentary a suspect from the very beginning. This book is more a chronicle of the authors weight loss journey than a guide to healthy eating.Conclusion: Better to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"New diet","review":"I was so excited to receive this book as i have tried all the diets out there.

I'm sure you can find other plans to compare this to, but the reality is that if you follow the plan as it is, it works.Some reviews say that it is too much of a fruit diet, but I do not eat very much fruit at all, usually just for breakfast. And it is true, I'm never hungry, I don't crave bad foods at all (pizza, chips, cakes and candy, ect.)This book is amazing!

He was addicted to food. Then he tried different diets and none of them worked. So he made up his own diet after praying to God about it and lost a bunch of weight eating frozen grapes. (Oh, and he got a tummy tuck to get his abs flat)His diet: eat fruit, don't eat dairy, don't eat carbs except beans, no snacking between meals, protein only allowed at lunchProbably pretty safe for most people, but you have to follow his fruit, no dairy, and no carb plan.

I have reached my 20 lb. weight loss goal and I eat more than I did prior to the plan.

The book is a diet book authored by a man who lost a ton of weight by eating much healthier. It's not exactly news that by substituting fruits for refined sugar or veggies for bread you will be healthier and have less problems with weight. The problem most people have is the addiction to refined sugar and bread and Wilson does not give any solution to that problem except get rid of the tempting foods and replace them with the healthier ones.

I'm only 16 and I'm not too into losing weight but lately I have been really intrested in the science of nuitrition. So I thought I'd find out what this book had to say. It's a book in which author Roger Troy Wilson gives his weight loss testimony and then tells us, his eager readers, what he did. This is his meal plan:Breakfast: Eat fruit till your fullLunch: Big meal of the day. Eat lots of protien.Dinner: More fruit and some soupsI think he's got a point when he says that Lunch should be the big meal of the day because after lunch you are much more active than after dinner....thus burning more of the calories and carbs. This diet seems to have worked well for him and many others, so I say go for it if your willing to try!

The story questions everything Christiany teaches and assumes, and there are more than a few jolts as she plays with things that I'd assumed since birth. It's refreshing, enlightening, intelligent and so fascinating you'll find yourself hooked.Angel Sanctuary is absolutely NOT for anyone who will not question ideals, nor for anyone who is looking for a mindless story.

As his son Yan Pascal says in the notes, these performances are not perfect. There are indeed lapses of wrong, or out of tune, notes. But they are more than made up for by the spirited, emotional playing and the beautiful sound. There are frequent close-ups of Tortelier's face, maybe a few too many, but they do show the intensity of the performances. There are also many close-ups of his beautiful (and huge) left hand, which is a joy to watch in action. Not many cellists would, or should, perform all six Bach suites in public at age 76. But we should give thanks that Paul Tortelier chose to do so, and that the performances were recorded for posterity."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for learning Amercian spoken English","review":"I strongly recommend this book for those who (especially, international students, businessmen and tourists) would like to understand American spoken English and express themselves using American spoken English.

However, I then noticed that the collar was going off at random times, like when my dog yawned, sneezed, or even did nothing. I once found him cowering in the yard as the spray went off every second, for no reason. Needless to say, the dog is terrified of the collar. The last time I put it on him he stood glued in the same spot for 45 minutes, not even moving his head. I tried putting a bandana under the collar to make it less sensitive, but that didn't make much difference.

It was working GREAT! He figured out within a few days that when the collar was on, he was not to bark. But then he was sleeping and out of nowhere it suddenly sprayed him! I contacted the seller, and they said he shouldn't wear it while he's sleeping (which makes no sense, because dogs sleep on and off throughout the day while you're gone), but I decided to give it another chance. He was just sitting next to me on the floor not even MOVING and it just sprayed him again out of nowhere! So that was the last time I put it on him. The seller tried to tell me there was nothing wrong with the collar and that it was just \\"not a good fit for my dog.\\" It was working fine, I just don't think it's fair for him to be sprayed with something he finds aversive when he's being good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work very long","review":"This collar worked for my lab initially, so I actually ordered a second one for my much smaller corgi. The strap is very adjustable so it fit both dogs fine. Soon after I received my 2nd collar, the first one pretty much stopped working. It would make a click like it was going to spray but then wouldn't. This problem was solved on a few occasions by shaking the device, but within another week or so it was totally toast.

Before the collar, I could hear her barking even before I put the key in the door. Now, I listen outside the door and don't hear a thing! It's great! She's become almost scared of the collar now when I try to put it on her because she knows what it does. I think all in all its a good product for her since she isnt a constant, continuous barker.

The first day it seemed to malfunction right from the start. When he barked it would spray multiple times, it should let off one spray for each bark. Still it seemed to stop his barking for the first day or two. After that he seemed to not be bothered by the spray at all and actually would lick his nose after being sprayed.

She barks non stop at EVERY DOG, even if they are across the street until we pass them. This collar worked immediately to help stop the barking. The first time we tried, it a dog was walking our way so it was perfect chance to try it. The spray really shocked her as she wasn't expecting it. I felt bad as it was a little dramatic for her the first time but she got the message quick. It's been several weeks and she might get one small bark out now on our walks but most of time, she doesn't bark at all so this has dramatically improved her behavior. It will even spray if she only growls. I can even leave the collar on and leave it turned off and she knows not to bark.I will say I can see how this may not work as well if the dog is left unattended with it on.

Since nothing seems to work (click/reward system, being firm) we decided to go with a bark control collar. As we thought using a e-collar for a rescue, who just moved in new surroundings is too much.The first time she barked with it, she was startled by the citronella and stopped. Wow, we thought, maybe that will do it. Unfortunately it didn't, she would bark right through it. The whole house would smell like citronella.

As we speak, I am sitting in complete quiet in my home. It took just one day for them to realize that with their collar on, they better be quiet. Funny thing is - the one who barks the most, loves to get her collar on. When they start getting anxious I just say \\"okay girls - come get your collar\\" and they come running.

The collar initially surprised her, but it did not make her stop barking. It just makes her smell like citronella. There are a number of issues with it: For one, she has a lot of fur, and the collar gets lost in the fur and doesn't really spray like it should. For another, it fits awkwardly and tends to flip upside down so it's actually just spraying into her chest. Finally, it doesn't hold enough spray, and she learned very quickly that once it's out, she can bark freely. It just wasn't enough of a deterrent for her, I guess. I'm not really a fan of this sort of training, anyway - spraying a dog in the face or shocking them when they are barking out of stress to begin with doesn't seem like the best method. I'll be honest - I was looking for a quick and easy fix - I'll be returning to positive reinforcement and a consistent training regime to work through the barking with my dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product information","review":"I bought three of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

A gross waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What no returns - how about telling me that before I buy","review":"Ok so I was really excited about this humane way of getting my barking 5 year old vizsla to calm down. I get the product and it works all right - it sprayed my dog when she jumped on the bed, when she moved during her nap, and a couple of other non barking, non noise induced times. So now she is slightly more neurotic wondering why she is getting sprayed in the face every few minutes.I was looking for a way to return it - after searching the website I found there is no return because they consider the spray can to be a hazardous material - so then why were they able to ship it to me?I just searched the purchase page to see where it said that I cannot return it, it doesn't say it anywhere. I used 1-click so there were no other notifications anywhere telling me that I am now $37 poorer and stuck with a defective item.I'm really disappointed and will reconsider ordering from amazon in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"This spray stopped our dogs from barking but after 2 - 3 months we could no longer fill them. The refill would spray out all over the place. Couldn't get any into the collar. Replaced by the store and again, same issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I was really looking forward to amazing results after reading all the positive reviews, but unfortunately the collar did not work for my dog. She just continued to bark while being sprayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay for this product","review":"If you're considering this...buy it. You won't be sorry. My dog is a sweetheart, but she's very anxious and barked at every leaf that fell from a tree. After using this just a few times she got the message. Now i only put it on her and she absolutely won't bark...great for car rides, fast-food drive-up windows, friends coming to the house and she wanting so-o-o-o much of their attention that she won't stop barking at them etc...Whenever she was wearing the collar and would bark, a spray of great smelling citronella would shoot out at her nose. Yes it startled her and she didn't like it, but it didn't hurt her in any way and she smelled really good when it happened : )It is effective, not harmful, and a huge relief. Now i can take her places without worrying that she'll bark and disturb other people. The peace of mind is great!!! And now she gets to go many more places than before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly effective!!!","review":"I absolutely love this product!!! My dog loves to bark at anything and everything that comes near the house....people, animals, falling leaves. This could be a real nuisance to the neighbors especially at 5:00 AM. The barking stopped immediately the minute I attached my Innotek anti-bark collar! One bark.....one shot of citronella... that's all it took. I can now leave her unattended in my back yard without fear of waking the entire neighborhood. I no longer even need to turn the collar on, just the fact that it is attached around her neck is sufficient deterrent to keep her from barking. I am so impressed by the effectiveness of this product that I recommend it to every dog owner I know. Thank you Innotek...thank you!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!!!","review":"This product is horrible. It says it fits dogs of all sizes, but the collar won't stay on properly on my dog, who is a smaller sized dog, about 16 pounds. I've followed the instructions step by step and it just won't work.Instructions say to test by blowing into the microphone, which is the only way to activate the spray action. Barking does not do it. My dog barks and it won't activate the spray. I've even tested it myself by \\"barking\\" into the microphone and it will not spray.Bummer is because of the spray can included, this item isn't eligible for return. So now I'm stuck with a pricey, defective item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Results","review":"My dog got the message right away with the spray collar. To date, nothing else has worked efficiently. Shock collars, low level sound, nothing. The spray collar gave her the scent as soon as she barked or shook her ears (it is highly sensitive). I used it about 4 hours the first day and less than an hour the next. Now she doesn't wear it at all unless she picks up her bark. I expect that she will figure out her bark again and when she does, I have the spray collar to back me up. I like that it trained her and I can put it on her if the barking comes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"erratic and way too heavy","review":"This thing really did not work for my dog. He's 12 pounds and this was so big that it couldn't really get the proper fit without it being SUPER tight on him. As a result the spray was very erratic and only worked about 5% of the time. It also went off at other times. I called the company and they told me to change the battery. I did so -- out more money -- and it was still erratic and ineffective."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this product a \\"0 stars\\" if that were an option!","review":"I just wasted $40!

VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad collar, bad collar!","review":"This collar simply didn't work. I followed the directions, very simple really, and nothing. I made sure the reservoir was full, checked and rechecked the on/off switch, having my dog bark with it both ways - nothing. As a last resort, I took the battery to a battery shop to have it tested and the battery was good, but the collar is a dud. To add insult to injury I find out only after this experience, and deciding to return my defective collar, that Amazon has a no returns policy on this collar. Save your money and buy something else, I wish I had.UPDATE: Just to set the record straight, Amazon has refunded my cost of the collar. Thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!","review":"This product is a lifesaver! My dog literally barked all day and night I was at my wits end. I never thought anything would stop his barking, I fell for all the infomercial products that never worked. From the first time this collar sprayed I have not heard a peep out him, everyone that knows him is amazed! Whoever invented this product is my hero! I HIGHLY recommend this product to any dog owner that has a barking issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Was interested in something a little more humane than a shock coller for our Aussie shepherd. It's somewhat their breeds demeanor to bark, but we are trying to curtail it as not to upset the neighbors. She barks when playing fetch (barks until you throw the ball, barks at our other dog when he gets the ball, etc). The first few times she barked, it worked. She appeared to be confused and stopped barking. However, she quickly got used to the spray and it did not phase her one bit. She was barking constantly, and a near-constant spray of the Citronella did not affect her one bit.If your dog barks just occasionally, this very well may work. However, if your dog is a nuisance barker who barks continuously, you may want to try another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item defective","review":"The collar worked for the first few days then it stopped working. I ordered new batteries and replaced them, refilled the collar and it worked for a few minutes then nothing. I tried to return it and Amazon doesn't accept it as a return because it contains the citronella spray, which is considered hazmat. The fact that it was not a returnable item should be noted in the listing. Amazon quickly resolved the issue when I contacted them through chat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, can't return","review":"The product description says that it works on all sizes of dog. I have a 12-pound JRT-Chihuahua mix who is an insane barker. Three years of training hasn't worked and we needed something (our mailman changed routes because of her, and we have a baby who I'd like to nap). I was worried about shock collars on such a small dog. However, the unit on this was way too big for her little neck. It is heavy and bulky. It would have been fine if she were just sitting or standing all the time, but she couldn't lie down with it on. She was so uncomfortable. I need something she can wear all the time because I never know when someone is going to come to the door. Of course you have to cut the collar to make it fit so now I can't return it. I wanted to like this but it turned out to be a waste of time and money. We ended up getting a shock collar--the unit is smaller and in the end more effective for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless - don't waste your time and money","review":"Worked one time on my little rat terrier.

We almost had to sedate her to get thru War Horse. Got this product and it worked for about a month. Now she looks like she is having an epileptic seizure jerking her head back every time she barks and gets sprayed. This no longer works on her. Time to try a stronger method.

I mostly use it when I don't want her to bother the neighbors. Especially late night or early morning. I just snap it on her and I don't hear a peep.

I like the fact that it doesn't cause her any physical pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective but stopped working","review":"This worked really well for a few weeks and then just stopped working. Not a reliable product for $50+."},{"rating":"2","title":"I admit I was sceptic....","review":"....but it really does work. Our miniature schnauzer is a real barker. We couldn't have a normal conversation with people on the street, because he wouldn't stop barking. The only reason why I didn't give this product 5 stars is because our dog gets scared of it. After one bark he flees inside not to come out again. The citronella scent comes in handy to hold off mosquitos, but without it it would work just as well. He doesn't like things blowing in his face. Which is offcourse the whole purpose, but I don't want to scare him too much either. He doesn't know it's coming from that thing around his neck but thinks it's the location. For example: he doesn't want to go to the playground anymore, because it's where he got sprayed after barking at some kids. On the other hand, I still take him there without the spray collar and he hasn't barked once since!! All in all I think it's a great product and a wonderful alternative for things like a shock collar wich I would never use."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped functioning after a few months","review":"I purchased two collars and both worked great for a few months.

If it stayed put, I would give it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked at first.","review":"We bought this collar because our dog barks at his own shadow! Spraying him with water and verbally scolding him did not work. This collar seemed to work at first. My 22 lb dog would wear it and it would stop his barking very quickly. After 2 weeks he didn't care if the collar sprayed him, he would continue to bark and get sprayed over and over. Waste of money. Going to have to try another method!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked for the first couple of days","review":"This product worked for the first couple of days. The first few sprays distracted my lab enough, she would try to figure out where it came from, which caused her to forget what she was barking at. However, she began to get used to it and eventually she would bark over it. We wondered if the battery or spray ran out, but it worked just fine. We would watch her bark amidst a cloud of citronella spray! So if you have a stubborn or defiant dog, I'm sure the effect of the spray will wear off rather quickly and they will just ignore it. In fact, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. We have since tried the PetSafe PBC-102 No-Bark Collar which worked great. She stopped barking the first time and will never bark when the collar is on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bark didn't set it off","review":"I have a 5 lb maltese/bichon mix and i was sure this would help, but her bark (which seems pretty loud to me) didn't even set the device off.

She's 30lbs and the fluffy fur didn't matter as we saw the spray was everywhere in her face. She didn't care! I went through a can in less than a week...also replaced the 6v battery--which I do not recommend buying for $9 at Petsmart as Walmart, Amazon, and RadioShack are all much cheaper!

She was previously abused by a guy and has some fear issues.This was very big and heavy for her. Even after cutting the collar part to fit her neck, the bark box protrudes way out. It did not stop her barking and actually made her fear worse. She was scared to go in or out of her dog door with it on. It hit her door the first time she went out, and scared her. I had to let her in and out, defeating the purpose of having a dog door.It did spray out nicely when she barked and the Citronella made her smell nice, but the collar is now sitting in a closet.I would not recommend ths for a small or fearful dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"Multivet Gentle Spray Citronella Anti-Bark CollarThis collar worked fine, in fact better than the shock collar.

I said \\"quiet\\" as I did it. After the first time he was quiet for a few days then tried barking again. In a week I had to douse him about 4 times. Since then he goes weeks without barking and an occasional reminder keeps him in line.

And doesn't work","review":"I have a Great Pyrenees... she LOVES to bark at anything and everything, ALL the time... we have been successful controlling her barking with a shock collar but I'd prefer a painless alternative. I had high hopes after reading the many positive reviews of this product; I should have given more weight to the one and two star reviews. This has been my experience with this collar:The citronella spray deterred barking for ONE day. Then she figured out that if she just kept barking, the canister would empty out (the manual says this happens after 18-24 barks). My yard smelled great, but that was the only benefit!The nylon collar is flimsy and cheaply made... it would get looser and looser throughout the day until it was hanging off my dog's neck.But by far the worst news of all... the collar is not returnable to amazon!! I wouldn't have purchased it had I known this.My recommendation... save your money for a shock collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be your first plan of attack for barky dogs!","review":"I bought two.Spray product worked like a charm to stop my AussieShep/Mix from barking. Still using it 7 months later. It's a godsend.It worked for a few months to stop my bulldog/mix's barking, but he wised up and realized a little spray in the face was no big deal. Now he barks right through it.This product works...but it depends on whether you have a stubborn dog or not. I'm going to try a buzz collar for the bulldog but definitely keeping this spray collar for the AussieShep.I would really recommend the spray collar as a first line of attack though. It's not as expensive as some buzz/static collars and it's very humane and easy to use. Have not had to change batteries yet after 7 months.The only bad thing: sometimes it sprayed when the dog shook. Loosening the collar a bit so the dog could shake while the collar hung down helps. It still goes off when the dog barks...it doesn't have to be extremely tight on the neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product ever for dogs!","review":"Afetr living with a yappy doxie for a year, I was at my wits end.

Within two - three sprays, he realized what was happening and stopped barking. It, of course, does not stop them from whining because that doesn't trigger a spray. Unfortunatley, the product is so cheaply made that (as mentioned in other reviews) the collar adjustment does not stay so the collar either falls off or becomes loose enough for the dog to chew. Our dog chewed right through the collar by the third day (he hated being sprayed) and then when we went to put it on another collar, the plastic on the side of the sprayer broke and now it is useless. I will not purchase another product from this company due to their lack of quality workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware the return policy!","review":"I thought this looked like a great product and read all the glowing reviews, even went to the manufacturers website to look at others.

Deciding that it is not practical for us I attempted to return- To my great surprise it is not returnable!! Nowhere did I find information that this is considered a \\"hazardous\\" product!

I didn't want my Coop board sending me complaints about my dog's barking and the watergun just taught him how to duck. I am sure it would work great on a larger dog that could wear it all the time, but with a six pound dog he has a hard time eating with it on. Right now I just use it when I can tell he is riled up and is going to be barking at the door anytime someone comes up the stairs.

The pads are great for stopping fast from high speeds, but during slow stops from highway speeds (like while approaching tolls) the pads get too hot and I find myself needing to put more and more pressure on the brake pedal as I approach the stop.

For the price, the floppy convienience, great pictures (even in low light), and ease of operation, this is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Priced","review":"\\"lakeplacegames immediately addressed my concerns.

Example: When David Houston sings \\"Almost Persuaded,\\" his voice is out of sync with the music and does not have the emotion it did in the original recording. If you want to buy classic country compilations, the Time-Life Classic Country series is always a good choice. I also recommend Universal Music's \\"Pure Country Classics: The #1 Hits,\\" if you're looking for a great single-disc of classic country.

While there is some useful information, this book is mainly a consolidation of existing scholarship in one source. There is nothing new here save some letters sparsely quoted.

There were some interesting things (like examples of how memory can go wrong) but the infamous door handle example gets brought up over and over and over again. Jesus, I know there must be more things equally as/more interesting to talk about, please stop with the doors already. I would have preferred more cognitive science and less design manifesto (\\"design is important, design is important, design is important, blah blah blah\\"). I would have given it one star but I can see how it might be good for designers who are not very smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...had to change rating to ONE STAR","review":"Not a very useful book.Too much of the book was focused on how wrong it is to put a pull handle on a push door. Okay, kind of joking about that, but it seemed to be a recurring theme.Many examples of obvious things, repetitive themes, and unsupported data.Also outdated. Sure, good design concepts are timeless, but using DOS in a computer example should give the author a clue. Given this book's shortcomings, you would think the author would want to take every opportunity to try and improve it, and make it more appealing to a wider audience.Also very unstructured. It jumps around a lot without making solid points.Maybe worth the $12.00, but glad I didn't spend more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed a subtitle","review":"The subtitle for this book should have been petty whining about mundane issues. If you are the type of person who always complains that they are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, then you will love this book. The author evidently has too much time on his hands and has nothing more illuminating to write about than to find fault with, and endlessly complain about, the most trivial design issues. Light switches that don't line up with lights, stove top controls that don't line up, etc., etc. This book is neither interesting nor insightful. There is a definite lack of imagination at work (sadly, considering this is a book about design) which keeps the author from being able to appreciate simplicity and display creativity.This book was recommended to me, but I definitely cannot do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but useful information","review":"After reading so many wonderful reviews, and as a graphic / web designer myself, I expected lots of useful information.

In all honesty, Dr. Norman had some nice ideas, but listening to him drone on about his trip to Cambridge was tiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens your eyes to the usability problems of everyday life","review":"This book is fun for anyone: regardless whether you are an interested usability novice or a full-featured cognitive psychologist.It demonstrates the good and the bad in usability design, it shows potential solutions to everyday problems and tells many great stories about usability adventurues the author has experienced.After reading this book, you will become 'aware' like never before. It opens your eyes to the disasterous usability problems that surround us and how to correct them (if you are developing a product).You won't regret it if you buy this book; it's a classic in its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone that buildsproducts for use by humans. This book will be of tremendous interestto anyone that really wants their products to work intuitively. Products that \\"just feel right\\" are not an accident -- this book shows you the secret."},{"rating":"2","title":"A philosophy rather than specific guidelines","review":"In general, computer software is abominably designed. But I find most books on user interface design frustrating: they assume that if the designer just follows certain specific rules, the product will automatically be \\"user-friendly.\\" It doesn't work that way, folks: even if your menus are short and your use of color is discreet, the product may still be utterly unusable.Norman puts the focus right where it belongs: on the USER. What is this person trying to do with the product? What is his/her level of knowledge? How can the design of the product facilitate what the user wants to do, instead of getting in the way? This is a philosophy of design, rather than a set of rules. But the software designer (or any designer) who absorbs this philosophy will turn out far better products than someone who merely buys a book of rules and follows them blindly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is terrible!","review":"I love this book and own it it hard copy. I wanted digital versions of my books and bought this. The pictures are horrible, like copies of copies of copies on a 1960 photocopier. They are completely incomprehensible in a book where the visual images are critical to the message. This is not true in the hard copy of the book. It is impossible to read the pictures that have words in them (like the phone overlay.). I am very disappointed that such a great book was converted to digital so poorly. Stick with the old world hard copy and maybe in a new version, they will fix the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"good rule of thumb information","review":"While in University, studying Industrial Design, I would have rated it a 4 .... now I rate it a 2. It is still the rarest example of litterature on human perception affecting design. It still is unique, but you will not need to read it more than once, it is likely not to become a reference in your bookshelf BUT it is exellent for university/college level reading and book report to anyone studying psychology and or design. The book is full of anecdotes and lessons. It would be best if accompanied with a good textbook on perception. Reading some Papanek in conjunction with a perception textbook and this book will result in some well intentioned Design creativity I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting, Not Very Insightful","review":"While not completely un-readable, don't expect any \\"a-ha!\\" moments from this book.

It should be a must-read for every engineer and every engineering student as well as their bosses. But I found this book seems not organized well enough. The key principles should be highlighted more. The design of subtitles is confusing or at least helpless for readers to construct a clear structure of the contents. Sometimes in the later chapters, the concepts echo the key principles, but it's hard for a reader to remember those principles since it never helps readers to construct a clear concept structure. You have to either read this book fast and keep your brain clear, or take notes. You need to organize the book by yourself. This is why I only give a 4-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book even if you are not in Human Factors engineering","review":"I had to read this book for a course. However once I started it, I wanted to read it. All those oddball things like pushing the wrong side of doors, not knowing whether to push or pull, that we all do and blame ourselves, are not our fault. Something in the design led to our incorrect behavior. This is a fundamental concept of Human Factors and Don Norman captured it perfectly. A must read for Human Factors engineers and an interesting read for the rest of the world. I'm buying more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Very good, but very outdated at the end when computers were discussed.

As the author states, he changed the title from \\"Psychology of ...\\" to \\"Design of\\" - the former is more accurate and indicative of content.

The endnotes were utterly unuseable. Half of the notes were very interesting digressions and the other half were citations, but I couldn't tell which was which until I had spent three minutes flipping pages. And yes, it took three minutes to find the proper endnote. Every chapter's notes are numbered beginning with 1, so I frequently ended up on the right note number, but the wrong chapter. Even if you remember which chapter you were on by the time you flip back to the notes section, you can't always tell which chapter the notes are for; each chapters-worth of notes is labeled only on the first page, and they tend to be several pages long. Until the good Dr. Norman sees fit to reissue the book in a readable format, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview of Design Fundamentals","review":"Although I only read about half of this book, what I did read was quite good. This book presents some interesting insight into the design of everyday things, and provides amusing examples. I would recommend this book to engineers, designers, manufacturers, and pretty much anyone that is involved in the design process of any product. Some of the material is common sense, but after reading it from this book it just seems to sink in better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, better books available","review":"This book is a classic in the sense that it was once groundbreaking, in that it pointed out obvious flaws in industrial and software design. However, a lack of any updates outside of a new introduction leaves the book stale and dated. Complaints about the design of 1980s DOS software and VCRs is now of only historical interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a book","review":"It's a good book.

Once reading this book, one is no longer able to ignore the ergonomic, conceptual, and structural design flaws of everything from doors to complex information system interfaces. This book is clear and concise case-based information on how to recognize, diagnose, and design for usability in every arena. To the ever growing population of Information Systems and Web developers: you NEED this book for its insight on the human interaction experience; don't just develop an interface because you can- create a user-based system through the instruction of Don Norman's principles outlined in this book. Don Norman is a god!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading in high school.","review":"This is a common sense book that illustrates how many problems aren't due to it user errors - but to the designer's error. For example, how often have you guessed (incorrectly) when walking up to a new building, what door is the main entrance \\"in\\" door, and puzzled over whether that door opens in or out? The problem is not due to your lack of intellect - the problem was caused because the entryway's usability was not tested in the building's entryway door design, and therefore everyday users can not use them easily. If usabilty and good design were taught at the secondary school level, maybe we would all benefit from better designed homes, cars, highways, electronics, and web pages. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"super interesting","review":"great for artists, designers, programmers, architects, actually pretty much anyone who has an interest in they way things work, creative process, and design.This challenges the notion of lazy design, and goes against the issue of designing things the same way becuase that's the way it's always been done. Rewinds the design process and starts over. Shows design flubs and goes through the thought process and the intentions behind them. VERY interesting book, love the photographs and diagrams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Read","review":"Not exactly a page turner, it took me several months to get through this book. I enjoyed the content but the delivery was excruciating at times. Ultimately it was too textbooky for my liking. If you are looking for something that is engaging (a la anything by Malcolm Gladwell), look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow view on the subject","review":"The book is about proper design of door handles and appliance switches. Door handles should suggest by their size, shape and position if the door should be pushed, pulled or slided. The arrangement of switches should resemble the arrangement of the device, so that the right switch can be found easily. These would be two great introductory examples into the subject of easy-to-use design. But the book stays there and does not go anywhere further. This message could be conveyed in two pages instead of 257. I would expect suggestions about gathering user requirements and turning them into good design or applying intuitive design techniques to user interfaces of computer programs. Also, I think that most inconvenient designs that we encounter in everyday life that cost us a lot of time are poorly designed procedures rather than things themselves. Even though the title of the book includes \\"things\\", it could go into applying easy-to-use design principles into procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Expert, Heal Thyself!","review":"Great ideas from an iconoclastic psychologist. Unfortunately, rendered in a design that is more than unusable--it is hostile to the reader. The book is almost a parody of the ideas it attempts to communicate.

The author does have a collection of anecdotes about poorly designed items he's encountered but the constant whining gets tiresome very quickly. He then promised to offer some insights into how to get the design process right but never quite managed. The best he could come up with was these four bullet points:* make it easy to see what's possible* make it easy to see what's not possible* make it easy to see what happened* make the mapping between action and effect obviousEven if you do find those points insightful, you'll find that beyond examples of when those points are violated, there is precious little useful advice on how to achieve these things.The physical book itself was hardly a model of good design. The margins were far too narrow with some headings disappearing completely into the binding area and random paragraphs were set in italics for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"As a woman, I can truly say that I loved this book. Even though I love cars, a lot of books on the subject bore me to death, but this was an enjoyable read from start to finish.There were so many great pictures in the book! I loved the one of the GTO featured in \\"My Three Sons\\"! The pictures alone are worth the price of the book.However, the real meat is the story told by Milt Schornack and Keith J. MacDonald. They take you back in time to the beginning of the GTO and you really feel like you are there. In addition, some very interesting facts came out in the book that I wasn't even aware of.If you are even the least bit curious about the early days of the GTO or if you love classic cars and are looking for a great read, I highly recommend that you buy this book.Kudos to the author, MacDonald and Schornack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the Real Mr. Royal Pontiac Stand Up","review":"I have read Milt's book as coauthored by Mr. MacDonald from cover to cover and I must say I was impressed. I have met both Milt and Jim Wangers at car shows in the past. Mr. Wangers gives the impression that he was the inventor of the GTO and all the Royal Pontiac ideas were his alone. The real Pontiac afficionadoes know the truth. The book was awesome and really caught the spirit of the Great GTO. I read a review by some guy know as the Car Geek and I must say he certainly wasn't reading the same book I did. The old pictures which I had never seen before were great.

I rarely use it but when I do it works perfectly so the set gets a 4 star instead of a 3. The middle sized one, thin and long feels a bit too long to use well. I don't typically use it unless it seems to fit the project. Maybe this is more about my and my small hands and knife experience than the knives though which is, again, why they get a 4 star rating from me.The little one is a beloved knife to me. I use it all the time and it stays sharp and splendid. It fits great in my hand and slices really well. It is truly a joy to use. I always make sure it is clean and dry for my next use.

Very comfortable to grip and use, and they are super sharp. When they first arrived, my roommate ran his thumb over the edge of the chef's knife and expressed skepticism about its sharpness. So he picked up a piece of paper and sliced at it. The cut was quick and smooth. He was impressed. My experience cutting tomatoes--often a good test--has been the same.I had done a bunch of research before deciding on these knives. They are definitely a good buy, lots of value for the money. My only slight complaint (and it is really not much of one) is that they are advertised as dishwasher-safe, though hand washing is recommended. But when the set arrived, its instructions say specifically not dishwasher safe. It hasn't been a big deal. I wash the knives lovingly by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size matters","review":"Since I've never used a \\"good\\" set of knives before, I didn't rate these a \\"five\\" because I don't have the experience to know if they get any better. I can hardly imagine better. They make food prep a relative breeze. When I went shopping for these, I was actually just looking for one 8-inch chef's knife, a specific type, not just a description. The Vicorinox brand had gotten the highest marks from \\"Cook's Illustrated\\" besting much more expensive knives. However, nowhere in the product description or in any of the reviews could I find out what each of these knives were: I ordered them anyway. They are a 10-inch chef's knife, an 8-inch slicer and a 6-inch parer. I might have been happier with just the 8-inch chef knife, but this way I have three really good knives, not just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorinox knives","review":"My husband simply loves the sharpness and handling of these knives.

The blades did not feel weighted correctly. They felt way too light and therefore did not have a balance to them that we had sought out in knives previously. Also, I knew the description said 10\\" for the chef's knife, but I did not expect the size still. It was huge. I don't know that I ever would have used it. My boyfriend went to buy different knives at Bed, Bath and Beyond and ended up with a 3 set of Henckley knives for the same price, which felt much better to hold. I cannot comment on the blades as I never used the knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slice Like A Ninja","review":"These knives are a great value. Yeah, the handles are kind of cheap, but the blades are amazingly sharp for the price.

(Can't believe it's been that long)... In all of these years I have yearned for a decent set of knives, but shuddered when I would see the prices. These knives are awesome! I am so pleased with their super sharp blades. With a little tender care, these knives will give me slicing pleasure (if there is such a thing) for the rest of my life.

I thought Gold Toe would be a good buy, but not these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scholarly","review":"This book bombards the casual American reader with far too many names and references to obscure British individuals with whom Churchill interacted. It implies that the reader already knows a great deal about other British leaders such as David Lloyd George, the prime minister at the end of World War I.If you are a Churchill afficionado, it no doubt has some good tidbits. But for someone looking for a well-written and more general overview of Churchill and the times he lived in, this is not the right book.By contrast, Donald's book on Lincoln was far more manageable and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much churchill","review":"for a first time reader of churchill--this book was too muchthe style of writing is detailed to the point where i lost interestthe author obviously adores the man but this reader had to put it down several times and struggle to the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change titlle to \\"Churchill's Parliamentary life\\"","review":"If you are trying to get a round and complete view od Churchill's life, this is NOT the book. It is all about how Churchill is elected to the Parliament, his relationships with other MP, his speeches at the House of Commons, in summary there is not much insight into anything else.It is well written, strong British english, and I'd recommend it to anybody looking to learn the British Parliamentary system, similar to \\"Johnson, The Master of the Senate\\" book (American workings of the Senate), or if you have already read about Chruchill and want to get a deeper dive into his Parliamentary years, though, it is a long book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be a difficult read--and even more difficult to finish. There are parts that stick out as great tales of Winston Chuchill. But overall there are simply too many details. Unless you are student of British politics there are probably better books to read on this historical figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapdash writing.","review":"I didn't finish this book. Jenkins just throws his note cards at the hapless reader. The editor was awol. Stick with Gilbert. Alternatively, start with Manchester's unfinished bio (to 1940) & then switch to Churchill's memoirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"long winded and drawn out","review":"I read Roy Jenkins's biography of Churchill soon after Edmund Morris's The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Jenkins work did not compare. His writing was drawn out and labored, with extensive references to obscure members of the British aristocracy and long passages on parliamentary procedures. The author's constant reminder of his own career in parliament was an annoying distraction. The book's strongest section was the chapters on Churchill's wartime conferences with FDR and Stalin. I have always admired Churchill and I was looking for a well-written comprehensive biography. I am still searching for that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Churchill by Roy Jenkins","review":"We read this book for our book club. All members agreed that they did not enjoy \\"Winston Churchill\\" by Roy Jenkins. Besides being extremely long (900 pages!), members felt Jenkins focused on minutiae regarding Churchill's life while failing to convey why he was \\"the greatest Prime Minister Britain ever had\\", as the author repeatedly claimed. It concentrates on the details of political life, who said what, to whom and when, without discussing the impact of decisions taken. In addition, there is no discussion of what was happening in the world, ie, WWI, WWII, the fall of the British empire, rise of communism, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Bio!","review":"I cannot believe I read the entire 900+ pages. It was a very tedious endeavor, and I stress the word \\"tedious.\\" Even though this monumental tome went into minute detail on aspects of Churchill's life, most were not that interesting. I didn't really get \\"to know\\" Churchill as one does when one reads a biography by someone of the caliber of Robert Caro. I guess I should have read Manchester's volumes, even though it doesn't cover WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sir Winston As He Was","review":"We Americans tend to see Winston Churchill through the prism of a few months during the Battle of Britain when he stood alone in the world against the Nazis and fascism. As fascinating and dramatic as that period was, a full length biography of Winston Churchill gives the reader the proper context to appreciate Winston Churchill as the leading political figure of the 20th century. Roy Jenkins has authored an extraordinary book that only he as former M.P. and minister could write. The nuances of 10 Downing, Westminister, and Whitehall might elude other historians, but Jenkins knows all the slights and symbolisms of parliamentary politics. Jenkins concludes that Churchill was the greatest British prime minister of all. That's not an easy judgment from Labourite Jenkins who also wrote the award-winning biography of Gladstone. This book is a neccesary addition to the Churchill bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed With Knowledge!","review":"Perhaps the greatest tribute to the work of author Roy Jenkins is that, at times, he seemed to know what Winston Churchill was actually thinking - and you're pretty sure he's right. When the mind you're reading about belongs to perhaps the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Great Britain, Nobel-prize winner Winston Churchill, that is a pretty impressive accomplishment. Jenkins' biography is essentially unsentimental, and reveals Churchill's idiosyncrasies and errors in an honest manner that serves only to elevate, rather than tarnish, the legacy of the man who rallied the free world to resist the tyranny of National Socialism. Jenkins has written an extraordinary volume which we highly recommends to any student of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about content, sorry.","review":"Your guidelines ask for reviewers to stick to content. I would be glad to follow your directive, but I couldn't read this book. I'm a biblioholic, reading two or more books a week (no, I'm not retired!), and had a thirty-year career teaching high school English. I guess that what did it. I marched painfully through twentysome pages and gave up. The prose in this tome requires a methodical reader who can stand to go back again and again to decode just what sentences might mean. I should have known on the very first page. \\"But Churchill was emphatically not among them.\\" Just how is someone emphatically among others?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree It's Unreadable","review":"As with several other readers, I too found this to be a 900 page paperweight. Jenkins had a few bright spots where I was able to see into the heart of Churchill. I especially liked Churchill's early struggle over his perceived lack of education. However, Jenkins had a great opportunity to take us into the soul of a complex man, who, regardless of one's politics, helped to make and change history. I just wish Jenkins could have been the one to help me learn more about W.S. Churchill.Sadly, as with other readers, I put Churchill down for another book. It just so happened to be H.W. Brands' wonderful story on the Gold Rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst biographies I have ever read","review":"I have read many biographies, both about Churchill and other figures, and this is easily the worst I have ever read. For such an intriguing character as Churchill, this book does a magnificent job of making him dull and boring. The writing style is so labored and dry that it is almost painful to read. My advice: read a different biography of Churchill - they are all better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridgement or butchery?","review":"I realized it was an abridgement of the book, but I had no idea it was such a drastic one. Much of the text was truncated to the point of being clumsy in transition. In fact there were times when the cuts were so dramatic that one was left with some ambiguous antecedents. It was well read, but there just wasn't enough text remaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one-volume work to summarize Churchill's life","review":"With a person like Churchill, you can't imagine how you find new material to write about a celebrated life. I guess at this stage it's about style and what makes your biography slightly different than the many other books written about Churchill. This is a very readable book and you really get the feel the author gets into the head of Churchill. Of course there are lots of little interesting factoids about Churchill's life revealed as should be expected in 900+ pages. I also know that there is nothing like getting some \\"aha\\" moments when you thought you knew something about the subject and you find out you're wrong. I was quite surprised about Winston's upbringing. In summary, a very good book to expand and reinforce your knowledge about an amazing person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex political biography","review":"This is a book written by a British politician about a British politician and it assumes a good working knowledge of Parliament, British history 1880 onwards and the British Empire. As another reviewer has pointed out, it shouldn't be a first book about Churchill, but Roy Jenkins is an excellent, enthused writer and this comes through in the way he glorifies Winnie. Unfortunately, there is one criticism, which is the way the book simply peters out. At the start, RJ was dedicating pages and pages to certain events, some of which was guess-work, whereas in Churchill's later life there is precious little. In this sense the book cannot be called a comprehensive Churchill biog. But it is well-worth reading if you already know something about the subject and want to crawl deeper beneath the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read, and overwhelms with tedious detail.","review":"I do agree with one reviewer, that this isn't an appropriate biography for \\"first time\\" Churchill students. I do know a hodgepodge of facts about Churchill, and have read some of his writings, but never \\"had a go\\" at a biography wholely dedicated to him. I'm sorry I selected this work for a starter. It is analagous to opening Pandora's box in regards to names, positions--details and more details which are impressive scholarship, but an extremely soupy read, frankly. Didn't enjoy it at all. Must be better biographies of Churchill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Return to the Life of Sir Winston","review":"I have always enjoyed reading about Churchill and his life. When one does read a Churchill biography, he or she needs to rest since Sir Winston's life, though long, moved at an incredible pace. It has been a long rest, so I was delighted to read Jenkins' take on Churchill. Thankfully, he brought to me a refreshing look at a most prescient politician, scholar, keeper of the English language, soldier, statesman, and interestingly enough, artist. Jenkins' biography moves as quickly as Churchill's life...and all in all, it is a great tour de force worthy of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about it","review":"To say that this book is poorly written would be a gross understatement. It is not only boring, it fails to bring important context to the forefront. Finally, when I got to the description of Chamberlain as \\"the great man\\" I came to the inevitable conclusion that I had purchased the wrong book by the wrong author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a big disappointment for me. It was a short, quick read that ended far too abruptly. I think I'm simply getting tired of this series. The Stephanie Plum character is loosing her charm for me. She does not seem to grow in any way and doesn't seem to want to. My main problem with this character is her indecisiveness. Joe or Ranger? Make a decision already! Actually, I think the decision is obvious. Does she really think there is a future with Ranger? I must admit, I am probably the only female that reads this series of books that is not that fond of the Ranger character as a romantic interest. Yes, he's \\"mysterious and sexy\\", that's all well and good, but what woman would want to seriously become involved with a man who seemingly has no interaction with his only child? I will admit, I never get tired of Lula and Grandma Mazur. Those characters are always a lot of fun and they provided a few laughs. It's just not enough to keep me interested anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Stephanie Plum Novel","review":"I really like the series and enjoy Stephanie's typical little mishaps - but this one just didn't \\"feel right\\". As some reviewers have already remarked, the love triangle gets boring and her ditzy-ness in this installment really is more annoying then funny... I hope book 11 will return to its former class and charm.It is still a decent read, especially if you are a Stephanie Plum fan - but it's far from the charm and quality of the first few books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what up to snuff","review":"The ending leaves you flat, wondering, where do things leave Stephanie? Previous books have always ended with her and a man, whether you know which one it is or not, but this time it kind of just ends.I agree with many of the reviewers, I have always bought the book the first day it's released, and I feel cheated. Is Janet writing with someone else? Handing over the type-writer ribbon to a novice to get their \\"finger's wet\\"? This just doesn't seem like Janet's writing. No funeral home was really visited, they live in the burg and they're going to Dunkin' Donuts? What about Barbero's or Italian People's?And what about Juniak? Is he no longer in the book for a reason?Overall I was disappointed, but I'll still buy the 11th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"Frankly, this is probably the most poorly written Stephanie Plum novel in the series. The dialogue no longer feels authentic and many of the situations are just too over the top. The ending is thoroughly preposterous and feels as though Ms. Evanovich slapped it on because she had written enough. I agree with other reviewers that there is not enough interaction between Steph and Morelli or Ranger (Though I am happy to see more of Connie).Throughout my reading of the novel, I often wondered if Janet is even still writing these, or if they are some sort of team effort like her romance novel redux. I love the series, love Stephanie and the rest of the characters, but really didn't like this book. This added less to the series than the holiday novella--the characters really didn't grow at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this book if you're on a diet","review":"This was my first Stephanie Plum novel and it will probably be my last. I didn't think it was as funny as the author was intending. (could be a \\"chick book\\" thing?)And it constantly gave me junk food cravings that I thought I had conquered years ago. Especially the TastyKakes butterscotch krimpets.It gets 1 star because I did manage to get through it as I became used to the author's style and storytelling. But I could've/ should've missed this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"While I enjoy Stephanie's adventures, they are becoming a bit tiresome. I debated about even reading her latest book because I was bored with the last two, but since they are a quick read decided to forge ahead. I agree with other reviews; Janet needs to move these characters along. Maybe Stephanie should explore a new career that is less dangerous that showcases her strong points. I think like all great TV shows, this series has about run its course."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun!","review":"Stephanie Plum is back in \\"Ten Big Ones.\\" After losing yet another car in the first few pages of the book, Stephanie finds that she has accidentally enraged a local Trenton gang called the Slayers. The Slayers have called in a professional gang hitman that is called Junkman to kill Stephanie. While trying to dodge the gang related hit on her life, Stephanie happens upon the discovery of her young lifetime - Ranger's house, the so called \\"Batcave\\". Stephanie must apprehend several small time bail skippers and buy a gift for her sister's wedding shower before the gang members make their move on her.Evanovich has done it again! Ten Big Ones is absolutely hysterical. I laughed out loud all through this novel! Grandma Mazur and Lula are absolutely priceless. If you enjoy a good mystery, a really quick read, and some plain old fashion fun, then I highly recommend the Stephanie Plum series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the bad- It is actually a pretty good read","review":"I enjoyed this book. Many people complain about the lack of Ranger and her continuing inability to choose between Joe and Ranger, but I don't want her to choose. I like them both! The mystery is forgetable but I love the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still good...","review":"I liked this book for the most part. True, Stephanie or her situation hasn't changed much since the first book, but I still love her as a character. There needs to be more happening in the love triange between Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger. She needs to make a decision there or try something new or better yet, give Ranger more of a go instead of just flirting and the occasional kiss. My biggest complaint is that the ending was terrible. It was way too abrupt and there were so many questions left unanswered. It all came to a end much too quickly and neatly. There was a great buildup and then everything was over and all was fine and it just didn't work. It's like Janet was only allowed so many pages for the book and she realized she was getting close to the end so she had to wrap it all up. Disappointing, but I am still looking forward to number 11 and hoping it brings some needed changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"First few books in the series were pretty hilarious but this is just more of the same. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plum Ridiculous","review":"First, let me say that I LOVE Stephanie Plum! But this book was a big let-down. As fun as SP is, the plot for this novel just couldn't keep my attention. I mean, C'mon. There's a contract on her head, but she's running around shopping etc, as if she didn't have a care in the world. Totally implausible. But hey, if you need a book you can skim while tanning, then this is probably it. Buy it used. Better yet, check it out of the library. Save your $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a Tree","review":"I have enjoyed the Stephanie Plum series. I have paperbacks 1-6 and glad I didn't waste a tree or two on 7-10. I'm tired of the car blow-ups-goop in the hair-donut stuffing-gun slinging-mishaps. It was interesting to see that Ranger actually slept in a bed rather than hang from his toes at the top of a cave. The series has become too monotonous and predictable.What the \\"fudge\\" kind of ending was that anyway?Snap...snap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish and will not read anymore","review":"I have been reading the Plum series since they first came out and Janet Evanovich wasn't very well-known.

The series is getting down right silly and there are too many other great authors to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie Plum has \\"jumped the shark\\"","review":"I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum series but this one was a real diappointment. Nothing happened! It was as if Janet took pieces out of each of her other nine books and condensed it into one short novel. I got to the point where I found Stephanie, and everyone else, annoying. Either there needs to be some movement in the characters or retire Stephanie and start a new series."},{"rating":"2","title":"another plum ace!","review":"the stephanie plum series is the best ive read in a long time....i cant stop reading! this one was no exception....these are the only books i laugh out loud to. reads very well on the kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I loved how this book was a continuation of nine.

Overall, in my opinion this is great read that will keep your interest page after page."},{"rating":"1","title":"CJ Critt","review":"I'm listening to Ten Big Ones but the narrator is CJ Critt.

I own and have read them all except the lastest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this series?","review":"Either Aliens came down, abducted Ms Evanovich, and replaced her with a clone who cannot write or, even worse, the series has run it's course and the author has grown bored with the characters and run out of creative thought. If you are a fan and, like me, have enthusiatically followed the exploits of Stephanie Plum, you will be sorely disapointed by this latest installment. Bottom line--it is pretty bad. Have only about 50 pages left and it will be a struggle just to finish. Plot is weak requiring the Author to spend endless amounts of time on nonsense filler that has nothing to do with the real story. Still, there are some funny parts to the story, you will chuckle here and there. But these times are few and do not make up for the largely poor story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie's relationships are stalled.","review":"I have been a Plum reader for years, the murder plots are great but the romance triangle is stalled. Since this is a big part of the story line would like to see Stephanie grow up alittle and make a decision. She needs to have confidence in herself. I think Stephanie has been working this job long enough to start to get her feet on the ground. She also needs to make a decision on which man. She needs to tangle with Ranger or marry Joe and settle down; even if it means the the end of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten Little Ones","review":"I love this series and this book is a bitter disappointment. This is a short story, not a novel. The print is as big as a children's book with wide margins, if published in an adult font and format it would have been 100-125 pages. There are a few laughs, but it doesn't make up for the underdeveloped plot and the lack of growth in the love story triangle. Please Janet, don't publish Eleven until before you finish the book, let Stephannie grow and move the love story ahead (any direction will do, just move it ahead)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a stinker","review":"I have always liked Stephanie Plum, but this latest was a stinker. I know that this series is not meant to be taken seriously and Stephanie is a crazy girl, but the formula is getting old. The love triangle is never resolved, and the characters have become cardboard cutouts. I had a real problem with the end of the book - there wasn't one. It just seemed to come to a screaching halt with no resolution and a completely dumb final scene. I would not recommend purchasing this book. It left me hanging....and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I love these books. As a matter of fact they should totally make a tv series out of these books.

Have fun, buy it.. enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the series should have ended two books ago","review":"Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas. The series could be written by a twelve year old. Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes. You get the idea. Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though. She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list. It was only mentioned every other paragraph. Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does. Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment. If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should take me longer than 3 hours to read...","review":"a bestseller from the NY Times list. Hallo! Good to see everyone... always wondering what everyone in Jersey is doing and how everyone is getting along, even the niece who wants to be a horse entertains me. But for real it took me 3 hours to read this book. There was no savoring. The print is huge. And honestly there are a few downers...having two men like Ranger and Joe in your life and not putting them to good use is a waste. Yes, I love that Ranger's shower gel smells heavenly. I knew that already from my dreams. And sure I know other things too from my dreams. But those are not the \\"real\\" things that happen in Stephanie's world. I still really love Evanovich. I remain an avid and adoring fan. I just want more and I want it to last longer. All women want that, don't they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Delicious!!","review":"At repeated urging from several friends, I finally bought the paperback edition of ONE FOR THE MONEY. Finished it in one evening...couldn't put it down!! A couple days later, I located TWO and THREE, and sat up two nights in a row until 4am reading them. Last Friday, I bought FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT and NINE, closeted myself at home for the weekend and read FOUR through SEVEN, finishing at 2am this morning. I am totally addicted to Stephanie Plum's adventures!! Can't wait to get home from work tonight to start on EIGHT. When I finally get to sleep, all bleery-eyed from eye strain in reading, my dreams are filled with visions of Joe Morelli and Ranger. Janet Evanovich is great in weaving these adventures...and teasing us with Stephanie's love interests!! Can't wait for her next novel!!Oh, and P.S. I am a senior citizen!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed reader; Hopeful for #11 to be better","review":"I am quite disappointed with Evanovich's latest, 10 Big Ones. Like other readers, I could easily see that she probably wrote the first third and had a chance to develop it more (or her editor) and then rushed the rest. Where was her development editor?? It was his/her job to point out the weaknesses in the story and be the reader's advocate. Good endings should have some loose ends to spur me to eagerly anticipate the next book, but the sheer number of loose ends in this book just makes me frustrated. I definitely felt that I should have kept my money and waited in line at the library. If Evanovich is finding it this hard to write and is making the struggle so evident, perhaps it is time to wrap up the series and find some fresh material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing overall","review":"I love the Stephanie Plum series and was eager to read the latest. This book, however, did not hold my interest. I thought the plot was weak and the characters, with the exception of Ranger and Joe, were dull and uninteresting. In fact, I got annoyed with the frequent mention of donuts and the unbelievable stupidity of Stephanie.There were still some laugh out loud scenes but even they did not make up for the boredom of the book and the abrupt ending. I am so glad I got the book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The anticipation was better than the read","review":"I have been anxiously waiting to read this book since I learned of the release date. Hmmm.... it's just not funny to me anymore. The lines are old and the humor is just mundane. I didn't see any attraction between Stephanie and Joe or Stephanie and Ranger. This is the 10th installment and Stephanie still hasn't gotten the bounty hunter thing right? May be it's time for a new job. Or may be it's time for a new twist in the story. Something needs to happen to bring this series back to life. In the meantime, I'll just settle for reading the 11th book when it comes to paperback; if I'll read it at all. I'm starting to wonder if I'm reading more out of obligation instead of pleasure. May be the change for me is to start looking for another series to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rename Ten Bad Ones","review":"I have read all of the Stephanie Plum books; loved them at first, but they have gotten monotonous. The characters are just rehashing the same things in different settings. The writing is juvenile. The story was just plain stupid. I realize this is not to be taken seriously, but come on - some of the situations were just plain ridiculous. The blown up car bit has really had it. I just did NOT like this book. The only character that made me laugh was Sally - snap snap. It could have been written by a 12 year old; just plain awful. The ending? There was none. I think this will be the last Plum book that I read. A good series to read are the Sue Grafton books; much better writing and interesting stories. I am really sorry to see the Plum series degenerate into dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"another rushed writing job","review":"This book felt like abut 2/3 of what we expect from Janet Evanovich: too many loose details, scenes that start well and fizzle, characters acting too far out of character. It was a fun read, but nowhere near what I expected for either humor or plot. Worst of all, Stephanie seems to be regressing toward adolescence instead of maturing in this story, and that was particularly annoying.FYI: there seem to be a lot of defective copies of this book - pages 281 to 312 missing, repeats of chapter 12 and 13, etc, so check the volume carefully before purchasing. Every single one in my local store was screwed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wendy","review":"Janet does it again. Already buying the next one. Great plot and oh that Ranger. Can't wait to see what happens to Stephanie next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why couldn't it have been 1000+ pages???","review":"Ten Big Ones is probably the best Plum Novel yet! In the four hours it took me to read it, I did not stop laughing once - except to recover from my Ranger/Joe Hot Flashes. My god, why can't they be real???I don't want to ruin any plot points for those who have not read it... However, I will say I thought I was going to die from laughter when they were @ the beach house.Run, don't walk, to your nearest bookstore and fall completely in love with this series. The only downfall to finishing Ten Big Ones is that you will have to wait a YEAR for the 11th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Evanovich fan- terrible book","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer in that I'm not even sure Janet Evanovich wrote all of this book. The dialogue is not of the same quality and the plot is meandering and pointless. I am very disappointed especially because I thought the ninth in the series was the best one since the very first, One for the Money. Don't get me wrong, I know these are light and funny mysteries and I don't expect Brian Haig or John Sanford-like writing. However there is a reason Evanovich is as popular as she is and it's because she has written a high quality series of funny, quirky books. This does not match the level of the others. Wait for the paperback or get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, Redundant, Trite and Uninteresting","review":"This tenth book of the Plum series is difficult to get interested in. The author seems to believe that the same old, repetitive jokes of the last nine books will be enough to satisfy her readers so they are used (and abused) excessively at the expense of a plot. There doesn't appear to be any suspense, mystery or story here. This is a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!! AWFUL!! AWFUL!!","review":"The quality of this series continues to crater. Ms. Evanovich should concentrate on quality rather than churning out money. This book and her \\"extended\\" romances and the pathetic Christmas offering of a few years ago are insulting not only to her fans but to all readers. She's forgotten that it's the readers who put her where she is today. Pure drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Forehead Hurts from all the Slapping","review":"Exactly how many novels is it going to take before Stephanie Plum stops being a colossal idiot? The first 30 times her ineptitude prevents her from bagging somebody that any normal human could catch in their sleep were fairly humorous. Now, it's just plain annoying. She can't do anything right- ever. It's time for Stephanie to either improve at her work or hang up her cuffs. Of course, she doesn't HAVE any cuffs, since she continues to lose them. All I kept thinking through this entire book is, \\"She is the biggest moron ever!\\" I did not used to think this. I used to be amused by her. No more. Please, stop with the Lula and Grandma going out on busts. Pretty please. I'm only going to read one more book and if it's the same as the last 5 books, then Stephanie is on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Again Back to Square One","review":"Just when I thought Stephanie had finally gotten her act together and was finally on right track to being a successful bounty hunter after reading \\"To the Nines\\" it appears she's back to being the same old Stephanie who doesn't have a clue, who can't decide what man she wants in her life and always Ranger/Morelli running to the rescue, another car lost (what insurance company would give her car insurance?), no bullets in gun or for that matter where is the gun? Enough already!!!Why do I keep doing this to myself? Because I keep wanting to see Stephanie grow up and stop being the bumbling idiot that she is, but will that ever happen? At this point I am doubtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"In the past I devoured the Stephanie Plum books and couldn't wait until the next one was out. The past 2 have been declining but #10 was the worst. Where is the snappy, funny, original dialogue? Everything is soooo tired. I realize plot was never the strength of this series but puhlease.I am not looking forward to the next one and it pains me to say I don't really care about the characters anymore. I'm just glad I didn't spend any money on this junk and read a library copy.I think Evanovich needs to take a break from this series for a while. She's disappointing die hard fans and for me, that's saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie","review":"Still love reading the Stephanie Plum series. The story line is still good..I still laugh out loud while reading..if you like this series you won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I thought that book 10 was better than 8 and 9. This one seemed more fresh or something to me. The new details about Ranger were wonderful...I'd love to see more develop here! This is a great book. Buy it, especially if you are a lover of the Plum novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I nearly died laughing","review":"Stephanie Plum reminds me of my friends and family. For those that didnt find this book entertaining have never had a Lula in her life. I have and I nearly died laughing from her lingo and her craziness.I read the book in one sitting...and was brought to tears during the scene with Connie, Steph, Lula, and the kidnapped thug. I even read it to my husband and I ruined it by the non stop laughter.Im new to this series and started reading at 9 when I picked it up at JKF airport and I was drawn in. I love the fact that you dont need to read the other books prior to get the gist of the relationships...and Evanovich makes the 1st chapter of the new book the last chapter in the previous...at least thats what I noticed between 9 and 10.Its definitely a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it but......","review":"I can say i liked this book alot...but I didn't LOVE this book. Things seemed to be missing, while other things were too much in the spotlight. I didn't like the ending very much. Does Janet not know that Victoria's Secret makes the MIRACLE bra, not the WONDERBRA? I guess I'm fit to be tied until number 11 comes out for us to find out what happens with Valerie and Albert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Up and all Janet Evanovich novels after","review":"It was a huge disappointment to listen to the books narrated by King as she is so far inferior to Critt. Do not buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal parts laughter and mystery","review":"If you haven't read Evanovich, don't start here--start with One and work your way up, because the character development is significant to the plots, and you just won't get as much enjoyment out of the book if you aren't acquainted with the characters and especially Stephanie Plum's relationship to them.Evanovich does not write rocket science, and her work will likely never be listed in the bibligraphy of anyone's doctoral thesis, but if you're headed for the beach, or have a quiet weekend ahead, take Ten along--you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun read!","review":"I had grown a little bored with the last couple of books in the Stephanie Plum series, but this one grabbed my attention and found me hooked yet again. Lets be honest, we don't read these books because they're great literature, we read them because they're fun. But the formula had grown a little tired for me. I think this book is an improvement over the last for two reasons. One, Stephanie is starting to grow somewhat as a character. She is even able to apprehend some fugitives with -- dare I say it? -- a minimum of disasters. She's starting to ask herself why she and Morelli have the same on-again, off-again, encounters year after year. But the real reason this book held my attention was the increased level of sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger. Personally, I find the Morelli relationship played out anyway. But with ranger, this volume definitely turns up the heat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"this is one of the better stephanie plum novels. all of them are a great read, but this one ranks among the top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Comedy Mystery Adventure","review":"If you liked the other books in the Stephanie Plum series, this one will not disappoint you. I listen to the audio versions of the books in my car. Sometimes I laugh so hard that I can barely keep my eyes open. Janet Evanovich makes you sorry when her books are over. I listen to them multiple times. In Ten Big Ones, I was especially happy with the return of Sally Sweet, one of my favorite characters from Four to Score."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dud!","review":"The earliest Stephanie Plum books were cute, not great, but entertaining. I haven't read the ones in between, but this one is so dumb as to defy description. The writing,the dialogue, the characters. Beyond description. Far more comic book caricatures than comical characters. I won't be reading another of these books because I can't be sure when they started going downhill. Read the first few in this series and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move the characters along","review":"I agree with other reviews that the book needed to be longer. If the words about food was taken out it would be a short story. It was padded with ridiculous scenes. The relationship with Morelli was boring and almost to the point of I don't care. I got very bored with Grandma and Lula. They really need to be kept as secondary characters and their mouths shut.I would have loved to see a book written about Ranger and Morelli with Stephanie left out. I still like those two characters but fed up with Stephanie not growing and being better at something.Don't bother buying a hardback book. You won't miss much waiting for the paperback. Actually I am sure that the discounted hardback books will be plentiful, which will be cheaper than the paperbacks. It was ashamed for this book to be printed as is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, Same old","review":"It hurts me to have to say this about a Stephanie Plum novel, but this book was tired and dull. Nothing new to the story line, Stephanie hasn't grown or progressed much, and this book was missing the normal laugh out loud moments so prevalent in the past Plum books. I hope that the next installment will be reenergized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 10","review":"Over the years I have laughed till I've cried over the adventures of Stephanie Plum. Janet Evanovich has a really keen sense of humor, mixed nicely with warm, if ambivilant, family feelings and a talent for writing a good mystery.\\"Ten Big Ones\\" is as good a book as I've read since the last Stephanie Plum novel. I do see a difference in this book (along with \\"Hard Eight\\" and \\"To the Nines\\") and her first seven. In the earlier Plum novels the humor was more slap-stick/Lucy & Ethel. Since \\"Hard Eight\\" there has been a darker, more serious side to the comedy. I am a huge fan of the mystery genre and am a voracious reader, and it is my opinion that \\"Hard Eight\\", \\"To the Nines\\", and \\"Ten Big Ones\\" can hold a candle to all comers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and repetitive......","review":"I have read all of these books. I loved Steph thru about book six. I kept reading to see if the triangle between Steph, Ranger and Morelli would get resolved. Despite some interesting characters, this series is getting tired and repetitive. It's not that funny to see Steph's car get wrecked for the umpteenth time. Time to wrap it up with Number Thirteen, Janet!! Quality over quantity...and Loyal Readers over Dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me laughing","review":"It was too short in a good way. I had a great time reading this one as I always do with her books. It had me laughing the whole way. I wouldn't have put it down if I could have managed but work and a two month old baby have their own ideas. Looking forward to her next one...a year is too long to wait. If you haven't read any of her books I recommend you do..she is a great author and her books are very entertaining, are fast paced reads and overall a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"grow up already!","review":"After you read TEN of these books her naivet�� gets to be grating. Surely by now she has learned SOMETHING. It quits being cute and funny. I loved the first books but the character has grown NONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"There seemed to be too much repetition of trivial facts but not much actual interaction of Stephanie with any of the other main characters. Seemed more like fluff to me than the first books she wrote. I probably won't reread this one as I have the others. Would like to see more Joe or Ranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as the previous nine!","review":"Janet Evanovich has done it again! She has kept me up all night laughing and wondering how Stephanie will get herself out of this predicament. However, this book lacked something the other nine did not. I am not sure what it was, but I know I missed the cliffhanger-ending that the other nine had. Still this is a wonderful, easy-read, that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series has lost it's sparkle","review":"The first three of the Plum series were very fun reads. Now it seems worn and tired. To The Nines was not worth the hardback price, so I read this one in the bookstore and put it back. (Its a fast read...wait for it at the library or paperback) Evanovich needs some fresh ideas for this series, she can't string us along with the same old any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash.","review":"groan!This had to be one of the worst books I've read in ages. I could barely suffer through it. Characters were poorly developed. I have tossed this garbage in the fireplace. At least there it is put to good use.Secret Life of Bees had rich thorough character development (as an example of quality workmanship)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good - but, not her best","review":"I just finished Ten Big Ones and I closed the book feeling vaguely disappointed. There were parts where I laughed out loud and lots of tension, but something was missing from this book. I thought that Joe and Ranger were both a little flat in this book. I didn't feel a strong pull to either of them from Stephanie. The ending just didn't feel like the ending to me - there should have been one more chapter. All in all, I enjoyed Ten Big Ones, but it was definately not my favorite Plum book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped short","review":"I love Stephanie Plum and all of the situations she finds herself in. It is always a laugh out loud read but this time I felt short-changed at the ending. I got the sense that the book was printed with the last chapter or two missing. I felt like I was left hanging and that things were not wrapped up with Joe and Ranger and the rest of the crazy bunch. Other than that it was pure Plum action. I guess I'll just have to wait for 11!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING - BORING","review":"I can never wait until June/July each year for the Publication of a new Stephanie Plum. I love this series. But, unfortunately 8 & 9 seemed to lack originality and now 10 hits the jackpot for boredom. I have always loved the humour and the characters and when I re-read the earlier books I find them just as entertaining and amusing as they were on the first read. Stephanie in 10 I find, annoying, boring and childish, she is like a record stuck in a groove. When is she going to grow up!!! It would be much more interesting if the characters and their relationships evolved. This book started off OK but it is as if the author lost interest or lost the plot after the first couple of chapters. The ending is so abrupt I think in the end she lost interest completly. I hope Janet Evanovich can rectify this in the next book, if she can't she should finish this series and try something new, because Stephanie in her current persona is really getting old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud with this page turner!","review":"This book is hilarious. The plot line is secondary to the author's witty banter. Had tears in my eyes after reading the first few pages. I like the characters and am looking forward to the next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and enjoyable................","review":"I've been waiting to read this book after not really enjoying the last few books in this series. I am so glad that I picked this book up. A laughfest from pg.1, I eagerly dove into this book and just finished it. Will not go into a synopsis of this book because so many others have,but I enjoyed this book and to me it's one of my favorites. Sweet Sally makes a comeback,Grandma Mazure is at her funniest,Lula is a riot and Stephanie loses another two cars and gets kidnapped,just like old times. I know that sometimes these books have a way repeating each other, but so far I have enoyed all but two of the series. And the best of all is Ranger and Joe Morelli two of the hottest hunks and the suspense builds between both. Who will Stephanie end up with? Knowbody knows. I highly recommend this enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun!","review":"Goofy and exciting at the same time. I love the adventures Stephanie Plum gets herself into. All the women in my family have read or listened to and loved this book. We had a multigenerational discussion on who we liked better - Joe or Ranger! What a great story - it was fun and exciting at the same time. I listened to the unabrided CD version and recommend it for a long car trip. It will definitely keep you awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a pretty good book, but...","review":"I thought the book was good but the series is getting kind of long. I have read all the books and it's a really good series. But what is going to happen with Steph and Morelli? Are they ever going to ever get married or even just stay together without having a fight. I think I'm not the only one in saying that Mrs. Evanovich should make movies. I know if I was making the kind of money Mrs. Evanovich is making off these books I would keep writing also.. but don't keep with the suspense!~*wOLf*~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is the best one in the series yet...wheter you've read one or all of the Stephanie Plum series this book will keep your interest from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only being a mystery would have made it better.","review":"After reading the first chapter I wasn't impressed and didn't think I would even finish it. It was my first book by Janet Evanovich. But once I got into it and got to me Stephanie's family I couldn't put the book down. I only read at night and was up till close to midnight last night so I could finsih it. That is late for me nowadays. My only complaint would be that I prefer mysteries and this was more of a crime book. But I enjoyed so much I started reading 11 on Top last night even though it was late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same-old, Same-old","review":"This book shows signs that it was rushed to meet a deadline; hence, the lack of development. Good serial books, regardless of genre, have either a plot that develops the storyline or a plot that is new; this book has neither. After reading the book, which took about an hour, I realized that this was a \\"filler\\" book, which included recycling parts from her previous books. Stephanie Plum, at the end of the book, is pretty much in the same place she was in at the beginning of the series. Perhaps Ms. Evanovich is frightened to mess with the formula?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanovich needs some fresh ideas for these characters.","review":"This is by far my least favorite of the series. The story lacks excitement and I'm getting frustrated with Stephanie's inept lifestyle. Maybe it is the way it is written. Maybe it is the rehashing of the same old scenarios. It's just not as riveting and as fun as the other books. Don't get me wrong. I will read any future Stepanie Plum books that Evanovich produces. I am still interested in how these characters and their situations are resolved. But this one is a clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Morelli!!!","review":"I have read all of Janet's books. Forget her outside romances, but her numbered ones are entertaining. One and four are the best so far. I read them for Morelli and Ranger. They were pretty much wooden here. But the rest of the book is an amusing read. Get them from the library. They really arent worth the high price of a hardcover, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud in the doctor's office reading this one!","review":"What a great book! Funny and a good thriller, too. My first Evanovich book, but I bought another before I finished this one. I am not usually an emotive reader, but this one had me laughing from the first page and kept me going all the way through. The staff at the doctor's office are all going to read it after watching me enjoy it.

Speaking of guilty pleasures, Ranger is the only fictional character to ever get my pulse racing.Bring on the Plum movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Plum after another","review":"Had to sent this off to a friend in Germany so they could get the great Plum adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Plum and Junkman","review":"I marvel at the fact that some writers can be consistently humorous over a long series of books, and this author is one of those people. Not only do we get an interesting story, but there is humor all throughout the book, some coming from the situations, and a lot from the totally wierd people that inhabit its pages. This series is one that, occasionally, I have to laugh out loud. It doesn't bother my wife, however, since she's already read the books first and done her out-loud laughing already. I hope this series continues ad infinitum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valtorta","review":"These books are the basis for the opening in my heart to the love of Jesus.

Too much of his presentation is breathless, so that everything he says comes off as THE most shocking/impressive/awesome thing he's ever said.

I study abit of western history aswell and I found out that the reason why the west advances IS because they are IMPERIALISTS, they took ppl's land and steal their resources and copy their techs.

From the beginning of the book, Stephen is a genuine knight in shining armor. He seems to be real with Lauren about how he feels, and what he wants. Yes, their love story moved very quickly but sometimes that happens in real life so that wasn't the issue for me. My issue was Lauren had such a victim mentality. First, She wasn't honest with anyone about how she felt for Stephen. Second, She always fell back on the whole 'my husband cheated on me and I had my heart broken so I am protecting myself from being hurt' thing. Finally, she didn't take any real responsibility for her actions, i.e. keeping a disk on her guy for \\"research\\" and wasnt going to tell Stephen she was pregnant. The girl didn't deserve the guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I could definitely feel the love between Lauren and Steven. Just reading their love story gave me butterflies in my stomach. This was my first time reading a book written by B.A.Osahor, and she did a fantastic job with this book. It was very well written and the plot was easy to follow.I already read it two times, it was that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary","review":"This book was not romantic. It was scary. What woman in her right mind would date a mind who has been watching her for weeks? She comfortable enough to use the bathroom with him in the room, she moved to another town with him yet they still didn't know each other's birthday. That didn't make any sense at all. Another thing that bothered me is that Stephen never wanted to talk about his past! Almost everythig she learned she learned froom his friends. SCARY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This book could have been really really good, but things moved too fast. I really thought that things would move nice and slow for Lauren and Steven but by the third date they are sleeping together, and a month later they are living together. I liked the plot it was weak, but good enough. I hated how Lauren gets pregnant, and then there is very little mention of this growing child inside of her except for the occasional gesture to her belly she makes, also getting married in 6 months is also unrealistic and does not make any sense for the Lauren character who was so afraid of commitment before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daewoo - you get what you pay for","review":"Every DVD we tried freezes for a few seconds and then \\"catches up\\" but jumping ahead.

I was greatly curious about the road that slithered through so many of the stories in this book. I'm quite positive I would have jumped out of any vehicle and walked, while pressed like wallpaper to the rocks and cliffs that were farthest from the edge.

It was not what I expected. Far to much swearing for me and left me feeling like what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time movie","review":"I was tricked by the cover into buying this boring and uninspired movie. Instead of having the main character educate himself on his health or really look at his reasons for eating, he just runs away to the woods. It shows very little of him figuring out what to eat and how to fix his health, and too much on time showing him just laying around. A much better movie is Fat,Sick and Nearly Dead, which shows two men really working through the health issues in an informative and interesting way. The other reviewers must be related to the writer. There is no way that this deserves 4 or 5 stars. It's just a less interesting remake of Fatso, the movie by Dom Deluise. The only reason this gets one star is that there is no way to indicate a half star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watched 12 minutes Hate it","review":"Sorry this type of show is not for me.

But the best part, the message we all need to get is that change isn't easy, people around you won't change because you did, they may not even like or appreciate the change, you have to change for yourself and you have to accept yourself. All the rest of the film was baby steps to get to that message while making it meaningful without lecturing.

It is a true work of art, and the 3 Brown originals are a wonderful addition to the classic pieces. Geoff Keezer and Karriem Riggins are wonderful young jazz musicians and complement Ray Brown perfectly while not hogging the spotlight. This is one of my all-time favourite jazz albums, and I can never get tired of hearing it.

I sincerely doubt it would have any appeal to a non-member. It is not a book on techniques for growing Bonsai in a desert climate. Rather, it is a trivia and date laden, difficult to follow, historical overview/ramble on garden societies, Asian-Americans in America, with vast and (to my mind, uninteresting) lists of old members, who's plant won at what competition, and reminiscences of old meetings. If there are any tips on actually growing Bonsai in a desert environment, I was unable to find them in approximately thirty minutes of effort, and frankly, after skiming the book I had no desire to actually attempt to read it cover to cover. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A history of the club with essentially no bonsai info.","review":"The book would have general interest for those who belonged to the Phoenix club and wanted a record of its history. However, I purchased the book based on the \\"review\\" provided by Amazon.com, in which it was implied that desert bonsai techniques were discussed. After much digging through the book, I found nothing on what it takes to grow and maintain bonsai in desert environs.

It seems everyone connected with Dr. Bill Cappa (Bruce Willis) keeps dying in strange ways that are never fully explained. The killer is likely from a group of crazies that Willis presides over but we never really connect with any of them. Willis, looking buffed and not shy about baring it all, is miscast. His laughable dialogue includes lines like \\"People are dying around here and you act like its Disneyland!\\" Jane March is beautiful but can't act - but Lesley Anne Warren and Brad Dourif, who can act, are stunted by a terrible script.

Bruce Willis was a pleasure for the eyes and the mind. And it had that staple of any good movie to me--you really couldn't guess what was going to happen next.

That Willis, Scott Bakula, Leslie Ann Warren, and Eric La Salle all lent themselves to this bomb is unbelievable.

Even though the script is just awful, director Richard Rush brings enough energy and style to make it entertaining.The acting ranges from bad to worse to just plain ridicoulus. Jane March is too cute and sweet to be convincing as the mysterious femme fatale. Ruben Blades and Leslie Ann Warren are just annoying. And Bruce Willis tries his best. Only the alway-excellent Brad Dourif manages to escape with his credibility intact. His performance as the neurotic lawyer is the strongest performance in the whole movie. The film is nicely shot by the late cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann, and composer Dominic Frontiere provides and excellent score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 20 Of All Time","review":"Okay, so the acting sucks, the actors aren't attractive (other than in this one we get to see more than Bruce's butt), and it's not a movie you really would sit down with friends to watch as a general rule! But the twists and turns are great, it has one of the best murder scenes out of all movies, Bruce gets naked and we all can point and laugh at the little thing, and there's plenty of blood and gore along with sex and promiscuity to make up for a lifetime! I would recommend it, but you have to watch it more than once to understand it...I have seen it probably 10 times and each time I watch it I realize more and more details that make the movie make more sense!

For those looking for something worthwhile to mention in this movie, the only two good things I can say is that Jane March is very good-looking and she can simulate an orgasm quite well.

Willis is the only one who seems to be halfway trying to act. The script was as bad as the fictional \\"Beverly Hills Gun Club\\" on ACTION, but without the irony. Scott Bakula's acting (especially his death scene) was so awful I hope it was intended as a salute to Argento's DEEP RED, rather than the unintentional humor it appears to be.

If you are expecting Vertigo or even Fatal Attraction you are hopping the wrong train. This is pure goofball entertainment. The sex scenes are fun(Thank you, Ms.March),the violence is over the top(conceptually cribbed from Italian giallo, no doubt), the dialogue is inane(beautifully so, I think), and the plot and its many twists are plenty outrageous(as in, \\"oh, come on...WHAT?\\"). Did I mention the supporting cast? All of your favorite \\"whatsis names\\" get a chance to chew the celluloid in an attempt to \\"out crazy\\" their costars(BTW, Brad Dourif wins-AGAIN).

Not only did the gratuitous sex and nudity not lend itself to an already bad and unbelievable plot, it just prolongs the viewers agony. Maybe, MAYBE if the sex scenes were even remotely sexy, my rating would have gone up a notch. I won't even waste my time critiquing Ms. March's performance or lack thereof. I'd like to meet the person who told her, \\"Jane, you really need to go to Hollywood 'cause you've got talent.\\" I'd like to meet that person and slap him/her.

I suppose you could get some big football players to play the Herans but 6'5 300 pound guys don't get a lot of acting experience outside of pro-wrestling. Plus the spider character would be expensive to animate. Since we've seen the last of the Next Gen characters in the movies, books like this make for a worthy substitute. Very glad I picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, not great.","review":"This is a well-above-average Star Trek novel; it has good pacing, good characterization, smooth writing, and a fair to middling plot. It almost fell into the trap of being just another of the many Star Trek novels with the \\"crazy, out-of-control admiral\\" plot, but managed to more or less mostly avoid that pitfall. It puts a somewhat different spin on the usual \\"genetically engineered supermen\\" plot, too. Since I don't really care for the first of these plots, even seeing a near-miss cost the book a partial star, and while I don't mind the other and found the twist to be interesting, I still feel that the basic concept is overused, so that was a small negative, too. And the suggestion that Riker might be descended from the followers of Khan is rather dubious. So all in all, I'll give the book four stars for a very good effort, but not five. It has too many overused plot points for that high a rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book to read.","review":"I liked the book. I could not put it down.

Thus, future users will need exceptionally well-prepared materials to learn it well.This book is an excellent start, with numerous tutorials and videos, but the reader will definitely need additional materials.Lynda.com is quite well resepected for its tutorials, and rightly so, though I personally find them rather dry (in comparison with the Total Training series). Author Daniel Short, while undeniably a talented, skilled and capable instructor, has a voice that could be bottled and sold as a prescription-strength sedative.The book is an ideal supplement to the Lynda.com series, and could even be considered critical to adequately grasping Dreamweaver, but the section on CSS falls seriously short in conveying understanding to the neophyte.I do recommend this book (even highly), but hope that Mr. Short and Lynda.com can address these shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can follow lessons, can't work independently","review":"OK, so I'm half-way through Chapter 15 and this book frustrates me. I'm on a Mac, so that offsets the instructions by one jog. It doesn't help, either, when Mac instructions are given incorrectly, or not given at all.Most of my software learning has been from books, not classes. This is my first experience of being able to follow exercises, but then not being able to work on my own. There is no sense of where to begin to build a practice site. For my style of learning, it is not helpful to be shown one way to do something, then to be told, \\"Don't do it that way.

He and his routines had matured over time, just like a good wine, and I think that show is much better. (Jeff's kids are teenagers now, not newborns, and he's got a hilarious routine about the womenfolk trying to get ready for church -- and he decides to make himself comfortable since it's more likely than not that the family would miss the service.)

The entire family can enjoy this comedy as it is not R-rated like many other comedians. Nothing wrong with R-rated but Foxworthy provides laughs without the hardcore language or body motions many comedians must use to get you laughing. This \\"good ol' boy\\" humor is fun,clean & intelligent.You don't even have to be Southern to find this Redneck humor amusing. You may not laugh out loud at everything but it's worth the money & time to enjoy it.

They're inexpensive, but don't look cheap. I've received lots of compliments on them, even now that they're about two years old and a bit beaten-up. The upper is thin, but soft and flexible, which makes the shoes feel very comfortable right away (there was no break-in time required). The soles are slightly padded, though you'll still feel the street beneath your feet, but what else can you expect from flats? You do get a bit of toe cleavage, but I don't mind that. They're cut a bit low at the sides, which I think is attractive, yet they manage to stay on my feet nicely. They feel very light and because of the leather upper, let your feet breathe. I plan on buying another pair because they're also really versatile.

I learnt from this book in the beginning and I'm making great progress. The only negative points I can see are that some of the exercises are a mystery to me, (\\"hey Charles, what the hell is a Russian Good Morning?\\"). And the pictures are a bit second rate. The quality is good, and you can see a whole pile of well developed muscle groups that are being referred to, but that's because a lot of them are steroid freakshows.

While Coach Poliquin works mainly with professional and olympic athletes striving for strength and power, he makes it clear that the scope of this text is to build mass. I really found the material in this book useful and include it as a staple in my training. While Coach gives a ton of in-depth, research-proven info, he's not afraid to throw in some comedy here and there, lending to the book's unique and enjoyable tone.

The reader has to review the entire text, not just the pictures. Poliquin rarely wastes any words when it comes to strength training. In order to understand what is being said you need to start from the begining of the book and read the entire book. His understanding of the body and how it fuctions is well researched and put into practice and is very successful.

I would have preferred that Franklin focus more on the out-of-box control than the DSS (a vendor) Winsock control.

It's not that the buckle comes loose; rather, it just slips up over the headrest and falls to the floor. I think this is because of the kind of headrest I have.

Unfortunately, he allows his dislike of Montgomery to color his work, and an ex-army officer who should know better than that. Whether D'Este likes it or not, there is no Allied Commander with a battle-to-win ratio that touches Mongomery. He was not Manstein, but was a steady hand, and sadly D'Este's selective research, based on a personal bias that appears is his other equally poorly resarched books, fails to take this into account.This book is a good read, but its conclusions are 'different.' Remembering that no one ever makes good money without finding something new to sell, D'Este's approach is understandable but less than professionally commendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very balanced, well-researched","review":"This is an excellent book, and leaves it clear that Montgomery was not a great and able strategist.

It seems like people are afraid to talk about the subject, like they have the need to be politically correct or not to hurt anyone. I understand why but if you decide to write a book about subject do a good job regardless of the circumstances. This book relates the facts and everyday life in the camp the way it was. An author shares his feelings and thoughts. He describes behaviors (sometimes worse than barbaric) and survival instinct in the purest basic form. I liked this book. It is written well and it keeps reader at full attention. Chapters and story line flows smoothly. It's a book that describes harsh reality of the concentration camp that I wish no one every would have to go through again.

It remains the most powerful memoir of any Holocaust survivor, bar none. Muller is in the same league with Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski and Jorge Semprum (Literature or Life), although his account in no way approaches the literary. It doesn't have to. The details are searing by themselves--including the escape of two prisoners who fruitlessly warned the Allies what was occurring. These permanently imprint on the reader's memory. What lends Muller's account biblical proportions is his proximity to the evil heart of the death machine--throughout the war--his daily witness to mass murder, his memory of individual victims who fought to the last. He shows the grisly, methodical progression of Nazi inhumanity, the virtual-impossibility of escape, and the fierce spirit and repeated miracles one required to survive. Alyssa A.

She articulates things that are hard to articulate, about the process of writing. And she is very democratic; she believes everyone can write (or create) and should. What's also nice is that each page deals with a different aspect of writing, and is short and sweet. It's not a lot of verbiage you have to wade through--Cameron makes her point easily and effectively. No matter how uninspired you may feel, or how fearful you might be, when you read even just a few pages of this book, or the bigger book, \\"The Right to Write,\\" you will suddenly feel a strong desire to write.

In these cases, it would have been nice if they were included (by the way, I highly recommend the dictionary to go along with the novel).

Examples are only useful if they show the working of some underlying general principle. In this book, however, examples simply stand for themselves. The stories are nicely written and it is fun to read, but it certainly does not present a theory of successful teams. But maybe, as an academic economist, I am too demanding in this respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappoint, a voyeurs view of effective teams","review":"The book is a review of other books and as such provides little insight into its title. The book is poorly structured with examples repeating each other to the point that it looked like the authors were tyring to fill up the pages rather than write a cogent arguement. In addition, Bennis goes for the cheap when he repeatedly discusses the \\"sexual:\\" tensions that existed on these teams. I'd rather he focused on their dynanmics and how they were maintained than people's personal lives. If that doesn't discourage you from the book, this will, most of these teams were formed over 30 years ago. This offers little advice or guidance on dealing with building teams of gen-Xers ect. That was my reason for reading the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the kindle edition until it's fixed","review":"I had to request a refund of this book because of the isses that made it impossible to read.

I think Froggy goes to School is a great story for little kids in their toddler years (mostly for ages 3-7). This story is about a young frog and his first day of school. Froggy wakes up one morning and finds that he was running late for the bus and he don't want to miss his first day so he runs out the door and then when he gets on the bus his friends start to laugh at him because... Froggy forgot to get dressed he was on the bus in his boxers and then when he got to school his teacher called his name and only it was not his teacher it was his father calling him to get dressed school was starting soon. It was all a dream \\"bubble bubble, Toot toot, Chicken, Airplane, Soldier.\\" To find out what this has to do with Froggy's first day of school read this story it's a Darn Tooting good one.

I didn't know if the hero was going to make it to the end and be able to tell us whodunnit. I agree with the reader from Berlin who puts it so well. Alex teeters in and out of reality, obsessions, compulsions and never sleeps. This last reminds me of P. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, but she never bathes either, and Alex is faithful to long hot showers, Thank God. He certainly doesn't inspire much confidence. The scene with P.I. Prudmore displaying Alex's lack of sleuthing ability is worth the price of the book. I liked everything but how he handled the plot. When Alex is obsessively following a train of thought, the author should remember that Alex is dragging the reader right along with him. I admire the skill, but I felt I wanted off the train every now and then. His handling of location was superb. I'll be looking for more books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgar and Shamus Awards for Best First Novel","review":"It has the mysterious murders, the plot twists, the maniacal killer (maybe), the dame, quirky small town citizens and the hard-boiled former cop turned UP detective. I don't normally read mysteries, but I was drawn to this one at the bookstore. I have to say it was worth the price; I finished it in one sitting.

It started out quite well but I found the development of the back-story predictable and the denouement too drawn out.

After an interesting, but not unforeseeable plot twist, the story just ends -- no resolution, no follow up -- it just leaves you hanging.

It left me wondering why I hadn't read them before. The book was a little short, but extremely well-plotted and had many interesting insights into Native Alaskan culture.

I found the Chief's attitude toward Alex unbelievable; the Chief was mad at Alex no matter what he did. I know a novel needs conflict, but so much between those two characters was manufactured. At one point, a deputy tells Alex that the Chief wants him arrested him on sight. Arrested for what? Cooperation? Also, the fact that a grown man (Edwin) needed a \\"babysitter\\" didn't work for me at all. The way Edwin's mother behaved was more in line with the way she'd deal with a 12-year old. Based on some of the other reviews - that Hamilton gets better with each new book - I might try one more of his later ones.

P. and to much forced anger...","review":"Being from the U.P. it is always a pleasure to stumble across a book with ties to my home. However, this was not the case with \\"A Cold Day in Paradise.\\" This story could have taken place anywhere. The U. P. is a unique location that could have had more significance to the story or its characters. I was also disappointed in the continuous anger of each of the characters. As a reader I did not feel I was given enough information or background to understand or believe where this anger was coming from. As one previous review stated the characters seemed \\"flat.\\" I would agree with this and in being more specific I would add it is more enjoyable and believable to watch a character moving into a state of anger, possibly struggling with it internally ... these characters were simply flat angry all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific insensitivity to mental illness","review":"I bought this book to try the first Alex McKnight mystery.

It's great to hear a voice which can convey sentiments with subtlety. This is particularly impressive when one considers Silje's first language is Norwegian. She obviously has a deep understanding and feel for this music genre. All of the tracks sound very polished in keeping with her beautifully clear voice. From the little I know of her it is obvious she has spent some time developing her style and direction. After buying this CD I immediately bought her latest 'At First Light'. This is also a triumph as Silje combines well with lyricist Mike McGurk to compose all but one of the tracks on this CD.

However, and unlike all other remotes I've used, holding the up and down arrow key buttons does not result in cycling through a menu; instead you must press the up or down buttons repeatedly to arrive at your selection. Unlike other remotes, this one is not at all forgiving if you do not point it directly at the receiver and TV. It is white and dirties easily.

The beans were very aromatic and to me they seemed quite nice. I have never dealt with vanilla beans before so I guess my comparison is quite limited :) I am using them to make my own Pure Vanilla for baking so I guess I will find out in 6 mos how it turns out. Nice buy but disappointed in how many I received.ETA: After thinking about my review, I wasn't thinking about the fact that these are measured by weight. That does make a big difference. I was disappointed because the recipe I was using called for 40 beans and in the end I only had 3 leftover to use for something else. I will definitely be buying more though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plump delicious vanilla beans","review":"I purchased these beans through Amazon to make my own real vanilla extract.

The author himself tries to criticise both constructivist and positivist approaches regarding a deeper analysis of scietific affairs and its making in the scientific mileu. He also rises interesting analyses about the notion of consensus in both the \\"research frontier\\" and the \\"core knowledge\\" trying to debunk the comonplace idea that in natural sciences the consensus is higher than in social sciences. I reckon he carries out a serious and interesting critique on some constructivist standpoints... well, just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Demystifies the whole process and appeal of admission to very selective schools. This is not a \\"how to\\" guide, quite the opposite. If you want a how to guide, the best are Acing the College Application, and New Rules of College Admissions. The former geared towards very selective schools and top students, the late geared towards everyone else.I like this book because it is a refreshing look at how neither you, not your child, NEEDS to get into one of these schools. And how these particular schools might not even be the best for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't the Avengers have their own trilogy?","review":"After all, the X-Men have several. This is a review of book#1 (the data base tends to mix them all together.) Greg Cox reminds me of Roy Thomas writing Marvel comics in the 60's and 70's. He can take the Marvel characters and advance them a step further while maintaining their original essence and actually improve on them. I never really liked the Hulk and Iron Man that much until I read this book. I also liked his approach to the relationship between the post-divorce Vision and Scarlet Witch. The climax battle at Niagra Falls is awesome; it is as vivid as an actual comic book while supplying details that could only be described in prose. It takes a good writer to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found","review":"This is one of the best X-Men books I have ever read. I loved it.

Samson, Hulk was supposed to have the strength of the green hulk, the smarts of Banner, and the cunning of the grey hulk.

Can they make books any worse? ... When dolls started coming to life I had to question the author's intelligence, when Wolverine got attacked by rapidly regenerating deer I laughed. When a T-shirt attacked Rogue, I had to set the book aside and call it quits on this testament to stupidity. Superheroes may be for the younger audience, but superhero novels are not. I am used to very good plot lines in comics and ESPECIALLY novels. This is the stupidest book I have ever started, well... aside from The Giver, Holes, and Walk Two Moons, and I am sure the other two novels are just as bad if not worse...

The first story by Hampton and Kneece saw a Batman team-up with a Thor like character but it was really lacking in creativity and the art didn't do it any favor.

They even come with their own CD Jewel case.The only disadvantage I found with them is that they do not have a high memory capacity like most other discs. If you were just looking for economical discs and feasible alternatives of data storage, I would say that these are fine, but if you want to put large documents or large numbers of documents on the discs, you may want to get a larger capacity disc.

Bingham tried to bring too many characters to life and as a result they all seemed colourless. The \\"unexpected\\" ending to Judy Melton's romance read like a last minute idea to give the book a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling; the heroics of Meggie were too sketchy to prompt any feelings of peril on her behalf; Rusty's transformation from young war hero to debutante came off sounding rather silly. All in all, I felt that the love affairs of each of the \\"main\\" characters read like a teenage novel and the sorrow of the war tragedies come across as if written in a monotone voice. Finally, the subject of the prologue, The Chestnut Tree, was woven so loosely into the story as to be almost forgotten altogether.This book evoked neither my laughter nor my tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"top of the lIne","review":"this is a wonderful book.i can easily see it being made into a movie.both english women and men showed great courage and fortitude during ww2.i highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not end up purchasing a new car lik I did!","review":"DO NOT LEAVE THIS TEE IN YOUR TRUNK!!

My sweat shirt that was in the trunk with it has been washed twice and still stinks of it. Other clothes that were in the laundry with it now have the smell. I thought the smell would go away but two months later the tee's odor is still as strong as ever.I asked Franklin about this, and they said it's just the nature of the rubber they use..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke right away","review":"My son used this for batting practice. The top tube split the first time he was using it. The second time he went to practice off if it, the very top part of the tube ripped completely off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batting Tee","review":"This batting Tee has little nipples to \\"help\\" hold the ball. After the first practice trying to teach 8 year olds how to hit, half of them had been knocked off. The other half that stayed on were no longer \\"helping\\" hold the ball off but yet now in the way. Now the Tee just has and oversize platform to hold the ball on. The product still works, I just wish I would have went with a different type."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"this is an excellent tool to teach basic science in a fun way. But it fails to mention that you need to buy straws. If you buy this item, pick up straws as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous - batteries heat up fast","review":"This is not a safe product for younger children (the box states for ages 7-up). I had to do all the work, so my son got bored quickly.Important safety note: the 2 AA batteries I placed in the battery holder unit heated up in minutes, without being linked to anything else in the kit. The batteries got so hot that I could not touch them with my bare hands!The book is great--fun and instructional, but the items in the kit are dangerous. I returned our kit for a refund.I bought Elenco's Snap Circuits 100 kit for my son for Christmas also, and it is a totally safe electronics kit that my son can use all my himself or with supervision. Buy Snap Circuits NOT this poorly made kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so book","review":"The stories really good are only Batman-SpiderMan and Team X - Team 7... the others are so \\"light\\" that don't deserve to be mentioned. A thing to see is Superman eating (something you don't see a lot in comics). The stories of Gen13 looks like Beverly Hills 90210 with superpowers and don't even has good supervillians. Don't waste your money, if you want to read it, better borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that effective...","review":"This catnip did not have a real impact on the cats. Maybe it was old and degraded but no matter what the reason it barely had an impact on them, even after smelling it closely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"The slits are too wide which results in the - yolk sliding through it; or the egg white pulling the yolk along with it; or the yolk breaking (the 3 times I did use this separator one of these happened) . The separator is very sturdy, shinny but does not do its job so would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dalla Doesn't Do!","review":"I don't recommend the Dalla Piazza Egg Separator. It's awkward to hold and crack the egg inside. It's takes the egg white too long to run out of the side openings. And the side openings will break the yolk. I would not have purchased it. I'm now looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"The product I bought was outstanding for quality and price. I am a big fan of Amazon. I have made many purchases form you and have never been dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Album","review":"A lot of your old western favorites in this CD. Many of them are covers of songs made popular by other groups. If my memory serves (and it doesn't serve that well anymore) \\"Riders In The Sky\\" was a Vaughn Monroe (sp?) hit and \\"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\\" was a Sons of the Pioneers hit. But what the hey. Frankie Laine brings his own special voice to these songs too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little that's Good","review":"While the CD features a few gems like Moonlight Gambler and Rawhide, most of the others are second rate. If you want a CD full of great songs of the west, try Marty Robbins or the Sons of the Pioneers."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ea80e152"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/55.md","filePath":"sponsor/55.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/55.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
