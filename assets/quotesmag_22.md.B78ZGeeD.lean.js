The tale captures from the first and never lets up. Unlike many novels, there are no \\"down\\" times but instead, the working out of a deep mystery.the introduction of \\"magic\\" through technological means was nifty, a cool device that made the story seem almost plausibile. Once again, that plausibility factor was heightened by the switch in language from 19th to 21st century. Some aspects continued to intrigue after the last page: Did the twins exist?

Layered over this, are the \\"readers\\" of the autobiography and diary who are also the descendants of the the two magicians.

The rest of their lives are spent trying to sabotage each other's shows, and when Borden begins performing an illusion he calls The New Transported Man, Angier will stop at nothing to discover the secret to the performance and improve upon it for use in his own act. ...\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, just okay","review":"I bought this book based on its review and was extremely disappointed.The basic idea and plot of The Prestige was good enough, but I'm not fond of diary-style writing at all, and was unaware that most of the book would consist of this.

They even matter-of-factly state that Jesus Christ was not crucified, but was rescued from crucifixion by his disciples, and then moved to what is now England. Give me a break. The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is well-documented in Christian, Jewish, and Roman records. Jesus moving to England and getting married is well-documented in third-rate movies.

The \\"tips\\" that the author shares are fairly common knowledge, and it's not worth slogging through yet another paragraph on the joys of a finding a scrap of exquisite fabric in a shop in Paris after a lovely little lunch at an out-of-the-way cafe, and how lovely it looked in Mr. Insert-Name-Here's quaint chateau. Rose Tarlow should have just written her autobiography and not tried to disguise it as a design book.

Unfortunately, she really isn't interested in teaching you a thing.I read the book carefully and then went through it a second time to see if there was a single design principle or piece of advice I could come away with. Amazingly there wasn't.Rose plays her cards close to her chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Photos-Not Words","review":"Ms. Tarlow has decidedly good taste and most of the photographs are quite lovely.However, the writing is painfully bad.To ferret out the few, good tidbits of advice, one must slog through pedestrian prose.

Too many uneccesary words to sift through to get to the meat of it. After awhile you give up and go on to the next book you bought (if you have another). I guess for some people it could be comic relief if your frustrated about your computer messing up, but to call this book helpful, you'd have to be the computer geek type that reads manual after manual for entertainment(which I'm not), but maybe they might be able to find something in this book. To me, it was a waste of money. Good thing I also bought the Mac OSX Tiger Bible and The Missing Manual.

Spend your $$$ on something else!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac OS X Tiger Book Roars","review":"Andy's wry sense of humor makes this invaluable reference book a great read. As with most of the \\"How to\\" books, he covers the basics of Mac OS 10.4 that you'll get with many of the other OS X reference books (e.g. David Pogue's Missing Manual). Andy cuts through and points out a lot of the stuff you might want to skip, or if you are technically inclined, you might want to delve into. At one time or another, I've bought a Mac OS reference book from most of the experts out there, but the wit Andy brings to this book makes it shine a little bit brighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info and very pleasing text","review":"Very good book. Actually bought it by mistake, was supposed to buy another one but I botched the name of the book and ended up with this one. Wouldn't trade for the one I was supposed to get (will supress the name, of course), as this is much more information packed and, as a bonus, the author is a piece of work.

I started reading it and I found it had a nice sense of humor. However, after reading 5 chapters and not getting any significant knowledge about MAC OS X, I felt the book really felt short of its main purpose. As a comedy book is great especially for computer geeks like me, but man...no meat on this one. The chapter on troubleshooting is basically \\"DO NOTHING\\"....what??? Buy the missing manual from David it is a much more comprehensive book. Not as funny, but you actually get pretty good at learning MAC."},{"rating":"2","title":"He writes like he talks!","review":"I bought the book in a book store and not online. There were so many books on the subject that it was difficult for me to choose. After all, I had bought many major references on Panther and I did not want to duplicate them with new editions with just a little additions.Well, after browsing thru numerous Tiger books, this one really stood out in the memory! It's the Plain English! When you pay, you don't get a book, you get a buddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to OS X","review":"This book was my introduction to OS X and it served that purpose very well. It was an enjoyable read and offered a good overview of the features available.Most subjects were not covered in much depth but the book allowed me to see the features and functions offered by Tiger. As a result I was able to pick the subjects I was interested in and investigate them further online and in other books.Humor is certainly not universal but I found most of the author's side comments entertaining. Thanks Andy, ya can't please everyone so don't let it hold you back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"I've only made it through the first 4 or 5 chapters so far, but I've found it educational and even more fun to read.

Most cocoa is alkalized (\\"Dutch process\\") because it makes the flavor milder...but supposedly that gets rid of some of the benefits of cocoa.This cocoa has a delicious flavor, very different from the burnt (aka cheap cacao) flavor that most grocery store brands have.Makes delicious hot cocoa, great chocolate milk, wonderful peanut butter cups, fantastic cakes, and so forth. If you're going to take the time to make whatever you're making, and if you're going to put it into your body, you might as well make it worthwhile.If you're considering this cocoa, give it a try!

When switching from Wx Radio to FM Broadcast below 93 Mhz I usually got a loud buzzing instead of the radio station. The phase-locked loop (PLL) did not lock. Tuning above 93 Mhz and then down would allow reception but who wants a radio that acts that way. (I mostly listen to NPR at 91.1 Mhz.) The round \\"selector\\" dial was rough to operate and felt like a rusty wheel, requiring a little more force than necessary. Side volume control was rough in operation. As far as I can tell there was no way to actually turn it off, so if it were unplugged the batteries would exhaust themselves...The N.W.S. Weather radio broadcasts and S.A.M.E encoding are great.

The Bouncing souls are known for their nostalgic 3 chord verses and upbeat sing-along choruses. This album will follow those rules and still sound fresh. My favorite is 'Night Train' with their Bassist on lead vocals and the Greg backing up with high accents. It sounds good, along with the 15 other songs all with their own mood. The bonus track starts to sound like an acoustic version of '87'. Highlites have got to be Anchors Aweigh, Born Free, simple Man, Night Train, and Im from there.

The Sorcerer's Stone game objective follows the story but has a few twists along the way. Mainly I would describe the game as a \\"puzzle\\" solving game that is not so hard that a player looses interest and doesn't finish. Harry's main mission is to earn spells by passing a challenge assigned by his teachers. Besides earning spells, there are side tasks like collecting wizard cards, finding bernie botts every flavor beans, and earning house points. The game does load for every scene which can get annoying and the grafics aren't as great as most games released today, but the game is fun for those who like less violence in their game play."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Brilliant!","review":"It is one of the best PS2 games I've ever played (maybe evan the best!), I liked the Chamber of secrets and Quidditch World cup, but this is the best Harry Potter game because this time there are not as many loading screens as there were in the Chamber of Secrets, but the only downside to it is that some of the story from the 2nd Game is the same as this game (ex.

There is hardly anything out there that is worth buying anymore. It is very rare that a band comes out that actually impresses me. Avenged Sevenfold has done just that.I can't get over just how great this band is. They combine elements in rock and metal music to create an assault of razor sharp riffs within a massive wall of sound. The guitarists are the main players on this record. They demonstrate their solo skills with perfection. The lead work is a force to be reckoned with. The song writing is also very interesting. You'll be jamming to an almost black metal assualt of vocals and guitars and it will suddenly turn into a disco beat (Eternal Rest). A lot of these songs hit the six minute mark, but always remain interesting and fun.

But not every band out there can be, and if you only listen to the best band in the world, your CD collection will be mighty thin. It is obvious that these guys aren't here to replace Metalica and such metal bands or punk bands of equal caliber. They are here to make music that is enjoyable to listen to and if your willing to listen to that then get this CD. Some people will disagree with me and say that they're not worth listening to, but if everyone agreed about what music to listen to then music would get real boring real quick. Since you won't know whether you like these guys till you listen to them, go to there site and listen to the sample tracks and this will give you a feel of what they're like.

The only bad part about the album is that some parts have punk singing, which suks, but the rest makes up for it. They add some really cool goth type melodeath guitars on the songs. The drumming is also good. The vocalist has an amazing range from slowly singing to black metal screeching. I hope on their next album they lose the punk and go heavier and more gothic. The best songs are Chapter Four, Desecrete Through Reverance, Eternal Rest, Radiant Eclipse and I Won't See You Tonight Part1 and 2.This band rules. Other good and even better bands are Lamb of god, Otep, the black dahlia murder, unearth and deicide! Can't wait to see what this bands new album will be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band has no sense of identity.","review":"These guys aren't bad. They're a talented bunch of musicians, but they can't decide if they want to be a metal band, a hardcore band, or a punk band, so they throw elements of each in their songs. For a metal fan like myself, hearing an awesome opening riff and ripping guitar solo is awesome. I like the heavy Pantera-like breakdowns they do sometimes, but then they stick in punk choruses and punk sounding progressions and vocal harmonizations that just don't follow the form of the music. You might make a stretch and say that they are integrating melodic metal styles, but its very different. The clean vocalist doesnt have a powerful or deep enough voice for that and his voice actually reminds me of older Offspring.Avenged Sevenfold is NOT a metal band even if they have some metal sounding aspects of their music. If you want to hear current bands that are closer to real metal check out Shadows Fall, God Forbid, All That Remains, Lamb of God, and Unearth."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great stuff...","review":"for starters, avenged sevenfold has been a pretty good band in the past-their last cd was pretty good, so i bought this one. the music is different from their energetic old stuf, this is more bland, if you know what i mean. i heard 'second heartbeat' on hopelessly devoted to you and thought this band still had some good music coming, but in their cd, they totally redid second heartbeat! now its slower, the guitars are less daring, and the the singing is way more boring. thats kind of a reflection of their first cd and this one!as for their image--hilarious! i dont know if they try to make their cd appearance look corny, but everything from the gay dancing skeletons to the \\"spooky\\" spider webs and cackling witch, is screaming three-year old halloween party."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT METAL","review":"This cd has lofty intentions from the get-go, but sadly falls into the neo-punk ilk, covering the normal metal standard riffs and break-downs, yet fails to present anything new for what is strives for.

I'm glad to see a new band trying to be heavy, but this doesn't quite cut it. I witnessed the emergence of death metal and black metal and it seems that they \\"wrote\\" their songs by just sticking together a bunch of admittedly cool riffs from past acts (several Obituary riffs are prominent). The jerky lack of transitions betrays this method of writing. The vocalist is just too pre-pubescent to my ears (hence the Linkin Park connection). M. Shadows may have taken $12 of my paycheck, but I'm hoping that seven people will read this and buy something else instead...then I will be avenged sevenfold.Try As I Lay Dying for metalcore, or Emperor or Morbid Angel for metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny Emo Crap","review":"The music on this cd is OK, ripping off Maiden, In Flames and other melodic metal - But the vocals and the production and image (not to mention lyrics) are pure teenage poser emo crap.

Hey - skulls are cool, lets make a scary band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poseur metalcore garbage","review":"This band sucks. This has got to be one of the most overrated bands ever. They add sreaming into a pop-rock song and call it metal. That is if it can be called screaming. The singer's whiny emo voice alone should be enough to convince you that this band isn't metalcore. Want real metalcore? Listen to Hatebreed, God Forbid, old Killswitch Engage, On Broken Wings, Throwdown, Chimaira, Bury Your Dead, Between The Buried And Me, Terror, Merauder, etc. Want real metal in general?

It's the perfect blend of melody and metal. The band is extremely talented.I've browsed through numerous forums and reviews where people have mentioned that A7x is \\"_________\\" (fill in the blank with any negative comments you want).

I would say these guys are one of the best hybrid bands if you were to mix 80's and 90's metal with a dash of punk. Best avenged sevenfold album to date!!! I was kinda dissapointed from the change of sound in \\"City of Evil\\". I guess they are leaning more toward punk nowadays. This album is more toward my taste in metal and the first few tracks just blows you away. Best picks would def be \\"Unholy Confessions\\", \\"Chapter Four\\", and \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\".

There are a couple good songs, and they are all, not surprisingly, the ones where shadows actually sings for the most part. You stupid metal heads say that city of evil is too poppy. Well the reason none of your music is popular is because it all sounds the same and it all sucks. Just like most of the songs on this cd. Can't tell the difference. And since city of evil is the better cd but is behind in the rating, it shows that amazon.com ratings mean absolutely nothing.

Piano, guitars, drums, bass and vocals all shine through on this disc. Vocals are varied and keeps the entire record interesting. The guitars are heavy yet keep a melodic groove and the rhythm section keep the paces varied and strong. I don't rate this album a five because all songs are perfect but because all songs are enjoyable and one can listen all the way through without hitting the skip button. This is a perfect combination of metal, hardcore and just plain hard rock. I am also not judging this album on production which could be a bit better but does not take anything away from the talent that this band exudes. Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it","review":"first it has the epic cover for the case then the cd is amazing, only 1 more a7x cd to complete my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This cd rocks!They have an amazing singer,that scream he does is insane.The guitars are something I've been waiting for for years,non of theose simple harmonics with distortion crap a lotta bands have done.The bass sound,well,it kinda gets drowned out by the guitars,but I guess it serves it's purpose.The drumming is very very good,nice and fast.Anyway A7X is...M.Shadows-lead vocalsZacky Vengeance-rhythm guitar/backing vocalsSynyster Gates-lead guitar/backing vocalsJohnny Christ-bassThe Reverend-drums"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD AT ALL.....","review":"avenged sevenfold is not good at all....their sound is a mix of many past bands like metallica, megadeth and korn with a POP feeling and bad lyrics.....i can only totally agree with what another reviewer write......HEYYYY, OVERKILL!!!!!!!! this band is REALLY STEALING the skull bat creature you guys create to your front covers!!!!! many avenged covers got this skull bat clone.....man, if they don't know what is OVERKILL, a classic thrash metal band, is a shame....but if they know, it's a TOTAL RIPP OFF!!!!!!!i can list a really really big list of better bands than avenged sevenfold, but try the bands they try to copy like metallica, megadeth and pantera......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A7X's best work","review":"This is one of my favorite non-punk CDs. The best part is Matt's voice. When he screams it's great, when he actually sings it's great. He just has an excellent voice on this CD. \\"Unholy Confessions\\" is a great song. The screams . . . God how I miss them! Probably the best song is \\"I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1)\\" in which Matt sings the whole time. I wish he would have sung like that on \\"City of Evil\\" instead of turning into a disturbing conglomeration of Axl Rose, Mike Patton, and that dude from Velvet Revolver. Matt's singing voice on WTF, not the screaming now but the actual singing, is incredible. If you are new to A7X and checked out \\"City of Evil\\" and didn't like it, try \\"Waking the Fallen.\\" This is a really, really, really good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!.....just WOW!!!","review":"first off, i was completely blown away with avenged sevenfolds first album, sounding the 7th trumpet. and i bought waking the fallen the first day it came out. i started listening to it and i got mega chills though myself when Shadows first sings out \\"ill try, she said and he walked away...\\" just....wow. after listening to the whole thing, practically in tears, i would not put my cd player down. best band ever, best cd EVER. just to sum it up :). if u dont go buy it, ur CRAZY!!!!! go buy it, right now. best...EVER. and the length of it, i actually thought it was too short! i cant get enough of a7x! :) :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it.","review":"This album is very good....buy it...you won't be dissapointed.

This book is one intended at a western audience who will not be able to refute the claims of the books not because of thier lack of intelligence but because of the countries information is not well known in the outside world. The author has in the best of judgment and the best of lights made a mockery of any scholastic venture made of any country yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The UAE","review":"The author has combined history with political science to make for something of a cutting edge book on one of the Gulf's most interesting countries. I just finished reading this, and being a veteran of the UAE for many years I found it to be very well researched with some extremely clever and original analysis, and in a completely different league to all previous books on the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"A view from a local UAE national","review":"As an Emarati national living in Abu-Dhabi(Capital city) I found this book to have lot of questions that need to be answered. Certain statements the author made about the politic's of the country had either no sources or the source was not good enough to make any just assumptions (most people interviewed were either from another city in the Emirates or people who were originally from Iran)I think to make it fair Dr.Chris should have spoken to UAE nationals from the UAE and taken their perspective. Overall i would rate it as average and most of its contents are not well sourced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view from the USA","review":"This book is meticulously researched... everything from terrorism and wahabbism to authoritarianism and civil society in the Gulf.

My own issues with it was that the programmable keys shared F keys and to switch to programmable mode you had to hide a button. During this mode though your F keys didn't work and it ended up being an annoyance. But it's a great keyboard for the price. Nowadays all the keyboard prices are going up because of wireless and other options but this is a great simple wired keyboard with media options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Page Turner in Alexandra Cooper Series","review":"This book was a great book to read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. In previous books by this author, I thought there were too many other stories going on besides the main case, but in this book, it seemed to be more about the major case at hand. If you like the workings of solving a murder, then you will like the steps that are taken in the latest by Ms. Fairstein. I like the banter between Chapman and Cooper. Story is in the Holiday season and involves a woman that was abused by her husband and the woman is murdered. However, the murder may not be directly related to her husband even though he had put a hit on her. It is a great journey through the evidence trail and one I hope you enjoy as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Know Or Care Who Done It","review":"A murder took place at the beginning of the book. The last disc (Audio book) tells how it happened, but at that point no one cares. I felt that maybe there was a bunch of short stories thrown in this book before the last disc. I am loading my iPod and removing the book without finishing the rest of it. I think it's about over. This was such a disappointment. I know I didn't read this author in order but you'd think since no introductions were needed, the main story would move along. It was plodding with all kinds of distractions and a multitude of characters and side stories that had nothing to do with anything. I don't know why I listened so long. I guess I kept hoping it would get better and wanted to know how it would get wrapped up. Well, I need not have bothered. These are the most boring characters in a continuous series ever. Words were spoken without saying anything. I will not be bothering with anything else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure what the author's intent was","review":"495 pages... it become almost impossible to track the main story line in this book; it is well hidden in page after page of minutiae. I really do not care what the storyteller, Alex Cooper, ate, saw at an art museum, wore, or account for a socialite lifestyle. In the first few pages, Lola Dakota is murdered. At page 361, I'm still waiting for her and Detective Mike Chapman to get through the Christmas & New Years holidays so they can get back to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD IS RIGHT!!","review":"With L. Fairstein's 25 years as head of the New York district attorney's Sex Crime Unit, I expected a more intelligent, facetious, gritty, in-depth, realistic story. Deadhouse is shallow and uninteresting. Flat. Bad writing.Here again we find that everybody who is anybody to the main character is the bestest of the best in his/her field of work and personal life. Her parents are wealthy...carribean home... Marth's Vineyard...Alex doesn't go to a grocery store, she has her groceries delivered. The dialogue between her and her detective friend, Mike are dull, dim (he calls her Blondie, euck). Mike himself is outragiously unnecessarily rude and crude to people.Also here we got the main character, the head of the sex crime unit, walking the streets of NY alone in the dead of night WITHOUT ANY means of self defense such as mace or pepper spray, stun gun, pistol, retractable steel baton, cell phone. Instead of taking a self-defense class she takes ballet. Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"more heart, less description","review":"hmmmm have just finished it - started out promisingly, got a bit slow in the middle then went on to finish somewhat implausibly! having read all of fairstein's alex cooper series, i think there is something missing - perhaps it's heart. a strong female lead is great but alex just doesn't have enough frailties (that we're privvy to) to make her human and appealing. the strong woman character is (thank goodness) nothing new in this genre but she seems more of an imitation of tempe or kay.anyway, not a bad holiday read, but once i skimmed the descriptive passages of the island and its history there wasn't too much left to the actual plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Did Linda Fairstein all of a sudden realize she had written the required number of pages for her latest book? The ending certainly feels like that. Totally unsatisfying, with lots of open ends. A start for the next book? Sorry - I really liked Ms Fairstein's books, and the characters in those books, but - I won't buy the next book. I really felt like I wasted my money this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of Linda Fairstein's Alex Cooper series, and I loved the first three books. The Deadhouse was a major disappointment, though. The plot was unbelievable, and it ended in a rather unsatisfying climax. One of my favourite parts of the previous books was the conversations between Alex, Mercer Wallace, and Mike Chapman. Even that was missing from this book, though, as Mercer was still recovering from being shot in the chest and Mike has fallen in love with an architect. That was the most disappointing part for me. I don't know if it was just me, but I always figured Alex would dump her annoying NBC boyfriend and end up with Mike. I'm still going to read The Bone Vault, because I liked the first books so much, but this book was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York history + mystery","review":"I love a good mystery...and when it is immersed with bits of history of New York City, I love it even more. Alex Cooper is now involved in the murder of a King's College professor, Lola Dakota (you gotta love that name!). A bit of paper with numbers on Lola's dead body sends Alex and Mike Chapman on a quest to Roosevelt Island, off the shore of Manhattan. We learn about the history of the island, including hospitals for the insane and small pox victims. Lola's colleagues become suspect for various reasons. Just another \\"can't put it down\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but a let down.","review":"This was my first Linda Fairstein book, but I am not compelled to pick up another. It was almost as though she was writing a book to write a book, not because she had something to say.The concept itself was very interesting and a lot could have happened with it, but in the end I found the book rather boring and uninteresting. I finished it because I wanted to know \\"who dun it\\" but I could have left it unfinished and it wouldn't have bothered me a bit.The plot was kind of flaky, the subplots could have been left out entirely, and there was just far too much politics and backbiting. Perhaps things really are that was for a female in the legal environment, but books are where we go to *escape* reality.Finally, the ending even seemed rushed, as though there was a page allotment and too much had been used up already.Bottom line, I would not recommend this particular book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't relu get into it","review":"did you ever keep reading a book just because you had started it...I just couldn't relate to these people. Moderately interesting plot line; but I basixally didn;t CARE about tge protagonists. Sorry, won;t read the earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Freeze","review":"I wish I had thought to review some other readers comments before starting this book. This was my first read by this writer and the last. Nothing like some of the great mystery writers available to read. I found myself reading but not even absorbing what I was reading because the story just drags on and on...When I reached page 169 I kept thinking that the book would start to display more drama or intrigue but this never happened for me. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly & boring","review":"Having never read anything by this author I picked up this book after seeing her interviewed on TV. I love good mysteries, especially the British police porcedurals, and thought maybe Fairstein might be somewhat like those. I thoroughly disliked Alex Cooper, finding her shallow and pretentious. The constant toing and froing amongst her & Mike was tedious and embarrassing(the Blondie thing has got to go) and the story just dragged on and on, and I really just lost interest. What a waster of paper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and necessary reading for anyone who works in education and parents of special needs children","review":"Beautifully written, honest and at times funny, Debra tells what it is like trying to raise an extraordinary child in a world that is not always understanding or accepting of differences. Parents who pick it up will feel connected to her and Blaze as she describes the trials and tribulations she must go through. Although the details are not the same, parents of children on the autism spectrum will relate to her fears and frustrations, as well as to her joy and satisfaction in raising her son. A wonderful description of what many parents of 'special needs' children go through when it comes to the school system, this book should be required reading for anyone working in the field of education."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I am not a doctor but from reading this book about Blaze, I suspect his problems are caused by a combination of the breathing problem at birth and thimerisol (mercury) in vaccines given to babies at that time. I tried to email Ms. Ginsberg about this but her web site was down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different direction","review":"After reading \\"Waiting\\", Deborah Ginsburg's memoir of her life as a waitress I expected \\"Raising Blaze\\" to be a light hearted, funny little book. It's not. Blaze is the author's son, he's the sweet baby she had at the end of \\"Waiting\\". Blaze is different and his teachers and school psychologists have called him everything from retarded to autistic to having attention deficit disorder. This book is about Ginsburg's fight to save her son from being labeled and stuck away in special ed classes. The book is about love, Ginsburg's family is still in her corner and it's about hope, there is still no telling what Blaze will be like when he grows up. The book is emotional, it's upsetting and several points I wanted to yell at the teachers and at Ginsburg herself. I wish Ms. Ginsburg and her special son the best and I look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"so great","review":"we are about to start building our own house and to say the least it can get so overwhelming, i absolutly LOVED this book, it has beautiful pictures and All different kinds of styles and great information, i would recommend this to any one about to build a porch or sunroom and needs some ideas, information on how to do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat, small and decent functionality, questionable quality","review":"Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass.

Martin makes it sound like diabetics can get sick no matter how carefully they take care of themselves, and that is simply not true. Anyone who takes their insulin properly and controls their blood sugar will be fine unless something else, like an infection, is going on. While the book does mention that Stacey had the flu recently, it is inaccurate because if that were to throw her blood sugar off, it would have happened while she was sick, not after. Also, why can't she eat sweets? Diabetics can eat anything they want as long as they plan for it and give themselves the proper amount of insulin.

He just plays with the stickers, so this is why I gave it 4 stars, rather than 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad purchase, not for long interest or young children","review":"The book's content is disappointing & not appropriate for younger children: \\"You're not my friend if you don't come to my party!\\" and brief mention of spin the bottle. Not even a good story, in my opinion.The structure of the book is also disappointing. The vinyl stickers are only for use on the front and back fold out covers, which as another reviewer stated are already way too busy for adding stickers. The story is only 5 pages long, the other 12 pages are single use activity sheets that would entertain a 2nd-3rd grader for no more than a single sitting/day at most.While I was excited to find reusable stickers, this is not a good buy at all, especially for the price.I don't recommend it, especially not for preschoolers, kindergartners or even 1st graders, nor for any possible long term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 y/o not too interested","review":"Bought it for my 3.5 y/o girl.

It's true, Brandon was a liar, forger and thief; none of these Capital Crimes. No one, of any persuasion, deserves this. I saw \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" first, and I have no end of admiration for Kimberly Pierce's vision. Certainly, some things were changed, but the interviews with the killers were so perfectly aligned with Pierce's depiction. Hate crimes are very unsettling to me, and this documentary gave some great insight, especially that the law enforcement officers were so cruel; Ms. Pierce's film was kinder to them.

Fascinated by the story, I decided to go to a showing of this film at the university I attend. I wanted to learn more about the girl behind the story. I was disappointed to find that the movie focused more on the people who knew Teena than on Teena herself. And the people who knew her...other audience members actually laughed at their stupidity. The documentary was amusing, even though its subject was not. Overall, I was unsatisfied because I left feeling that I had learned very little about Teena Brandon and what she went through.

Half of this 45 minute documentary focuses on how repressed we've been as a society when it comes to physical touch, showing clips from old black and white movies in an attempt to exaggerate how far we've come.While I was able to move beyond the \\"unlandscaped\\" appearance of the actors and actresses in this DVD, I didn't find anything about it that would allow me to give it more than two stars.

Nothing anyone who is interested in sensual massage doesn't already know.Second: The video quality was very poor. It was far below what I get with Youtube and Vimeo.

Talk less and listen and practise more.I have not forgotten your scurillous remarks in the 1980s of the late Miles Davis's foray into modern electronic pop jazz. It was naive and ignorant.

I would love them better if they actually kept their advertised claim of making sounds and flashing lights longer than a day or two, if at all.

However, I have, perhaps rashly, bought and used twenty of them by now, and the sounds/light feature has not worked on some and the others stopped working quickly.

But she's a smart little bugger and figures things out pretty quickly. For a couple of years we supplied her with two or three a year and she would have a blast with them. She loved to take them into dark rooms and throw them off the furniture or down the stairs. But she's figured out now how to dismember them very quickly and I'm afraid our Zap Ball days are over. With the last one, she had it apart in 40 minutes and we spent the rest of the night searching the house to make sure she hadn't swallowed the little pill batteries (she hadn't).The toy is great, but I think it needs some pretty close supervision. And be forewarned, if you have a particularly smart dog or one that is a very aggressive chewer, it may not last as long as you would like.

The 8 year old male had turned his round ball into a sort of egg shape, although he had not managed to put holes in it.

That's what I thought. The problem is that once the heist portion of the movie starts, it goes nowhere fast. There's a lot of pointless screaming as members of the crew start turning on each other. It's another entry into the current string of U.K. funded programming that features people turning on each other. For more of the same, watch \\"The Bunker\\".

Everyone I wanted to live dies and those I wanted to perish clung stubbornly to life. Their must be better films to waste your time with, pass on this, life is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok in the beginning and middle, confusing near end.","review":"It drew me in at the beginning and the killing in the middle, but near the end was stupidly confusing. Normally whatever you see on the cover on the title is what you would be expecting to see. Instead of some \\"cybernetic-type monster\\", you got something else, I'm not going to ruin the surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad horror movie","review":"Seems to be alot of pointless, incoherrant movies about theses days. Alothough you are aware this group is in a compound of sorts...I am not sure why. There aren't any animals there. I might have missed the point somehwere before they went, but I really didn't care to rewind to go find out. The characters are not likeable, and you're glad to watch them get killed. And what is with the one girl's hair? At first, when they are heading towards a different lab filming in the back of a van with face camo paint on, i thought her hair was a mophead attached to the hat she had on as part of a disguise. A few frames later, I realized it was her hair in blonde dread locks.She dies about an hour into this mess after she throws up on her shoes, whick is shown, and then tossed face first into a door. Which is what you should do to yourself if you waste your money on this garbage. Throw yourself into a door, and slam it on your own head as punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the future professional baker","review":"This is another of the books I use as reference for my cooking school. It contains recipes from Le Cordon Bleu schools and recipes from America. Most of the recipes are for large quantities and it is definately not a book for the home baker, this is a great reference book to be used in a professional pastry kitchen.I particularly like this book because it gives you a basic recipe for let's say a bavarois cream, and then it gives you ten other variations (chocolate, coffee, strawberry, etc) that you can make by changing or adding one or two ingredients.The instructions are clear and easy to follow.I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is thinking of baking seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"good in theory","review":"If you are looking for good recipes, then this book is not for you.But if you just want to know how to operate a bakery or just want to have an idea of how to bake and decorate basic recipe then this book is for you.The recipes are to be modified by you so that it can taste better. What is written in the book is just a general way of how to make it.The good part is the part about how to decorate a cake, how to place the filling and layer the cake traditionally.All in all i would say it is a good book if you are looking for theories and facts in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"To bake, or not to bake, that is the question...","review":"Honestly, I found this textbook to be hard to follow, difficult to understand, and many of the recipes and formulas did not work. Also, there were not many photos, and the diagrams were confusing. This certainly is not for the home chef, and I hesitate to recommend this to professional students either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste!","review":"this book is an atrocity to the pastry chef, i don't know about you but i want to see what i'm cooking and this book has very few pictures, and the recipes are completely wrong i've used this book in culinary school, 70% of the things we cooked were absolutely flavorless, and just plain didn't work! and the only reason i still have it is to occupy space in my library, i highly recommend Advanced Bread and Pastry by Michel Suas, or Baking and Pastry by the CIA, and for professionals Bo Fribergs books The Professional Pastry Chef, and Advanced Professional Pastry Chef"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality lamp base","review":"This is a heavy, well made lamp base. It came with how to use and maintain instructions that are easy to read and use. I had a repro-tiffany shade that needed a base. This base is perfect and stylish, they look great together. The nite lite base is a nice feature. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cape Breton cheese (except for 2 tracks)","review":"First, I should say that I knew what I was getting into before I bought this CD... and I went ahead and bought it anyways.This is very much *not* the new wave of Nova Scotian music; if you're looking for Natalie Macmaster or Ashley MacIsaac, look elsewhere. If you're looking for Buddy Macmaster you're probably better off looking elsewhere, too.I bought this CD for one reason: Howie MacDonald's version of the \\"Skye Boat Song\\". (I'll be waltzing to it with my mom at my upcoming wedding.) For the most part the rest of the CD is, well, unbelievably cheesy. The only exception is the Rankin Family's \\"Jigging Medley\\", which features excellent musicianship despite the grating vocals. Then again the Rankin Famliy's reputation precedes it. (Too bad Heather and Raylene don't fare as well on their own!!)This CD is not for everyone... and not even for me if I'd been able to find Howie Macdonald's \\"Skye Boat Song\\" somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Scott Card Makes a Believable Universe","review":"Call of the Earth is an electrifying saga of humanity trying to leave their warlike ways. This is an \\"Earth that could be\\", and it's not all that far from reality. Very well worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAAAAY overpriced!","review":"Any book in the Homecoming series would get a lukewarm review from the average Card fan. The storyline just isn't as riveting as Card's other works. I definitely wouldn't pay $200!!! for it! There must be a glitch in the system - are his books being printed on platinum now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills the pot-hole","review":"Well, it's not the same quality as the rest of the road, but it fill the gap between 1 and 3. I still liked it, don't get me wrong, but I still like the Memory of Earth better. And I won't compare it to Ender's Game #1) because I've never read it (I know many of you are shieking right now) #2) because they are different books. Of course it's \\"no Ender's Game\\", because it's not. Just cuz the man can't turn out his absolute best every single time, don't hold it against him. It's a good book. If you're reading the whole series, then it's a must-read, just so you don't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a filler if anything","review":"After reading the first book in the homecoming saga I was fairly dissapointed in The Call To Earth. The 2nd book seemed to lack any real substance. There really is nothing going on, it seems to me that Card made this book as a filler. There are a bunch of useless characters and useless events, this book could easily be condensed to around 200 pages and be much better than it is now. Personally I did enjoy it, although I have to admit more then a few times I dosed off reading the book and skipped a few pages simply to try to stop the boredom. I am hoping this book is a build up to the 3rd book in the series, if not Im afraid the rest of the saga may be just as bad if nto worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was ready to get out of the car.","review":"Listened to this book while travelling. I have read and listed to the Ender's Saga. In between finishing those early books and starting the Homecoming series I discovered OSC's LDS affiliation. While there was not much overt influence in the Ender's books parallels were endless in this volume. Rather than look at L. Ron Hubbard I would rather compare this cross-genre influence to C.S. Lewis or Madelyne L'Engle and their sybolic Christian references. Pleasant driving drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversoul? Try over-sold!","review":"I'm quite a fan of Orson Scott Card, and I appreciate that he lets his faith infuse his writing. Although not a Morman, Irecognize Card's inherent morality as one of his strong points. Unfortunately, in this book, and in this series, Card has gotten away from forming his writing by moral dilemmas, and instead has gotten into subtle propaganda for the LDS church. It's kind of like L. Ron Hubbard writing about Xebu or clams.The combination makes this work both below Card's normally excellent standards, and also not a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religiosly black and white - more than a century out of date","review":"Like in Memory of Earth the characters are sickeningly bland, and what's more important act outrageously stupid for people living in a dream world that has freedom of religion, instant data access, instant communication and seemingly a social system granting prosperity to everyone.The worst part are the religious ravings and horrible dream interpretations. If I hadn't read the Ender series I would have been on the verge of calling the author a religious nutbar but, alas ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of creativity","review":"Orson Scott Card is Mormon, and if we didn't know it before, now we do--he based the entire plot of the Homecoming series on the Book of Mormon. It's so pathetic that I am speechless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears","review":"Sorry, this book is not Mr Card's best. The characters are 2 dimensional and the plot is transparent. This is in stark contrast to his Endgame books which I thoroughly enjoy. Sorry Orson, you hit a skunk with a broom on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"I'm a Card fan and have been for decades. I love most everything he has written and re-read many of his books twice yearly. The Ender and Bean series, Songmaster, Alvin Maker, Treasure Box, The Lost Boys, Pastwatch, all are more than worthy of reading again and again and again. I even read Saints more than once and enjoyed it almost as much as the first read...and I'm not a Mormon.The Call of Earth series is incredibly boring. There is no other word for it. I forced myself through the first two books and about half of the third and then gave up. (I bought the entire set at once, simply because I had so loved his other works.) I'll never finish the series and have put the books into my 'Yard Sale' box of books I never want to read again.I have no idea why this is. Someone told me that 'Call' is the Book of Mormon redone in SF form and, if this is the case, perhaps Mark Twain was right.'Call' is \\"chloroform in print\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't no Ender's Game","review":"This book ain't no Ender's Game, that is for sure. Is it really possible that the same guy wrote both books? Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy them. If you haven't read the Book of Mormon or aren't familiar with Mormonism at all I reco doing both before reading this series, you'll get more out of it and understand Card's writing better in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"Juvenile. I was stuck with a couple of books from the Homecoming series on a 6 hour flight. The characters are annoyingly one-dimensional - the good are too good and the evil too evil. It appears that Card is just telling a very simplistic morality tale, stretched over many books. Might be enlightening to a 6 year (an extraordinary naive one). Stick to Aesop's Fables for this kind of stuff. I threw the books out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I love all of these Orson Scott Card Books all of his books are a great read. thank you very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The disappointment continues","review":"Well this series took a downturn. The first one wasn't great to start with. Yet, somehow, the series managed to become MORE one-dimensional, MORE predictable and MORE overtly religious in overtones. Except that even in the Bible people have more depth than in this book. Everyone in the second book seems to be either revoltingly self-centered and hard to get along with. Or id they aren't, they are so self-righteous that they make me want to start swearing and doing naughty things just to break up the monotony. This series is definitely a disappointment when side-by-side with Mr. Card's other books. I fell terrible for those who read this first, I'm sure they will never read any of his other stuff to see what can be GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"this guide is not very good","review":"yea , i purchased the book , but , half the codes i already knew were in there and i knew the layouts , all i really needed was the strategy to defeating goo without cheats , it listed no guide what-so-ever in the guide .. so im sorry i rate this a 1 , i knew more than the book did , except for a goo strategy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly design headphone","review":"I purchased this headphone 2 months ago and boy was I disappointed. Unless you have big ears to hook the headphones on, you are out of luck! The ear piece keeps falling off and you can not adjust the ear piece to make it fit. I absolutely wasted my money and if I were you, I try to find something else. The quality of the sound may be a good one but I haven't had a chance to make a fair judgement only because the darn thing keeps falling off from my ear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality product","review":"- Very loose fitting- Sound quality is not very good- keeps slipping out of the ear, have to press hard to tuck it back in- All these problems faced just by using the headphones in sitting position.

They did but not in just a lil out of them. When running the actual headfone will comeout and dangle on outerside of the recess that makes the ear canal. They will stiil be around your ears but you will have to push them in again and again to get better sound and some Isolation. Sound on the otherhand is much better than what you can expect from a 10$ earphone. Actually it was better than the Sennheiser MXL51 that I bought along with it. So Great Sound, but the grail of stable earphones still remains elusive."},{"rating":"1","title":"good maybe for elephants.....","review":"Following all the good reviews about these,I went and got a pair. It took me exactly 10 seconds to see what the problem is: these earphones are HUGE! How can anybody put that thing into his ear? And I an a pretty big guy. Of course, if they are not sitting properly in your ear the sound qulity is lousy. My only comfort is that I only lost 12$"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable, Good Sound","review":"These are good simple affordable headphones. The sound is good and I like that they are not bud style because I don't like how those feel crammed into my ear. You can barely feel that your wearing these and the sound is very good. These are not noise canceling so you can still hear whats going on arond you while listening which is something I prefer although some may not. These are great headphones for this price. I am thinking of getting these for my mom as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps, but not perfect.","review":"Maybe no earbuds are perfect, but these are close. I do have some trouble keeping them close inside my ear to keep the volume steady. Bigger ears might help. But the cord is much longer than I can imagine ever needing. I'm forever getting it tangled up even while I'm wearing them. I run/jog 3 miles on average every day. The sound is very good, music seems true to recording. I use them with a Creative Zen-plus. They are much better than the buds without the ear bra to hold them in the ear. Orange is a nice color. I can easily find them when I've left them on the bed, chair, back seat of the car, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence of the left earphone.","review":"I purchased this item on 12/12/09 and it never fit comfortably in the left ear but they were about twelve bucks so I did not send them back. Well on 7/9/2010 the left earphone stopped working. They were not mishandled or torn. There was no indication there was a problem with them. The sound was good and all of a sudden it stopped working. I am disappointed because Sony is usually a reliable product. I did not purchase a warranty and I guess I am literally paying the price for not doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony headphones MDR-J10","review":"I actually purchased the blue ones. These hurt my ears, there is not any flexibility in the ear pieces. I know this is because I wear glasses, so if you also wear glasses buy headphones that are soft and flexible.

Lives up to the Sony Audio brand. It delivers audio quality, product quality and design elements far above the line of acceptance for the given price range.Reference: Listening to the new Mark Knopfler release over this phones plugged to my iPhone( CD converted in loss-less format, not AAC).Pros:- Ergonomics : Feather light, I don't even feel that I am wearing anything over my ears (other than my glasses - yeah! Sony designers kept us in mind ). Does not pop off like the ear-buds do. Not to repeat the other engineering qualities that other reviewers noted ...- Audio quality : Comparable to other Sony products in this price range. That is, extremely pleasant, has a wide dynamic range, virtually free of any noise.Cons:- cant think of any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running","review":"Great headphones for running. Even a fairly hard tug at the wire won't pull them from your ears. They also work well for mountain biking, although the over the ear design is a little tricky when wearing a helmet and sunglasses - still the best option I've ever found though. Well worth the money.June 5, 2012 Update - these headphones are still going strong. I love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I ordered this because the way it was explained these head phones were comfortable and stayed on easily.. WRONG!!! they hurt my ears and they do NOT stay in place very well, I had to adjust them constantly. So maybe it is different for everyone due to their ears and how they fit, but they were not worth it to me and it would cost me more to return them, then to just donate them to Goodwill at least them I get a tax deduction off of them......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable but Flimsy","review":"The headphones are very comfortable while working out. However, when the rubber on the connector of the 1/8\\" stereo jack touches anything, the sound comes in and out, or sounds metallic. If I touch the connector again, the sound may come back, but it usually takes a few tries. That is until I bump the connector again.I would like to see the connector's durability enhanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!!! J! E! T! S! JETS! JETS!

I researched some and found these. It's not the best sound, but they are comfortable and stay on pretty well while running. It seems to have stretched out a little bit, but continue to stay on. The only complaint I have is the sound doesn't shoot directly into your ear like earbuds. When running the headphones shift some and it shoots out some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair.","review":"They look neat, sound fair, and tangle quite easily. Despite their appearance, they really are not well designed for active people. While running, sweat somehow manages to run down the plastic clips and \\"flood\\" the ear buds. It did not long before they started to sound weak, and lose bass response. Finally my right side blew, even though my MP3 player has a pretty mild sound output.I got a few months of use out of them, and am debating getting a new pair. I don't like the idea of disposable hardware; I expected much better from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"one ear bud died after less than one year!","review":"My original review is below. One of the ear buds has died. Disappointing.----I just received these, so this is not a long-term owner review, but I can say that I like the fit and quality of these headphones. The ear buds that you just push into your ear always fall out of my ears, so the vertical clip-in design is a must for me; these feel secure. The sound quality is fine.The only con for me thus far is: I bought these expecting a bright orange color. The color is more of a red-orange. This isn't a huge deal, but not what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"These headphones looked perfect and very cute. But when I got them, first I couldn't get them to actually hook around my ears (smaller ears I guess). Without the hooks working they could partially sit as earbuds - but I wouldn't have been able to wear them very long because the plastic is painful in my ears. Last thing is the sound quality is awful. No bass and lots of static noise if the volume is over half way up. I guess they were cheap...in every way, more hassle to return than it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"My top choice for running for years","review":"I love these! Earbuds don't work for me b/c I have small ears. I run a lot and these work great for any distance. They only seem to last for 4-6 months before one side loses sound, but for $10 that's fine with me. I've tried more expensive versions and they don't work as well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Didn't Buy These","review":"I wish that I would have spent just a little more money on something better, that I could actually use! I don't see how anyone can wear these. I wouldn't consider my ears small by any means, but there's no physical way that these headphones will stay on me.

Also I had a pair of Sony clip on's and they were made of a bendable soft rubber so wearing them felt great, these on the other hand are hard plastic and they slip off easily.

I recently purchased an iPod and the earbuds that came with it were so uncomfortable I knew I had to find something better. I wanted something that would be small yet comfortable and would stay in place when walking, running, etc. These headphones are perfect! They fit my ear like a glove, and the smaller \\"earbud\\" piece slips right in and rests comfortably just inside your ear. They're very comfortable and don't budge even when yanking on the cord. They don't have the world's best sound quality, but they fit the bill for the kind of music I listen to. If you like your music loud and with a lot of heavy bass, these may not be for you - but compared to the stock iPod earbuds these have very comparable sound. I recommend these to anybody who is looking for a good alternative to the not-so-comfortable earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing Sound","review":"Yeah they fit good and are durable but their sound quality is awful.

These have the worst sound I have ever heard. I am not that picky when it comes to sound but these really suck. Plus they don't fit too well around the ear. They seem to stay in place ok but they always feel like they are going to fall off. My other over the ear jvc set is much better the ear size is adjustable so they stay on very well.

I continued in my persuit to find a book like this. Ian McNair does an outstanding job of teaching the lanuage fast and understandably. Now I can't say 'It's Greek to me.'Thinking that a second lanuage is to hard to learn is no longer a valid excuse. Ian says, Oh yes you can! And to prove it, he wrote this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Aid for Beginning and Furthering Greek Study","review":"I love this instructional book. MacNair is both sagacious and cunning in his prolific instruction on everything from learning basic pronouns and the 4 cases, to actually translating Biblical phrases. All the while, he intermingles a likeable sense of humor in a didactic way! I recommend this to everyone who wants to make their latest pursuit the learning of the Greek language and it's peculiarities. On a critical note, I do not approve or accept the way that MacNair still attaches the disgusting, yet traditional doctrine of the trinity on certain areas in the book. Why, when one closely examines the sentence structure in the original Greek, such things have to be dismissed. Such things were not the thoughts that Bible writers wanted to convey."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME AS THE 7TH EDITION","review":"If you were looking to save money by buying the older edition of this book, sadly, it won't work.Every semester when I am told by my professors to buy the new book...I do. But I also buy the last edition (usually for pennies on the dollar compared to the new edition) and usually find that there is no need for the newer, more expensive version. (I then return the new version to the book store for a refund and use the savings to buy supplements.) That is not true with this book.Difference between 6th and 7th Edition:Not only are there a lot of new cases in the new one and dropped cases from the old one, but the chapters are organized differently. All you have to do is look at the table of contents for both books and you will see that the old version won't work if you professor is having you read specific page numbers.I think this is the first time ever, but I highly recommend buying the newer edition of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"An interesting read, with lots of information about the huge oil, aluminum, banking, etc., companies. The title is very misleading, as I couldn't find any instances where Paul Mellon actually did anything wrong, personally. You'd think, based on the title, that Mr. Mellon was an evil puppetmaster, pulling strings and controlling the energy supply of the planet. In actuality, he and his family simply own huge portions of stock in many different companies, much like most fabulously wealthy families do. I don't blame Paul, or any of the Mellons, for anything they do or have done in the past, any more that I'd blame Bill Gates or Warren Buffett for enjoying their immense wealth. It's simply not anyone's business what someone does with their own money, but since this book was written in 1974, and there was certainly a hippie bias against \\"the establishment\\" in that era, I can't blame the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good spy story and romance; well paced!","review":"I really enjoyed this story. I think it is her first Regency and for me it had all I look for. Romance, witty dialogue, very likeable characters and, as a bonus, a good spy story that kept me guessing. There were no slow points in the entire book. My only quibble was when a secondary character made a very stupid move that seemed almost too stupid to be believed. Luckily the key word here is \\"almost\\" so I was able to accept it without ruining my enjoyment of the story too much. This is more a 4.5 star for me than a 5 because it didn't quite make my \\"classic Regency\\" list. But I finished the book with a smile on my face, sorry it ended but satisfied with the ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give this book a miss","review":"The book starts off with a promising plot then veers off into contrived and unbelieveable situations.

My biggest complaint is the lack of volume control, which I can't understand why anything that has to do with bedtime would lack. Also, Pooh's intermittent \\"I'm so sleepy\\" is disruptive at the fixed volume. I love the lights, I love the music, I love the nature sounds, but without volume control, they're all pointless. Maybe two rooms away it's a lullaby soother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"This lullaby soother is just that. Nothing helps makes my son relax like this.

It was great, he slept in his own crib every night after we got this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Toy - a little loud...","review":"I've been reading the reviews of this item and agree that the volume is loud. A quick fix is to take the music box out of the pillow, get a piece of scotch tape and put it over a couple of the sound vents, then put it back into the case. It makes it much quieter and can be removed easily....hope this helps...All in all, it's a really cute toy. Our daughter likes the nature sounds best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can hurt baby?","review":"The pillow part is heavy-my son dropped it on his head a few times while on back. I keep it on his dresser now. I love the toy, it's very sweet looking/sounding.

For the first time, he fell asleep on his own when I put this in his crib (he generally nurses to sleep or is rocked to sleep). He fell asleep while watching it/listening to it twice in one day. When he was fussy, I put it by him and he immediately quieted down to listen to it and watch it again. The sounds are great. The change of lights is soothing. I find myself getting sleepy when I put it on. My only complaints have already been addressed by others - Pooh talking intermittently is a bit disruptive (my son would be drifting off to sleep and wake up slightly whenever Pooh talked) and the volume (I can't tell there are two levels) is waaaay too loud. I have to put the doll across the room from my son because it's just too loud. If they corrected this feature, specifically, I'd rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was only 2 weeks old. She slept a lot better with it. Now she is almost 5 months and loves to snuggle up to him before drifting off to sleep. It has soft songs, and it lights up her crib with red, green, blue, etc. its very soothing. It's a must for a crib! PLEASE keep in mind that remote RARELY works. We stopped using it and the company refused to fix it for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book and a great guy","review":"It's almost hard to believe that the same man who terrorized NFL offenses in the 60s could be the nice guy that this book makes him appear to be. Ray Nitschke was truly a class act. He might have enjoyed crushing an opposing quarterback, but off the field he was set a great example as someone who cared deeply for his family, friends and teammates. Although he had a rough start in life, he learned early that he wanted a life he could be proud of, and where he could be an example for others. I never expected this book to be inspiring when I bought it, but it certainly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"THE SPACE MUSEUM is definitely one of the best Dr Who stories of the first Doctor sagas. The acting is very realistic, particularly with the first episode. (The first episode also has a neat surprise!). For THE CRUSADES, all I can say is too bad the BBC threw out the other two episodes. This story proved that Dr Who didn't have to be all about monsters. Superb acting all of the say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the Crusade","review":"This tape consists of the two remaining episodes of The Crusade and the complete version of The Space Museum. The Space Museum's first episode is fantastic, but the remaining three are a complete let-down. Don't let this keep you from buying this tape. The Crusade more than makes up for it; the plot and characterization are fantastic. It's only a shame it isn't complete.

If you do not have an outlet in the room you want to put it you are out of luck. I was planning to put it in my closet but won't work unless I put an extension cord which I do not see it practical.The other thing they do not tell you is that you cannot use it for more than 18 hours. Well, what happens after this? Does it go on fire? I thought it could be left unattended until the colors changed but not with a limitation.

A number of the reviews noted that it was effective in small bathrooms, so we tried it for ours (about 5' X 8') and were sorely disappointed. One problem was likely that our expectations were too high for such a small device to be effective in the bathroom. It does seem like it was absorbing moisture, because the silica beads changed color. However, the biggest problem we had was that the recharging just didn't work. We left it plugged in (in a well ventilated room) for hours, but the silica beads never returned to their blue color. After trying to charge it three times, the best we got was a pinkish purple color. The unit also got alarmingly hot when it was plugged in for recharging. Further, some of the silica beads seemed to deform/melt from the charging - Perhaps because the unit got too hot? Either way, we returned the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We are using this in our master bathroom and it works great!

I purchase about 2 or three of these neat little items and placed them around the apartment and they sucked up the moisture well. It's energy efficient the only thing is that it required the use of an outlet to expel the moisture which is not a luxury when you reside in close quarters but if you have the space to plug it in and open your window to let the excess moisture get out good for you but then you really wouldn't need it so this is only beneficial if you live in a tiny not well ventilated apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but maybe not big enough for what I need","review":"These things seem to work as described. I can easily hang them in my closets, and the little blue things turn pink over time. The problem is that they seem to only take a few days to turn totally pink and then I have to re-charge it (which is also pretty easy).

Sure, our Maltese does chew through it and destroys it in about a year or two, but she just loves it so much. It's her favorite toy! I first bought one from a local posh dog store, and they can't keep them in stock (I just looked the other day, and they're out of stock again!). I'm ordering a few more here, just in case they ever stop making them.When our Maltese destroys another one. I take away the stuffing, so she cannot swallow it. For months now, she has been carrying a hollowed out, silent Henrietta. Like the others that came before, it will be torn to pieces one day (you should see the look on our dog's face when she accomplishes this). I then give her a new one, and the cycle begins. I know it's silly, but the toy does last at least few years with her. I've purchased other similar ones, and our dog just goes back to her Henrietta, even when it's falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool but not so cool","review":"Sure, this toy is awesome, you will certainly think it's really cool and fun looking, its squeak is hilarious, etc, etc.I gave it to my dog (a boxer) and it was love at first sight. In the course of two days, she first broke Henrietta's beak, she removed the head, then the neck and finally, following her deconstructive labor, she got rid of the squeaker... I just had to throw it away, I was scared that my dog would swallow the stuffing or the rubber when I wasn't looking.I guess it's a toy made for a smaller, dog. If you have a muscular, strong, hyper dog who likes to chew, I wouldn't recommend it at all. I would also try first the smaller version, I had the bigger one, and I'm almost certain the smaller one is more tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I received a Henrietta in the mail today for my dog, and I gave her to him right away.

She came a couple a days ago and was just as cute as I thought she would be and made a funny sound. My dog loved her! HOWEVER, Henrietta is made of VERY flimsy rubber and absolutely cannot hold up to any dog. I have a little Boston Terrier and she had the head off and shredded in less than 5 minutes. Since my dog has loads of toys and very seldom literally takes one of them apart -- none of them in such a short period of time -- I really was shocked. A half hour later, I discovered a pile of rubber and stuffing that used to be Henrietta. She is not cheap and really was a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"This is a horrible game. I have played every other Sims game made, and this does not even come anywhere near to being as good as the rest.

I would totally not recomend this game, the only thing that happens is this guy who lives in a mansion comes around and steels all your stuff, so you have to try to move to the mansion to get it all back. I would not recomend this for kids 10 nand lower because there is some kissing and love content. Dudley who's house you got to first is a tralior disgised as a pig sty. It is quiet disgusting and I shut my game down as soon as I got there. The first house you live in is your mom's house and your mom looks like a wolf.

You have to always have all the skills you need to get a promotion in the career part of the game, and you have to be happy ,(which is basically impossible). This game is supposed to let you start a family and get married, but that to is impossible to figure out how. This game is also supposed to let you build your very own house but, sadly ypu can't have your own house, you have to share it with which ever sim you are living with. You can't shppse which sim you want to live with either. But overall this game is very adicting and you probably won't want t stop playing it until you get another game.

If you prefer mission based gameplay and nothing else, this is the game for you. If you prefer the open ended free play of the original console Sims and the PC games, save your money. In the Bustin' Out version of free play you are only given three open houses instead of the six in the original. You can forget about all the exciting places like Club Rubb and Pixel Acres you unlock in the mission based mode because you can't visit or call any of the Sims you met there. You're basically stuck in your free play house with only your neighbors from the other two free houses to invite over. This total lack of freedom ruined the replay value of this game for me despite the new items and locations. I only recommend this disaster to die hard Sims fans who must own every game and expansion."},{"rating":"2","title":"BusTiN Out!","review":"I have a gamecube, and ever since I've had it, I wanted the Sims.

Its awesome because you can play against a friend! They have many new items, and the people are looking better than ever!! Their faces are actually quite nice! There's new clothes, new faces, and new accessories! Zoom features make this game so much more easy to control and see. If you want to see the whole house, you can! If u want to zoom in to see your sims have a nice conversation, you can! Speaking of conversation, there are so many new social options! There are 2 great modes, Bust Out and Free Play mode.

In the games time, it takes him an hour and a half to eat, half hour to go to the bathroom, he needs to sleep for at least nine hours and need to be happy, clean, likes the house, is relaxed, and is social staduis is good.

Now i'm here rating the sims busting out for the home consoles. First and foremost it was an excellent upgrade of the original that released on the consoles prior to it. The non ope-ended game mode was way more challenging than on the first. Yyou having to end the game in all seven of the career options to \\"make your dreams come true\\", yet it again left me wondering what to do next after completing it. Now the open ended mode in my opinion wasn't as open-ended as on the original sims for the consoles. Although the players you create in that mode would be able to visit are even marry you in the career mode it failed when you compared it. Overall it's a great game and a great upgrade that leaves you in anticipation for more from maxis and it's creators. So enjoy busting out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Memory cards!","review":"I have 3 kids who all would like to play this game, but they can't without erasing the other's progress. Whenever you create another person to play with, it asks you if you would like to save, you click yes, and it asks you if you would like to overwrite the current player. Its stupid, and memory cards turned out costing much more than the game itself, so if you have more than 1 person wanting to play this game, you have three options. Buy massive amounts of memory cards; don't end up buying the game in the first place; or listening to arguing over who erased who's Sims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sims Reveiw","review":"Hi everyone, i really reccomend getting or at least renting the sims bustin' out.

I don't know if I would have liked it better had I not already got Sims2 when I bought this, if it's the difference between the PS2 and the PC controlling system, the plot, or what it is. I just can't get into the game.I love Sims and Sims2, and even spent a good six or seven hours playings \\"The Urbz\\" on PS2 with a friend, but I can't do this. I bought it when I realized I would have to send my PC into the shop and wasn't sure I could do without my \\"Sims Fix\\" but this certainly did not satisfy, about the only thing I liked was going through character creation, that was a great deal of fun, but once the actual game play started...urgh. I stuck it out for almost an hour, and couldn't take any more. I keep meaning to go back and give it another try, because I can't believe there's a Sims game I wouldn't like, but I just can't bring myself to play again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native American Postcolonial Psychology","review":"The authors have been able to finally delineate some of the issues facing the Aboriginal community the world over.

The guy who translated this 4 volume series was obviously not a fan of the anime series, or he wouldn't have tainted it by translating PYO/NYO/NYU into SQUEEK/MEOW/MYEW, & on top of that, the characters don't end almost every sentance with pyo/nyo/nyu/gema like they're supposed to.

And if you're a particular fan of the war in the Pacific theatre, you will truly enjoy this game! The details, graphics and historical content of this game are pretty authentic, and lend an added aire of excitement and enthusiasm to it's play. The instructions and controls are fairly straight-forward and easy to understand; i.e., not so complicated that it takes away from the overall fun of playing the game. If you're an 'older' video game enthusiast, like myself, I think you'll find \\"Heroes Of The Pacific\\" a worthwhile and satisfying addition to your game collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too hard!!!!!","review":"I agree with all who said that the game is WAY TOO HARD! I hold a private pilot license and have also flown radio control planes for over 25 yrs so I know what I am saying when I say that the flight charateristics AND the campaign goals are rediculously difficult even in the \\"rookie\\" mode. The game may have some possitive value for those who know where and how to get cheats or who enjoy doing the same level 25-30 times and still not advancing but I am not one of those. I had a successfull career as a watchmaker and jeweler so patience and precision are not problems for me but enough is enough. Also there is little or no instruction on how to accomplish any of the goals in each scenario. I was initially pleased with finding a WWII flying game but now very disapointed and have quit playing it since the idea is to have fun not to get so completely frustrated that you want to throw the controller through a window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try. Secret Weapons was WAY better","review":"I'm starting to agree with other writers of reviews for this game. That damn instructor that keeps yelling at you any time you demonstrate any free will should be shot. This game is a SAD copy of Secrety Wepons Over Normandy. I'm a huge WWII aircraft buff and spend my free time studying the aircraft of that era. Of course it was fun to fly the F4U for a sec but the missions are ridiculous. The graphics are good and there's a great use of WW II propaganda posters between missions. I did like that you can get a view as if your actually in the cockpit as well. However that view is that same no matter what plane your in. At least with \\"Secret Weapons\\" they did their homework. I'm sorry but there's no way any fighter pilot had to shoot down 80 planes in a single mission. I returned this game after one play."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of action/many types of planes","review":"I bought this as a game and a history lesson for my 10 yr old.

Extremely high learning curve, it's impossible to control your plane, and unless you have a very big TV you won't ever even see the plane that kills you...again...and again...and again. It's not realistic and not fun. If you must have WW2 dogfighting, find a copy of Microsoft's Flight Combat Simulator, the first or second one will run on any PC made in the last ten years. You can fine-tune the realism from instant arcade action and immortality to a realistic 20 seconds of bullets and several hours of travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun","review":"This game is not fun, it is tedious. Everytime you fail at a mission you have to go back to the beginning. Listening to the instructor nag you that you need to get back to your flight plan when you are directly over the enemy target is annoying to say the least. I could also do without the constant insults. I agree with a previous reviewer; targeting is extremely hard and frustrating. Note to Programers: GAMES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

I've been flying MS Flight Sim for a couple of years. I thought a PS2 game might be better since the 'computer' is designated for the game. I failed to consider the stupidity of programmers. It seems that realism is something of which they are completely unaware. The 'targets' are either too close too quick or too far away for the unrealistic amount of time given to complete the level. And the side shots or flybys are not just stupid, they interfere with your concentration and smoothness. I'll stick to driving games on PS2. I'm going back to the computer for flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I love flight sims... I REALLY love WWII games... so the thought of a WWII flight sim was too much to ignore.But this game is just awful. I've played 2 levels of this game and some instant action, and it's just waaaaaay too difficult to control your plane. I am not a huge fan of arcade-style sims; I prefer a game like Ace Combat over something like After Burner, which is what this game reminds me of. Dogfighting is a thrill, but the controls are depressingly bad. It's either too much pitch or not enough. And without the benefit of a 1st-person HUD, it's even worse. Essentially, if you want a good WWII flight sim, stick to something like Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator for your computer. Until someone comes out with something like that for PS2, I'll stick with the Ace Combat games."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to controll plane when shooting","review":"as 2 time world champion of warbirds i say with some authority that this game is unplayable concerning lining up a shot......absolutely the worst i've ever played"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ideal, user-friendly text for intermediate to advanced Latin students","review":"Now in a newly revised edition, Bradley's Arnold Latin Prose Composition is a classic and comprehensive review of Latin grammar and Latin prose composition with exercises to demonstrate key grammatical principles.

A merciless, brutal, egoistic and aggressive social environment: already at school children are badgered, resulting in several deaths per year.But the biggest victims in this overcrowded country are a Japanese minority group (the burakumin) and women.The burakumin should be compared to the pariahs in India. Because of their discrimination, many of them joined the yakuza (the powerful, also politically, Japanese gangsters) and are now feared.Women are totally subordinate to men.

With a go-at-your own pace, spooky ambience and puzzles with integrated solutions, this game kept me on the edge of my seat--I have to admit, when I reached the closing puzzles, I was tempted to save the game because I was too creeped out to continue! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the sequel","review":"This point and click was a fun game. It's in 1st person in a 2D environment. It had at times a creepy atmosphere, but what I most remember is a feeling of discovery and curiousity. I enjoyed revealing the mystery with my character. I don't recall pixel hunting for clues and the story line revealed itself at a good pace. There were plenty of hotspots to keep me entertained but not so many that I wanted to pull my hair out, and they all added to the story (though in the end, they may not have all been necessary). It's been a while since I played it, but it is a game I thought good enough to keep and play again (which is pretty rare for me). The sequel to this \\"Dark Fall:Lights Out\\" I didn't like, the whys you can see in that review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I was looking for a puzzle game and spooky atmosphere when I came across this game. I wasn't disappointed. With a set of headphones and the lights down I had a lot of fun letting myself get caught up in the game. The puzzles aren't super hard. I only got stuck once. Some of the puzzles seemed a little dependent on how well you clicked your mouse instead of whether you actually could figure out the logic behind them which could get aggravating. I do wish the plot had been a bit more interactive. I finished the game without really being sure just what had happened to some of the characters.All in all I would recommend this game. I find my biggest criticism is that it was really too short. I would have enjoyed playing it longer and exploring more of the setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring(SPOILERS)","review":"I just finished this game and I thought it was very boring. The game only took me a couple of hours would have been less if I wouldn't have had to read so many things through out the game. There aren't any ghosts or any other people in the game would have liked more scary stuff to happen. You're stuck in the hotel the whole time not enough exploring you don't even get to go into the tunnels. I didn't like this game at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Computer Game","review":"This was my first computer game that I ever played, so I did not have anything to compare it to. I enjoyed playing and I was never board. I didn't have time to be with all the note taking. I just thought that was what you did in these type of games.As far as the puzzles go, all the clues were given to you so if you had them, the puzzles were not all that hard to figure out. Even the one with buttons.I am from the Atari generation so, to me, the graphics were great. Since playing Syberia, I know the difference. I was actually board with Syberia at first because I didn't have to take notes!All in all it was a great game. I did not like the ending at all, it made it seem like a dream. I do hope that DarkFall II will have a better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Top Ten","review":"Yes, it does contain a lot of reading, and it does help to take notes. But it's worth it. I've been at this for several hours now & I can hardly get out of my chair to go to work. Don't play this at night alone, the sounds are really creepy! It's a 1st person game, so you don't have the personality of Gabriel Knight; & the graphics, while excellent, are not as startlingly beautiful as Syberia, but despite these flaws it is a terrific game, not too easy but not requiring a lot of cheating like some games. Much creepier than Black Mirror. Big plus for those who hate extensive dialogue -- you're all alone in this creepy place! Or are you....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Everyone","review":"I bought this game based on the positive reviews, I had high hopes for it. I love adventure and point and click games. I have found more interesting games for free on the internet. I found it incredibly boring and not at all scary. I played it for about and hour or two, quit and uninstalled it. I felt completely ripped off. I didn't feel like I had any idea where it was going. I would say save your money and try \\"The Longest Journey\\" or \\"Syberia\\", these were much more fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing game I've played in a long time","review":"I bought this game based on the great reviews, but I was very, very disappointed when I finally played it. I'm surprised this didn't come in a set of 3.5\\" disks instead of on a CD. If you like playing games that look like they were made in 1990, then this game is for you. Everything about this game is cheap and behind-the-times. Navigating one full screen at a time (instead of actually \\"walking\\" from place to place\\" severely detracts from the game's realism and playability. If you want to waste a few dollars on a game you'll only play once or twice, I suggest you buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark, and don't know where to continue the game.","review":"Poor game!

It is delightfully creepy (the designer, if I remember correctly, is a former ghost-hunter, and the knowledge gained there is evident here) and has above-average graphics.The game can occasionally be frustrating when you realize that the clue you need is going to make you backtrack, but for the most part, the puzzles are tough but solvable--a few require an extra leap of logic, which only makes it all the more satisfying when you figure it out.And, finally, I highly recommend playing this game with another person. Not only does that make it more fun--you *will* get swept up into the plot, and it's great to have someone to talk about it with--but having two perspectives on a lot of the puzzles makes it a bit easier. I played through it with my boyfriend, and we're still wondering what happened with a few of the characters..."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THE TOP 5 AWESOME GAMES FOR ME","review":"creepy, thrilling, intriguing 1st person point and click. sneak about in some seriously weird places and before you know it, about 10 hours have passed and your stomach will be growling-- you forgot to eat or sleep cuz you were so into this game. by far a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Series","review":"This historical series is set in fifteenth century England and features Sister Frevisse.

Jane is a stubborn and virtuous young woman who believes that she can find a life for herself outside the nunnery and works against odds to achieve this.Frazer does an excellent job in presenting a tale of medieval mystery which is true to the period.

In my experience, most tech books have one or two tech editors. This one had 9.Finding a Flash solution is easy because the book's format is consistently Problem -> Solution -> Discussion. This facilitates homing in on what you need. The discussion is where the true learning value is concentrated for those who want to go beyond dealing with their current production challenge.One important aspect of this book should be mentioned. The authors concentrate on Flash-based, authoring-time solutions. ActionScript is not the focus -- even though it plays a role in many solutions here.

It arrived with the package damaged and the top of the heater dented. The dent appeared to be just cosmetic so we tested and it seemed to work fine. We had it professionally installed. It worked fine for about a week. Then it kept shutting down due to the flame out sensor tripping. We did some research and were finally able to resolve that. It operated fine for about another week then kept shutting down again. This time it was the fuse on the circuit board being poorly installed by the mfg. It was loose and every time the heater gets up to temperature it would lose contact with the circuit board. After that was fixed it worked fine for about a month.

If you are a huge Miyazaki fan like me, you most definitely will be disappointed by how lacking this one is compared to his other films. You will get no action, and then very little, for over 70 minutes. If you have to have it for collection purposes, then make room on your shelf, cause it ain't moving but once. If you are about to spring for what you hope to be another Ponyo, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, etc., then you need to either borrow it first or rent it.

It feels like they put Earthsea in a blender with Princess Mononoke and then only gave us the foamy crud at the top of the smoothy.

Hey, if Ursula K. Le Guin didn't like it, why should I?My main objection with this lethargic mess concerns the dead slow pace at which the barely coherent plot unraveled. With only bits and fits of sporadic action, I found the story less then compelling. It's completely devoid of wonder, and, oddly enough, magic. I also found some of the voice-work questionable. A long musical interlude didn't help matters either. It's a pity Le Guin can't sue. But!

If you are a fan of the series looking for a remake of it in cinematic form, this is NOT it. The director basically chopped up the tale and reused characters where he saw fit. This wouldn't have been problematic if it was actually well done but it wasn't. The plot was awkward and did not make much sense and the characters' actions were unbelievable (such as the explanation as to why Arren kills his father in the first 5s of the movie).I would've given this 0 stars if I could.

That's a major flaw in the approach. Following this, children are not instructed with sound teaching, but rather encouraged to wonder for themselves what the truth is. Instead of simply teaching some simple foundations of the Christian faith that have been taught over the centuries, young children are expected to figure it out and explore together what the Christian faith is. What this eventually leads to, of course, is a religion that is made to suit themselves. Who is really worshipped here- self, or God? Let's not just \\"work with the stories of God\\"- what is that?

Your sim might start to complain because it is hungry, has to pee, wants entertainment, or is tired. When this happens, you can't talk to anyone.2. If you get a dog, it pees all over your house and you can't punish it. You also have to clean it up.3. It's hard to please people. One of your goals might be to befriend the detective but the choices they give you to say will only make him madder.4.

I promise you won't be dissapointed in this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game!!!","review":"I love Sims Bustin Out! I got it for Christmas this year, and I can't put my gameboy down. The graphics are amazing, and you have so many options. It is great because you can guide your sim around without having to click where you want them to go, unlike regular sims. I also love that you can take sims wherever you want to now that there is a version for gameboy advance.You start out living with your uncle, and you have to complete several goals in order to move into your house. You then recieve more goals, and you get jobs to earn money. You can get promotions, etc. All in all, it is a really fun game, and I reccomend it. I haven't tried the other consoles, but from what I have heard, they have even better graphics.Pros:can take it anywheregreat graphicsawesome gameplay and goalsCons:Diolouge is slightly limited"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The BEST RPG for Gameboy Advance","review":"This game is full of wonder and is not the same as the computer version.

It is full of problems, beginning with the characterization. They don't act or speak like real people would, and don't even act like the character, unrealistic as they may be, that the writer has created. The other reviewer is right, there are lots of twists and turns, but these too are unrealistic. Some things are so absurd it's almost funny.

The cart feels cheaply made, with thin canvas and a light frame. The frame is held together with little screws, and they wobble loose every couple months and have to be re-tightened. I lost one screw that unscrewed itself, and now the whole thing is wobbly and unstable. The compartments are not separate bags, just canvas with dividers, and you can't take the compartments out.

It makes the laundry room look clean and neat. I like it so much I bought another one just to have for a quick house gift on hand.

The materials are cheap and flimsy, and under any kind of strain, the screws have a tendency to come loose and it jerks front and back when you pull it across the shortest of carpet.

It was insane!)I would tighten the screws which would help for a few minutes, then the frame would begin to sway again. It became so bad that the frame would almost touch the ground with each sway!

It was a book I had in childhood and I remember loving it. Found it, ordered it, and continue to love it. I now keep several in my house as giveaways to friends, family members and neighbors. The kind of tactile, imaginative play that is the subject of this book is the absolute anecdote to too many electonics (more abstract play). I love electronics also, but I think kids need a good amount of this kind of play. We all need some of this in our lives, come to think of it!

It is the type of album that you can play on repeat (without skipping a track, of course) over and over and over and enjoy it just as much everytime.I would also like to add that they are one of the best live acts I have ever seen. I enjoy the fact that they are totally mellow while completely rocking out at the same time. My favourite part about watching them is that John has this huge smile on his face the ENTIRE time. He radiates happiness and not a trace of pretentiousness/cockiness.

Being a Titanic fanatic this is the worst (out of many) book I have read about the Titanic. Maiden Voyage is even a bad title for this book, because the first 100 (aproxx) pages are not even about or have anything to do with the maiden voyage of the Titanic. They deal with how he got named and him watching his father and his fathers girlfriend take their \\"clothes off\\". And it also is too descriptive of what the boy does. I mean it describes him finding out what life is. If you know what I mean. To give you a clue the kid is going through puberty. Then theres the other part. The kid is only a young teen and he's falling in love ith someone much older than him. The book really wouldn't be bad if it didn't have the sex that it does have in it.. I do not recommend it to anyone who likes the Titanic. Let alone recommend it to anyone else. These are the reasons I rate this book 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uninteresting narrator; didn't break Titanic. Overall, bad.","review":"The character of Sumner was not fully developed, in my opinion - he was selfish, narcisstic (as, I suppose, most boys his age are) and always feeling sorry for himself. As for the Titanic herself, Ms Bass did not do her research - witness have always maintained the ship broke above the surface between the third and fourth stack before the stern attempted to right itself and eventually plunge to the bottom of the ocean. Overall, I found the story of a boy who wants to be a martyr and the historical inaccuracy distracting and not very appealing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a crowd pleaser","review":"After reading this book I am left with the question of what this story had to do with the Titanic. The reality is this is more of a coming of age story about a wealthy young boy than it is a book about the Titanic. The story could take place in Iowa for all the setting had to do with the disaster of 1912.Furthermore, the main character, Sumner Jordan, is quite unbelievable as a 12-year-old boy. In sections of the book Sumner's thoughts and emotions seem more like that of a 20 something; other times he seems more like a teenager, and once in a while a 12 year old emerges.The only character of any interest in the book is Pierce Andrews who unfortunately occupies a relatively brief part of the book. Overall the book is long to get started (do we really need all the family background?), slow to develop, and predictably ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An A For Style","review":"While it's true that this book had little to do with the sinking of the Titanic and the main character, Sumner Jordan, is far from a plausible twelve-year-old character, the style transcends all of that. Bass has a very eloquent way of writing and could set a good example for young and aspiring writers.If you want to check out the book because you are a Titanic buff, keep on searching, but if you are interested in a real writing talent, by all means, try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book, on an interesting subject!","review":"Maiden Voyage, in my opinion was a very distasteful book. The charecters weren't loveable,they were mean and sometimes crude. The subject, in most of the book, was not focused on Titanic, but on the Suffrage Movement and Sumner's own boyhood thoughts. It took only one chapter to sink Titanic, and five chapters to get talking about it. It wasn't even very exciting, as the real event was much more dangerous and adventurous and sad. In conclusion I did not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have versions one and two, do not waste your money!!!","review":"OK.

For a quick and easy read thats a lot of fun, try this book. The book flows very smoothly with it's plot, introdcing several aspects (professional, realationship, friendship, etc..) of the main character, Jane's, twenty-something semi-chaotic life. Throughout the entire read, Holden has you rooting for all of the right characters and she never side-tracks or goes in circles around the main plot. It stays right on line, is full of humor and has a perfect ending... though you wouldn't imagine this ending until maybe the last ten pages. If you like the twenty-something single girl books, then you need to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Hellish","review":"This book had a fair chance to be engaging - the plot centered on a young-ish woman tackling career and love in modern London. Unfortunately, though, the book never engages the reader because of uneven transitions and a flat plot line. The main characters fail to evoke sympathy of any kind, and all attempts at wit are awkwardly contrived. My pain-staking effort to reach the last page left me with that sick feeling of eating too much cotton candy. In other words, I want those hours of my life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the BEST","review":"Jane is a writer that gets stuck writing a column for a party girl named Champagne D'Vyne.

Difficult read and nothing divine about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful!","review":"Maybe you have to be an avid reader of the 'upmarket' glossies like Tatler, and to think that IT girls are important, to enjoy this book. Personally, since I consider intelligence and ability to be far more important than looks and fashion, I found Simply Divine torture to read. Jane seemed to be both intelligent and sensible - so what on earth was she doing working for that kind of magazine and letting herself be talked into ghost-writing some lackwit socialite's column for her? Champagne wasn't just vacuous, she was repulsive, and the so-called humour left me cold.If this is a fair sample of this author's work, I won't be reading anything else by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, simple beach read","review":"The comparisons to Bridget Jones are inevitable . . in fact, justified. Simply Divine chronicles the adventures of yet another 20-something Brit facing job woes, singlehood, and annoying friends and non-friends. I laughed out loud at some parts-- I pictured Champagne D'Vyne as the body of Pamela Lee with the voice of Fran Drescher. To anyone who doesn't read Vogue or Bazaar, the fashion name-dropping could get a little tiresome, but for anyone at all connected with that world, it's great fun.

I waited about a year and a half to read it, felt like something like and comic, and picked this up. I was pleasantly surprised. I expected another novel riding on the coattails of Bridget Jones, but this book quickly establishes itself on separate ground. Jane is a great character. There are fabulous comic lines that will make you laugh out loud (even if you read it around midnight, like I did), and there are obscure literary and historical references that elevate the level of the book a little. Yes, some of the situations, names, and events are unbelievable, but I think that this is a FUN novel that the author had FUN writing. It spoofs current events, pop culture, media, and society, and has FUN doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"Contrived, trite, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" wannabe.

The results still sound like crap: recording my wife's choir from about 15 feet away, there was lot's of noise and the signal was very weak so you had to turn the volume up to the highest level to hear anything (which makes the noise all the louder). It might be that the line-in on my Archos Jukebox Recorder is bad/noisy, but anyway you're not going to get anything decent with this. In fact, except for the hard-drive noise, the built-in Archos mic sounds much better than this (can even get it to record in Stereo if you use Rockbox).

But there's a problem with the overall album of Raw Like Sushi: all the songs that surround \\"Buffalo Stance\\" don't even come close to matching its catchiness.

You can tell this is an unfished job because it only last 38 minuts, but leave it there. These are 38 minutes of the best they can offer. I hobe they keep on working together because this is music with out labels, the music we the music lovers need. I will not comment about the music itself because thats for you to digest.

Mr. Hughes has a flawless voice, the way he sings is truely incredible, and Tony Iommi is the greatest guitar player of all time, weather its with Sabbath, or solo, he is the true guitar god.

Well, I was pretty disappointed, I can tell ya. I was expecting the melodic, lush keyboard filled majesty of Seventh Star, one of my favourite heavy rock albums. This album is nowhere near as strong as that one was- maybe thats' why they initially shelved it. A couple of the songs don't even have any real melody- 'Time is the Healer' is a completely tuneless sludgefest. Also, Glenn Hughes wasn't singing like such a maniac on Seventh Star as he is here- he was more restrained back then, not overdoing it all the time like he tends to do these days. Don't get me wrong, I love these guys- they have made some brilliant music over the years. But theres' a bunch of overhyped, misleading reviews on here that lead a prospective buyer to think this album is some sort of rock Holy Grail, and it ain't- its' pretty ordinary.

The instructor is monotone and has a flat affect, as well as the music is NOT enticing.

So many unrealistic situations, it makes your head hurt. It even gets preachy about drugs. We get that Elizabeth is a goody-two-shoes, but really, two paragraphs directly out of a health textbook about why drugs are harmful? That's overdoing it. Everything is neatly tied up as usual (no continuity) the end.I don't hate the series.

There were a lot of bugs in this game and now my computer is fool of patches that I loaded from Herinteractive. There were so many bugs, that I could hardly play the game.

I kept thinking the game was going to \\"open up\\" to more detail and more places, but while I was waiting for this to happen I followed what I thought was a simple clue and suddenly found I had solved the whole thing.

The game has a map interface that takes Nancy directly to her destination, which means no more wandering around for Nancy. Also, there is not nearly as many \\"things\\" to look at; instead many clues are \\"given\\" to Nancy by contacts on her cell phone. There was no \\"night time\\" alarm clock which takes away Nancy's opportunity to explore when people are not around; it also takes away much of the thrill and fear of \\"being caught.\\" There wasn't much suspense in this game either and the mystery was very easy to solve. I gave the game two stars because my game was not buggy, things worked like they were supposed to and the villian was difficult to guess.

The game was way easy and lacked many of the hallmarks of ND games. For example, Nancy no longer has an alarm clock to go from day to night. Therefore, the gamer is forced to \\"sneak around\\" while people are still their offices. The amusement park has a map and you just click where you want to go. No more fun wandering around... There's loads of people to you need to call to give you answers you need instead of doing the research yourself. And the topper: there are very few \\"hot\\" items to pick up.

Having purchased and played all preceeding Nancy Drew games with my children (where we were very satisfied and impressed with the quality) the Haunted Carousel was a noticeable letdown. Each game claims a minimum of 20 hours playing time and we have found this to be true with the exception of Carousel, which we finished in under 6 hours, at the highest difficulty level. The game contains far fewer problem solving opportunities and too much \\"help\\". You can't even wander through the park.

Three hours of game time, and I was done. I had solved the case, but not in the 25+ game time garunteed. I would have given it five stars, but it being so short I took off one star. I thought the characters were fun and some parts were really challenging such as using the lathe. My favorite characters were Joy and Miles, the riddles were great. I didn't really like how the cell phone would ring and naturally pop up, because sometimes it was in the middle of when I was planning to do something important. Overall though, it was a very fun game!!! I cannot wait until Danger on Deception Island. It sounds great and is coming as soon as October of this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solved in 4 hours","review":"Okay...so maybe I didn't quite solve it in just 4 hours.

Finally I turned it over to a 12 year old who beat the mini game in 2 minutes allowing me to go on with life. Other then that, I would have solved it in 4 hours. It's not a long game. The sets are pretty but the puzzles are easy. You do get food (always a favorite in my book) but the only ride you will ride is the carousel. You do get to play the midway games as much as your like. You also get to learn shorthand and the history of carousels (fun little trivia to carry in the back of your mind).

It seems to be a very revealing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Editing for the Kindle","review":"I was extremely disappointed to have spent so much money on a Kindle book only to receive a book with the worst editing job I have ever seen. As one reviewer mentioned, whole sentence groups are repeated in different parts of the text.

It uses a lot of anecdotal material found in letters and diaries, but, quite frankly fails to give us a convincing picture. Also, one gets the feeling as one reads this book that the author has very little sympathy for early American history. Perhaps Ms. Bryan has lived a little too long in Britain, but for this American her touchiness on social issues of the 18th century seem totally removed from the events of that period. There is a sort of creeping left wing bigotry and latent feminism that keeps percolating up from the bowels of this book, rendering any scholarly point of view totally impotent. I wonder if any of the men and women of the present day would come off any better if they were subjected to this kind of scholarly Stalinism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This thing reads like a college dissertation.

The book is structured into five sections: Structuring Space, Orienting on the Page, Text Systems, Ordering Information, and Pictoral Considerations.

So I needed a reliable drive, which the reviews indicated this one was. It worked fairly well for a few months, but then the transfer speeds began slowing down more and more, and the amount of failed transfers began to increase. In the end, after less than one year of use, it stopped working all together. It would begin transferring files, but then fail at about 15-20 percent...every time. There were many times where it indicated that transfer was successful only to fail when I went to read the files on a different PC.It's also worth mentioning that even when this drive worked, it never achieved the advertised transfer speeds (all PCs used ran Windows 7). The best write speed I ever got was about 10-12 MB/sec, which is pathetic. And reads weren't much better.I do not recommend this product, especially if your data is critical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corsair 64 GB Flash Drive","review":"I had to return the product as it would not format. When communicating with the seller, I was advised that once received, they would replace the product and reimburse me for the return postage. Instead of doing that, they issued a full refund for the original purchase price and shipping charges but not the $4.95 I paid to return it. When I questioned them on this, they advised that I could pay them $80 through PayPal and they would ship me another flash drive. I have difficulty in doing business with people that do not honor their commitments even though I was reimbursed minus the additional charges I had to pay. That seems to be unprofessional and quite frankly, I do not trust them to follow through since their word is obviously not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Word of caution","review":"I gave one star mainly because the USB drive failed to function in less than a year after purchase.

It simply didn't work. I brought me to data retrieval center; they couldn't retrieve data. Some company offered me about $1000 quote saying that there are too many bad sectors.

Since then I have never relied on it at all, and well for it. I have a 1GB SanDisk Cruzer from 100 years ago that has been accidentally washed twice and still works; my (3rd) Flash Voyager has been treated with extreme care and just suddenly stops working. For the price it's fine for what it does, just always remember DO NOT rely upon it to keep anything at all--not even for a few minutes. There's no telling when it will just fail.

I never liked the design of this thing but because of storage capacity I had to carry it with me.With all my files and pictures on it and on Aug 19, it died completely. I could not make it to work and have tried so many computers at work and at home. I even tried it on WXP, VISTA, MAC OSX, W2K3, and data switches (Routers)... I couldn't access the files.I can see it as a drive but when I click on it, it says insert drive!!! and on the drive properties, it shows zero bytes. I took it to a data recovery shop and he tried but couldn't make it to work.

However, I bought this drive hoping to have an adequate keyring hook so it could be strung on my keyring as other memory sticks I have either don't have a hook or they break. The picture of the Corsair Voyager is deceiving and rather than a rock hard plastic or rubber exterior it is infact soft rubber and I don't feel confident that it will last too long on my keyring. Also the soft rubber exterior picks up fluff and dust very easily. The device might look good with your mountain bike but it doesn't seem as though the keyring hook at least might be as durable as it claims by just being in your pocket. Corsair do another memory stick with an aluminium casing and what looks like a sturdy keyring hook. I've placed an order for it but it has yet to arrive. We shall see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer speed SUCKS!!","review":"This is my 4th Corsair product and I don't know WHY I keep buying them. My first was an 8GB which just died one day. Fortunately I also had a 16GB and started using it immediately, ordering a 64GB to take its place. I've now gone through my 2nd 64GB stick and will not come back. The transfer speeds are HORRIBLE. Attempting to transfer a mere 6GB takes over 40-minutes. The 16GB screams! I even tried breaking the 64GB into two 32GB partitions... no difference. Now I'm told one of the partitions has an 'unrepairable error' and can be mounted ONLY to back the files up. I can tell you that once the files ARE backed up, this thing is toast.DO NOT waste the money on the 64GB. If you need more storage space, get more of the smaller ones. You'll be MUCH happier.... and ALWAYS back these things up. They're more apt to die than ANY hard-drive I've ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Flash Drive","review":"I read a lot of reviews before I bought this flash drive.

My only complaint is that I didn't realize how long it took to encrypt and tranfer files to the drive. It took over 4 hours to encrypt the whole flash drive and transfer 8GB of files over. It would take about 8 hours to transfer 16GB of files over to the drive. Not a big deal because I need to have good encryption...but it slows down you computer quite a bit while it's doing that. It wouldn't have been a deal breaker for me, but probably something you should know about before you buy.

I have many portable apps installed on this, and I still have a lot of storage left over.The rubber exterior makes the drive a bit more durable then other drives with a hard exterior. Because of the exterior, fitting other USB devices into the USB ports above for below this drive is a very tight squeeze.

True plug and play - it was recognized immediately and assigned a drive letter automatically by XP SP2 pc's both at work and at home. Fast read and writes makes it easy to transport large files and presentations. The entire case is construced of rubber so I would not handle it roughly but under normal use it should be fine. I gave it four stars instead of five because I think it should have a little more of a solid feel for the price.

I would have given it five stars, and that seems to be why everyone does give it five stars or close to that. But today the drive crashed, and I lost completely a document on which I had been working all week. Who cares about how much data it can store and how quickly it loads? Who cares about the rugged rubber case or the lanyard? It lost my data in one split second, wiped out all my hard work, and that makes this less than useless. I would have been better off writing with a pencil on a pad of paper. So, if you want to play russian roulette with your data and end up losing it, by all means go ahead and pay ninety bucks for the privilege. Me? I'm going back to backing up data on DVDs.

If rooms are arranged where the supplementary cube doesn't have a clear view of the first cube this doesn't work. However, if the cubes beam off one another this will produce the desired results and two rooms will be cleaned.Where this comes in handy for me is my L shaped great room which combines a really large family room with dinng area and a good sized open kitchen. This accomplishes the job of floor cleaning in quick order. To simplify the process and guarantee that there is no need to change out pads, I vacuum the contiguous floor surface before starting the Mint.My advice is buy the extra cube if you need to clean a large area efficiently and position the cubes in a manner that both cubes communicate the room parameters to the Mint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"I thought this extra cube would allow me to send my dearly beloved Mint into two separate rooms.

McDonald attempts to connect phenomena (games, economics, business, & war) to concepts in which he feels cross between disciplines. However, the writing style of his book swtiches back and forth between making assertions and stating examples that are so broad that at some point becomes unrelated to the whole point of the book. One example even tries to describe the chemistry of ideal gases and how it's related to pure competition! I was expecting that the book would dive into deeper aspects of how poker was related to investing as he described in the article but mainly talks about concepts already written in standard college textbooks. I suspect that McDonald tried to rush his writing of the book and grabbed straws to fill out the pages. My recommendation is to read the article and not the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jolly Good Seires!","review":"Set in the rural English countryside, this very-English comedy series pokes fun at both English life and the aristocracy. The self-made businessman (and imigrant) Richard Devere and the recently widowed Audrey fforbes-Hamiliton are at odds after she is forced to sell, and he in-turn buys her ancestral home. Moving to a nearby (and much smaller home), Audrey keeps an eye on her beloved estate all the while scheming to get it back someday. Throughout the series Audrey and DeVere clash and occasionally get along, engaging in one-upsmanship, and all the while begin to develop an admiration for each other, leading to a surprise conclusion to the series.The series was very well done and will leave you laughing for weeks, especially if you enjoy British humor. My family and I enjoyed the series so much we made a special side trip while in England to see the estate used in the filming of the series.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with Yes Prime Minister!","review":"I was looking for another intelligent Britcom and decided to give this a try. What a pleasant surprise! I have to admit not being a fan of \\"Good Neighbors\\" nor did I care much for the character Penelope Keith played in that earlier series. But she is PERFECT as Mrs. fforbes-Hamilton. In fact this is about as well-cast a series as I've ever seen. I've let several friends borrow my tapes and they've all enjoyed them.To answer a question others seem to be asking, this gift set contains the entire set of 20 episodes - including the rare 1979 Christmas special. I sure wish they'd release this (and Yes Prime Minister) on DVD. Until then, we have this great gift set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to Cape Breton music","review":"Cape Breton must be in the lead for the \\"musical talent per capita\\" award, as this album amply illustrates. It's a good introduction to the wide range of styles found under the general heading of Cape Breton traditional music, from the traditional stylings of Buddy MacMaster to the contemporary energy of Slainte Mhaith. In between are the amazingly versatile Barra MacNeils (this album features an instrumental, but they are equally strong on vocals), the incredibly talented J.P. Cormier (equally virtuostic on fiddle, guitar, banjo, mandolin, piano, and bass and a great singer and songwriter to boot), and the unique piano stylings of Tracy Dares. As with all samplers, not every cut is equally strong - Stephanie Wills' intonation is painfully bad and Graham and MacDonald's isn't much better. You'll want to buy a number of the albums sampled here, but will be frustrated by their unavailability (unless you're lucky enough to be Canadian)."},{"rating":"2","title":"my husband played football at the university of florida so it was fun reading aout him and his friends in the fifties! i","review":"any football fan of ga or fl would love this! i remembered the games and events written about...as i was a gator \\"girl friend\\"...lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner","review":"Contains a lot of pictures and text about Chet.

I purchased this book mainly for the arrangement of Vincent (Starry, Starry Night). I've listened to Chet's performance of this great song and watched him play it numerous times on video.

I thought it would be a great toy to shoot my suitemates with. I was really excited until I tested it out. First the gun is EXTREMELY LOUD. You have to pump the lever several times in order to launch the balls. This makes sneak attacks impossible. Also, the plastic gear comes into direct contact with the balls, so they will wear out. I would not recommend this for kids. It requires a lot of strength to pump the gun and it's REALLY LOUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"I just bought this toy. I have 6 yr old and 8 yr old boys. This toy is loud, but not as loud as some of the reviews would leave you to believe. Still, better as an outside toy. The toy fires by putting (no more than) three balls in the chute and cranking up the drive wheel. When you get the wheel up to a decent RPM you can pull the trigger and the ball shoots out (in a semi-automatic way you can rapid fire up all three balls). The problem is that the wheel looses RPM very quickly and by the time you get to the second (and third) ball it barely goes 10 feet. If the RPM drops too low the ball will become jammed in the barrel, causing a problem that only an adult will be able to fix with the help of something long enough to poke down the barrel to pop the ball out.Overall \\"fun value\\" is low due to the noise and the quick loss of RPM. My boys got bored with it quickly. Regular neff dart guns are much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"Gave different versions of Nerf guns to the \\"boys\\" in my family for Christmas.They all worked well and it sure livened things up.This one was a little hard for the youngest (4) to use because you had to get it going before you could shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design leads to less fun!","review":"The gun can only hold 3 nerf balls at once which leaves you on the loosing side of combat when you're having to reload all the time.It does hold up to it's name.

They soon discover (some later than others)that this new-found paradise may be darker than it looks, and they are not as safe as they think they are.This book was my least-favorite in the Trilogy, not through any fault of its own, but because I love the other two more.

You have to apply the stuff twice a day for the rest of your life, or at least as long as you want to try to thicken your hair. Although it's not the worst discipline, I grew weary of having to do it. Too much trouble, I found.2. It's expensive.3.

One song that doesn't fit on here is the novelty, \\"Don't Monkey With My Widder\\", but most of all it's that unique voice of Wynn Stewart that rolls up and down smoothly and precisely note for note, and like Paycheck with the right management and direction Wynn Stewart could have stood above the rest. This Audium cd is of good quality and sounds excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you might think...","review":"Because I purchased this CD based on the two previous reviews, I feel compelled to write my own.AFTER THE STORM is not a bad reissue, but nearly lifeless. Recorded in Nashville with second-string session musicians, this appears to be a sincere attempt at reviving Wynn's career. However, the tepid arrangements and unispired playing mimic the MOR sound popular in Music City in the mid-seventies.I highly recommend THE VERY BEST OF WYNN STEWART 1958-1962 to anyone interested in some rightous California honky-tonk. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven, but still worth hearing","review":"This was the last Camper Van Beethoven album before leader David Lowery split with the band and went on to form the more conventional band Cracker. \\"Key Lime Pie\\" is musically quite ambitious and makes good use of a full time violinist, particularly on the ace cover song \\"Pictures of Matchstick Men.\\" Other CVB classics that inhabit this album include the brilliant Ronald Reagan satire \\"Sweethearts,\\" the wistful \\"When I Win the Lottery\\" and the brilliantly corny \\"All Her Favorite Fruit.\\" Not everything works, however, and overall the album is of uneven quality.

It is not a perfect record, but it is very unique and creative. Key Lime Pie is slower than the albums before this one. Dave Lowery writes witty and ironic lyrics which can make you think, laugh, or actually picture the scene for yourself. The violin is absolutely soothing, even on the raunchy The Humid Press of Days. Borderline and I was born in a Laundromat are two best cuts. When I win the Lottery is down right hilarious. This album will take time, so don't make your conclusion after the first or second listen. Let Key Lime Pie seep into your bloodstream and enjoy. Dave Lowery and CVB are genius! I will have the pleasure of purchasing New Roman Times when I get the chance. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's darkest before the dawn","review":"The first time I heard this album I was drinking too much (was I the only one who thought 1989 and 1990 were painful years). It was my favorite CD. Years later I am gratefully spared the misery of that kind of so called soul searching. And I still listen to this CD (and I still love it). I don't claim to be a music critic but I can say this: the music moves my emotions every time. Jack Ruby makes me angry. Pictures of Matchstick Men makes me happy. Other songs make me sad. Shouldn't good music move our emotions? Do more than just entertain? This one does just that and it stands the test of time. Over a decade later, it's still sounds fresh. How many other CDs from 1989 can we say that about? If you haven't added this yet to your collection, do it now. A rock classic that helps us realize life is worth living."},{"rating":"2","title":"just give me some tension release","review":"It's very easy to call this album \\"boring\\" in comparison to the rest of the band's catalog, but it's not to be written off. Gone is the experimental stuff, and for the most part so is the goofy sense of humor and eclecticism, but what's left is some well-written clever pop. Imagine a Cracker album but with some mideastern violins once in a while, and you've got the picture. It's a bit heavy on the slow songs, so when there's the rare one that's a little less than excellent things can start to drag, but most of them are beautiful, and songs like \\"I Was Born In A Laundromat\\" and their cover of Status Quo's \\"Pictures Of Matchstick Men\\" manage to punch things up at just the right places.

Probably give the edge to Key Lime Pie since I bought it first. David Lowery is simply a genius. 'All Her Favorite Fruit' is one of the all-time greatest songs in my opinion ... perfectly describing how most all of us go through our relationships not really knowing what the other truly wants and feels. The orchestration with Morgan Fichter's violin at the bridge should send chills up your spine.I listen to this frequently mainly because there's not a bad song on here ... Jack Ruby, I Was Born (in a Laundromat), When I Win the Lottery, that Status Quo cover, Flowers, Humid Press of Days ... all great tunes. Makes me wonder why Intelligent bands like Camper are dismissed from the mainstream, while pure drivel like Celine Dion, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Ricky Martin are treated like gods.

At first I thought I had a defective disc, but after I tried it in a MAC DVD drive, the entire disc came up without a problem! I suspect it has something to do with the dual layering and PC drives not being able to read one of the layers. It seems they didn't do a very good job at product testing to make the DVD able to be read by different kinds of DVD drives.

Immediately, the crossbars popped out! The problem is that they are not attached to the telescoping arms, they are just held in place by pressure (the bars ends fit into receiver sockets in the arms.)Carefully checking, I discovered that, indeed, I had mounted the brackets about 1/16 inch farther apart than intended, so I blamed myself and put four more holes in my wall, a bit closer together this time.Installed the brackets and mounted the rack. Felt pretty good about it. Then I pulled the arms out to the full telescoping length and the darn crossbars fell out again! The problem is that the arms, when fully telescoped, are fairly flexible, so just a little bit of pressure in the wrong direction can move them apart - and it takes less than 1/4 inch of movement to cause the bars to release.In short, even properly installed, this device is too poorly designed to actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart immediately","review":"This rack is very flimsy.

If you loved Okemah or Stone, Steel and Bright Lights, than by all means, buy this albumn. It's good. There's nothing wrong with it. It's simply not classic Son Volt, and people should know this before buying it. Many of the reviews that I read made it sound like this was returning to the purity of the older sound, and I don't see that at all.

While lyrically challenged at certain points, the overall strength of the songwriting and their delivery overcome. Even with its overt references to Christ and His salvation (I Build This Garden, Rosemary, Empty Hands), which I believe to be an asset, Lenny has lots of fun, and so will anyone who listens to this great album.Kravitz draws deeply from a number of artists and influences, ranging from Hendrix to Sly And the Family Stone. These distinctive, mostly retro flavors will, like a good Beatles record, anchor memories to these tunes, rendering it perfect for anything from a road trip to a first date.Not to mention, you will look so hip breaking out Kravitz from 1989, it will probably help get you that second date.Let Love Rule [Explicit]"},{"rating":"2","title":"must have, his best album","review":"Now I don't have any of Lenny's album's past '5', and I have all of them up to that point, except Circus. But, based on that I'd have to say this is my favorite album by him. I got this like 9 years ago and the CD is still in 50 -disk CD changer. Other ones come and go but this one always stay. I'm reviewing it right now because it actually just came around on my stereo again. This CD doesn't have fancy funky bass or good electronica like the newer Lenny. It has raw Lenny with feeling. The tracks just never get old. The lyrics to all the songs have a very hippy progressive fight the power feel to them and when Lenny sings them, he puts just the right emotion into them.

Killing Joke is truly the HARDEST band on earth. With relvant political-social commentary, rallying cries against corporate greed, and to the defense of the helpless, Killing Joke is the tonic we always need. They simply could kick the teeth in of all those so-called ThunderRock bands , that have come and gone, ie. Limp Bizkit or just fill-in-the-blank.

Two totally different products!! If you actually like to hear good quality music without skipping (i'm a recording industry major) go ahead and spend a few extra dollars for these headphones. I saw them at the Sony store for over $200... I've had zero problems with these. I can even leave my phone in the kitchen while i take the dog for a walk in the back yard with NO interuption. And i live in a city with lots of interruptions, or so the salesman that i returned the S9's to said. I read some of the other reveiws of other products and no matter what they say; these really do have long range, long battery life, both ear phone setting, and the other caller can hear clearly.

Tried reboot the phone, reset the headset,...etc.The iMac show it pairs with the headset, but will not connect.So I wasted my precious birthday trying to get it to work.

Won't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine, when they work","review":"I received these as a gift as use them with a mac, pc, and ipod. Moving them between all three has been a surprising pain. The headphones often cannot sync with each device and I have to re-pair them. It takes a few seconds to pair and the time adds up. The headphones also only communicate problems back to the use through a beeping light. It comes across as very primitive and it often difficult to diagnose errors. I also really wish these headphone could connect via a wire if you wanted them too.Overall these are good headphones, a little snug on the head, but the they are tied to a terrible wireless standard (bluetooth) and are not at all easy to use compared to wired headphones. Given their expense, I would definitely recommend getting a different product and would highly recommend against getting anything Bluetooth - it just doesn't work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, lousy sound","review":"I really wanted to like these but ended up returning them. First, they cauliflowered my ears....ouch!! But the real deal killer was the sound...normally I would say, \\"Hey, not bad\\". But I also have a pair of Plantronics 590Es that I bought 2 years ago. Yikes!! The Plantronics utterly destroy these Sonys...the Sony equalization is a disaster that ruins your music...I think they are doing high frequency filtering like Dolby B noise reduction. Nevermind that the Plantronics are also almost 1/3 the cost. So I ended up ordering another pair of Plantronics. Funny, I have had bad luck with Sony headphones over the years....they want too much for this kind of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I bought it to use with my iMac Intel, but found OS X 10.4 does not support A2DP.

I bought this pair along with a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headset. The Sennheiser did not cause me any discomfort.

The sound is flat and lifeless and the volume controls do nothing. I bought these to use with my Palm Pre. I don't know if the problem is Pre related, the Pre's bluetooth stack has a lot of deficiencies, or if these are just lousy headphones.

Quality of the sound over skype is bad. Many sound interruptions due to the set(not the Skype). It almost unusable for Skype.3.

The sound quality is not quite as good as my aging Sennheiser HD-530-II wired phones, but the best currently available in bluetooth headphones.I love the freedom!However, this morning I broke them. They were in my backpack and as I leaned back I heard a small crack noise. Later when I took them out I discovered that the one side of one of the yokes that hold the cans had broken. They still function and I can wear them, but I am bummed. Cheap plastic!Worse, you cannot easily contact Sony repair. You can call them if you are available for a phone call during working hours. Otherwise you have to e-mail them and they say to expect three days for a reply.I love these headphones for the freedom and high quality sound. But if you buy them get yourself a sturdy plastic box to carry them in lest you break them like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"These headphones are great.

People talking and the train noises are much louder with them on than with them off. I find this true anywhere that there's high frequency noise: malls, buses, crowded sidewalks...pretty much only good at work and at home, not what I needed.

WHAT? it's called A2DP. that's what gives you the 2-channel stereo sound. so to get these to sound right on a mac, you gotta download third-party software.i'm not going to suggest any certain supplier on this forum, but a simple web search will find what you are looking for. my software only cost $20. but figure that into the cost when buying for mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phones are OK, mic is horrible","review":"Bottom Line:Phones are OK (not great, but OK)Mic is horrible (people constantly telling me they can't understand me)***I got this for the long phone calls on cell phone with my girlfriend. I hate the numb ear you get when talking on the phone a long time, and standard one ear bluetooth pieces just hurt my ears.I shelled out good money (these are one of most expensive headsets out there) for quality. I thought it would be nice to listen to music on computer while roaming around house either.When on phone with girlfriend for long periods, I am constantly hearing her ask me to repeat myself. I've only been using them 3 days, and within those 3 long phone calls each time she was constantly saying she either couldn't hear me or couldn't understand me.My quality (the sound from headphones) is OK.

I am a farmer and wear headphones to listen to audio books while on tractor or combine. Old set of noise cancelling wired headphones allowed me to hear combine buzzer alerts as I was listening, but once you've had wireless, you can't go back. These work very well at noise cancelling cause they fit comfortably over the whole ear. Ear warmth is a problem, but you get used to it. Pairing was easy and they connect effortlessly to my droid phone. Only complaint is the small buttons and wife can't hear me very well in combine which is a noisy environment. All in all well made and sound very good. This is my 2'nd pair of bt and they are much better than the motorola s805."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a great product!","review":"I bought this headset because of my tax return honestly, wanted to wire free myself. This headset arrived in two days, and synced in about a minute.It is very comfortable and has a pretty good bass output. My only complaints would be, on Mac it created two sync accounts for the sound, only one actually works, the other produces a clicking noise. That is the settings, not the headset itself.Secondary complaint is it makes all audio slightly low.Third and final complaint would be that it doesn't reach much more than 15 feet away, granted that is plenty of space, but sometimes it would be nice to get some distance.Other than that this headset works perfectly! What amazes me is it is in no way bulky and very compact for storage, even includes a small pouch that it fits neatly into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wireless","review":"They are big but they work very well.

I wanted one where the battery could be replaced, and another reviewer described that process. It's not as straightforward as I'd like, but it's an option.These headphones don't slide off my head like the DRBT101/BLK, which were always sliding and falling off. I think these would stay on a runner's head without any problem, but because of the ear cuff, they may get hot. With normal use (1 - 2 hours, watching a movie) I did not have a problem with them getting hot.I have paired these without problem with an iPod Touch, an iPhone, and the Sony Bluetooth Receiver for iPod. All work perfectly. I believe this unit pairs with 8 or 9 units, and it has done that well.All in all, I am very satisfied with these and wish I had bought these instead of my second set of the BT101 headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headset","review":"Sony does it again.

(I'm running Snow Leopard on a MacBook Air, for the record. I suppose they might couple better with other setups.)After much wrangling I've learned how to get them to couple with my computer, but it takes at least a minute or two of fiddling each time.Platform issues aside, they are only so-so headphones.

I would not recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major problems pairing with my Mac","review":"Its sound is about as good as you're going to get via Bluetooth. Comfort, construction, battery,... all pretty good, and life would be great IF ONLY I didn't have to go to the Sound Preference Pane to manually switch the Output to DR-BT50 EVERY TIME I try to use it; IF ONLY it could keep its connection active for more than an hour, not requiring me to turn it on and off again, which takes half a minute, as you have to hold the button for ~7 secs each time (why?!)! Sony, don't say Mac compatible unless you really test it on a Mac! Yes, I've tried pairing it more than once to try to fix this, but problems still arise and I'm a Mac expert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for iPhone","review":"The sound quality is good WHEN it works. Although easy to pair with Blue Tooth to the iPhone once I did it and tried it again at the gym I can't get the music to play and of course you probably already know the controls on the Sony Headset don't control the iPod/iphone? I thought it was really cool at first but after trying to get it to work at the gym for three days running it goes back. It is also worth mentioning that you can't use regular rechargeable batteries. It has a built in Sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for. Oh goodie, something else to recharge and keep up with. Not worth the headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay. Wouldn't buy again, though","review":"I've had these for several months, now. The sound quality is actually very nice. Comfort is low. Your ears will be in pain after 15 to 20 minutes of use.

They fold up enough to place them in the included carrying case.The button controls on the headphones come in handy! You can change the songs and control the volume with ease without even having to touch your device!The headphones are comfortable and made of durable material.

He's happy with the sound quality when he listens to his music (iPhone in pocket, headphones on ears, hands free to cook and not get caught on a cord/wire). He can go on walks with the dog and not have to worry about a transmitter or going out of range because it is just bluetooth and so long as his music devise is on him, he's golden.

There is a loud \\"thump\\" each time audio comes in after a few moments of silence. When using the headphones as a bluetooth headset for phone calls, people on the other end can't hear you and complain the sound quality is distant and tinny. If you just use them to listen to your music and don't ask any more of the DRBT50, you'll be happy enough, but I wanted and expected so much more.

However, when it does work, the sound is impressive.The microphone is a complete joke. The sound comes through extremely garbled and while it seems to have a hard time picking up my voice while I am wearing them, it detects and amplifies the shrieks of my children on the other side of the house.

Utterly unacceptable for the conversations in a noisy or windy environment.(2) It's unusable in the proximity of my Panasonic microwave, though not at work near my GE microwave(3) There are occasional quirks when the connection momentarily is lost, for no apparent reason(4) While it's battery life is good, you can't swap another battery into it, neither you can use its charger in Europe, since it's 110 Volts only (While vast majority of electronics can automatically switch between 110 and 220 volts !)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad mic","review":"Overall it is great. It is very comfortable to wear, it has good speakers, it is easy to use, and what else can i say it is bluetooth. The one downside is the mic, evertime i call someone they can hardly understand what i am saying. They tell me it sounds muffled. I tried it on three different phones to multiple different people. But as I said before overall it is great(for listening to music)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"It synced and played music perfectly, but phone reception was terrible. The other people could hear me fine, but the sound i received was intermittent, distorted, and had a brrrrrrr ringing echo to every sound, even the ringing when i made a call.I could not make out what the other people were saying at all.I looked in trouble shooting, and it says the unit can get \\"interference from a wireless LAN, other 2.4 GHz wireless device, or microwave oven.\\" Shocking! Where someone can go these days where none of these other devices are operating? i went 30 feet outside my house and it was just as bad.Or maybe the one i got is just a lemon. I don't know.I called SONY and they said to try the reset, but i'd already done that, so they offered to let me send it to them so a techie could look at it. I'm returning it in stead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for talking","review":"The microphone on the headset is overly sensitive. So sensitive, that my peer can not hear me while I walk from a relatively quiet street - background noises cover my speech, making the headset useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound,comfortable headphones, difficult controls","review":"I found these headphones to be very comfortable on the ears. They are well padded, and I could wear them for two hours before any discomfort set it. The sound is good, but not great. Highs are a bit muted, and bass is good but not great. Still, compared to the typical earbuds found in an ipod or other $30.00 phones, they are wonderful. The bluetooth feature works well for me, with no static, and it easily handles phone calls as well as music. I could hear the caller well, and they could hear me.The only real difficulty was with the controls. With the phones on my head, it is difficult to locate the volume up and down buttons. They are recessed, and hard to press. It is easy to accidentally hit the next track and previous track by mistake. After using them often enough, you can finally get comfortable with the location of the controls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I was skeptical when I bought this book but wanted to give it a try. I am now a believer!! I don't know whether it was the book, or if my 34 month old daughter was just ready, but I trained her over a 2-day weekend. I used this book in conjunction with a potty watch that goes off every hour, and after a couple of accidents within the first 2 hours of training, we had it down pat. I will still need to monitor my daughter and remind her to go to the bathroom, but the basic concept has been established. I just wish the book gave more information on how to handle outings within the first few weeks of training."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Successful Times!","review":"I bought this for my first child and used it again for my second. Along with the book, we added an extra incentive. My first was a huge Dora fan.. and Dora had a show coming to our area. Well, you know, Dora won't let little girls come to the show unless they're wearing their Dora underwear :) For my second, we're going to My Little Pony... of course, wearing our pony panties! Since I had experience, the second one went much better than the first.. but I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the author!","review":"Some parts are helpful. Or the most part I do not agree with the authors tone and attitude towards the child. My daughter is doing great with traing, but she is extremely stubborn. If I push her too much, as suggested in this book, it would backfire. Not to mention the author is ridiculous stating if your child doesn't get it they have a learning disorder. What a bunch of b.s. maybe they are just not developmentally ready. Don't waist your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Might Take longer","review":"the theory makes sense an very simple to follow. just don't expect miracles! with our daughter it took 4 days for her to catch on. I do think this method was the best one I found though. I have no regrets, just recommend that you plan ahead for the possibility of it taking a couple more days for them to catch on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not purchase again","review":"This book is really a pamphlet, only a few pages with huge words on each page to make it look like a book. There is nothing new, nothing creative, nothing helpful in this book. Basically tells you the same thing you can get for free out of any book or website on potty training. Throw away the diapers, spend 3 days with the same caregiver, take them to the restroom every hour. An absolute waste of money, I am disappointed Amazon would even sell this \\"book.\\" Not helpful. And no, my child is still not potty trained."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not good!!!","review":"If an item looks to good to be true then it must be. Im on day number 2 and i feel like I'm going insane!! You can set ur child on the potty but can't make them go. And it's not the parents fault all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I was hopeful, but it wasn't enough. Even by following this \\"book\\" to the letter, 2 weeks and still not potty trained. This may work with a select group of children, but not mine. And not any of my friend's children either. This really isn't a book at all....more like a pamphlet. Certainly not worth the price paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"This book simply did not do the trick for my family. The strictly regimented potty training process did nothing but frustrate my daughter and myself. We were so stressed out after the first day that I threw the book out all together. We then began our own style of potty training and my little girl was using the toilet regularly in a matter of days. This book was a waste of $ for me. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"This did not work at all for my 21 month year old daugher. She showed a couple of signs of being ready to potty train, which according to the author was all that was needed but she clearly wasn't ready. The only thing the author says about if it doesn't work is that your child may have a learning disability. That's ridiculous. Following the steps in this book caused my daughter unbelievable stress and anxiety. I stopped after the second day and her not successfully going in the potty even once and being so stressed out she no longer even wanted to take a bath (which she always loved). I recommend not following the advice in this book and really waiting until your child is ready. I plan to wait until she's at least 2 to try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"This book did not work for us at all. I tried very hard to follow all her points/ideas, but ended up deciding our 2 year old was not ready. He kept thinking he'd gone in the potty when he hadn't gone. According to her list of points, he was ready, but it was apparant once we started, he was not. Now he keeps putting his potty in the closet, and telling me \\"No potty\\" so we're taking a break. And when I start again, I will not use this book to help guide me through the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE AND MISLEADING","review":"This method DOES NOT WORK IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!!

Since then we didnt have a single accident. Very happy with the advice and even happier with the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"potty training in 3 days","review":"I found this book helpful. It was a quick read with many helpful tips for potty training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the stress","review":"This book came highly recommended from several people that had used and swore by this method. One would have to have a cold heart and nerves of steel to follow the steps EXACTLY in the book, as is strongly encouraged. If parents out there can teach their kids to use the potty, change their pants and wipe their own bum in three days, then you all deserve a medal. Call me Mommie Dearest, but I could not watch my 2 year old struggle for 20 minutes and cry and beg me for help when he could not pull up his own pants after an \\"accident\\" nor could I sleep on the floor of his bedroom and wake him in the middle of the night to use the potty. I'm sure there are other books out there that provide realistic potty training direction with more compassion and kindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: do not proceed without reading this first","review":"If you were planning on potty training after 2 1/2 this book will make you feel like a monster for waiting. We got suckered doing it even though our instincts were to wait, it ended up being a horrible experience for everyone. The authors rigid perspective does not account for the possibility of anything deviating from her plan, so when it does not go as planned you are on your own. The technique requires you to connected your child's pride to being potty trained, so going back to diapers is not an option unless you are OK with really messing with your kid. It took us 8 horrible days with this method to potty train - not worth it. If the child is actually ready this technique probably would work, but don't be fooled by the authors timeline and checklist for determining your child is ready. The author is not the authority she pretends to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"I have worked with special needs children for more than 10 years. I found it extremely offensive that the author suggests if her methods do not work then there must be a compounding reason. Children all learn differently; one approach may not be the answer for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and misleading","review":"While this book might provide a good platform for beginning potty training, it is incomplete and misleading. It really does not address teaching your child to 'poop' in the potty and that makes the title misleading. It also seems to be predicated on the idea that all children are the same when it comes to this topic. The assumption that all children are ready by the age of two is fundamentally rubbish. Children are different and parents' approach must be tailored to that child's needs. We saw some initial success with the methods outlined in this book, however, nearly a year after beginning, we have a three and half year old son who seems to have 'defied' most of the principals this book laid out. I could not recommend it in good conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!!","review":"I have friends that swear by this book. Bought it a year ago and my son still isn't potty trained. We have tried on 9 different long weekends and even a whole week with grandma to use this approach. Guess what....all we get is a pile of wet and poop underwear to wash. This \\"maybe\\" would work if you did it at the EXACT moment your child was ready to potty train. Good luck finding that moment.PS - I have found copies of the same book on the internet you can download for free. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty Train in Three Days","review":"This book is some sort of mind-control prgram for toddlers. It goes against everything that I as a mother believe in, such as allowing your child to take the lead, treating accidents and bedwetting as an unavoidable part of potty training instead of an opportunity to \\"teach\\" your child to NOT have such accidents, and other sorts of \\"tips\\" that would appear to work better for training a dog than a child. My child is not a \\"trainable\\" dog - he is a small person who deserves my respect and care and compassion. And to be told that a child still in diapers at 3 years of age is a horrible disservice to that child flies in the face of all that is held true in the medical community today. The fact is, very few children are trainable at 18 - 24 months as this woman claims. But she points her finger squarely at parents as irresponsibly keeping their children \\"babies\\" longer than necessary, and longer than what is healthy for the child. An awful, mind-control form of potty training."},{"rating":"1","title":"no such thing as training in 3 days!","review":"I should have been wiser before buying this book, and believing it could work in 3 days.

Wendy's love for, and dedication to Grant is undeniable and can not be disputed for a second. Having worked with children with autism, I can not even begin to fathom the patience and strength of which Wendy and her family are such amazing examples. Wanting the best for Grant, Wendy followed the advice of experts, hoping to provide her child with the quality of life that all parents wish for their children. Gentle Giant is a must read for anybody, regardless of whether or not you have any connection to a person with autism. Above all, it is an inspiring glimpse into the lives of the Robinsons and the incredibly special and irreplacable light that Grant brought to their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cleaning house!","review":"I use these when I clean house - I have one for stuff that belongs in my son's room, 1 for stuff that belongs in my daughter's room, and one for stuff that belongs on the basement.

They journey to school, and accidently get taken to someone else's house! There they meet Princess Mimi (a.k.a Mean Mimi) a doll who is a menace to all dollkind. After thinking that they've defeated her, the two dolls find a way back home, only to dicover that Mimi has come with them! The dolls and their families work together to save dollkind from the meanest doll in the world. I liked the first book more, because the end of this is a little bit sad. I wouldn't read the book to a younger child because of this. All in all, it was pretty good for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evil Doll","review":"If you are a reader that likes an adventure where you'll find someone you wished you never met, you should read this book, because it makes you wonder what's going to happen next.

It has one major flaw, NO MUTE button and no way to program the multi-function button to have that function. Which means if you use this with phones like the VTech DS6321 there is no way to use the headset and mute a call. The mute on the Vtech phone only operates when you are speaker on using the handset, which is also lame.Top that off with the fact that the tiny outward facing microphone picks up EVERYTHING around it. Makes it virtually useless as a phone headset. On any call even in quite environments the called party hears what sounds like a fan nearby!!!Works great as a stereo listening headset..."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb headset at this pricepoint","review":"Just got these to pair with an LG enV and my laptop using a bluetooth USB dongle, and I'm more than happy with the results.Audio is very clear, good bass response, good dynamic range, I'd have to say they're even better than similar over-the-ear wired headphones by Sony I've used in the past.My only complaint is the 'folding' mechanism - they don't fold flat, so they might be likely to break if you stuff them in a full bag. It would've been a better idea to make them adustable instead of folding - they're far too large for my girlfriend's head, though they fit my (rather large) head very well.

It just has a few words on each page, and long spells of just music, I suppose so the child can take in what's going on on the page, which isn't a whole lot.The one good thing about this book was that it was his first read-along and he learned how to turn the pages when signaled, so he knew exactly what to do with his second read-along,Poetry Speaks to Children (Book & CD) (Read & Hear), which he loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheep in a Jeep","review":"Sheep in a Jeep is a fun book using rhythmic wording.

Indeed, some of my daughter's first words were \\"splash\\" and \\"thud\\" as she recited along this favorite story.With every page Shaw's vivid vocabulary comes alive in perfectly-metered rhyme, adeptly complimented by Apple's whimsical illustrations.

Better for an older (2+) child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Shaw Has a Hit","review":"Those crazy adolescent sheep are at it again, and this time they've hotwired a jeep. Okay, let's be honest right from the start and admit that this one is not up to the standards set by \\"Sleep in the Deep,\\" but that comparison doesn't seem to matter much to the legions of parents and kids who love the off-road sheep.The plot is pretty basic. The characterizations are a thin. But every page rhymes, and that's got to count for something, and besides, it's a sit-com with sheep, not Hamlet. Overall, this reviewer gives three thumbs up for Sheep in a Jeep. I didn't give it five stars because my own little girl seems to be ignoring the book so far. Could be the other 500 books in her room are distracting her and she just hasn't noticed this one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short read, but fun","review":"My 2.5 year old daughter loves this book. It's short and makes a goodcompanion book during those \\"two book nights\\". :-)Wonderfully illustrated---lots of little details that make rereadingthis book fun rather than boring.

With this offering, our funny band of sheep take a jeep ride and you can only imagine the results, or better yet, let these two ladies imagine for you. The rhyming text is one that will stick with you and you will find many of the lines going through your head later in the day after a couple of readings with your child. The illustrations are of their usualy high quality and, as always, go perfectly with the text. This is a good one to read to your child one on one or is a great one to read to the entire class. I do home these two keep turning them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely hilarious","review":"This book uses wonderful words and pictures to describe the escapades of 5 hapless sheep. My girls and I think that the sheep are hilarious. I think the rhyme is creative and has an interesting cadence that makes you think about the words. It does not lull you into numbness like Suess. The concepts are also a bit more complex than other early books.

More than acting, beautiful filming and style were required to make a better movie. I kept thinking how the movie could have been improved. But the sheer implausibility of every component of the movie right up to the last scene in which the final murders occured prevent this movie from coming together in a meaningful way.Consequently it is just a stream of events and characters not without interest but ultimately superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting but gore replaces suspense","review":"Of course it's begging for comparison with Strangers on a Train, given that both are based on a Patricia Highsmith novel and both involve a similar \\"bring an innocent man into the realm of the killer\\" scenario. But unlike Strangers, this film doesn't have much suspense. A big scene, in which the \\"innocent\\" man's wife learns more than we want her to know, is passed over way too quickly. This was basically the emotional climax of the film and it just zipped by. Hitchcock would have understood that it, not any shootout, was the film's big moment and would have lingered accordingly. However, Malcovitch and everyone else does a great job and Italy is beautiful. So if you can stand the gore, you may enjoy it as a rental, but it's no must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling, suspenseful movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It reminds me of Hannibal with Anthony Hopkins. John Malkovich perfectly plays Tom Ripley. He is the evil protagonist that you end up rooting for. The intrigue in the movie stems from an innocent Italian husband and father being pulled into the role of assassin as part of a sick game played by Ripley.The movie contrasts the sociopathic Ripley who easily justifies killing with a conscience-stricken picture framer who can't stomach killing others but learns to do it. The movie also shows the consequences of evil actions--that there is no such thing as getting away with it, even for the conscienceless Ripley.The acting is superb and the plot driven at a face pace. The events are realistic and not far-fetched like so many thrillers recently.With a main character like Tom Ripley, no one is safe in the movie. He is cast as very much like Hannibal Lector--the refined psychopath."},{"rating":"2","title":"It draws you in and becomes mesmerizing","review":"What can I say but Malkovich??? A stellar performance by the man with beautiful lighting and direction as well. I, for one, could not stand The Talented Mr. Ripley with Matt Damon but this movie is great!!! Again, maybe it's my love for Malkovich as an actor but this movie is really good. My only wish is that there was a little less time drag between some sequences and instead included a little more storyline background. Otherwise, a fantastic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I missed Matt Damon","review":"After I saw \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", I found and devoured the rest of Patricia Highsmith's stories in the series.This \\"Ripley's Game\\" is quite good and translated to the screen in a faithful manner. The only thing missing is the lush scenery of Italy and Matt Damon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even though I'm his biggest fan...","review":"John Malkovich is creepy enough when he's NOT brutally murdering people. This movie is b-o-r-i-n-g."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!!!","review":"I did not like this movie. I have seen better movies on television. It was senseless and the main actor John Malkovich was terrible. He was a disgusting lover as well.

In that time I have purchased some 15-20 books about Buenos Aires and Argentina, including travel guides, historical accounts, etc. Probably the least valuable is this Berlitz book on Buenos Aires. This book MIGHT be of negligible value if you were spending no more than 24 hours in this fascinating city, but I would recommend many others (especially Time Out Buenos Aires) before this Pocket Guide. This Berlitz quick study doesn't provide nearly the depth one needs to discover the fascinating, rich, tumultuous city that is Buenos Aires. Sorry, Berlitz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Honky Tonic","review":"I had been waiting a long time for someone to issue something, anything by Texas swing/shuffler Charlie Walker. Finally Audium/Koch/Sony put together THE definitive hits collection containing all the essentials such as \\"Pick Me Up On Your Way Down\\" , \\"Who'll Buy The Wine\\", \\"Close All The Honky Tonks\\" , \\"Don't Squeeze My Sharmon\\", \\"San Diego\\", \\"I Wouldn't Take Her To A Dogfight\\", \\"Honky-Tonk Season\\", Honky-Tonk Women\\" and more. Charlie Walker's career as a hitmaker didn't endure primarily because he was a very limited singer having but a very narrow vocal range. There is a Bear Family box set available but that is way too much Charlie Walker This disc is just the right amount. If you liked the early vintage Ray Price, you'll love this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Honky Tonk","review":"Charlie Walker recorded some of the finest honky tonk tracks ever waxed. His sound follows fast on the heels of his friend Ray Price's classic honky tonk sides, and come complete with that wonderful shuffle beat. Every side is beautiful, and Walker runs the gamut from the deeply wounded to the humorous. \\"Who Will Buy the Wine\\" and \\"Pick Me Up on Your Way Down\\" are model honky tonk odes to the hard side of the life and \\"Please Don't Squeeze My Sharmon\\" makes you really wonder what Mr Whipple really meant. Plus the set has Walker's killer reading of the Rolling Stones' \\"Honky Tonk Women.\\" Someone needs to seriously reevaluate the Country roots of the British invasion. A beautiful CD, and a long overdue tribute to a great singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I am a person who is trying to learn how to make a knife. That's a pretty basic starting point. This is a very unprofessional video (poor quality) that shows you about half of what they are describing. The very point of buying the video is to be able to \\"see\\" how to do something. They certainly step through all the phases and throw out a bunch of words that I've never heard so that I know that they know what they are talking about. The problem is that \\"I\\" don't know what they are talking about. They only shoot close-ups about 1/2 the time, and they don't bother explaining some of the more basic concepts. I guess if you already know a decent amount about making knives, then this video might rank a 3, but it's still a poor quality taping. Buy a book - you'll get almost the same experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I recevived this video as a Christmas present. I am a knifemaker, and my sister got it for me, not realizing that this video is dedicated to nothing but stock removal. I thought I might watch it anyways for finish grinding tips. It would be a good video if you have a milling machine, a $1000 2 x 72 grinder setup, and thousands in other sorts of equipment. Not to mention the video is very grainy, and low quality, there are very few good closeups, and the explanations suck. Don't bother wasting your money...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To Life!

But, it probably is in bad need of an update because the book is 4 years old and none of this may still be true. So there's that.I did not like his thoughts on what to say to an agent who fails to get back to you after having your manuscript exclusively. He said to tell them you are moving on to another agent---err, not. He's maybe not looking at it from the writer's side. The LAST thing I want to do as a writer is alienate an agent. I think he should have given an e-mail sample of how he would approach the agent---maybe it would not be as harsh as it sounded.

Relying on Qashani, a classical Ibn Arabi interpretor, to expound IA's otherwise elliptical and obscure theosophy, the author suceeds in simplifying IA's difficult and mind-boggling ontology which has riddled Muslim scholars for centuries.

I can use it either on dry hair or water-spritzed hair. The curls reform and with a bit of a skrunch after applying the gel, the top has a little lift. What I like most, as opposed to other gels I've tried, is that this one leaves your hair feeling soft, silky and natural, but still holds the shape I want.

However, my two-year-old son hates it. The few times we tried it, he either cried or became irritated and wanted to get out of the bath, the exact opposite effect we were looking for. The point is to encourage a child to want to take a bath, right? The smell--a combination of citrus and other ingredients--is also very strong. In fact, I think there is so much citrus (acidity?) that it stinging our son's eyes and maybe even his skin. There are little or no bubbles, which is also no fun. Even we (the parents) think it's too powerful, and we only used one capful (the directions say you can use up to two). If even we wouldn't use it in a bath, that's when I know it's not right.

His characters read like they were lifted from a fourth-grader's cartoon. The dialogue was so hollow and so cliched that it had an incongrously comical effect. I was consistently reminded of the skits on the improv tv show, \\"Who's line is it anyway?\\". The plot was predictable to the point of annoyance. The narrative was pedantic and generally insulting to my intelligence. This is the worst book that I have ever come across in my entire life.

The plot was good - the usual meglomanic trying to take over the world vs. Tweed, Paula, Marler etc... However the full impact was let down in the delivery. Real people don't say \\"pass a message to X, who is in the room next to mine\\" if they are in that room anyway. There were several moments where things happened too easily too - where does Marler buy all those guns in every city in the world?

It takes a LOT for me to go a 3 tiered thumbs down on any sci-fi flick, but this was so bad, that even with only 10 minutes left in the movie I turned it off, put it in the box, and dumped the box in the trash.

Five-star contents.BUT - there were exactly 4 sardines rolling about in a 4.375oz tin, yielding a superpremium price, amounting to $0.50 PER SARDINE. The tin could easily have contained 7 or 8 fish of this size. No argument here, save for having been led to believe that this was at least 4oz of fish (had they been packed traditionally), not 50% oil (as packed in this instance.) Negative 3 star practices. Net 2 stars.There was no claim as to quantity or weight of fish - no false claims in the advertising verbiage. This is simply \\"sharp\\" practice - a \\"gotcha\\", for which the company deserves to lose its patronage.

The oil isn't as strong as some brands, stray bones are rare, and the fillets are fairly consistant in size.

This is a nice, smoky, fishy sardine without being horribly stinky or too salty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"No bones. No skin. Just wonderful sardines. They are the only ones worth buying, but once you buy them I don't think it's possible to go back to the cheaper kind.

McKidd takes us through his character Franks life with zeal rarely seen (sorry Brad Pitt could never touch McKidd). McKidd can be hideously ugly and violent in one scence, stunningly beautiful the next. Throughout the film we are repulsed by Frankie, learn to love him, and (spoiler warning) hope the beating he recieves at the hands of his old \\"friends\\" acts as a final catharsis for his old life (instead of him getting killed). As he was in Bedrooms and Hallways, Rome, Dog Soldiers, and Journeyman, McKidd is infinitely fascinating to watch, and certainly the best actor out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Descent movie, but could be just a little bit more","review":"This is very similar to it's billing. A slight touch of trainspotting with a huge helping of A Clockwork Orange. A group of houligans let by Frankie stir up trouble in a scotish town. This movie focuses on the childhood, and then growth of frankie after \\"16 years of alcohol\\". This movie is told in a round, from end to beginning and back again. Interesting perspective, but not quite as gritty as it could have been. This did not give me the trainspotting tweak, or the bite of the Ultraviolence from a clockwork orange. However, does give you a slight flavor of what an Alcoholic does deal with, and what a troubled childhood brings with it. Worth while to see for fans of independent films, and independent thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I ordered the wrong video on accident but thought \\"oh what the heck, I'll watch it anyway...\\" What a mistake, this is a B movie from England or somewhere.

As a young boy, Brunin withdraws into himself to avoid the pain from his domineering overbearing grandmother, and his father sends him to train as a squire to Joscelin de Dinan. As Brunin blossoms under Joscelin's care, he eventually becomes a strong young man and a knight to be reckoned with, and he learns to deal with the shadows of his youth and banish them forever.Brunin and Joselin's daughter Hawise began as childhood friends growing up together, to becoming man and wife, while trouble and conspiracies threaten their happiness. As always with Chadwick's books, the way she brings the medieval period to life in such a graceful and effortless way, be it the sights, sounds, smells, food, clothes and battles is just awesome. As quoted on some of her book jackets, the next best thing to time travel.

Unfortunately, this is yet another book to add to the recycle pile.It fundamentally fails to grasp any of the points that it attempts to make, and manages to use just about every management cliche ever devised, including some that were even new on me! Personally, I find books such as this similar to the story of the Emperor's New Clothes: It may well be the flavor of the month, but in time, people will see it to be totally transparent.However, if you want to try to master the art of using thousands of words to say nothing, then maybe this book is for you after all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finz is excellent-mostly","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" for a first year law student as a supplement and it is worth every dollar you spend on it, much better than most of the others out there.

I am returning this winter for the first time as a tourist, and purchased Lonely Planet's guide, because they are normally good. Using this guide, I cannot find a single decent place to stay, any good restaurants, and even the activities list is pathetic. I know you're probably thinking that I'm just jaded because I lived there and know the spots, but from a basics perspective, not ONE of the major hotels that I know are good are listed, the three hotels that I did recognize are dumps, and the restuarant selections are crappy tourist dives without any real authenticity.

It wasn't luxurious by any means, but the location was nearly ideal. It was also practical, comfortable, friendly, and cheap.

Silly love song is soooo beautiful....just the memories alone that accompany this album are worth it...it is ashame that Death Row did'nt market her as much as they did snoop & Dr. Dre...but...her 2nd album is nothing compared to this one...I don't think anyone on Death Row knew how to bring any tracks to complement her voice..Dr. Dre was already gone by then...will somebody find MICHEL'LE & sign her ..I know she could outsing all these so called \\"divas\\" of today! SHE IS DEFINATELY 1OO% WOMAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"This album is good all the way through ,based on the time it was released in 1989. The slow songs featured on this album are among my all time favorites, such as \\"If\\" & \\"Silly Love Song\\". The song writing is better than I expected from a Rap record company, and the Piano playing on \\"If\\" is very good. A solid buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Dull Moment","review":"Michel'le was hot back in the day and this CD is very good.

The best track here is \\"No More Lies\\" which hit #1 in early 1990, I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"I was 17 when I purchased this CD. The entire CD is great but \\"Something in My Heart\\" was my theme song that year. I was in love for the first time and the words of the song and Michel'le's beautiful voice made me cry (in a happy way). It was the first song that has ever moved me and everytime I hear the song, it still reminds me of that new love feeling and tears me up. I highly recommend this CD. It IS a shame that Michel'le did not blow-up. Her voice is amazing--- she has that squeaky speaking voice but shocks you with that rich diva singing voice. Where is she now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic Velvet Underground Revisited","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing. I got to see the Warlocks in concert in Austin, Texas when they opened for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. I was blown away by their raw & gritty live performance. The next day I went and bought both of their full length albums including Phoenix. The album opens with \\"Shake the Dope Out\\" a pure rock n' roll materpiece. Next is \\"Hurricane Heart Attack\\", which is yet another hard hitting rock n roll tune. Bobby Hecksher's distorted vocal style completes the bands sound. My favorite song on this album however is \\"Baby Blue\\" The use of the sitar completed the song and took the band to the next level. Imagine early Pink Floyd mixed with The Velvet Underground and you have the Warlocks. Excellent album worthy of much praise. The USA needs more bands like The Warlocks. Long live the 'locks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Psychadelica","review":"This album draws from a number of psychadelic rock influences, but the most pronounced is the Velvet Underground. Taking the original name of the Velvet Underground, the Warlocks pick up where Lou Reed and company left off.The Warlocks have a murky, retro feel - but never comes across stale. Their sound is big and catchy - \\"The Dope is Good\\" is probably my favorite. Catchy guitar hooks fill the album along with some backward masking. All in all a great album that acknowledges what made this genre popular in the first place.Turn off the lights, turn on the lava lamps and drop out to some cool rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile all around great rock album.","review":"This album works its way across a broad spectrum of rock from begging to end.

Any fan of Wolverine knows just how dangerous he actually is. This reads almost like a What if story line: Wolverine gets captured and Brainwashed by the new super villian 'Gorgon'. Wolverine goes bad, all his moral restraints have been switched off. For a guy that cannot read minds, fly, turn invisible etc, he deals a ton of damage and a whole world of pain. Going head to head with SHIELD, the Fantastic Four and the X-men, it takes a combined effort to stand up to him and his elusive 'hit and run' style tactics forged in his black op days. The final question at the end is, can they get him back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action, cool story","review":"If you like Wolverine you'll probably like this trade.

The HAND, ninja organization and HYDRA are up to no good and end up contributing hundreds of cannon fodder for the threshing engine of Logan and his allies. There are some interesting confrontations while Wolverine is under the control of Darkness and it is nice to see his inner dialogue flower beyond the usual \\"I'm the best there is at what I do,\\" cliches. Anyway, it's silly and stupid in all the right ways and thankfully no appearance by Sabretooth so if you like Wolverine in ninja action, you'll have a good time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is a wonderful story line that any fan of Wolverine will want to own.

The Brotherhood, Coyote Crossing and The Return of the Native by Greg Rucka were great stories and really got to the heart of what this character is all about. Then Millar comes along with this story and wrecks that great streak. It does not even really deliver on the promise of Wolverine vs. the Marvel universe. Millar uses all the run of the mill and tired methods of avoiding real confrontation. This was tremendously disappointing after my hopes had been raised so high by previous volumes in this Wolverine run. Enemy of the State delivers nothing new and actually hurts the deveopment of this character. This version of Wolverine is flat and the story is weak and lacks any and all oomph. The art is good, but beyond that it has very little going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISREPRESENTED AS ITS NOT 20-32 ITS 20-25!","review":"I AM UPSET AS THIS WAS LISTED AT A RE-RELEASE IN 08 WITH A COMPILATION OF ISSUES 20-32..THAT IS FALSE IS THE SAME AS THE 06 AND JUST 20-25!!!I COULDVE PAID 1/2 IF AMAZON WAS HONEST"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"I have a sump which is has water all year round.

In its brief 180 pages, an overview of where and when Columbus travelled is well chronicled.There are perhaps too many people who know of Columbus only that \\"in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\\". Yet Columbus did more than just sail. Although he never discovered America and constantly thought he had arrived in Asia, he nonetheless served as the spark to the later journeys that would fully reveal the New World. Unfortunately, both his journeys and those of his followers would do much to injure the indigenous people with the introduction of disease and slavery.If you are searching for a primer on Columbus and the New World, Least Heat-Moon's book serves that purpose well.

He more or less succeeded in the accuracy department, but otherwise this novel is a fairly routine potboiler, with a touch of sex and violence, a wrongly slandered maiden whom only the hero appreciates, an alcoholic mentor who helps the hero behind the scenes, a scrappy secretary who never gets paid on time, etc.Readers looking for a novel about a trial that is both accurate and well written would be better off buying *The Just and the Unjust,* by James Gould Cozzens.

Brinkley intersperses snippets of regional history with reminiscences about the adventures he and his students had while touring through those regions. I bought this book fully expecting to prefer the personal pieces to the history, but found the opposite to be true. Being a Canadian with little more than a very basic level of exposure to U.S. history, I can honestly say I learned a good deal from this book.But in between those chunks of history, one has to bear Brinkley's endless name dropping (he knows Ken Kesey and knew William S.

It is the literary equivilant of name dropping, where the author attempts to shoehorn in the names of as many historic sites, authors and rock stars as possible in between stops for television interviews. In painstaking detail, the author ensures that the reader is constantly aware of the music they play on the bus, and how it is the perfect background for the mood or location. In addition, the reader is \\"treated\\" to a laundry list of attractions the group chooses to bypass. Of course, there is the occasional shrine they arrive at too late to tour, like Jefferson's Monticello, and the author is only too happy to tell the reader about their adventure trespassing, instead. Pick up \\"On the Road\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive American History","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Dr. Brinkley's insights into our culture, both past and present are sharp. He presents a balanced look at all parts of the country, even the more looked-down-upon sections.

I purchased it for use in our travel trailer - when we aren't traveling. The Eva-dry consistantly absorbs moisture, and we haven't had ANY problems with moisture/mold/mildew in our camper since we began using it.PROS:* Affectively collects moisture from the air in small enclosed areas (closets, campers, etc... as it was intended).* REUSABLE - Which saves a great deal of $$$ vs. the cost of disposible moisture control products.* Neat and Compact - No messy containers of cat litter or other moisture control products to spill or change out.CONS:I find only one problem with this unit. Because it is hefty, it simply will not stay plugged into a wall outlet for recharging. I have to place a prop under ours during recharges.Even with that small glitch in design, I still give the Eva-Dry 5 stars.

This did not surprise me particularly after actually seeing the device as I learned that it is 100% passive and doesn't even have a fan to move air over it's passive, water-absorbing pellets. I would think that to work at all it would need at least a fan. What then is this \\"wireless\\" claim you ask? Well, allegedly, once these pellets are saturated with water, you can plug the device in and it will heat the pellets or something, causing them to release their water, making the pellets reusable... but still worthless since it doesn't really do anything to begin with.* yes the humidity monitor works, I have confirmed it against other humidity sensing devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights out campers!","review":"We ordered this with high hopes.

I'm able to renew it on a counter outlet but could be a more problematic for a regular outlet that has more space between outlet and floor. Problem 2. My boyfriend who I forgot to tell about the unit, went into my closet like a bull in a china shop and it fell off its hook and broke (glass beads everywhere) - I had to buy a new one after only a month. There should be a more secure way to affix the unit to hang in the closet or perhaps customer should opt to put it on the floor.

The units do slowly collect some water, evident when they are recharged and show a bit of condensation in the viewing window, but the reality is they are not removing anywhere near a substantial amount of moisture. I have used a hygrometer, and even in a tiny enclosed space did not see the relative humidity budge from its 60% level of the surrounding air."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works!","review":"I had written a review for EDV-300 which I thought was for EDV-500. Anyway, I bought both and both work as expected! I used them both for my bathroom that's about 9 square feet. The mildew is visibly less and takes a longer time to build up. The mini one changed color after about a week of use and the EDV-500 started to change color now that it's about 1 month since I first started using it. One thing that I notice is that for the EDV-300 it changes color faster once you have charged it. It now starts changing color in about 2-3 days as opposed to 1 week. I need to see if that's the same case for EDV-500. But overall, I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for small SEALED applications","review":"I bought this for my Keezer because excessive moisture was causing mold. This thing works amazingly well dehumidifying a 7.0 cu foot SEALED container. No longer are the walls of the freezer 'weeping', they are bone dry to the touch.Since this is a PASSIVE dehumidifier I do not recommend it for anything but small and relatively sealed areas like a closet or fabric chest. If you want to dehumidify a small room or large closet look at getting a active model.Update: I've had this in my keezer for 7 months now. The moisture related mold problem I had before hasn't come back since.Update 1/21/11: Dropped it off the plugin a few times while recharging so I always use an extension cord to recharge now.

At first it worked well, with a (slightly) noticeable difference in air quality. Unfortunately, I know from firsthand experience that the material used to soak up moisture is a tiny charged glass resin ball. Before the dehumidifier had finished discharging even once, it split on its seam after being tossed gently onto a bed, spilling tiny beads EVERYWHERE. It was impossible to put it back together because of the nature of the crack, so my roommate and I were left cleaning up tiny glass beads (which, by the way, crush easily) for the rest of the day.Overall pretty good if you KNOW it'll never move, drop, get bumped, but not very durable, well-made, or even particularly effective in my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstanding on how to use","review":"I thought this only needed to be charged and then would work unplugged.

All you'll find is intellectual deprivation and an abysmal disdain for intellectual curiosity.In Jacobs' world there is no gray, and gray matter simply doesn't matter. I am not suggesting that she is not intelligent, only that she seems to have a deeply ingrained mistrust of human reasoning and logic. She doesn't go so far as to equate human reasoning with evil but, like the lyrics and song title of a classic song by the Rolling Stones, when something seems foreign and unfamiliar to her, she will not hesitate to Paint it Black.

It isn't an entirely useless work, as it does give some interesting insights as to how second century Imperial Rome looked upon its founding fathers.

He spares no one in this, if they were morally corrupt (as most of them seemed to be) he completely tells it all.

I would usually roll my eyes at this seemingly one-sided story, w/ Bernardo being the only sadistic, homicidal monster. However, the empty, soulless nature of Prepon's performance is quite chilling in itself, showing how far a human being can go before doing what is right. Even if this Homolka-view of the story is true, it presents us w/ a feeble-minded creature, unable to save the lives of others due to her own weakness, impotence, and total insecurity.

When I saw the doc on youtube I had the impression she was a willing participant in everything, when I saw the movie it makes it out like she hated everything & had remorse. Watch the doc on youtube & then rent the movie & watch it for yourself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad....not close to great though","review":"Not much to say about it. Those looking for a lot of skin/etc. will be disappointed. Seems like decent performances by the two leads (I really had contempt for the male lead, and was infuriated by the passive acceptance of Laura Prepon's title character) were done in by poor writing and nonexistant supporting cast. Sort of makes me think someone lost a bet and had to be in the flick in the first place, as I certainly think Prepon at this stage in her career can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll be in therapy forever","review":"I only gave this a great rating because it is a real depiction of sadism, evil and I hope it saves other girls from someone like this.I've been through a rough relationship with a Paul type.

I had family issues, abuse at home, issues with my parents. Men like this look for girls that are vulnerable, needy and craving love.Men like this are not wired right.

After the first murder I'd had enough. I don't like to discourage young talent, but this project is thoroughly amateurish. The script is pretty much one tawdry sexual situation after another. The production desperately needed a make-up professional or at least somebody that could light the performers in a flattering manner. The acting is exaggerated mugging, almost like this had been a stage production and they're reenacting their broad 'to the back seats' performances. All in all, it seemed like a video made to impress their friends rather than something that should be in general release. I can't comment on the second feature since the first one was so unpleasant to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mistake on my part...","review":"When I saw this online, I thought it was 'the Film Crew' with the MST3K gang and opened it up before I realized my error.

It fills a lot of inexplicable holes in the older book. The definitions are for the most part clear and intuitive. And the biggest thing for travelers and beginning students is that Indonesian words are listed as they appear--you don't have to deduce a root word, which the older edition and other Indonesian dictionaries make you do (fine if you've learned a bit of the language, but it makes a dictionary pretty much useless if not). The compiler is Australian, but as an American I have not run into any usage issues. Hard to see from the picture, but the book also includes an English-Indonesian dictionary and should also be useful for Indonesian speakers learning English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little dictionary","review":"Great small dictionary that would be easy to keep with you when travelling or studying.

An attempt was made to define specific versions of an Indonesian word rather than have the user wade through a long list of variants.

Everyone got some but none got enough to make a meal. His quip could equally apply to this book. It touches on everything, but doesn't cover anything in sufficient depth. In fact I would tend to view the book as really centered around bringing Fireworks and Freehand into play (contra Illustrator and Photoshop). Freehand and Fireworks get 200 pages each, while Flash gets 90 pages. Dreamweaver gets just under 300 pages, and the surface of many features is revealed. However, there isn't a lot of depth throughout and elaborate examples are avoided. The rest of the book is focused on Cold Fusion (which was not of interest to me).My personal recommendation is to look at specific books for specific components. Compendium type books, often suggest more than they can deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!

I feel somewhat angry that I spent $... just to hear this guy try to sell me his \\"gizmo.\\" He also spends a lot of time criticizing crunches, basically claiming that he has a corner on the market of scientific information, and telling you to ignore what the rest of the world says. He does cover some other \\"non-Pavelizer\\" exercises; but still, hardly a page goes by where he doesn't mention the need for his device.

This theme hasn't been applied to the abdominal muscles,(check all the high rep, low resistance 'tools' on TV ads), UNTIL NOW. Pavel uses the the latest knowledge to TRULY isolate, (crunches won't do it), the abs for the first time. What this means is brief sets like never before, ( those ' 6 minutes workouts' for the abs are NOT brief, just trying doing six minutes of crunches). Imagine doing a set of revised situps that stress the abs so well that you've had your best ab workout ever in less than ONE minute! No comparison; the only ab book worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ab Great","review":"Sure there is self promotion in it but this has to be one of the best ab books I have ever bought.

Someone should tell him that you could do janda sit-up till tomorrow and nothing will happen either! His \\"secret\\" is far from being a secret. It does not matter what kind of sit-up you do. You will not get any 6-pack doing that kind of exercise. You can strength your abdomen, of course, but fat will stay there OVER your muscles. If you want to get rid of fat you have to do aerobic exercise (even walking quickly is effective) and take control of your diet. That's it. That's the real secret.

The best I've seen as far as people stating that got results and a 6 pack is the \\"The Complete Book of Abs\\".

Most of the exercises can be done at home, using no equipemnt (or cheap equipment). Those angry reviewers who insist this is an info-mertial for his ab-machine (which he admittedly does advertise in the book) seem to overlook that he demonstrates how a partner can take the place of the \\"Pavelizer\\".

It is great fun to see Joan Crawford match wits and snappy dialogue with Sydney Greenstreet. His characterization is superb evil, and he places his energies into getting rid of Joan Crawford who has newly entered into this quaint (Florida) town. Joan, however, refuses to leave. What fun! It is a pleasure to see the stars take to their roles with such vitality. It is well worth your time to watch and cheer street-wise Lane Bellamy (Joan) take on the evil Titus Semple (Greenstreet) The ending is pure Hollywood, but that is what makes it such fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawford vs. Greenstreet","review":"When I saw that the movie was essentially going to be about Joan Crawford taking on Sydney Greenstreet, I knew this was one I had to watch. Crawford plays a former carnival dancer who falls in love with deputy sheriff Zachary Scott, only to have him pulled away from her by Greenstreet, the sheriff, who is planning on advancing the weak Scott's career so that he can have some behind-the-scenes power. Having spent most of her life moving from town to town, Crawford isn't in a hurry to leave, which sets up the central conflict of the film as she goes against the sheriff. The film is at its best when Crawford and Greenstreet spar, setting off fireworks. Some of their dialogue is fun, making up for other less inspired stretches of the story. Gladys George, a terrific character actress, does very well as the owner of a night club who employs Crawford. It's not great cinema, but in the hands of old pros like Crawford, Greenstreet, and director Michael Curtiz, it is very watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRADA'S THROW-UP ORANGE","review":"Look, it's on sale!

Now they may fit right for females, but there's just no room for my junk in these drawers. That leads to the second catch, that although I wrote the seller an e-mail asking to rectify the situation, I received no reply.All told, I'd have to say: shop for a quality product that fits, from a supplier that will support their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Agree","review":"Wanted some compression shorts to wear while bicycle riding and for general purposes.

Odd, and certainly a red flag.There are not worth the price. You will probably be disappointed and do what I did and toss them in the drawer and never wear them. For compression shorts, I suggest spending the extra money and getting something of a heavy grade that will actually compress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to Asics","review":"These shorts start off with their advertising all over the waist band, which is not in the advertised picture - not appreciated. Then they are very difficult to put on, compared with the slightly more expensive Asics. Then they have no crotch support, unlike Asics, and a similar observation to another bad review here. I thought this kind of item was pretty similar across the manufacturer board. Wrong. The same could be said for the sleeveless exercise shirts.

Very readable, with a nice, easy style. I would recommend it to any martial artist who wants to improve and refresh his/her basic knowledge of this important part of hand-to-hand combat. I call wrist locks \\"the small man's friend\\" (I'm 5'7\\") because, properly employed, they can help smaller combatants overcome the size and weight advantage of larger opponents.

I am convinced those who rated this outdated and useless book highly were paid endorsements. In a street fight, if you honestly believe you are going to get someone, swinging at you like a Mike Tyson, in a wrist lock you should be beaten to an inch of your life. Maybe only then will you see the lunacy of your thinking. Don't get me wrong. Wrist locks have a place for police officers who arrest drunken miscreants who fully comply. But this book is rediculous. The pictures are old and gritty, unclear, vague, and really, how much can you learn this subtle art from a book? If you think you can, I have a book I'd like to sell you on teaching you how to fly a 747 jet airliner. All you do is read the book and you are ready to fly the jet--the same day.

The first half of the book covers the creation of Yugoslavia, its WW2 break-up and its re-creation as a socialist federation under Marshall Tito. The chapters are brief and straightforward with little new information.The second half of the book tends to stray into the realm of suspicion and paranoia that is a staple for this part of the world. Hudson unfortunately sees everything that happened in Yugoslavia since 1980 as a consequence of American capitalist imperialism.By the end, I was really tired of this book, even tho it is less than 200 pages. If you want a more objective look at why Yugoslavia so tragically shattered into pieces, look elsewhere.

All one has to do is to ask God for healing, and God will heal the sick person. He does not believe what he writes. If he did, he would not have included an out when what he presents does not work. His out is that if the person is not healed, the sick person and the prayer do not have enough faith. Like all who use this out for unanswered prayer, he does not define how much faith is enough faith. Presumably, if the prayer and sick are atheists, who deny God's existence, and the prayer offers up a philippic, sarcastic prayer, and the sick person is healed, then they had enough faith. However, if the prayer and sick are devout Christians whose virtue and piety are beyond question and who have never doubted God and the sick is not healed, then they did not have enough faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never got it USMedia is Rude and docent fulfill.","review":"I never got it, USMedia is Rude and docent fulfill your purchases.1 sentence answers with no help at all.

L. and Daisy Osborn's unique approach of preaching a holistic gospel combined with mass prayer for the sick should be studied by anyone with a passion for winning nations to Christ. The thing that set T.L. and Daisy Osborn apart from other ministers is their unwavering conviction that the simple preaching of the Word is sufficient to accomplish miracles. What I like about the Osborn's writing is you get the impression that anyone can do what they do, even if they don't have a particular \\"anointing\\" or \\"gift of the Spirit\\", as long as they preach the pure and uncompromising Word of God.Aaron D.

I also don't believe it does a disservice to the d.a.'s office of Boston. I believe, instead, that it sheds light on many of the most important cases and issues faced by the city's law enforcement officials.

This book of traditional characters will soon be obsolete. Buy the new version.Note (June 2010): Just on a whim I decided to go back and re-read my reviews to see where I've most embarrassed myself, and I have to admit it's right here. I asked my wife where she got that information, but she said she couldn't remember, but obviously it wasn't true.

But I digress. Susan Jacks' voice is hauntingly and breathtakingly emotive, even seductive. One feels the heartache in her voice as she waits for one who never appears. Unrequited love! And the melody and vocals have not left me since the first day I heard them. If you have ever been in love, buy this album, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Canadian Pop Group","review":"I enjoyed this collection very much. My favorite by far is \\"Where evil grows\\" with that great bassline. I discovered this song from a friend who bought it in a 10 cent promo bin. I also was pleased with the single version of \\"That's where I went wrong\\". \\"There's no blood in bone\\" features a very elaborate phasing gimmick. Susan is very gifted in the vocal department. Her voice has a certain melencollie to it and she is very underrated. \\"Which way you going Billy\\" and \\"I was wondering\\" are also fine. This cd was a big surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fan broke within 6 months..","review":"This dual fan, unlike others, did not have a switch to reverse the airflow. This would have been more convenient than having to turn the unit around if I wanted to change the inflow/outflow. It did however work fine in terms of enough power for my room (12x12). The problem was, one of the blades eventually came loose and fell off it's support. I was able to put it back on but it was a recurring problem and eventually that blade bent and was useless. If I had to do it all again, I would have bought a heavier duty fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Fan","review":"We have had 2 of these fans and both have had the same problem over a very short period of time. The fan is mounted vertically in the window.With both fans, while they were running,the top fan blade fell off! The first fan was only a few months old and was returned to the store and I was given a replacement fan. The current fan is only a month or so old and not 30 minutes ago the same thing happened to this one! I will return this fan but I'm not really sure if I will accept another replacement after this happening twice with 2 virtually new fans. I thought I'd bought a quality product but now it sure doesn't seem that way now that the same thing has happened twice. I will contact the company and inform them of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is rated not a soundtrack","review":"If the music is not from the film then how is it a soundtrack?Amazon has some problems and this is one, I in general trust Amazon but how I to trust \\"soundtrack\\" labeled music that is not from the movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"History Disguised as a Novel","review":"Fast-paced, peopled with well-fleshed out characters (some fictional, some historical) and historically accurate, this novel is a godsend for those who wish a familiarity with the subject matter, but hate to read history. Here is a blow-by-blow depiction of all the major events of the second Greco-Persian war in the order that they unfolded as observed by the various participants, yet the novel never seems stilted or contrived, but flows naturally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we reading the same book?","review":"One customer said this was better than \\"Gates of Fire\\". Since I thought \\"Gates of Fire\\" was brilliant I bought this book. What a disappointment! I have to wonder if that reviewer read the same book I did or is just shilling for the author.This book is badly written, full of misspellings, grammatical errors and words whose meaning the author apparently doesn't know.The author's knowledge of the subject is sketchy at best. I plowed through to the end hoping at least that the climactic battle would salvage the book. Alas, the author managed even to make the battle of Plataea boring.I give this 1 star only because the author is not a professional writer.In my opinion he would do well to keep his day job.I wish I could get my money back. This book is so bad I wouldn't even donate it to my local library book sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herodotus was more exciting","review":"Well, sometimes the history books are better. This book was slow paced, the characters were underdeveloped and the action was not that gripping. The battle of Plataea was a momentous and significant event. It was the culmination of a dramatic stand against an overwhelming force from a foreign land. The subject matter should have been handled with a more dramatic approach. Instead, I was left not caring who lived or died. This is an uninspiring tale about a very important time. The author obviously knows his history but should leave the historians to tell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Not All That!!!!","review":"I read some of the other reviews for this book, and being very interested in the time and the setting, was looking forward to my copy of this book arriving.I really wanted to like this book.In truth, the characters are hollow and there is next to no time put in towards more than a cursory glance at each of them, the storyline flicks between the characters from each side in a jagged, hap-hazard way that ultimately results in confusion over characters and sides of the story.The writing style of the author seems to be more interested in 'showing off' particular details of Ancient Greek and Persian life that he has learnt rather than capturing the subject in an imaginative and creative way.Ultimately I was left with no emotional investment in the story and no desire to read other novels of the same Author, which is sad because I love the setting and the time period.As I said, I really wanted to like this book. Sadly, it fell too far short."},{"rating":"2","title":"tremendously surprised and pleased with historical accuracy.","review":"After being disappointed with the Greek historical novel \\"Gates of Fire\\" that so many others seemed to rant over, I was suspecting something similar with this author. Was I ever pleasantly surprised and delighted !Jon Martin knows his ancient Greek subject thoroughly, and is an excellent story teller.

It's just a really pleasing album. They manage to sometimes sound like an alt-country or jam-band, but other times sound like they could have come from the alternative scene. Whatever your perspective though, they're really good. The album starts strong with \\"Little Silver Ring\\" and \\"Everytime\\", and most of the rest is as good.

Yet, Jesus said that our love for Him would be evident in the way we treat our neighbors. Even our enemies. This book will challenge every child of God to examine the way he or she lives in light of the great commandment, as well as Paul's teaching on 1 Cor 13. For, this book is a collection of sermons on the thirteenth chapter of Paul's letter to the Corinthians, often called the \\"love chapter\\". After reading this book, the reader may not go about flippintly using the word \\"love\\".

The world pisses him off and there's nothing he can do about it. Don't get me wrong, there are moments through this book that are particularly insightful and very funny, as he attacks how language insidiously breeds its political and religious agendas; however, there are other very long stretches where George is that obnoxious bore at the end of the bar. The 7 dirty words were a riot the first time thru back 30 years ago. Incantations not with standing, the repititive invocations here are just simply a droning and monotonous inveighing that when it doesn't strike you as unimaginative is then patently and moronically of no effect. I've always admired someone who can roll off a curse with aplomb. George isn't one of them. So, shell out the coins to the NY hustler if you must. Maybe one day he'll have enough to hire an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job!","review":"Much of this book was witty, true, and included things that you wish someone had said but no one ever did. My problem was with the bathroom humor. When Carlin went off in this direction he was not funny, he was not even witty, he was generally just plain disgusting. I imagine that bathroom humor can be made to have some wit, but he missed it here. He is much more enjoyable to watch than he came across, on balance, in this book . . and he should stick to that . . George, don't quit your day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he really mean this to be funny?","review":"A surprizingly tiresome and unfunny book that is far more annoying and irritating than it is amusing or thought provoking from someone I regard as one of the great comedians and satirists of our time. Don't misunderstand me, I like George Carlin, always have and still do. But the only reason this saw the light of day is because the author happens to be famous. If this was written by an unknown no publisher in the world would have released it. If you don't believe me, or any of the other negative reviews here, do yourself a favor. Go to a book store and browse through this waste of paper and see if there is anything, anything at all that makes you smile or stop and think.I am someone who reads constantly and I can honestly say this is the worst book I have ever read. And no, I am not a right wing religious nut."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not that funny","review":"I bought this book because I used to think george carlin was pretty funny. Unfortunately, this book is mostly just angry and bitter and not really very funny, at all. Mr. Carlin repeatedly uses very harsh language for its shock value and it detracts from what he tries to say. He has some good points about euphemisms, about religion, about women's place in the world, but his presentation lacks finesse and is as subtle as a brick to the head and about as funny. Lest there be question -- I laugh at South Park, enjoy Michael Moore, and miss the days when it took more than repeated use of the word penis to be considered witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlin Classic","review":"Once again, Carlin cuts loose and I laugh myself silly.

I sometimes pull his first book, \\"Braindroppings\\" off the shelf for a quick cheer-me-up. Its a FUNNY book. The problem with 'When will Jesus...\\" is its really not that funny. I felt like I was reading the rantings of a crotchety , bitter old man, without the usual Carlin finesse. \\"THE FANATICS WILL WIN...anyone who supports the US will be killed.Save your money for the black market folks, you're going to need it\\". Not funny. If I want to hear a crotchety old man, I'll call my father in Pittsburgh. I don't even care if Carlin messes with Jesus.

They were for the most part sharp and profound. \\"When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?\\" is a real disappointment. George seems to have literally run out of ideas.

But if you haven't read his others...give them a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"All these bad reviews prove one thing...........","review":"....good old George still hasn't lost his touch! In his beginning days George pissed off a lot of puritan and conservative wussies with his middle finger to PC brand of humor, and it seems he still does. As funny as ever.What's funnier are a lot of these christian goobers writing one star reviews are actually the work of one person. The person repeates how George is bad for not believing in some ancient Israelite hippie and more blah blah blahs.

Contrary to popular belief, it's possible to be hilariously witty without crossing all boundaries of decency. If this book is any indication, George hasn't mastered that skill yet. The largest part of this book left me wondering why I paid so much money to be subjected to such garbage. Be sure this is what you really want before you waste your cold hard cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be hypocritical","review":"Yes, George picks on everyone, and yes, he probably does intend to offend even his fans. It's amazing to me that his fans would put up with it, but that's their prerogative. However, George did single Jesus out because he put Jesus in the book title. So George will definitely be hearing from some irate Christians, and that's their prerogative. What I don't get is the people who claim to be Christians saying that knocking Jesus is OK. Jesus is a gentleman. He doesn't insist that anyone follow him. Neither does he offer an option to ride the fence where He is concerned. You are either for Jesus or you are against Him. If you are among the millions of people who bowed their heads during 911 and prayed to God in Jesus name, then you shouldn't be laughing and making light of a book cover that desecrates \\"The Last Supper\\". That's called hypocrisy. \\"Christians\\" who say that there's nothing wrong with George attacking Jesus simply aren't really Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Apparently nothing is sacred to George Carlin. He's going to be more than red faced on Judgment Day when he stands before Jesus trying to explain how he got the title and cover picture for this book. Anyone who claims to be a Christian needs to boycott \\"When Will Jesus Bring The Pork Chops?\\". Better yet, watch the Passion of the Christ and then try to tell me that Jesus hasn't already suffered enough abuse.

Nobody should earn money for this stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain droopings","review":"George Carlin occasionally hits the nail on the head. And even a broken clock is correct twice each day. If George Carlin were a right-wing fundamentalist Christian, and he wrote a book similar in tone or theme to this one, he would be accused of hate speech. While I am no fan of political correctness, I find Carlin's continuing bashing of sincerely held religious beliefs to be tiresome and offensive. Which, of course, in America, he has the right to do. Nonetheless, one wonders, what heinous act did Roy Rogers and Dale Evans commit to deserve the kind of vile, pornographic commentary that Carlin offers up in this book? It's one thing to criticize, mock, or satirize, but that remark and others by Carlin are simply crude and crotchety...no pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Jesus Out of It","review":"It seems that George Carlin doesn't care that many of his fans are Christian. He certainly has the right to the freedom of speech that was incidentally guaranteed by our Christian forefathers. Likewise, all Christians have the freedom to choose not to buy this book. Before George carelessly steps on millions of American toes, he should consider that he's likely to feel it where it hurts the most...in his wallet. Christians simply shouldn't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry George!","review":"George's act is very tired. Most of the material in this book is stale and recycled. His desperation is very obvious in the 'controversial cover' attempt. I guess he has to earn money to compensate for his latest rehabilitation.

I'm a Christian who stands up for Jesus...so I'll choose Jesus over George on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooot Funny","review":"I thought this book was supposed to be funny, but I guess I was mistaken. From the sounds of it, if George had two positive thoughts in a row, his brain would have gone into a cramp. He would have us all believe that the entire world and everyone in it is a complete screw up. What you read affects your thoughts. Unless you need more negativity in your life or are hoping to bone up on your bad attitude, you can probably live without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I am neither a member of the right wing nor a religious fanatic, but I found this book to be disgusting and vulgar for no reason. Mr. Carlin could have been just as humerous, without being offensive. Not only was his excessive use of profanity unecessary, but some of his humor was offensive, demeaning and and his stories actually sickening. I would not have even given this book one star if I had a choice. Do not waste your money. This was the first book I actually thought of burning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Not up to par for George Carlin. Not even close.

This falls way short of funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the Right Wingers who don't understand the title...","review":"The title references the fact that Jesus Christ himself was born and lived as a Jewish man, therefore he was kosher and did not eat porkchops. Jesus will never bring the porkchops because he is Jewish and kosher, that's the joke. Pretty clever, but I wouldn't expect any less from such a brilliant satirist like George Carlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud","review":"What I admire about this book is that Carlin is not afraid to take on controversial topics. Everyone, from liberal to conservative, prude to libertine is fair game. Even more importantly, he had me laughing out loud. In these rather nasty times, which sometimes look very bleak, it's important to let go with a big guffaw. This book is what I have been waiting for, and I hope you enjoy it as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a good book for an airplane","review":"This is a great book. Although it isn't a good book to bring on an airplane, because it's so funny! Carlin has 3 books out now and they're all very funny.

Thank the Pork Chop God for Laxatives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a shade off the mark in print","review":"I'm not going to get into the argument over whether George Carlin's humor was offensive; if you're buying his book then you probably know what brand of humor you're going to get.\\"When Will Jesus Bring the Porkchops?\\" is clearly up Carlin's alley, but it definitely loses something in the print edition. This isn't the case for most of his other work (e.g. \\"Napalm and Silly Putty\\"), but this time around you get the feeling that he more or less dictated some of his stage routines into a tape recorder, which someone later transcribed.I imagine that if you purchase the audio version of this one or, if you have a vivid enough imagination to \\"hear\\" the book in your mind's ear, you'll enjoy it much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Good, Half Bad","review":"I would say that half of this book is funny and entertaining and on target,(the parts about men, women, religion and retail), and the other half (burning cats, odes to Michael Jackson, crude bathroom humour)is just plain offensive and not funny at all. Carlin has some interesting insights on some subjects, but unless you're just crazy about him and really enjoy \\"in your face\\" type humour, the book is not that enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I've been a fan of George Carlin since the time of his \\"The Seven Words\\", but this book was a major disappointment. I have always appreciated his clever wordplay and his biting satire, but this was thoroughly disappointing. I listened to the audio book, and had the advantage of hearing Carlin deliver his own lines, but even that didn't make the book worth the effort. He seemed like a cranky old fart, complaining about obvious targets like men, corporations, etc., but without much wit. It was as if he felt he had to publish a collection and substituted stale and predictable verbal attacks for the clever analytical satire that had made him so much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"There's no need to get into a christian/jesus discussion - this book is terrible regardless of your beliefs.Personally, I really enjoy George's TV shows. Unfortunately, this book is without structure and just appears to be a random brain dump of whatever he was thinking while trying to fulfill some commitments to a publisher. Every once in a while he'll write something funny, but most of it is a waste of ink.If you like George, buy something else that he's done. If you're bothered by the title, don't buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Carlin bring the funny?","review":"Man oh man! I was so looking forward to reading this book and I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. If you read Braindroppings and/or Napalm and Silly Putty, you will get tired of this book really quick. Anything worth laughing about is merely a rehashing of the concepts introduced in the earlier books. As for new stuff, its as though he forgot he was a comedian. Not funny at all. I wasn't offended by anything he wrote. Well, except for the fact that I was offended he had the gall to charge money to read it.Definitely pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny....","review":"The picture on the cover is the funniest part of this book. I love George Carlin, but the best way to enjoy him is to watch him do a live performance. I even got the audio cd version of this book and .... not funny.The book starts off pretty well then quickly gets dull. There are WAY too many sections on euphemisms! Then he will do a commercial spot in between his many, many sections on even more euphemisms. The commercial spots he does didn't make me laugh one time and they got very redundant.If you want to enjoy Carlin, go for the live performance dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of Old Material","review":"I will admit up front that I could not get all the way through this book. This is a poorly done rehashing of old material mixed in with some boring new items.

I bought it with great anticipation of many joyful hours on the toilet. After all, what better place to enjoy toilet humor?Unfortunately the book was boring. What's more, Carlin does not resonate as the great sardonist and social critic he once was. He comes off as just another bitter old man.Here I sit brokenhearted...."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Will Carlin Bring the Humor?","review":"\\"Am I the only one who thinks the Muppets weren't funny?\\" That's a direct quote from the book. If you think it's amusing or real profound, buy the book.As for me, I have worked --yes, worked-- my way through 125 pages of this book. The last four or five reading sessions started with an argument with myself \\"I gotta keep reading this book -- Yeah, but it's so boring -- Well, you *paid* for this book, so enjoy it -- But I *don't* enjoy it! -- Hey, give the man a chance, maybe it gets better -- Oh, all right!\\"Still, I have yet to crack a smile --never mind laugh-- or nod my head in agreement with some wise remark. Now don't think I'm a curmudgeon: I read both Carlin's previous books and enjoyed them. But this one -- I get the feeling its contents were fished out of Carlin's trashcan: a mishmash of random jokes that just didn't make it -- to cash in on his two previous successes.And it looks like I'm *not* the only one who thinks Carlin's no longer funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Depressing and a Waste of Time","review":"I listened to this directly after David Sedaris Live at Carnegie Hall (which was fantastic!) and boy was it painful and depressing. I kept skipping sections and waiting for it to get funny. George Carlin is just a grumpy old man who has lost his sense of what is funny. He is like the Andy Rooney of comedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book reads like rough notes for stand-up routines, unfinished, a few rare good bits. A lot of it is ghoulish and piggish. You have to see Carlin perform to appreciate him. He does not come over at all in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny, Not Witty, Immature","review":"I've always thought Carlin was witty and smart, even though I could do without the foul language. This work struck me as really immature and not at all witty. The foul language was just offensive and not the least bit funny or additive to his point(s). In fact, I didn't find any of the material funny at all. It was a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title Is The Funniest Part Of The Book","review":"I just could not get into this book. Maybe I'll try again in the future.Not what I epected from Carlin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sad . . .","review":"Adjectives . . .Sad, vile, misanthropic, unfunny, vacuous, nihilistic, bitter, hateful, vitriolic, spent, tiresome, crotchety, and did I mention sad? So much negativity that I became a bit depressed and just couldn't finish the book. I went outside and sat under a glowing delightful sun that afternoon. I began to feel very sorry for Mr. Carlin. Life is too short to spend it with such a negative worldview. I cannot imagine how empty you must be if you found this book funny, and I am glad I don't know you. You are probably as toxic as Mr. Carlin himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please explain","review":"to me like a two year old what is the point of this book? It is a wastage of paper and ink and all the trees we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"He isn't funny","review":"George Carlin is the guy who brought you four-letter words toTelevision, and aren't we a better society for it! Wow. I am notsure why I thought maybe this book would be different, but it isn't.During the first few chapters, I just kept thinking, thisold guy really needs to grow up one of these days. His mentalityis stuck back in junior high, which is really pathetic. And I amstill waiting for that first laugh in this book. It just isn'tfunny. Why do people keep calling him a comedian? I repeat, heisn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"George can do much better than this!","review":"To \\"Mystic Riddims\\" who claims that Jesus wasn't in the da Vinci painting of \\"The Last Supper,\\" look again...He's the man in the middle. Perhaps you didn't recognize Him because nobody today knows for sure what Jesus looked like back then. But EVERYONE will recognize Him when He splits the Eastern sky during His second coming. As for the book, it's hard for me to be impressed by repetitive four letter words that ramble incessantly about lewd and crude subjects. Nevertheless, I love George, and so does Jesus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian Filth.....","review":"You took the 10 commandments out of the courtroom because it may offend someone, yet a book that offends millions of sincere christians is allowed to be sold in stores in America. This country definetly is going down but contrary to what this sad, sick man Carlin thinks; its because of people like him, who attack people because they have a religious faith. In America you have a choice to be religious or not, but you don't have a right to attack the faith of Christians. I took my copy right back to the target store manager and told him that this book should not be in the store but in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pork Chops? Jesus is KOSHER!!","review":"I tried to rate this at \\"-\\" but it wouldn't let me, oh well!When will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? Let me give you an answer Mr. Carlin - NEVER! Jesus was a kosher eating Jewish Rabbi. He obeyed the TORAH - God's Word. The fact that Carlin asks such a question should be reason enough not to buy book that shows his obvious ignorance of who Jesus was and is!As for you Dusti: Jesus isn't dead - He rose again on the third day! The Bible calls this the Resurrection! Wonderful isn't it!!Too bad Mr. Carlin shows no respect for the One who died and rose again for him. Yet, Jesus was put on the cross for this sin too! Thank you LORD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"For the people giving this a single star ????I have never read anything by GC, that wasn't frickin hilarious. If you won't buy it because Walmart decided not to sell it, that makes you sad. Did you also know that walmart pays it females employees less for the same jobs? OH wait thats ok the Old testament says I can be sold in to slavery and beaten to death, so obvioulsy God desn't give a crap about women.I love this book, I like the bits a pieces parts the best, Classic One liners abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlin has still got it..","review":"George Carlin always seems to find ways to take difficult and touchy subjects and make them simple and to the point. This book has had me laughing since the very beginning and it never let up. While this book may not be for the most socially conservative people out there, I do think it is a great book for everyone to read because of the common sense, no bull attitude that Carlin is famous for. Carlin has alot of strong arguements in this book on everything from religion to old people. All of which are funny as hell. I strongly recommend this book to any and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know George but I hope you brought HIM some!","review":"As always George Carlin's insightful view of life is both humorous and truthful. His comments will fill your day with insight and allow you to laugh under your own stress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brainwashed Christians...please pray for me","review":"Because I think you're blind, conforming, morons. The 1 star ratings are great. Lighten up people! And, pray for me...please...I need to be SAVED by your imaginary gOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Jesus bring the pork chops?","review":"This book is an unworthy follower to Napalm and Silly Putty. Mr. Carlin rants about certain topics for way to long. Of course, there are funny bits, but I must say that the nagging overpowers the humor. We don't see the funny, witty Carlin here, but rather the old grumpy man who yells at little kids for playing in the street. Too bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Boring.","review":"First off, let me say that I'm certainly not one of these \\"right wing religious fanatics\\", my opinion on religion is pretty much the same as George Carlin's. Also, he happens to be my all time favorite comedian.With that being said, I don't know what it is about this ... whatever it is ... spoken word album. As a whole, it falls flat. The vast majority of the material just isn't funny, or clever, but silly ... but not silly enough to be funny, just silly enough to be dumb.I'm giving this 2 stars since this is from George Carlin. It *should* be much better than this. At the end of the day, this is all simply boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"At best, keep it beside the commode !","review":"I am a huge fan of Carlins but we've heard these in hisstand-up. The book is in my guest bath room, for thosewho like a book in the bog !The best part of this book is the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?","review":"George Carlin was definitely an observer and a thinker! This one was more \\"dark\\" and laced with cynicism than the other two I have read but definitely worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the \\"Foole\\"?","review":"I used to love George Carlin. I thought he was the funniest thing this side of hell and damnation. But in recent years (I trace it back to the first heart attack, myself) his humor muse seems to have deserted him. Most of this stuff does not even remotely compare to the early Carlin stand-up albums. And I am not a right-wing wacko who is offended by the anti-Christian stance that Carlin seems to make a staple of his comedy these days. I just don't think very much of it is very funny. Some of the pieces here, to be sure, sent me into spasms of hysterics, but these were few and far between. My reccommendation? Get Carlin's Little David Years box set which has the classic \\"Occupation: Foole\\" (as referenced in my title) as well as six others including the Grammy Award winning \\"FM & AM\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random","review":"After listening to his great show \\"You Are All Diseased\\" I had high expectations of this book. Unfortunately, it never reaches the same level of hilarious outrage. Much of the book consists of a random assortment of observations, very few of them brilliant or laugh out loud funny. The only exception being a much more coherent part about euphemistic language, which is an ongoing thread in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even so so","review":"Luckily in brick and mortar bookstores the customer has the opportunity to browse through the books he contemplates buying. So I looked at Pork Chops the other day. Now my background is that I consider George Carlin to be one of the greatest comic geniuses in the English speaking world. Seven words you can't say. An hour of free floating hatred. Etc etc etc. I was even one of those rare persons who loved _George_, his short-lived sitcom. I even continue to laugh about the episode that turned on the toxic effects of insufficient hair-washing.Unfortunately, this book was not funny. In vain, I searched through the pages to find something to make me laugh out loud, to guffaw, or maybe chuckle. Nothing. Not even a wry smirk. I hope his much-publicized time in detox brings him back to form. As for me, I satisfied my need for comic ranting with a Dennis Miller book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snarlin Carlin","review":"I guess if you like George Carlin you may like the book. I've never cared for Carlin. After reading ( parts of the ) book, I like him less. SAve your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Crude","review":"After reading this book it's easy to understand why Americans in general are becoming increasingly rude and inconsiderate. I still believe it's quite possible to be very funny without being crude and irreverant...but that requires a unique combination of cleverness and finesse. George seems more interested in thoughtlessly thumbing his nose at everyone and everything. If that makes your boat float, then you can have my copy of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Humor????","review":"Blistering, malicious, and not all that funny--this book goes from bad to worse in a New York minute. I half expected George to blast my Grandma, or even his Grandma for that matter! I understand sattire, but it doesn't need to be this vicious. George should try some Ritalin before he writes his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will George bring the Laughs?","review":"The disappointed reaction to this book is nothing to do with religion - the sad fact is that is simply not funny and not in the least entertaining. It looks like George took all the scraps he had laying around that he hadn't put in a book and just threw them together. For a sample read the extended lists on the differences between men and women early in the book and then ask yourself how often have you heard these lines before. It's just an extended rant, and few people can bring that sort of thing off. George can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Trash","review":"This book is full of pure toxic venom which doesn't equate to humor. Sounds to me like George hates the world and life in general. Maybe some anger management therapy would help him to write a book that's a bit more positive, palatable, AND funny!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame!","review":"George carlin is no stranger to vulgar and crude language. What a disgusting thing to make fun of Jesus and The Last Supper. Walmart decided to NOT offer this. I dont recommend this unless you want a thrill and daily shock value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"George Carlin needs to have his mouth washed out with soap - perhaps his brain, too. I read as much of this offensive book as I could stand and then got up and threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just dont get it....","review":"This book was plain offensive...he should not write about a mans religion. The book was filled with immature jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"This book is a disgrace. The book is very offensive to my christian faith in Jesus Christ. Now, it is Carlin's right to write this book, but it is also my right to write a negative review about it and the right of book stores to make the decision to not carry the vulgar ignorant book. I find it very funny that after writing this book, Mr. Carlin admitted himself to drug rehab. Great decision, Mr. Carlin!!!!! Go to church at the same time. In response to the man's comment that all people opposed to this book are right wingers and christians, yes I am a Christian and very proud of it and yes I am a Republican, not a right wing republican, but a republican. I hope that you all had a very merry CHRISTmas. God bless. I am praying for you, Mr. Carlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Euphemistically speaking. . . .","review":"This is a book in which George Carlin manages to offend everyone who reads it, depending on their political preferences, how they feel about minorities, the handicapped, the homeless, the chronically ill, the elderly, etc, etc, etc. In other words, if you have an opinion about anything at all, he will manage to upset you at some point if you read this book.Having said that, this is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only is his take on life hilarious, he is more often than not right-on in his views on life and the way people live it. I think his views actually reflect the way the majority of people think about things, it's just that he's the only one with enough guts (read: balls) to actually put his feelings in print.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh - really, several hundred good laughs - and has a thick skin to go along with it. At some point pretty much every type of personality (even yours) is written about in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverent and funny","review":"While some people have banned this book--these are the same who ban Harry Potter--Carlin is one of the most astute political and language comedians of our time. He's the comedic Noam Chomsky--love him or hate him, he's powerful.My brother-in-law is reading this book and I read through it. I laughed out loud. Disagree with Carlin if you must (I do), but he's funnier and more tongue-in-cheek than Michael Moore, with the added advantage of not passing himself off as a beleaguered keeper of truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Carlin","review":"I don't know what the previous people are thinking giving this book only one star. Yes, Carlin talks about whatever he wants and uses vulgar language in the process. People should now this by now. Carlin has been doing this since the 1960s. Why buy the book if you don't like him going in? Although, I'm sure George doesn't care if people hate him and his book. One of his goals is probably to piss off as many people as possible. It looks like it's working :) If you're a fan of Carlin, you'll love this book. Buy it now, he's brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"great love opi","review":"I love opi products,this is a great neutral color.I have medium brown skin and this color looks great. Can't wait to buy more opi products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful color, under the right conditions","review":"This is one of my first neutral (I won't call it \\"nude,\\" because, well, not everyone has pink skin) nail polishes, and it does not disappoint. Overall, the shade is beautiful and easy to wear. Under certain lighting, it can appear on the brown side, while other times it appears more pink. It depends on your skin tone, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Pinky Neutral","review":"This color is so pretty, it is a great neutral rosy pink color. Coverage on this is great as well, very opaque!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great jacket","review":"Quality, tough and my husband loves it. He has had Carhartt products before, so this was an easy choice to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made in the U.S.A.","review":"A great jacket when it was made in the USA. All of Carhartt's products are no longer union made in the USA. This warm jacket, now leaves U.S. worker's out in the cold. I love Carhartt but how can we support a company that does not support us, like so many others. Fewer jobs here ='s high unemployment and low wages. Do not buy Carhartt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that is actually written by the artist performing it.","review":"I first learnt of Sherri JAckson when she opened for Rusted Root at a concert they gave at my town. While I was listening to her I was really becoming in tune with her music. I had the chance to meet her after her set. I had her autograph my cd and I still have it nearly 13 years later. I love to listen to this cd, and one of the things that I like best about this is that it is music that is actually written by the person who is performing it. Not only that it is actually GOOD! I love Sadey and Distant Blue is one of my most favorite songs. It is what I dub a \\"feel good song\\". Listen to the words and you will understand what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"The music on this CD is great to help you go from the workday world to a peaceful world of great sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed in Punchlist Manager","review":"This product is a great tool for tracking warranty issues! The customer service you will receive from John Radi and the Service Software team is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Sci-Fi that doesn't take itselt too seriously.","review":"Book two in Sten series and I am craving more. The first book set up our main character and trained him. Wolf Worlds lets him do his thing. The authors create a really interesting challenge for Sten as he gets to defuse a conflict between some sects of a religious group. These folks just happen to live right in the way of a new mineral that the Empire needs.So, Sten gets to go without use the tools that his Mantis Section training has given him. Instead he has to be a bit creative to keep the mission moving in the right way, but without all of the support he might have grown used to.I like the story, but I really like Sten. He remains a somewhat conflicted hero who isn't comfortable with every decision he has to make nor is he guaranteed to succeed at everything he tries. Things work out, but there are bumps in the road that threaten the mission. It's good stuff and worth buying from someone used."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cd of one of the best!","review":"Just as advertised, new and in new condition when it arrived. Have played it twice and and very satisfied! Would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Had borrowed this cd from my daddy and misplaced it....Oooops....So i ordered him one for Christmas!!! We absolutely love this cd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trip back in time","review":"I finally got a copy of Jack's book. I grew up in Forest Park, the same home town as the author's, and was in eastern II Corp in 69. When I started reading the book, I could smell the Jungle! I was stationed with an artillery group and did not have the misfortune of humping and SRPs in the jungle as Jack did. As a matter of fact, except for that, I practically followed in Jack's footsteps: Ft Polk, Camh Rahn Bay and II Corp. This book brought back the tragic irony of being in a tropical paradise during a war that came from the dredges of hell. The long periods of tedious, oppressive boredom punctuated with explosive moments of terror. It changed my life, as many others. If you've got the guts, go for a walk in the highlands with Jack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long-Awaited Third Volume","review":"It's hard for me to review this book fairly, given that I waited about thirty years to read it! I loved Anderson's Affair of the Mutilated Mink, and kept an eye out for a sequel for many years... but I gave up long before 2006, when the third book was finally published. (I have a feeling it was written back in the day, but rejected by the publisher for some reason.)Anyway, I'm glad I found it, and it's delightful. Our third visit to Adderley seems a little less fresh than the first two books, maybe, and as other reviewers have noted, the murderer is pretty easy to spot. So four stars instead of five, but this is a charming and clever pastiche. Still highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loved it!","review":"My wife loves crime mysteries. (She introduced me to Agatha Christie, Dorothy L Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, etc.) She also travels a lot, and that means she always has a book or two with her. I bought three books by James Anderson, including The Affair of the 39 Cufflinks, and she loved them all. She said that it gave her the \\"escapism\\" she needed.Why am I writing this review instead of her? It's because she's traveling, reading, or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This CD takes you back to a time where artist could actually sing. These are songs that I grew up on.

Running my hand across it, the material did not feel smooth and silky at all. It almost felt like plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like your highschool graduation gown.","review":"Before I bought this product, I read all the reveiws about how everyone hated the gown, how it was uncomfortable, and how confusing it was to tie in the back but I figured that everyone was being too picky for the price. That is, until I recieved it and now I understand what everyone else was talking about. The dress feels like you're wearing a highschool graduation gown that is too small on you, and I even ordered a size larger than my actual size and it was still tight. The fabric is unattractive, and is just mess of wrinkles. The only positive thing I would say is that the robe is alright, but if you're looking for a cheap sexy sleep outfit, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks and feels cheap","review":"This is a classic case of getting what you pay for.

The babydoll itself is made of a cheap, terrible material and has ties in the back that are awkward and you would need your lover to help you put it on to begin with. Not flattering and not sexy.

Just don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"My first impression was how bold the color was, so far so good. But upon touching the material my positive impression ended. The material feels horrible. I guess you get what you pay for? I couldn't imagine that material against my skin. Secondly, the back of the nighty has this weird cross around tie thing (notice there are no pictures of the back here on Amazon?), which does make it adjustable but I thought it looked odd. In addition to that in the middle of the back on the lower back there's another tie which seems might be nice for fuller figured women but it just looks so odd.

However, the product is less than satidfactory. The robe is oversized, and i mean HUGE. I ordered this in a large and the robe is at least a 2x. It sags and hangs everywhere on me. Plus the fabric is so wrinkly that not even the iron would press out the large wrinkles. The material is thin and flimsy and is only one sided, so while the outside has a nice, soft satin appearance, the inside feels like sandpaper against my skin. The little tea-towel that came with it is impossible to wear. I'm a smaller woman with large breasts (36DD) and I ordered a large to accomodate for that, however, this thing squishes my boobs and gaps bigtime at the underarm area. Then there are two awkward sets of ties on the back. Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor fit","review":"Would not purchase again the sizing chart is off.

The robe is nice, no complaints with that, which is the only reason why I didn't give it one star. The babydoll on the other hand... I still have not figured out how to tie it in the back. I have purchased plenty of such items in the past, so I assumed the previous posters just did not have a clue. Wow, I was wrong and the one without a clue. This item is confusing and still sitting unused in my drawer. It would have been nice if there was atleast a picture posted somewhere so that I can try to figure this out, but there is not. I bought this as a Valentines nighty, but gave up on it and bought another item from the store that I used the black robe with instead. It is a shame that so far, it has been wasted.

Also the shape is very awkward. AND the straps of the thing are difficult to handle and create unflattering lines.

I'm not at all a soccer fan and was afraid I'd find it boring -- or poorly written, given the author's young age. But Leah Lauber won me over by the second page! Her fresh voice, enthusiasm for the subject matter, and beyond-her-years writing skills make Soccer Dreams a pleasure to read. I was hooked by her chutzpah in dreaming big dreams and finding ways to make them come true. And I learned a lot about the sport and the women who play it. Lauber's book gave me a new respect for these outstanding athletes, not just for their prowess on the soccer field but for their character, loyalty, and sense of teamwork and camaraderie off it. Lauber's journey covers not only her trek across the country to follow the team through the realization of its dreams, but her own increasing skill and confidence as a writer. I expect we'll see more great things from this talented young author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!

Julie Fouty, Mia Hamm, Shannon McMillan, Brandy Chastain (of the winning score, rip-the-shirt-off fame)- they're all here in photographs you won't see anywhere else.This well-produced book, admittedly a family effort, gives credence to the value of self-publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book but...","review":"The hardcover edition of this is cheaper than the Kindle edition!!!!!!

I prefer cleaner, more subtle decorations for Christmas. However, the book and Radko's creations are great eye candy.The text is more general advice on christmas decorating and not specific instructions. It has a few sidelines though with useful checklists, like candle safety, types of christmas trees and other evergreens to use for decorating etc.So, if you are like me and you only want to look, get this book, it has beautiful pictures.

I live in New Mexico and so frequently authors fail to hit the mark by over-romanticizing the location and its people, but Samuel (O'Neal) is obviously one of us.

Of course a restraining order is only paper and thus fails to stop him in any way for long. She goes to prison and asks her husband's cousin, Ramon, to raise the child. Great choice and the guy turns out to be a Prince!!! He raises Tonio as his son along with running the Last Chance Ranch.Tonio's discovery that'Tanya' is his mother ends the book on a good feeling.

The book has alot of information, but it is hard to find the information when you need it, the text is usually quite boring, the maps are of very little use, and the book all in all looks dull.There is one exeption though, the boxed texts can sometimes be very useful and even written with some charm. The first day I was in Rome LP's Rome followed me in my backpack, but in the evening I took it out - it was of no use when I wandered around, and I had several books so much more interesting and helpful.I really hope the next edition of the book will be better, knowing other LP books I will give it another chance.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality is great...

I learned a lot of interesting about the history behind many of present medical practices. Some topics covered are medications, surgeries, and their side effects, fraudulent billing practices, negligent doctors, and unethical procedures and practices.This book is extremely sensational.

There are also hundreds of grammar errors and typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!","review":"This book is a horribly inaccurate collection of stories. I found several mistakes well beyond just \\"typos\\". For example, the authors describe a normal sleep stage (Rapid eye movement sleep) as abnormal and causing \\"suffering\\" in patients. The case of Phineas Gage (p. 215) is also mistakenly described. The authors take advantage of the fact that most people have not taken a course in neuroanatomy or basic physiology to advance their agenda.

Topics covered include politics, economics, education, migration, and health.

Their authors, writing in the early 1990's, foresaw many of the trends and problems that loom even larger today. On the other hand, some material now seems dated, particularly the assumption that it would be the Mexican left that would be the most important challenge to PRI dominance.

Most of the stories reach trite conclusions and plod along. Besides the exotic locale---the former Yugoslavia---most of the people are dull. The recent ethnic conflicts serve as a constant subtext, but is never addressed successfully. The few gems in the book (\\"The Address\\", \\"Petrol and Chocolate\\", and \\"The Eye of God\\") display a charming sense of cultural displacement and near surreal occurences, where American culture serves as a common denominator and everyone dreams of heading West. But these gems are few and far between. Most of the work is safe and unchallenging, the types of stories literary journals love (most of the pieces appeared in respected little magazines). It's interesting that English isn't Novakovich's native language. Whereas Nabokov stretched and revealed English, Novakovich has a more subtle approach that's unengaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biscantorat, Sinead O'Connor and the Monks Of Glenstal Abbey","review":"Sinead O'Connors haunting singing voice accompanied by the Monks of Glenstal Abbey, Co.Cork, Ireland fully desreves an appreciative audience.

The relaxed feeling stays with me throughout the day. That's nice. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect to learn as you go for beginners.","review":"I am just beginning my yoga pratice and found this book to be all that I expected. Cleary and simply written teaching the basic poses in order in the first half of the book, the intermediate poses in the second half of the book. As an athlete and cycling coach this an instruction book par excellence. I give it the ultimate recommendation - 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for beginners by beginners?","review":"There is some decent information in this book and ya, the spiral binder is handy. However, the photographs clearly show that these instructors don't have an understanding of asana other than just \\"put your body into a position\\" and call it good. Engagement, alignment, drawing in, and lengthening are vital to getting the most from asana, even for beginners, and clearly is missing in the photographs of these poses. Tara Fraser has done some nice beginner books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second review above is obviously fake.","review":"I hate it when the review mechanism is used as advertising space by vendors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement","review":"An item just right to replace the damaged plunger for my Waring 11JE38 Juice Extractor.

( Waring lists this catalog number as fitting this machine in its parts catalog as well -it doesn't.) Its not too good getting plastic in your vegetable juice. Even with care to avoid pushing the plunger in to the hilt, one doesn't always remember that its too long. Sooner or later-in this case much too soon, the bottom breaks off rendering the plunger useless, and ending up giving you a vegetable and plastic juice cocktail. We hope that it was food grade plastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin canvas","review":"The shoe rack's canvas is thinner and not as sturdy as a similar shoe rack I bought at Linens and Things a few years back.

About the only thing that fits easily into each pocket is a pair of flip-flops. Even if I put only one shoe in each pocket, the pocket isn't wide enough to easily slide in my shoes.The rack itself is nice though. Good construction, sturdy, etc. My only gripe is the sizing of the pockets. I wish I hadn't spent the money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I was really looking forward to getting the shoes off the floor of my closet.

Anyone who has a silpat is familiar with the spongy grids inside the mat. This mat has those grids also, and therefore it leaves a grid pattern on the mat side of any fondant you roll.

A little powder goes a long way. I used one heaping teaspoonful and it made a GALLON with powder floating on the bottom which means one level teaspoonful should be adequate.

If you like music that is powerful, driven by true emotion, or god forbid just plain SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS ORIGINAL then look elsewhere. Now that their hack singer has finally made a name for himself as a semi celebrity (via a vomit inducing reality TV show) people are now talking about that band as if they were ever a big deal. They had a moderate following, I'll even go as far as to say an respected following for a local band (from Lansing mind you, not exactly New York or Chicago people), but they really didn't accomplish much.

Dave and Barb are the best male/female duo since Black Francis and Kim Deal sang for The Pixies.I like the CD a lot because there are so many good songs. What makes it even better is the variety among the songs. HOLS definitely doesn't take the cookie cutter approach to making music.

I was able to limp through the last job by holding the blade to keep it from closing while using it.I purchased a second identical unit from a different store and had the exact same thing happen again also in fewer than 10 uses.

I can't fit stuff for my other kids in here, but it works well for just the baby stuff, like a change of clothes, some diapers, a blankie, and wipes. My clutch fits in just fine and some snacks.

I've seen it many times and never get tired of it.Joan Crawford, Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery are all delightful in a love triangle that leads Crawford from Montgomery (who leaves her at the altar, then tries to get her back) to Gable, with many laughs along the way. Billie Burke, Charles Butterworth, and Rosalind Russell also contribute to the hilarity with their share of zingers in smaller roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film!","review":"this is a great film and well worth seeing.

Attempts to avoid the pain of sorrow, disappointing relationships, or conflicts rob us of the experience of our true humanness. In reality, these circumstances can push us on to a deeper awareness of our dependency on God, which in turn frees us to love ourselves and others as fallen, not-yet-glorified human beings. Though the book is intended to assist counselors and others who facilitate change in others, it also offers many insights for anyone who is seriously interested in understanding human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep","review":"Larry Crabb is my favorite author.

As a result, reading this book to my son will have to wait until he is older.

It was just very boring. I expected more organized research, with interesting hypotheses or at least organized conclusions.

The author seems like a really nice guy ... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting to anyone interested in animal behavior.","review":"As an animal behaviorist, I am fascinated by his study of these extremely intelligent birds. Since he is a professional in this field, I recognize what he does to keep his credibility as a scientist, trying not to argue beyond the data. But I most enjoyed the book in the places where he says that this is simply his opinion without sufficient statistical data to make a scientific case.

A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivoting & Compelling","review":"From the first page to the last, I could not put this book down. Daring subject matter is often overlooked or not dealt with on a realistic level, avoided both by readers and writers. This story was compelling in its description of child abuse and the effects, the shattered childhoods, trying to keep it all together in adulthood. This book is not for the faint of heart and some situations are described in quite a graphic in nature, but this all lends itself to the truth. What a powerful, moving, altering story...you cannot help but be affected by it. Darnella Ford has the courage and strength to firmly grip evil while describing to all of us the torture and pain a child experiences and re-lives after being sexually abused."},{"rating":"2","title":"The long journey back to innocence. A Survivor's tribute.","review":"In \\"Rising\\" Darnella ford masterfully weaves enthralling prose, tumultuous story, and dark psychology into a most tangible piece of artwork. The 3-dimensional aspect of her tale allows the reader to not only \\"be\\" in the moment with the leading character, Symone, but also permits the reader to \\"feel\\" their way through the journey of survival alongside her as well. The more gentle reader may find this re-hashing effect to be too shocking, but victims of abuse (as well as readers who wish to learn more about the experiences of childhood trauma)will certainly find a safe haven to explore their pasts and continue the path towards healing. Although the story is entertaining in its vivid imagery, skillful detail, and sincere meaning, let us not forget the focus of the piece. It is an acknowledgement and tribute to the \\"survivor\\". An embracing of the resilient child within us all.

I couldn't believe how her words made me feel as if what was happening to her main character was happening to me.I recommend this book to anyone who has overcome a tragedy of any kind, whether it be from a stranger or a family member.

The reader can also detect the maturity and 'lessons-learned' from this and the following books. Truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction and Anne LaBastille lets her feelings and emotional experience permeate every chapter. One can actually feel the authors' growth, love and anxiety of her life experiences in every chapter. This is just the first of many wonderful stories that Dr. LaBastille gives the world. You will read it again and again, just to experience what it is like to do what you REALLY want to do when you put your mind to it.

The video shows he's enjoying his life and singing. His happiness spreads to me from him while I'm watching this video. However, in terms of music, this DVD is bad because of 2 reasons. First, the music and singing are drowned out by the shouting of the audience. For example, I can hardly hear he sing and the music in the first song \\"Cheese burger in paradise\\". Ironically, I bought this DVD after listening to that song on a CD which was recorded in a studio, not in a live show. The main purpose that I bought this is to enjoy the music not just to watch the picture. Secondly, after the first two songs, I found most of them sound very much like each other. Consequently, I became bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound hunter","review":"the sound is great on this songs are in 5.1 picture is great these songs are from different concerts. this is more enjoyable then Live at Wrigley Field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album.

I enjoyed reading this book for enjoyment purposes only. Dr. Ladson-Billings talked about her subject indeed. But I have to disagree with her when she talks about teaching African American children in a different way. First of all it would make them think that they (we) are always supposed to be treated in a \\"different\\" manner and secondly where would this exist? Utopia!! If we stop separating children, then maybe our problems will get solved. But, trying to teach one group this way and another group another way only creates problems for students as well as teachers. Furthermore, where will we find this PERFECT teacher? We are becoming a melting pot and therefore strategies for teaching one set of people one way will soon become obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was okay I didn't follow along that well","review":"I thought the book was a little rough on white teachers and it was bias in some ways.

From a linguistic standpoint, Shirley Brice Heath's book \\"Ways With Words\\" is much more effective. Ladson-Billings glosses over the differences between African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Standard American English (SAE). There are vital distinctions between these that are important for any teacher of either dialect to understand! Heath's book is much more comphrehensive regarding both AAVE and SAE and even teaching in a classroom where both are spoken. I heartily recommend Heath; you can take or leave Ladson-Billings and I prefer to leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy buyer!","review":"Again, all the books I bought through Amazon.com were in great condition or as stated on the website.

Ladson-Billings' book, Dreamkeepers, is lacking profound impact to the way we think about education and the problems faced in meeting the problems of the minority population of African-Ameican students. It is missing sufficient, current research to support causes and solutions to the achievement gap between African-American students and all other students. Frank, honest dialogue is needed to change the outcomes of the black population. Her book is just more lip service to examples of good teaching that are obvious to most educators. It is neither helpful nor thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling glimpses at successful teaching","review":"Ladson-Billings offers her readers the challenge to change teaching practices to be more culturally sensitive to individual student's needs, particularly of African American students.

Or Serious Joke?","review":"Having spent a great amount of years carrying out surveillance both for the government and in the Private sector, I can honestly say that this book has to be one of the worst I've ever read on the subject.As someone else said, it should be entitled \\"How to Equip a Surveillance Van\\". It tells practically nothing about anything else - no real tactics (unless you include \\"blasting through a red light!\\") - and is of no benefit at all to a new surveillance operative. It will more than likely get you compromised, and also fired if you use the shoddy outdated report format the author suggests!The book is in dire need of an update - but even then, unless the content changes dramatically, it would still be of no use. In my opinion, the best book on the market at the moment is \\"Advanced Surveillance\\" by Peter Jenkins - even old hands can learn a trick or two from it.

Stephanie inspired me with her humor and easy to follow instructions! However, I have one observation. I made her no-pattern hat out of a lovely soft bulky tweed and used her measuring techniques. When finished, the hat fit my head but was not snug at all. It seems to me if you have a 22-inch head, you would want a hat somewhat smaller to stretch over your head and fit snuggly (especially a knit hat meant to keep you warm!). After some trial and error I completed a lovely rolled edge hat and gave it to my mother to enjoy and it fits her perfectly. After a month of knitting this was my first completed project! Stephanie Pearl-McPhee is an inspiration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and useful","review":"This is a very humorous book with helpful guidelines for making various items, most notably socks.

I had no interest in knitting socks or fine gauge items. But the Yarn Harlot beguiled me with her seductive descriptions of the joys of hand-knit socks, so I have rushed out and purchased miniscule needles and fine gauge yarn and struggled with the sorrows of starting my first sock six times before finally making a go of it. I hate to rip out, but she freed me to feel like I can. Now, I am hooked...not because I've got a sock done yet, mind you...but because it truly is satisfying to watch these fine pieces emerge from my needles. Now I am looking for opportunities to knit in the round (sweater bodies, sleeves...) because of the Yarn Harlot's siren call. This is a fun, breezy read, and will light a fire under your knitting self to break out into new types of projects and not to fear mistakes and to try new things. I liked this book a lot! It is practical and useful, and empowered me to believe I could do anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorously Helpful!","review":"There's nothing I like better than truly helpful lists and hints unless it is those same lists and hints dished up with a generous sense of humor.

So if you want a handy dandy list of typical head sizes or typical foot lengths (the kind of valuable info provided) topped off with WHO wears WHAT hats and WHY, you will love this book. The basics are addressed here, along with some fine points and finer observations that will have you consulting this book again and again. And if you want to relax and really enjoy your knitting - or your stash or your knitting thoughts (guilt-free) - get this book just to read for fun. It works either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and practical","review":"I liked how she takes the seriousness out of knitting and makes it sound fun, easy and addicting--which it is. The book is full of practical tips, things to watch out for and excuses for things that don't turn out the way we meant them.

Each time I feel as if I'm about to go 'round the bend in knitting or buying knitting supplies, or hating to swatch, or hating a particular project, I read sections of the book that apply, and I'm back to feeling completely normal. It reminds the knitter that we knit because we enjoy it, so we need to stop treating it like a bad job when we get frustrated.

I have nothing against the author, but as a new knitter I want to learn how to knit. I do NOT want to become a knit evangelist nor a neurotic yarn stasher.

Reviews that and written from friends and are not impartial are plaguing amazon lately and i am very sad to see that phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"This book is not quite what I expected. The nutritional information I hoped to find is either not there or too hard to find. The back index doesn't show what I needed to find. I am sure the doctor who wrote this book did a very good job, but it was more clinical than I had hoped. I did receive it when it was promised, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Orleans Blues/Rock Band Sound","review":"The Radiators have been around the music scene for quite a few years, but this collection of very energetic R&B tunes is very fresh and upbeat. It has that crisp driving sound that draws the listener to meditate on the lyrics and appriciate the rhythmic instrumental solos. If you are a fan of \\"southern blues\\", you need to give this album a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"What a great find. I was not aware of this band until a recent trip to Key West. We were on a catamaran out snorkeling. The captain was playing some XM radio channel and the Radiators came on - Love 'em. Sorry they are now defunct...but the music is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Reggae at it's finest-A super star lineup-","review":"This album is a magnificent display of live reggae. It features most of the classic reggae bands alive and performing today. It features live burning spear, perhaps the best live recording ever- The brass is tremendous, while there are several early tracks and one rare one at the end. Winston Rodney's voice is electrifying. It also features an astonishing version of The Skatalite's Guns of Navarone. It is truly great to hear these reggae musicians because as they get older, the chance to hear them live is dwindling. Perhaps a little of that live magic is caught on tape in this album. Check into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash and poor playing out of tune","review":"If they gave away prizes for the poorest this one would surely be the winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spectacular Play","review":"\\"A Long March to Jerusalem\\" is a play which details a tragic historic event of which we know very little. This is of course the story of the childrens crusade of year 1212. Don Taylor fills in the many historical gaps with colorful characters and amazing settings. This is a wonderful play for children to perform, as most characters are children. The adult characters are overwhelmingly extreme. King Phillip Augustus is old, weary, wise and cynical. The villain, William the Pig, is totally EVIL. In general, I find this play to be philosophical, thought-provoking and very inspiring. Whoever loves to read plays will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Table and Chairs","review":"Rainbow was very easy to work with. I asked for a special order with a different set of chairs to go with the table, and they did with no extra charge. The product was shipped quickly and the quality is excellent. I am very pleased with the table and chairs, it is perfect for my small dining room. I would definitely do business again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Seller to Work With","review":"I had an issue with a dent in the table I purchased. I contacted the Seller and they submitted a claim to Fedex which was denied because I threw away the packaging. Unfortunately, I am now stuck with a brand new table and a flaw. On the upside, the seller decided to refund half of their profit for the inconvenience and gave me the benefit of the doubt. Since they came up with a good resolution, I would definitely refer anyone to them and do repeat business. The table is nice but it is smaller than I expected. If you are looking for quaint seating, this a good set. You definitely can't beat the price. Freight is a different story but that is to be expected.-KristinaRecent Customer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quacky","review":"Quacky is the main character. He is a kid and also an orphan. He somehow winds up on a tv show. He really wants to live with his aunt Maggie. They meet two criminals who are actually very nice. I kind of felt bad for Quacky because he had a horrible life. This is a quick, short, fun book that is just for reading when you can't find a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product. Quite satisfied.","review":"I bought this tray for my Ikea Galant desk because the tray available through Ikea was pretty flimsy. This tray is sturdy, smooth, and accommodates my over sized keyboard, a mouse pad and mouse extremely well. It's a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for with this tray. It's made for a Bush desk, and the hardware that comes with it is meant for the pre drilled holes in their desks. A quick trip to the hardware store for some replacement screws, a power drill, and about 15 minutes was all it took to fix it to the underside of my desk like it was made for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more sturdy than the rest","review":"Most of the keyboard trays I looked at were really junky.

A thorough and detailed reference on VoiceXML and voice application development. I wish authors had put VoiceXML 2.0 reference on some website (though examples are available on the CD). Also liked the tips throughout the book on VUI. It is the most important aspect of voice application development and the authors kept emphasizing that through the entire book with examples. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"This book is an excellent resource for a VoiceXML developer. It covers a wide range of topics in detail and has some excellent VUI design tips. I love the cross reference of voice technology companies and the services that they provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Flavor","review":"Just tried this item and found it lacking in flavor and oil.

Both times, the blue display light conked out about 3 months into use. I did not have the unit on more than a few hours a day so it couldn't be burn out. Additionally, the second unit I bought has a horrible FM transmitter in it. It barely transmits in my car (I use an output device that goes into my tape deck for clear reception) and does not allow me to listen to Sirius on other radios in my house like the old one did. I called Sirius about this and they said they had to adjust all the units because the FCC came down on them. But I wasn't told that beforehand! Anyway, you'd probably be better off with another unit for Sirius. As for the programming, I cannot say enough positive thngs about Sirius. It is WELL worth the 13 bucks a month. I never listen to regular radio anymore. And I barely have a need to listen to CDs in my car anymore. In short, buy Sirius but not the Streamer Replay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ended in true Deathstaklker style","review":"In the last book of this wonderful series, Green gives it his all in my opinion. Every charactor has their moment of glory and each follows through that development that was slated from the beginning. It may be argued that the series was intended to be over after the third, but I say the story would have been nowhere near over. Each charactor has something to learn, something to do. Each one has their desitiny to find. This book ended with a turn of plot so right, yet so frustrating, that I have been forcing people to read the series just so I could discuss it with them. In short, this is Green's best since Blue Moon Rising, maybe even better, when taken as a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely wrong...","review":"The fifth book in the deathstalker series is very unpleasant end to a great series. For anyone thinking of reading this book, I would highly recommend stopping before the last 10-15 pages of the book. Believe me... you really don't want to know. These last pages are exactly what you don't want to be reading about the characters you have gone through 4 books with! A disgusting end to a wonderful series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money..","review":"This series of books could do with a lot of editing....

They all went through the Madness Maze together, so they are bound to be alike (see Deathstalker Rebellion p. 239 I think). If you're talking about the other major players of the rebellion (i.e. Finlay Campbell), then take into consideration the type of environment that they are brought up in. And bad things are always happening to the characters, it's just that they are tough enough to overcome almost anything thrown against them. Other than that, if the next book doesn't come out soon I think I'll call on a psi-storm, go on the rampage with a mono-filament edge in each hand, and wear a shirt bearing the legend \\"Born To Burn\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader Snored","review":"This was an enormously disappointing, jingoistic, mass market human interest biography from which I learned little about the Fed and monetary policy, but from which I learned a great deal about the author's commitment to pseudo-intellectual, hyper-libertarianism and what passes for serious literature in the U.S. mass market. Pass on this unless you want an invitation to worship at the grave of Ayn Rand. You could log into a right wing blog and get the same stuff for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Schaum's?","review":"As a graduate student in physics, I have collected many Schuam's Outlines over the years and usually find them very helpful. This one was not up to par. The derivations and example problems were very wordy and skipped over half the mathematical details - one problem I did from the book required eleven steps when I was finished and the book showed three. Some chapters had only a few worked example problems and dozens that are given simply \\"as an exercise to the reader.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, this is NOT a Schaum's.","review":"I have used Schaums outlines to help with several subjects in Engineering and Physics. This book was printed in 1967.

Way too difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"The seller shipped this item quickly to me -- no problems there. My problem is with the quality of the candle. First off, even though it looks larger, the candle is incredibly small. Make note it is only 3 inches -- perfect for a cupcake topper, not a cake topper. Second, the quality is poor. The paint on the candle was scratched off in quite a few different areas. Third, the characters do not look identical to the trademark Sesame Street characters (more like a \\"knock-off\\"). Yes, they do look like Sesame Street, but there are slight differences.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I will not be using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Ridley","review":"This CD includes the best of the classic songs of the late 50's and early 60's music.

It has great plot, some interesting characters, and a surprise ending that I didn't guess! I'm usually pretty good at guessing the whodunnit and the so-called twists in the books, but in this case I was surprised. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whale Song","review":"Whalesong is an adventurous book. The best chapter is chapter 10. I think they should have had more chapters with Hruna and the pod. I liked the part where Hralekana sacrificed himself for the pod. I also like how it was told from the point of view from Hruna. I liked Hruna's lonely cruise. That was an interesting part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whalesong","review":"Whalesong was an outstanding book and I enjoyed reading it. It was very exciting in some chapters like chapter 10. Also the words were very descriptive. I think that Robert Siegel wrote the story very well and I like how Hruna is always on a different adventure. He made me feel like I was the whale in the story. Also it told me some new facts about humpback whales! It also taught me some new vocabulary. Whalesong is a fantastic book and I totally recommend it to anyone who likes to read about whales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whalesong","review":"One thing that I loved about this book was that it was very interesting.

Most of the parts were dull but some were exciting. This book was also very short. I would not recommend this book to older readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whalesong","review":"A very unsuspensful book. I didn't like how the whales knew so much and at the same time didn't ex: they knew what ice was and didn't know what a boat was. I also didn't like how the author made imagery and you didn't know what the object was that he was talking about. I also didn't like the story and the plot. You could also tell what was going to happen next. The book was about a calf who has many adventures, then he gets older and leads the pod."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"I'm in sixth grade my teacher read this book Whalesong for a read aloud book. This book was great ! There was a lot of good details, and this book is very touching. Right when you read the first sentence of this book, you will be a humpback whale called Hruna. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whalesong","review":"I think that the book Whalesong was a pretty good book. The only bad thing about it is that it was sometimes predictable and it was also sometimes hard to figure out what certain objects were because of the way that the author described it. But generally, the book was very good and enjoyable to read. It was basically about this whale, Hruna, telling about his his life story and all his adventures he had. The way Robert Siegel writes is like magic; each chapter a new adventure, taking you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whalesong","review":"I read Whalesong. I really didnt like it. It was boring me. The only parts I liked were the dangerous ones. It was not really an action book though. Robert Siegel is good with imagery but not with his writing skills. I wouldn't recomend this book to people because I think Robert Siegal went a little to far with the whalers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WhaleSong Book","review":"I didn't think the book Whalesong was good. I would of thought that there would be more action in a whale's life, more encounters with sharks, or maybe one of his dolphin friends fight a shark. I think Hruna should have met a human and become friends with him. The only exciting part was when Hruna saved everyone from the lagoon and when they escaped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical, beautifully written story","review":"It is rare that an author writes a book from the perspective of a non-human animal that actually makes you feel as if THIS IS THE ANIMAL TALKING. The world of the whales is spun around us, in a magical, unforgettable tale. I felt as though I was really there, swimming with the whales. More non-human animals need their experiences expressed- and literature may be the best way. YOU- YES, YOU- MUST READ THIS BOOK. Even for those who simply wish to enjoy faultless literature, this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whalesong","review":"I think that this book was very touching and you can see what it is like to be a whale.

The representative barely spoke English and didn't respond well to my requests but kept telling me to take the product apart. I had to purchase new belts and the product is still not functioning properly after several hours of time spent trying to \\"fix\\" this lemon. I previously owned a hover that out performed this unit. Instead of tring to save a hundred dollars by purchasing this \\"cheap hunk of junk\\" my next purchase will be a hover.

The cleaner spray DID NOT WORK, and got up a very nice sweat pushing a heavy, useless carpet cleaner around with water spills all over the floor. I went to look at the user manual, and to my shock, Bissell sent an owners manual for an upright vacuum cleaner! Went to the web, took apart the key areas, looked at trouble shooting section and there was no way the spryer is going to work! So.... it now lies waiting for the garbage pick up eventually on its way to a LANDFILL. This company makes an inferior product and with all the bad machines contributes to landfill pollution which is bad for our ecology!!

Except for leaking the cleaning solution when parked, it seemed to be working fine. Then one year later (just out of warranty) I'm using the hand tool to clean my car and the pump stops working. I'm a mechanic so I take it apart to see if it's fixable. A new pump cost me $29.95 plus shipping and about an hour to repair. So now comes the reason that inspired me to write this. My machine worked for almost an hour before the pump motor burned up again. Again I was using the hand tool. It turns out that this little and I mean little motor just overheats when it has to push water and soap all the way to the hand tool.

Instead, they had us take the blasted machine to local fix-it guy, who took MONTHS to \\"fix\\" it. We took it home to find out that it still didn't work!

Basicly, with the clean water bag in the center of where the dirty water goes, you have a filthy mess when you try and empty it.

I have four dogs- I bought a hoover steam vac 1 month ago, you would not believe the dirt and grime that is coming up after three years of these horrible bissell units. Just spot cleaning and one unit lasted long enough to clean my entire carpet, ha but I just did the carpet with a HOOVER and it is unbelievable.

First it is really really heavy to move around. So heavy that by the time I am done using it I have blisters on my hands. Second, the tools leak the cleaning solution all down the hose and then makes everything very sticky, third it does not hold much clean water, fouth after only 4 months mine stopped working. First the brushes would no spin, so i figured out that the bands had popped off..fix that. Then It would not spit out the water and cleaning solution. Called Bissel and they walked me thru some stuff to try and finally they said they dont know whats wrong and I would have to send it to be fixed. So I tried some stuff on my own and fixed it for about 10 minutes. Then it wouldnt suck up the water. Finally after about and 2 hours I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 USES AND THE TRIGGER QUITS WORKING!","review":"Sounds like many many users have the same problem It's obviously a defective trigger!

However the problems started on the second use. The water stopped coming out and I had to take it in to get it fixed, of course that was not covered under any warranty. This was after hours of frustration trying to clean it, take it apart, etc. Trying to use it for third time today, again no water. Throwing it in the trash and going back to renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money - Breaks after warranty period","review":"Worked fairly well for about a year, then poof, it wouldn't release the formula. Tried everything suggested by Bissell, but nothing worked. Found YouTube videos talking about heating element and injectors clogging up. Painstakingly took it apart (big pain) and yep heating element clogged up with white goop. Cleaned and soaked all injectors in vinegar as suggested. Nope, still didn't work. Three hundred bucks down the drain. To fix it at shop would cost nearly as much as new one (prices have gone down) and shipping to manufacturer is a pain and expensive. Piece of junk...DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This unit worked reasonably well when I first bought it and we used it approximately 20 times to remove small carpet stains, but a few weeks past the manufacturers warranty period it stopped working, and we took it to an approved service center for repair. The unit was found to have a faulty water pump which was replaced, costing me about $120 in parts and labor and it worked fine. A year later after approximately 10 more uses and it's stopped working again, there is no water coming out which happened before. It's just not worth having it fixed this time when it will likely happen again soon, when I can use the money to buy a better and more reliable carpet cleaner. It's a shame Bissell used to known for quality products, but I will be buying a new unit from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"great until you store it","review":"It cleaned well but after it is stored it won't work. it seems everyone has a problem with it (check the internet) after it sits for a while- heater clogs, tubes clog. I have spent hours looking into those problems just to come to the conclusion that it may be the pump that went out. I would not buy this product again. The whole point in buying one is to have it there when you need it and not to have to rent. However, most people spend so much time unclogging or preventing clogs that it is not worth your time. You will either spend your time going to the store to rent a machine or spend your time disassembling your machine while you hope you can fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacing belts a nightmare","review":"After cleaning 3 rooms with the machine, one of the belts came off. After an hour of following instructions and trying to get the belt back on, I gave up. Two hands just aren't enough to hold both rollers in place and stretch the belt onto the sprockets on the bottom of the rollers. I had gotten the machine for free from a relative who had recently passed away who had never even taken it out of the box so I just threw it away. If I had paid money for it, I would probably still be trying to get the belt back on but life is just too short to spend that kind of time on such a frustrating task. I hope this review saves you from buying one and experiencing this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves water behind","review":"The 9200 cleans well enough, but if you have dogs then be prepared for the brushes and the intake area to be caked with dog hair. The bottom of the machine also gets wet dog hair all over it which then holds water and drips it all over the carpet once you turn the machine off. After every use there are drops of water left behind on the carpet from the wet dog hair and you have to turn the machine over and pull all that wet dog hair off the bottom and off the rollers. Not a pleasent job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing item/items","review":"Package was missing the most important part of the carpet cleaner...the whole front dome/cover was missing...I am very upset right now....I needed to clean my carpets before company comes on Christmas and that is impossible without this part/parts.

When I tried to use it a second time the best I got was a dribble of liquid. Customer Service sold me new parts. Still didn't work. Customer Service spent a lot of time troubleshooting via phone and were quite experienced in describing what to try. Still didn't work. So off to the professional service center it went. After 4 days of effort, and repeated calls to Customer Service trying everything from cleaning to replacing multiple parts I was told they CAN NOT FIX it. It's now sitting at the back of the shop for parts or trash. He told me he sees a LOT of these machines. They simply don't work most of the time and cannot be repaired. Bottom line - I spent over $200 for a machine that was used ONE TIME. Don't waster your money!!!PS: The machine was out of warranty by the time I went to use it a 2nd time. Frankly I'm glad I didn't go through the whole fix/replace process. In the end I'm sure I expect I'd still have a not-working machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design all around","review":"Never really worked well form the start. Occasionally leaked from \\"Tank in Tank\\" nozzle if not screwed in just right. Soap dispensing system needs to be flushed out after using. Leftover soap in machine turns to a hard paste and clogs all the little openings, if you buy this model familiarize yourself with how to remove the spray heads, and get a pack of pipecleaners. I thought the suction was acceptable until I got a Hoover F5915-900, then realized that it wasn't even close. The carpets would stay wet for a full 24 hours, the new machine gets them dry with half the effort in half the time. I begrudgingly stuck with the thing until the heater got plugged up with the soap and a replacement part was too much money to waste on this junk. Steer clear of this thing, and all others of it's design. It almost ended my marraige with the fights it caused. Our marriage counselor recomended the Hoover Spinbrush F5915-900 (almost half the price too) to heal our marraige and it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm taking it back","review":"Five years ago, we bought a Bissell ProHeat carpet cleaner, and we used the heck out of it. Over the years, I broke off parts, patched it back up, and it kept working. Finally, it bit the dust this fall I went out and bought the Model 9200 ProHeat 2x as a replacement. Let's just say this year's crop wasn't as good as the crop in 2003.It still cleans the carpet, but there are two crucial areas where this model falls short. First, there is no visual indicator to let you know it is still feeding water and/or solution. The old model also had a light to show you if you were pulling too fast or too slow.The new model doesn't seem to dry the carpet as well, and it seems like the water and solution run out faster than the old model.Looking over the market, it doesn't seem like there are as many models to choose from as there were five years ago.

I have had to put it in the shop several times and each time the repair person has said that all the cleaning solution crystalized and clogge the tubes. I am using the bissel carpet cleaner and dont understand how this can continue to happen.

I choose to go with a bissel this time because I think the brush assembly on bissel's will hold up better then they did on my hoover. The entire brush assembly on hoover was run by one tiny peg which quickly started to wear down and break. The bissel brushes are run with belts which are easily replaceable unlike the hoover peg which require the whole assembly to be replaced. The attachment holder for one of the accessory brushes that is located in the middle of the back compartment does not hold the brush very well but thats been my experience with every vacuum and carpet cleaner I've ever owned so it wasn't a big deal to me. It cleaned my carpet very well and I'm pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell 2X rocks!!","review":"I bought this product because my old Bissell carpet cleaner lasted 7 years. I figured with the Bissell name, I would probably be satsified with it. WOW!! I am blown away by the machine and it's results.Pros: Two brushes are definintely better than one. It puffed up my old carpet. It has simple design and is very easy to clean compared to the older models. It was a snap to assemble and fill with solution/water.Cons: It is hard to tell when the clean water bladder is full since all the dirty water surrounds the bladder when in use. If you bump the vacuum against a wall it does loose suction.Overall, this was a bargain. I am seeing results that I can only get when I have the professionals come out and clean.I thought that my old vacuum was really picking up the cat hair until I used this machine. It will ball up the hair that wasn't vacuumed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water stops coming out of sprayer and leaks","review":"I've owned this product for 1 day only, used it not even 20 minutes, heck actual \\"cleaning\\" time was only like 3 minutes tops... rest of it was messing around trying to figure out what the heck was wrong. It leaks water off the sides leaving ugly spots on your carpet and the sprayer only works for about 2 passes and stops. I couldn't even get 8 square feet of carpet clean. Took it apart, read the manual, cleaned it... triple checked everything. End result, this is a faulty machine with LOTS of problems, It's very heavy and hard to move also, and the handle is poorly made (thing brittle plastic) only 3 tiny screws connect it to the bottom body of the cleaner.

Well, this time all of the problems mentioned in other reviews happened to me too....clumps of fuzz and dirt all over the carpet......suction clogged, water wouldn't come out....In short this machine is going to the dump....One big waste of money.

Nuruddin Farah says that everything is political. What does the term political mean? I think it implies the dynamics between the ruler and the ruled. What we see as political writing today has essentially to do with the state. But even within the smaller segments of the state and the society, even within human consciousness, there is the ruler-ruled dichotomy. So everything is political. But the response to that is individual, characteristic of the human being, and hence personal. The political manifestation in the personal life of Askar is what the book is about. While it does this, it also maps the contours of the psyche of Askar in the most lucid and poetic manner possible. Farah is a Somali shaman who weaves the tale of Askar in the oral tradition of Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot rated due to installation difficulty","review":"I bought due to the reviews, but once I opened the package, I have no idea which side is the camera side and which is the scratch resistant.

Look at the company's web, no instruction to identify the side of the protector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what any Canon SD 200, 300, 400 or 500 needs","review":"The Canon SD series Elph cameras apparently have very fragile LCD displays. Mine cracked within the first 24 hours.After my camera was repaired I added the LCD Protector Model 104. This definitely will prevent anything from coming in contact with the LCD. Hopefully the camera will last a long while now.My main concerns were that the protector not be too thick, too thin and that it fit the LCD window. I'm happy with the product. It's stiff enough that it doesn't flex but thin enough so that it doesn't add too much bulk to the camera. And, most important, it fits the window perfectly.The protector is plastic and may eventually get scuffed. At least it's inexpensive and easy enough to install that I can afford to replace it. If I had known how well it's cut to match the camera I would have ordered two.The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that the edges are not beveled. A minor complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I had my doubts about applying an adhesive cover to my camera, but after hearing the horror stories of the Canon LCDs cracking, I decided to give it a try. 'da Protector exceeded every expectation that I had. It's easy to apply (only took a couple minutes) and fits securely without damaging your camera or LCD. I suppose there may be a potential dust problem because it rests on the frame surrounding the LCD, but I haven't experienced any problems yet (like I said earlier, it fits REALLY securely). It's thick enough to keep anything from puncturing the screen, and the scratch resistant side keeps the image clear (unlike other types of electronic cases). As stated by another reviewer, it would be nice if the sides were beveled, but it's really not that big of a deal.All in all, it's a great product, and I will continue to purchase them in the future; even for screens that are not notorious for cracking. For only $10, why not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful-may be poor quality","review":"I purchased this set when it was at a discount of around 40%.

Allen plays fast and loose with historical facts, casually tossing out flippant remarks and trying to pass himself off as knowledgeable, but he is more of a wise guy and his humor is best-suited to the junior high boys at the back of the schoolbus.Perhaps this book was meant to be understood as tongue-in-cheek; however, it comes across as ignorant.

NOT what I would want to see in a book about food. Absolutely revolting! That, coupled with the fact that the author couldn't be bothered to back up his often-incorrect information (to such an extreme degree that this book should be classified as fiction) makes this one worth skipping.If you do read this book, you may want to check the \\"facts\\" against other sources before relating any stories to other people, lest they make you look like a fool when you're proven wrong.

As a student of yoga and meditation for over 30 years, I have found many of her meditations in other popular books. Yet, she does not quote or acknowledge other people's work.This lack of honesty and arrogance is out of integrity for a professional writer who claims to teach meditation and spirtual values.

It's been a while since I read it, so I don't remember the titles of the two stories I liked, but they both got me feeling and thinking hard.One is about a lonely man who discoveres a new species of demi-humans while hanging out in a bar. It's freaky.The other is about a space station whose sole mission is to comfort and welcome back astronauts from their extremely taxing trips through an alternate dimension.These may sound like stupid themes, but Gibson really treats the subject matter well."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Burning Chrome is definitely a must. Gibson creates worlds that are just as real, if not more real, than our own, and excels at doing so. His work is dark as can be, and quite gruesome at times (I'm thinking a particular scene in Hinterlands), but is very thought-provoking. Several stories from this collection have made their way into film (Johnny Mnemonic, New Rose Hotel), though the celluloid versions just don't do the stories justice.Several of the stories here are collaborations, one with Bruce Sterling (the other giant of cyberpunk), one with John Shirley (another member of the early movement), and one with the more humanistic Michael Swanwick. Each of these has its own unique feel, though not one should be missed.Like all Gibson, this is a love it or hate it experience. If you like to think, you'll love it.

While under warranty, it's still a huge problem because the new one has to be installed again including the PVC mounted to it which is a real pain.

Eydie gives it her best, and her clear, romantic voice, just makes you feel to relax and hear the voice accompanied by the ballads of the guitar strumming. You will want to be in Love.

He should- he shares most of his parts (including the head) with G1 Inferno; therefore much of my review for Inferno also applies here. This isn't neccesarily a good thing. That means mostly plastic construction and flaky chrome. Grapple has an additional demerit in the fact that he replaces Inferno's tight, telescoping ladder with a crane that loosely moves in and out- meaning it just kind of hangs down in robot mode and does not keep its place in vehicle mode.

It's an okay action programmer but the video source is absolutely pathetic, the worst I've seen from Alpha which is saying quite a bit. It looks like it was recorded on VHS at EP speed off broadcast TV (probably from a UHF station that ran it at 3:00 am). Apparently Alpha has no minimum quality standards. They will release absolutely anything from any source if it's in the public domain. I don't expect perfection from this sort of material but I don't expect garbage either.

My mistake!!As for the movie, this is a typical B/C grade Hollywood filler meant for mild amusement before the big feature-or perhaps a Saturday matinee. The acting is okay but I think my initial disappointment of getting the 'wrong' movie still clouds my review. Production quality seems quite poor; may have been from a poor-quality transfer.

It had a lot of nice features. The bad part is that the watchband is very non-standard and I cannot get a replacement even from Casio. But for 15 bucks, which is what I paid for it, I cannot complain too much. My advice is to either buy a Casio watch with a standard band, which is what I replaced this one with, or if you love it just buy a new one, even if you could find the band it is probably the same price as the watch anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch bad band","review":"I bought this watch from Walmart in Sep 2004 and the band started to wear out around Jan 2008 and broke off in March 2008 so I got 3 + years of use for $16.00Casio markets the watch with a 10 year battery which is useless since you cant get a standard band to fit on it since this one uses a novel band with screws which I must admit is a lot easier to replace provided you can find one.

Great looking watch with all the functions I wanted. But the deal killer is the watch band. It is held in by screws and cannot be replaced by a generic watch band. You have to buy genuine Casio and it was $15 at eBay. So more cost effective to get a new W96H type watch. My watch band failed after 10 months while most Casios I have owned take 2-3 years for that to breakSo on to a new model. Just bought the W-800H-1AV which also has a 10 year battery but will take a generic replacement watch band so that when it fails I'll get a Velcro wrap around for it.First digital I ever bought was Casio 25 years ago.Then eight years ago I tried Timex Iron man and Expedition. I use diff functions a lot and doing this runs down the batteries quickly on these. Plus illumination takes too much juice. So now it is back to Casio and 10 year batteries.

It's size and writing style are right for someone in the throes of grief--simple and to the point.

Halfway through, you turn the book over and the second book is in the back. One deals with helping a man (or someone who deals with grief in a masculine way) and the other is for a man dealing with their own grief. It makes for a great read and highlights areas you may not have thought of for areas that a person needs to grieve the loss of.

Depending on how you play some picks will wear more unevenly but I have been very happy with these.So overall, \\"it's a pick\\", so aside from design (which I love the color and design/logo of Clayton), and personal preference when it comes to size and weight, it really comes down to the material in which I feel is top grade.

But this is nothing more than a demonstration, not something you can follow along unless you know how to watch your computer and do yoga at the same time. Where there is instruction it's mostly not in English and some sequences are just the students demonstrating without any instruction at all. To be fair, the title of this video makes it clear it's a demonstration, but as a die hard yoga fan desperate for an authentic yoga video, I was extremely disappointed that this really was not anything more than a visual demonstration. It is a great yoga practice and I would have definitely given this 5 stars if only I could follow along without having to look up from whatever position I'm in to see what to do next. It would have been nice if the instructor described the moves so I could actually do the yoga as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too helpful","review":"I read this book to help my daughter who is slightly overweight. I didn't even keep it in my library. If your child has an obesity problem, or if you just have no idea what healthy eating is this book will help you, but to be honest there were many times while reading it that I just had to say \\"duh!\\" I was looking for some insight beyond simple common sense. My family doesn't eat fast food three times a week and spend hours watching TV every day. If you have a child that seems to be active and eats a well balanced diet, but still is overweight I would not recommend you looking to this book for an answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"When I received this book I was a little overwhelmed because it is as thick as an average text book.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most sensible book for kids and even adults!","review":"This book offers a great plan, some really excellent recipes, and an exercise plan and guidance that your child will be willing to follow, without feeling deprived. My daughter was only slightly overweight and she loves many of the recipes, and I was even more suprised how much I enjoy them. We are pretty active, generally eat well, but she is not always with me. She was making some unhealthier choices at school and at her dad's house. She now has a better understanding of the relationship between exercise, eating and healthy weight. She has always been confident, but is even happier with her lean body. And since she has a healthier mindset, it is easier for her to maintain. We geared our exercise towards the activities she likes best, so it was fun for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost my book","review":"My son and I read this book a few years ago and he lost about 6 pounds.

I wanted to cry with joy when it arrived. It's not at all soft but neither are real sloths. The baby does not separate from the mother but that is also okay with me. There is not even a way to seam rip them apart that I can see. The three toes' claws are pretty hard. I might not give this to a very small child but it's great for adults or at least a kid over 7?

BUT, a -great- deal of what is promoted as an advantage is really only an advantage IF you're interested in excelling at KBs in particular. Pavel says, \\"strength is a skill\\". DB and KB strength aren't 100% transferable to each other , and KB strength is no more transferable than DB to -any- activity. The recent popularity of KBs proves the importance of variety to maintain interest, but that's all. Then there's the HIGH cost of KBs, (as Pavel has somewhat of a monopoly at the moment), and the promotional material of KB advantages, much exagerated, some false. Decades of athletes in all fields have excelled without KBs. I'd rather have the variety of weights that adjustable DBs provide at a lower cost. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"While I appreciate Pavel's instruction and expertise, this video is a waste of money.

He was able to capture the tumultuous emotions that accompany a life at the switch, and a life of \\"playing god.\\"There seems to be a fine line between jailer and the jailed, executioner and murderer, and Solotaroff did a fine job of capturing these subtle differences, and providing the reader with food for thought in regards to the American death penalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Interesting","review":"Solotaroff spent six years working on the book - focusing on the \\"Death Belt\\" (two hours from I-10 in the South) relating stories from an amateur historian of executions, to former death-rom inmates, condemned, and executioners.

Whereas most male historians would write about how Alexander I, Talleyrand, Metternich, Hardenberg, and Castlereagh determined the fate of Europe, Alsop gives insight on how some women influenced the course of history. For example, both Metternich and Alexander I slept with the same mistress during the Congress. These insights provide the reader with some background behind the Congress that determined the makeup of Europe for the next hundred years.This is a lively read and at a little over 200 pages, the reader will have invested little time for a great deal of history.

Not like Riven and Myst where almost all the parts of the game connect with each other, and everything adds to or advances the main plot.Speaking of which, while the plot in Mysterious Journey has POTENTIAL to be interesting, the writing and voice overs are so corny that it falls flat.I have been searching for a game that can stand up to the Myst series ever since (sadly) UbiSoft decided not to make anymore.

Don't expect running around shooting things in this full 3D adventure - it's just puzzle solving pure and simple, all at your own pace and in your own time. From the makers of Schizm, this game has all the beauty of the original title and dreamlike quality coupled with puzzles to keep you awake for weeks. The graphics are quite frankly excellent... using the NOLF 2 Jupiter engine to render some highly complex scenery. The plot it also pretty damn good, with well done cutscenes and some odd costumes. If you're a Myst fan, and your computer can cut this on full detail (it's quite a performance tester) then by all means buy it. Expect negative reviews from FPS freaks and people who get frustrated by the logical but rock puzzles though... Brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just A Warning before you buy!!!!!","review":"I have not been able to play this game yet.

There were parts that were better than others, but overall I would skip this book.If you need something, anything to read and it is just lying there, I would read it, but it is not a book I would make a special trip to the store to get.

However, there is no real content. Most pages are devoted to describing, again and again, how much the main characters are attracted to each other and how this plays out.

A pretty straightforward proposition. Once you've optimised it, what more can you do? The way they were designed, and made, a couple of years ago was pretty much optimal. I can't imagine how you could improve on that design. So Bic have decided that, since they must have something new and \\"improved\\", they would go down the route of sub-optimalisation! They made it worse. And then, in this latest incarnation of the Bic Brightliner (I refuse to spell bright, brite), they made it even worse still! The cap is now way too short, the grip is way too fat, and the tip is now much narrower than previously (produces too thin of a line).What can I say? Congratulations Bic on a truly awful new product!

However, I found it to be too wet. It would not dry right away and would smudge on the page. The highlighted area would crinkle a bit because it was so wet and I could see it on the back of the page as well. I don't think I would buy this highlighter again.

If I wanted to read about wild sexual antics, I'd pick up some good erotica, not a supposed horror novel. A little bit in moderation is fine, but with her books, it seems like on every other page you're reading about someone's sexual fantasies, escapades, or perversions (including rape) - INSTEAD of getting a few good scares.This book isn't really a horror novel - it's a novel about mind control through cable boxes. And when it ends abruptly, leaving a number of loose ends hanging and much unexplained, it doesn't provide much satisfaction to the reader.\\"The Forgotten\\" was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh Should Forget this one!","review":"Ok...It is usually easy For me to get started on a book..This was the worst!!!..It didnt grab me at all...I picked up and put it down 10 times within a week...I would definately FORGET this one...Try Bad things...or Haunted..Much better reads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast-paced novel","review":"I picked this up at the library and couldn't put it down. I thought it was a very interesting concept, and the characters drew me in pretty quickly. The lead role, Will Banning, is a psychologist in a small town where odd things start happening. Of course, he is skeptical of the supernatural and believes a normal, rational reason is behind it. I won't ruin it for anyone by going further.

Sure there are a few nice creepy parts but they get muddled up in a very pedestrian story. But i must admit to liking the way she portrayed the cable industry:-)All in all i will not waste any more words on this crap which was so unexpected from such a good writer. Also here is a case where one must not judge a book by its cover. The picture shown has nothing to do with the story at all!!Enough!!

You just turn the dial on the bottom, and swipe the little brush over each cuticle. The product feels natural and smells amazing.

Sharp, easy clean cuts, sturdy and comfortable in the hand. However, the first time I took them apart for a more thorough hand washing (no dishwasher) I could not get them back together again. Nothing I do will hold the two blades together. It is as if the ratchet or something moved which is pretty impossible considering there are no moving parts aside from the two scissor blades. Of course, being a trusted OXO product like many others in my kitchen/household, I did not keep the clam shell package, the packing slip or the shipping carton I was so excited to get these so returning them is a moot point. After trying for over an hour to get these back together this morning I threw the pieces in the trash along with my $17. What a waste.

The author only described superficial details about her, and gave no insight into the death of her infant daughter, so to me, it really seemed like she was being ridiculous and hypervigilant about her son. I couldn't get upset over the way she was treated, because I agreed with everyone else that she was suspicious. Then there was that predictable ending. This book exemplifies why I usually don't like \\"who done it\\" stories. The author tries to throw you off track and drag things out until the end, only within the last few pages to find a quick and implausible ending. I saw no real reason for the \\"bad guy/girl\\" to do what he/she did, but I knew all along it was him/her.

With this offering he takes us on an even more far flung journey into the mind of the artist contemplating nature through his digital-imaging-tools-eye. The tone is spiritual and calming. I can recommend this DVD for anyone interested in digital art, animation, and meditation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated lessons on golf","review":"This video is quite disappointing in both instruction and production quality. Geiberger's classic swing appears as outdated as his stretch polyester pants. Complicating matters is his partner/mentor, Jim Blakely. The meaningless chatter from this old fossil makes this video a great candidate for the bargain bin.I'd recommend buying the Al Geiberger's sybervision video and leave this stinking fish alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks can be decieving","review":"Don't look at the box or the title, this one is great. The action is brilliant. These people are very skillfull. Ive watched it 50 times and am still amazed.

The only problem is that it is in mongolia wich is kind of different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to have purchase!","review":"This product is absolutely brilliant, I was fed up with unpicking tangled jewellery out of my jewellery box, also sometimes it would seem impossible to find what I was looking forthis has solved all my problems, you can see what you are looking for right away, match jewellery to your outfit instantly, and no more tanglesMy only problem now is I have filled it completely with my jewellery and will probably have to order a 2nd one soon ! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"I recently bought a TON of earrings and I knew that my tiny little jewelry holder just wasn't gonna cut it. I bought this organizer and it's just great! All of my earrings fit. There are little pockets and big pockets. I put all of my smaller earring in the smaller pockets and saved the big ones for all of my hoops (I wear really big hoops). I also have a few necklaces on the reverse side and a bracelet and still have more pockets leftover. The very best thing is that I can see everything easily right away, which makes jewelry selection in the morning effortless."},{"rating":"2","title":"rocks! And not just for jewerly..","review":"its absolutely PERFECT for jewelry.. I had to order two for jewelry. But then I had an idea and used it to fit all my eyeshadow too. All my MAC eyeshadow fits in each one.. no more looking for which one I should choose.. and the big ones fit in the bottom portion of this item. So, now I have a color palette of eyeshadow when getting ready. It's really great for both. Jewelry and eyeshadow. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer.","review":"This is a wonderful organizer. The size of the product is a bit too big and there are not many pockets big enough to fit bigger necklaces and bracelets. But overall a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"jewelry organizer","review":"The Whitney Design 80-Pocket Cotton Canvas Organizer helped me organize my jewelry. Now instead of having it in many drawstring bags and small boxes, it is all in one place where I can easily see what's there and find what I want to wear. It hangs in the closet and takes very little space. It is nice quality canvas...much better quality than others I have seen in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got my jewelry organized!","review":"This hanging jewelry organizer actually holds all my jewelry in a useful organized way that's easy to see. It has enough large pockets to hold necklaces and matching earrings plus plenty of small pockets.

One side for silver. The perfect way to keep my earrings organized. I even neurotically cut squares from craft felt so I can keep my studs color-organized. Blues are in one pocket. Reds in another. Purples on another. And the last square on each side holds extra backings because I'm always losing (and then finding) them. So now, I can find them when I need them. Highly recommend this item. Price is right, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this item","review":"This is a great and inexpensive way to organize your jewelry.

Earrings, bracelets and necklaces all store very well. It was a gift for my daughter and I may have to order another one. She LOVED it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usefullness Personified!","review":"I ordered this organizer on a whim and couldn't be happier that I did, it is SO useful and I love the pockets so I can see my jewelry clearly so it makes it easy to find matching colors as I dress. I love jewelry and own a large variety which I kept in several jewelry and other smaller boxes; this meant that I could never easily find the precise earrings or bracelet or necklace I wanted when I was dressing. Very frustrating -- your product has most effectively eliminated this problem. I've already recommended this product to several of my friends and will probably purchase additional units from you.

No more fumbling through little drawers or white boxes trying to find the one thing I want--I hung this at the end of my closet, and I can see exactly what I want/need when I get dressed in the morning. And in taking everything out of the little drawers/boxes, I also found several pieces I had forgotten I had--worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space saving jewelry holder!","review":"I purchased this jewelry hanger to replace an often unused jewelry amoire. The holder is well-made and almost all of my jewelry fit nicely. It's great to readily be able to see many of my jewelry selections so easily. The only negative I would have is the hanger which while substantial did not have a swivel hook. This was easily solved by my replacing it with my own \\"heavy duty\\" hanger which did have a swivel head"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but the pockets are too small","review":"I have a cheaper one I like much better that I bought years ago at Odd Job. This one is sturdy and has more pockets but they are very small and tight so it's hard to fit anything in them larger than a pin. Even bracelets have to be crammed in and a bulky necklace just would not fit. The few larger pockets are at the bottom - too low down to reach conveniently and not really that large. It might work for nails, screws, paper clips etc. - small stuff that you could easily see and get at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewelry Organizer very helpful.","review":"I really like the Whitney Design 80-Pocket Cotton Canvas Jewelry Organizer. It very helpful in organizing your jewelry. You can hang it in your closet and pick out your jewelry as you pick out your clothes for the day. The organizer is very good for earrings and bracelets. Your bigger necklaces however will not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad I bought it","review":"The product is exactly what is represented. It holds most of the items that I needed to store. The only reason it did not receive 5 stars from me is because the pockets are tight when a bulkier item is in the pocket on the opposite side. It is quick and easy to find an item I need. I could also see using it to store other items such as hair clips, craft items like beads, buttons, or other small items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect. Just what I needed.","review":"Perfect especially if you like to be neat and organized and don't like unnecessary things like jewelry boxes taking up space. It's so much better than digging through a jewelry box and saves so much time. I found myself wearing the same silver hoops every day b/c I never wanted to dig for jewelry. Now I can find what I need instantly. At first I wished it had zipper pockets but I found that the pockes are tight enough that they keep things secure and it's quicker b/c you can just reach in and pull out what you need. The only thing this needs is about 4 larger pockets at the bottom for my bulky jewelry and a swivel hanger so that I can spin it around in my closet. Also I wish it was longer so that it would hang to the ground that way I would not have had to buy two of them. But it's ok b/c I really really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very convenient way to store my many earrings.","review":"My sister-in-law received this product as a gift and showed it to me when I mentioned how difficult it was to find the earrings I wanted by rummaging through a drawer-full of various smaller boxes. I was always forgetting what colors I had and would often missplace the ones I wanted to wear by taking them off and laying them down on the dresser, nightstand, etc. Now I have them totally organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME PRODUCT!!","review":"Got lots of small jewelry and not much space? This takes up the space of one coat hanger. Double sided, 80 pockets. It is NOT a jewelry roll; tops of pockets are open. I keep my tarnish-prone stuff in small plastic bags inside the pockets.Really big necklaces aren't going to fit, but it's the best organizer I've seen, and it's sturdy, since it's canvas on a thick hanger. I suppose if you overload the pockets, they could tear, but I've had mine nearly a year with no problems.Great value for the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I loved this so much and filled it so quickly that I bought another one for me & one as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not do what I wanted","review":"I am not happy with this as the pockets are too tight to really insert anything into them except the skinniest of whatever. wanted it to keep my earrings organized but cannot squeeze them into to the pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"I really didn't like this item because the pockets were very, very small and it was difficult to get jewelry in and out."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSF LI, NY","review":"This product came earlier then expected and was exactly the way it is pictured.

I am a jewelry freak and have an endless supply of ear rings, necklaces, etc. This is PERFECT. It keeps them separated which reduces the chance of them getting tangled and turning colors (from contact with each other). Most importantly, it allows you to see every piece of jewelry you have so you can make the best choice of what to wear :)Cons:- They could have more pockets that vary in size- When full, it's heavy and can be annoying to flip aroundBut other than those two things, I really like this product. I have two now and they make my life so much easier in that respect lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy organizer","review":"I was very pleased with this purchase. Seeing all of my jewelry at a glance was so helpful to me in order to get dressed in the morning. The organizer is made out of sturdy canvas and plastic and is two-sided so you just flip over to see your jewelry on the other side. As another reviewer mentioned, it does not have zip closures and must be hanging upright to ensure pieces stay in place. The plastic pouches are flush with the canvas so small jewelry does not move around much and stays clean, however chunky pieces like bigger bracelets or bangle watches do not fit in as well. There are 8 larger pockets (16 in all) on the bottom for these. However if you own alot of really chunky jewelry this product may not be for you, for earrings and slimmer jewelry it is great. I am so much happier now to see my jewelry in one place and I feel this product was a terrific value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Jewelry Organizer","review":"This is a great jewelry organizer. It is made really well. The hanger is a heavy metal and a nice canvas material with heavy gauge plastic for pockets. Now I can see every piece of jewelry without digging in a jewelry box.

I have not sold it because no one here would buy it. The explanations are poor. If you want to know about thermodynamics, this is really not your book, I would rather recommend a Fisicochemistry book.As for properties tables and the such, well, the information you are really going to use is all summed up in the Chemical Engineer's Handbook, which is a must for any ChE, even if you're just a student (believe me, it has saved me a lot of times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for students of Chemical Engineering","review":"Ideal for undergraduate thermodynamics course.

Whether the inane production values (clapboard being seen, moths flying at film lighting...), the horrible script, bad dubbing, or TORGO, I laughed so hard my cheeks hurt. Torgo is so amazingly palsy you HAVE to love him. This movie makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like Citizen Kane. Even the name of the movie... \\"Manos\\" means hands, so the title is Hands, the Hands of Fate. wow. Well worth the 69 minutes of my life to watch it.

If you're really serious about wasting an hour and a half of your life then buy the MST3K version instead because they at least make it a bit funny (which takes away some of the pain and suffering of seeing Mangos: The Cans Of Fruit).

Only ONE cast member ever committed suicide. ONE. Not two, not five. ONE. John Reynolds, who played Torgo.2. Reynolds did NOT commit suicide because of anything having to do with the film. He had allegedly been into drug use and LSD experimentation, and combined with an alleged abusive military father, John one day simply cracked.End of story.The film is so bad it doesn't need crude after-the-act embellishment!Oh yes .... how would I know all this?

The events that he experienced flying P-40s, P-47s, and P-51s from North Africa to Italy are facinating and cover a longer period than many of the aces that fought in the war. If you have been disappointed in the past by the personal shortcomings that some \\"heros\\" have exhibited in other parts of their lives, look no further than Herky.

The fact that it was strange didn't really bother me. It was the horrible gameplay. It was one of those games where the camara went along with where you dragged your mouse, and you had to look all around you. up, down, left, right. It made me absolutely nauseous. After about 2 minutes of playing I felt like I had to throw up. Not to mention that the story is horrible, it's not funny. It's just plain cheezy. If anyone finds this game funny they have a very strange sense of humor. Every character in the game was really annoying. You couldn't actually talk to them. When you clicked on them, they would say things to you, but it isn't interactive conversation. Wow was this one bad.

Sometimes the view spun out of control, so I couldn't complete the puzzles and had to restart. Lots of problems there. But apart from that, although the scenes were lovely, the story lacked continuity, the puzzles were not entertaining, and the challenges were either too simple or too hard.

The jokes on the game and the free walkthrough are so stupid I had to keep forcing myself to come back and continue to play.

I tried to resolve this every way I could and my subscription ended up being canceled by the publisher. Amazon sent my problem reports to the publisher and the publisher said to contact Amazon. Don't even try to find a phone number for Parenting Magazine customer support. I could never find one. It has been 5 months w/o any issues. Amazon did end up issuing a refund.

I also thought it was worth $5. But the publisher also kept sending me out the incorrect version and sent out dated issues. When I contacted the publisher, they completely ignored my complaint about the issues being out of date. After 3 emails from me, 2 weeks later the publisher told me I should contact Amazon to get the correct version of the magazine.BUT Amazon had great customer service!! They responded in less than 24 hours of me sending an e-mail, credited me in full for the magazine and gave me an extra goodwill credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher sent me the wrong edition as well!!!","review":"I ordered early years- they started sending me school years, dated issues, too!

Am pretty disappointed. Update: am attempting to get the correct version. They are insisting to transfer only effective January, which means I'll only get 6 issues of a magazine I paid a year for, and that I should contact Amazon to get the correct version.Most recent email:Dear Ms. xxx,We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We received your Parenting School Years order through third party. We transferred this subscription to Parenting Early Years for 05 issues as 06 issues are already served. The last issue of Parenting School Years you will receive is December/January 2010 issue. Please contact Amazon for further assistance.Thank you for subscribing to Parenting Early Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Amazon coupon!!!!","review":"I bought 2 copies of each Parents and Parenting magazines for the Baby Amazon coupons in February 2011.

Devoid of content, full of ads and extremely thin. They claim to have two different 'versions' - Parenting (the early years) and Parenting (the school years). I thought great! Until I started receiving both and they are virtually the exact same magazine. It takes a five minutes to flip thru the magazine. Save yourself some $$ and don't buy it. You can read the whole thing standing in line in the grocery store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of magazine.","review":"I have used Parent's magazine for years.

I had paid for a two year subscription but the with in the first 6 months I missed two issues, when I complained the company I was told those issues were out of stock and I would get 2 months added onto my subscription. The other 4 months were late....and I don't mean a few days late, I mean months late. It was like they didn't have anything to send me so they would send the July issue in September! What a joke. Dealing with the company is even worse, but I did finally manage to get a full refund. As for the magazine itself save your money. It's nothing but ads. None of the articles are written from a serious stand-point and many articles are about clothing style, make-up and hair products for mothers.

They use to have few good coupons for Gymboree few years back. Now maybe every other issue, and that is about it. Not worth a penny. ALL of content is available for free online, many stories are biased, lots of stuff is common knowledge...and the biggest problem for me-they are pretty good for pretending breastfeeding does not exist as a form of feeding your infant. I guess it makes sense given the fact magazine is full of formula ads, but personally I think is dishonest. Would not take it for free, let alone pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some coupons!","review":"Plain and simple, after a few copies arrived in the mail and I had a chance to read this magazine, I realized it was a waste of money. Before canceling the subscription, I simply looked for the coupons inside and then threw it in the garbage. The information you get here, you can get from open sources like the internet or a good book. If you are into magazines and have the time, you might like it. I don't have much time, and only subscribed because I'm a new parent and wanted to have some backup.

If you're expecting the subtle and cerebral humor of Dumb & Dumber, you should enjoy it. There are numerous laugh out loud moments, but it's often cliched. If you look at the cover, you know what you're getting into. If it looks like the kind of movie you like, it doesn't disappoint. There's nothing really new here, aside from the surprisingly good actors, who are basically unheard of. Keep an eye out for some of these people.

I got an algae bloom in there and it was so green I couldn't even seen her! I placed some in the filter and made a filter out of a butter container. The water is so clear the it's actually strange looking at it. I can see my Turtle now, and see looks really happy. It works by removing the phosphates from the water that the algae feeds on. The price is wonderful, it's twice if not 3 times as much at my local store. A little goes a long way too.

What is largely neglected by those who learn about Sadat is his early flirtation with Nazi Germany, his acceptance of Nasser's authoritarian regime, his own \\"correction\\" of the revolution which placed him in power and, of course, his role as war leader in the October War.This book looks realistically at Sadat and how we ran Egypt following Nasser's death up to his own assassination. The author looked at primary sources and interviewed many of the key players of those years, opponents and proponents alike, in order to get a clear picture despite the murky nature of Egyptian politics.This is more of a scholarly work than recreational reading and it helps if you already have a working knowledge of Egypt's recent history. This book gives the reader a clearer look at Sadat the politician, Sadat the leader, Sadat the thinker... in effect, Sadat the human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egypt during the Sadat Years","review":"This book sets a high standard for studies about the Sadat era, and I was very happy to find a used copy in good condition at an affordable price.

Just read it, you'll love it.The second story is little complex in regards to the writing style. I had a hard time concentrating on the story because the wording threw me off. I had to constantly re-read lines, because I simply didn't get it. Ultimately, it is also a sweet love story.All in all, the book is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather poor","review":"While the authors of the series of lectures which make up this book have wonderful credentials as scientists, they are not very good writers. It isn't that they are unclear, so much as that they are dull and awkward. Mindful of their own research, some of the material is not very interesting either, although nuggets do shine through. I do recommend that anyone who can get hold of this book read pl. 24-27 on the neuroscience of cocaine addiction, because that section is a gem.

The range of her voice from extreame highs to lows that are surprising \\"For a Girl\\". I have 24 of Menanies albums, this one is second only to Arabesque(1984?). The best way to enjoy this CD is to close your eyes, rock back your lounger and crank it up till the floor rocks. Talk about Blown Away. You know the Maxell guy, he was listining to this CD. If you want to release your endorfens to the max crank this one up, it will even drown tooth pain. This is rock that doesen't all blur together, the instruments remain crisp and identifiable. The most amasing thing to me is Melanie wrote most of her own music and lyrics. The girl is amazing, beyond belief. I was going to USF when this album was made and I think I had a chance to go to the taping but I had finals so I had to cram and mised out on a chance of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melanie Rocks!","review":"Melanie is not a folk singer or a pop star. She defies being labeled because she crosses genres. This is one of her best albums ever. With a live band, Melanie sings old and new songs with an intense energy. She is at one with her band and the results are astonishing. My only complaint is that the CD leaves off three of the best tracks that were on the two album set. Still, these are emotionally stirring performances by a truly great artist. \\"Save Me\\" is raw, real, dramatic. \\"Buckle Down\\" and \\"Miranda\\" are great fun. The listener will not be able to stop listening because each consecutive song draws you in for more. This is a far cry from the Melanie on stage alone with her guitar. This album succeeds in an artist who is not afraid to venture into transforming her songs into another genre. Either alone with her guitar or with a full rocking band, Melanie is amazing. \\"Ballroom Streets\\" is a truly great work by a great singer-songwriter. By all means, buy this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earlier novels better","review":"The Belascoarán series has long been one of my favorites and more or less inaugurated detective fiction in Mexico in a unique form that could be classified as a subgenre. That said, Taibo's earlier novels are much better. As one goes from older to more recent, the plots of the novels suffer, giving way to essentially political tirades that make the reading tedious. The better novels of the series are Cosa Fácil, Algunas Nubes and Amorosos Fantasmas. Another of his great books is Sombra de la Sombra. This latest novel was so far-fetched as to border on the ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of Iggy","review":"Some people might bash this cd due to it's calmer nature and such but I personally enjoyed this album. While this is by no means Raw Power or Fun house, this is still a pretty good album. Iggy shows of his talents as a song writer here as evidenced by such songs as mainstreet eyes and home and a few others. While this is by no means his best stuff it is enjoyable and has a few classic Iggy songs like Candy and Home, also my baby likes to rock and roll is a nice song that is similar to Iggy's roots. Featuring guest apperances by Kate peirson and slash this is a very enjoyable album that I would suggest getting AFTER you have explored some of Iggy's other stuff don't just get this after listening to The stooges or you will be dissapointed. All in all a good album and reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale","review":"I was very disappointed with this one.

The Undefeated is my favorite Iggy song, period. But one expects more than a few *moments* to make a good album. For the most part, the arrangements are uninspired, the performances sloppy, and (most importantly) most of the songs suck. The title track, with its \\"I get off my d---; I'm living brick by brick\\" refrain is criminally inane. Butt Town, Pussy Power, etc... these songs are even worse than the titles suggest and Living on the Edge of Night is more cliched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I couldn't get through the whole CD because it was deathly boring. Stupid lyrics, uninspired playing, lack of originality. Some of it sounded like he was trying to imitate Lou Reed, but the imitation was poor.

What happened to the cancer cure?Laura's brother, zombified, half-dead, still managed to continuously beat up whole packs of armed and dangerous baddies...Say, now that I think of it, I'd like to change my rating from 3 to a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and melodramatic","review":"This book should appeal to 14 year old boys. The pace is pretty quick, but the writing is melodramatic. Overall, the story is improbable, the characters are hard to believe in, and my interest strayed. Put it this way: halfway through the book, I put it down and forgot all about it for almost a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising excellent read!","review":"I am not one into mysteries OR medical-related novels, so this book was more of something to pass the time away with this summer..... WOW! I am surprised, it is a GOOD read.

I am encouraged to look into more Palmer books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This book was thrilling and very interesting. I have read lots of Mystery/Thrillers but not relating to anything to do with the medical business. Well written and one of the books I couldn't wait to finish to find out what would happen. Characters were good and it was easy to follow with no confusion of who is who. Sometimes there are too many characters and it can get a little confusing. I do recommend this to someone looking for a good thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Michael Palmer medical mystery.","review":"Michael Palmers books, Sister Hood,Extreme Measures, Side Effects, Natural Causesand Crital Judgement are all EXCELLANT.The \\"hard to put down\\" type of reading.After reading each one I search the bookshelvesfor the next release.

He first two solo albums (late 70s, early 80s) were chock full of great pop tunes, and most of those are on this excellent single disc compilation. Yes, he co-wrote some tunes with Nick Lowe back during their Stiff days, and the music here will certainly appeal to the \\"Pure Pop for Now People\\" crowd and anyone who enjoys melodic pop-rock. Ian Gomm possesses a very smooth voice and has a feel for singing these tuneful songs. It's not quite power-pop but certainly very catchy pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What's an elk?\\"","review":"Perfect book for someone who has zero experience with elk hunting.

CDs that consumed me ten years ago often slip off my radar completely, never to be listened to again. This is not the case with Stuck Together With God's Glue. This is a really great piece of work, and though it's coming up on twenty years of age, it is still fresh, positive, energetic and evocative of pre-boom Ireland - there's still an innocence to it and this is what I love about it.For those from Ireland, I saw Something Happens in one of the first 'Trips to Tipp' in the early nineties. Special memories for sure, and this CD takes me right back. This comes very highly recommended from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses for Dummies","review":"Love it, love it.

This is one of the latter.The story is interesting and worth knowing. The dedication of Seth Carlo Chandler to his avocation is inspiring, the theory behind the solution is elegant, and the political intrigue is evocative. But to stretch the story to booklength required a trivial prologue, superfluous biographical details for secondary characters, and technical details that were rather opaque to the lay audience, this writer included.I'd still recommend the book to a friend with an interest in astronomy, but I'd rather recommend a streamlined 80-page version of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game experience since syberia!!","review":"Just givin' a quick review here. Just to let ya'll know for me Syberia really set the standard for me. So when I say that this game is the best experience I've had since Syberia I am saying A LOT!!

Good Times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I eagerly awaited this 3rd episode and was very disappointed. The graphics are not as good as the 1st two games, and the use of the arrow keys, rather than the mouse, was cumbersome. I r ead that the creators of the game say that this is the future of adventure games. I certainly hope not as, in my opinion, the mouse action is so much smoother. The rich color of the 1st two games was amazing, and since this game is several years ahead, I expected more in the way of lush graphics. It was not there. It was difficult to get the characters to move in straight lines. I found the game concentrated too much on eye-hand quick coordination to get through many parts, rather than logic. I did not enjoy spending hours trying to progress through the game by learning which keys to press, in which order, and doing it without missing a beat. To me, that is not an \\"adventure game\\" but rather a game of beating the clock. I finally through in the towel about 3/4 through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic game","review":"Got this game as a gift from my son, fantastic game, would have no problem in saying buy this game, lots of adventure.Broken Sword: Sleeping Dragon"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken sword sleeping dragon","review":"Could not get this game to work on XP.

This game has stilted characters, bad acting, stupid puzzles (it seems you have to find out things in a particular order -- if not, too bad). Maybe it gets better as it goes, but after about 20 minutes, I couldn't stand going through it again to get the clues in the proper order. It goes into the waste bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love this genre of games and this game sounded like it had a lot of promise. It has turned into the most disappointing game I have ever played. In my opinion, it is a follow-the-directions kind of game. There are few, if any, puzzles. There are many scenes in which you die and then have to repeat the whole scene over and over and over again in order to move on. I actually purchased a game controller because one scene could not be accomplished via the keyboard. Well, the game controller didn't help much either. This game volleys back and forth between boring and frustrating. Not a good combination. Save your money.

Limited control of most aspects, so be prepared for restricted editing. Many problems with program crashing while creating movies.

I am extremely disappointed in this program. It is not user friendly in any way. There are tips and step by step instructions, but they are unclear and not precise. I spent almost an hour trying to insert a transition between 2 frames. The directions give 2 methods of performing this action. The first method- clicking the selected transition and dragging it doesn't work at all. You can drag it everywhere on the screen EXCEPT in between two frames. The second method is to click on a button that does not exist in the effects mode. If I leave the effects mode, the button is there, but then I can't very well add any effects.After fussing with this program for over an hour, I switched to Windows Media Movie Maker and had my short little clip completed and exported to the internet in less than 20 minutes.Don't waste your time or money on Ulead Video Studio 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally *un*intuitive interface","review":"Tried to use the LE version which came with a Firewire card - after an hour I gave up in frustration. ...the user interface is not at all intuitive.

It appears it has many features and options. I spent 2 hours trying to edit a 30 second video clip and gave up with a headache. I had difficulty trying to preview minor changes (e.g. adding a title).

Like many others, I was hesitant to upgrade to ME because of reports of computer lockups,crashes,etc. Rumors circulated that WinME had many bugs that had yet to be resolved. Total hogwash. I realize now that I made a mistake by not upgrading sooner. The Windows Movie Maker software included with WinME was a pleasant suprise. I prefer it to Video Studio and Studio DV(Pinnacle). It doesn't include everything that the two major titles do, but it has everything u would want, without options that u would never use. After all, these movies won't be released in the local theatres.If u haven't upgraded yet, remember that the cost of the upgrade to WinME will be the same or less than either of the two major movie making software titles!!

I cited this book favorably in my thesis and highly recommend it to any Westerner who will work with non-Westerners.Duane Elmer first helps Americans understand their own typical conflict resolution style.

However, this is only part of the story, after an extended period of silence All Saints have recently begun releasing albums by new acts and Compounds showcases tracks by two of their recent discoveries including the highly acclaimed, Marconi Union, who contribute their dazzling track, Sleepless to the album, and effectively map out their vision of future directions for this music, while demonstrating just why they are being seen as important new voices on the European electrionic music scene.

It's one of the best written albums of the just young '90s and he even had Don Henley's producer Danny Kortchmar to produce his album.

Real Christians believe Jesus was God.In the early days of Christianity, people had their tongues cut out or were forced to drink molten lead for spouting the kinds of heresies you'll see in this book.

He takes the reader on an intimate ride into his past, but the intimacy is only in knowing that no one is alone. There are others out there that are feeling the same things. Going through the same troubles as you.In the end it leaves the reader with a better understanding of at least the \\"gay community\\" if not the reader personally.

No doubt if the author was born in Nazi Germany sixty years ago, he would be Hitler's right hand man in his pink triangle quest to oppress homosexuals, or at least, those too limp wristed and \\"icky\\" for Andrew Tobias' liking. I'm aghast other readers are recommending his book for those coming out of the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked in the 70's ... but now??","review":"My 2nd reading, after nearly eighteen years. I'm not sure how this can be called a novel, as it is so obviously the autobiography of Mr. Tobias, under the pen name of John Reid. It is insightful concerning the thought patterns of small children who grow up knowing they are somehow different, but I found his intolerance for gay people in general, when that is what he is aspiring to, to be irritating and downright obnoxious. He is dreadfully afraid of being associated with anyone who doesn't fit his idea of the perfect gay man: collegiate, handsome, white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Overhyped","review":"I bought this book because I thought I'd relate with the author's choice of the title \\"The Best Little Boy in the World\\". It took me less than fifty pages to realize that this was one of the worst books I've ever read. I can imagine that this book probably made a lot of difference when it was written, but today, I like to think we've progressed beyond the self-loathing, hatred of our own nature, and belittling of anyone that isn't like us to make this book less relevant for today. If I was recommending a book to a teenager to help them with their coming out process, I definitely would not recommend this book. I mean, come on, coming out is traumatic enough as it is, why would I want to make it worse by suggesting they read a book that will only put them down and make them feel worse about themselves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have problems in my aquariums with silicates in the tap water and therefore brown algae - this product takes care of that issue and keeps my plants clean and green.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story with an inspirational message","review":"Wow, I just finished Skip Atwater's book and I must say it was an incredible read about a remarkable time in our nation's history. The evolution of the program which utlimately became known as 'Stargate' is an incredible journey. One that wouldn't let me put the book down.I recently had the pleasure to see Skip speak recently about his work on HemiSync technology and was very impressed with his scientific approach towards the subject. He is an incredible speaker as well and is an intriguing individual.His book showed to me the other side of Skip, one that places trust in 'guidance' that we recieve throughout our lives, leading us ever closer to our destinies.

Even programs like Microsoft Word froze when doing just word processing. And when you call the company, they tell you that it doesn't cause any of these problems.

Her prose style is terrific- flowing, evocative, and deep. But rather than a comedy of manners, this is something of a *tragedy* of manners, as nearly all the female adult characters wallow in self pity and paralysis, often for fear of expressing their feelings to the people they (should) care most about. The callousness with which the children are treated is appalling as well. So while the art of description is magnificent, I can't help but be thankful I don't live in the stifling world Bowen has created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical of Elizabeth Bowen","review":"I love Elizabeth Bowen but as with every other book I've ever read of hers, the ending always leaves my hanging.

There's funny, sad and enigmatic (it turns out Fred's quite the storyteller; lyrics are included). There's a dead dog, an abandoned gas station, and actual Canadians who never mention hockey - something for everyone!.Personal faves? Gurf, OFB, and Old No. 8.But be warned: this is a gateway record - you may be on your way to the orginal Eaglesmith recordings and/or other records by the Various Artists involved. Congratulations are in order - to the musicians, Mike Holm, Mr. E. of course, and to you.::"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"In general I guess that people who buy tribute albums are already fans of the artist being celebrated. This is the reason why such albums are never really successful - most likely you will prefer the original versions. In this case, the opposite happened to me. I had never listened to Fred Eaglesmith, but this album made me wanna check him out. Many of these songs are really great, and the performaces are sometimes better than his own. This is especially true of the lovely little song \\"Carter\\", sung here by Bill Chambers and his daughter, Kasey. The collection focuses on the serious side of Fred instead of the rowdy and humourous side, which is fine with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful illustrations, unique poetry and quotes, but ...","review":"... the pages are thin (you can see illustrations and writing through them) and are gloss-coated, which makes it difficult to find the right type of pen.

I'd pass on this one, despite the cover and the illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"I got this book for my daughter who is now 5 and searched high and low to get it for my son now 3. Of course I had another baby, and finally found the book again for my daughter.

A book?!","review":"Maybe I'm jaded by having read so many other far superior books documenting information about alleged UFO crashes, sightings, abductions, etc., but DARK OBJECT read more like an overlong pamphlet than it did a book. The authors attempt at research is basically reduced to a series of telephone conversations, eyewitness interviews, and newspaper clipping summaries that add up to nothing. In the final chapter, they make the allegation that not only was one saucer downed, but there were two! It read like bad fiction, more than a hard core examination of what evidence was available. The cover speaks of officials denying the events contained within, but the authors didn't discuss anyone who denied anything! They just didn't want to talk about it.

I'm addicted to it actually and have probably heard it more than 50 times. There seem to be so many layers to the sound that new things kept revealing themselves to me after many listens. It's a \\"great cd for the car\\": a lot of variety, a lot of energy. I liked his follow-up \\"Human Conditions\\", but it was a lower energy affair. It's a great cd for background music in the house as opposed to being a great car cd.This new cd is somewhat closer to \\"Alone with Everybody\\" in terms of energy. It's kind of like what \\"Alone with Everybody\\" might feel like if the songs on \\"Alone\\" were more compact. The new single \\"Why Not Nothing\\" is great and might be the most energetic thing he's done as a solo artist. The latter half of the new cd has a number of slow but wonderful songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Record","review":"Most of the hardcore ashcroft fans seem to bash this record, maybe it's because this one is more accesible than the human conditions album, arguably, the previous one&#65533;s got a more complex intention and concept, and less hooks than keys to the world.Nevertheless this album is not to intended to be a step forward in that direction.

The first two Richard Ashcroft solo albums were disappointing compared to the early Verve albums. I heard the first single, Break the Night with Color, from this new album, and thought maybe he's back doing some halfway decent tunes. But man, I got the album today, there are 3 or 4 good songs on it, and they aren't even that great. The rest of the album sounds like what if Richard Ashcroft did an album with Sheryl Crow. What happened? I think he's cowriting the album lyrics with the writers who do Hallmark Cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORCED EFFORT","review":"This album sounds forced with no inspiration and or feeling.

He has some truly great tunes but also often gets carried away in overproduction and cheesy, generic, soft, lyrics and melodies- this one is by far his worst effort. The only song with any edge or bite is Break the Night- the rest would be great for my mom to put on during Christmas dinner. It's all Hallmark-type save the world, Neil Diamond sappy garbage. He went much more toward lite FM edge from the past rather than edgy stuff like Check the Meaning or God in the Numbers- just look at song titles- Words get in the Way, Why do Lovers, Keys to the World, Cry til Morning- I think he spent way too much time with Chris Martin this time around- sad to see because I was really looking forward to this"},{"rating":"1","title":"pap","review":"Its just incredible that one man could be in a band as great as Verve and make records as incredible of all of theirs, and then end up only a few years later making music as bland, uninteresting and tired-sounding as this.

Karen is rather self-reserved staying on the safe side. Nick Carter plays the jock who is the prankster and joker.It's an okay movie. It does have a 'Scream' attempt - and I really mean it. It's a teen slasher, but it doesn't do that well in the blood/gore department, but there is a scene where Erica is doing it with her friend.

And such veteran actors such as Judge Reinhold and Stacy Keach must have been really desperate for cash if they committed to this schlock. And don't even get me started on the headless horseman. He was as about as convincing as a special effect in a cheesy 50's science fiction movie. If you want to see the best version of the story, watch Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow.

I did read with interest as she helped to unravel the complexity behind his paintings, but did not find any interest in her exploration of his deeply personal life.

Or is it the other way around--imposing notions of the work onto the life? It hardly matters--the result is the same. Nothing of substance is said about either, and in the process of saying nothing, she drags in all kinds of ugliness. Of course all the while, the author is claiming to be a great admirer of Johns, even as she purveys her gossip and hearsay. Finally, as is usually the case with such psychographers, she's just revealing her own unsavory motives and hungering ego. The only reason I give the book two stars is that she's not a bad writer.

Having raised daughters myself and now the grandmother of many granddaughters, I feel I can speak from experience. I was particularly taken back by the quoted text that was supposed to be what young girls actually said. Not all girls act the way she portrayed in the book nor do they have such mean motivations. I found the book negative, full of quick stereotypes, and slanted. Not everyone needs to be put in a stereotype so quickly. There are some truths in the book, but you have to use discernment in reading it to have a balanced view of teenage girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Stereotyping","review":"My dad asked me to read this book so that we could discuss this afterwards. I agreed, and hoped to find an insightful, accurate portrayal of teen social life. Instead, though, I found that the author of this book was self-centered (the word \\"I\\" was used far too many times) and perpetrated unfair teen stereotypes (\\"Queen Bee\\", \\"Second-in-Command\\", \\"Wannabe\\", etc.). At my school, I haven't noticed any of this. Yes, some people have more friends, and others have fewer. However, in my experience the \\"Queen Bees\\" are popular simply because they are nice to others. While I know that this is not the case in every high school, the way in which the author forces teen girls into a mold or type worries me. She makes it seem as if this is true at every high school, when really it's not as common as some parents might think.I would save my money and instead TALK to my kids about social life at their school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we really need Roz Wiseman?","review":"From the very beginning of this book I found myself questionning Ms. Wiseman's credibility. If \\"all girls lie\\" what makes her think the ones in this book have shared their deepest truest feelings with her, a total stranger? Any sociologist knows most teens (and many non-teens) tend to tell a willing listener exactly what they think they'd like to hear.As I turned the pages I became more convinced this writer needs to rewrite Queen Bees after she has a teenaged daughter of her own--their stories aren't \\"boring,\\" nor do they require special expertise to sit through! I'm thankful my girls share them, and even enjoy hearing them! By the time Ms. Wiseman was advising me on how to know if my daughter had a party while I was away (are we moms really that dense?) I regretted purchasing this book.Live with a teen 24/7 and maybe then you'll get what they're REALLY all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's to Preventative Maintenance","review":"This reads like a chess manual for social interactions (or more accurately dysfunctional interactions) of teenage females with their peers. The goal of this book is to give parents insight into why certain situations occur and how to help their daughters address them. Politics are part of any social interaction but the compilation of scenarios in this book are complex and vicious. While informative, the book takes a reactive stance. Just how do girls get entangled in these webs in the first place? How do parents raise a girl to have enough sense of self worth to let ugliness roll off or stand up for whatever is right? This book is truly a huge inspiration to read books about child development, self esteem and socialization. These books in turn teach skills to help a child take control in a positive manner as opposed to being a pawn who takes the role of aggressor, accomplice or attacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrongheaded and Stupid","review":"To think that my little girl because she is a girl would have an aggresive bone in her body is the dumbest idea that I have ever heard. Little girls are made from suger and spice and everthing nice and it is the boys that cause all the trouble. I am upset, ticked off at the notion that it is the other way around. The fate of the world rests with proper notions being taught about who we are and what we do and this book does not do that. Sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought for a Preteen Mom!","review":"I love how this book lays out the pitfalls of teen and tween life these days. I love the emphasis on the fact that this is your child's experiences and you shouldn't let your emotional baggage come into play. After reading, I have a few more tools in the parenting arsenal as we move forward!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing....","review":"This book while telling you all about what \\"some\\" girls and a little about what boys go through, it tells you that \\"THAT\\" is the way things are in middle school and in high school for our kids. If this book was required for parents to read before their kids enter middle school, I'm telling you \\"NOBODY\\" would sign their kids up for school anymore... What for? Just to go through the \\"required\\" stage of life?So, what the author is saying is that your girl has to be humiliated, excluded, ignored and left out trying to survive school so she can be assertive, self assure, self confident, and emphatic person when she grows up! GIVE ME A BREAK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me think...","review":"about the subtle clues my own daughters give to me about their lives outside of our home. This book asks the reader to be honest with themselves over several points in this book in hopes that we, as mothers, don't try to pigeon-hole our daughters to our own experiences but to open up and discuss our experiences with them. As I read the book, I invited my daugher's friends over and watched them interact. I had to laugh as I saw what I read in the book, materialize before my eyes. Very insightful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for school counselors","review":"Great book for counselors to help kids cope with cliques, even though it is written to parents. I have used it in counseling sessions with the girls in the cliques, as well as their targets, to raise their awareness. It has helped change behavior already. It is the best book on girl bullying I have found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of a teen girl? Read this!","review":"As a mother of a 14 year old girl, I found myself reliving my junior high years and bringing my experiences to the forefront to share with my daughter. She was not only receptive to hear them but actually asked questions about how I handled things. Mothers and teen daughters have so much to share with each other but sometimes lack the communication skills to talk even keel with each other. This book is wonderful for opening the door to your daughter's world and beginning that crucial conversation...\\"So, how was your day?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening for Dad","review":"Simply put, I found the book to far exceed my expectations for it. As a male, the author's insights into girls' social roles and interactions were a huge eye-opener. And as the father of three girls, I appreciate all the examples of specific situations girls may find themselves in, how their thinking/social conditioning may have contributed, and how they can extricate themselves.As others have noted, the author's presentation is non-judgmental, and she makes great use of first-hand accounts to introduce or support the discussion, not as trite filler.This book will go on my shelf as an irreplaceable \\"field guide to my daughters, their friends and their social habits\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Bees and Wannabees Helped Me","review":"Though I am not a mother trying to learn how to deal with my daughter. I am a daughter learning how to cope with my problems with other girls. Every one of my friends is jealous of me, and they would do anything to get me in trouble. Well, I was about half way through with the book and my friends all played a cruel joke. After I remembered what the book told me do to while dealing with a situation like this, I got through it. So, really I don't think this book should just be read by the parents, I think the daughters should read it too. Besides, problems could pop up at school and the girls wouldn't be able to get their parents help. If they read Queen Bees and Wannabees they would know exactly how to handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gained a lot of perspective.","review":"We have all been bullied...or been a bully...I read this and was able to learn what to watch out for, when to listen and when to talk.

It is a great guide for preteen and teen years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended highly","review":"Both my girls were targets in middle school, as early as 5th grade, and when the school said they could do nothing, I happened upon this book. It was a life saver. After reading it, I could counsel my girls through their classroom situations with minimal assistance from teachers and administrators. My girls managed to learn the difference between good friends and cliques. A couple of years later, those same queen bees got out of hand and had to be disciplined for bullying and publishing a 'burn book.' Then, teachers came to me and asked for my secret. Over the years, I have given this book and title to many teachers and mothers.It's much better than the Ophelia books and a good companion to other teenage behavior and dating books. Can't say I've read the newer version, which includes the boyfriend bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not culturally sensitive","review":"This book is great if you come from WHITE AMERICA! I am sorry but I think we need authors who write books such as this to research more on other cultures rather than white suburban cities. Each culture is different when I comes to cliques, gossip and bullying in schools. It will be hard for me to apply this to my school since I am a counselor in a Native American community."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"Wow - I guess this book might be meaningful to a very shallow \\"princess\\" culture, but real kids have a bit more brains, compassion and depth than the sad cases she writes about.

My daughter was having trouble with friends ganging up on her. She's only in 5th grade!It's troubling to me that 11 year old girls are already playing the popularity game. Our society isn't allowing little girls to remain little girls. They have all these images thrust upon them...teen queens Brittney and Christina tell them how they should look. Nickelodeon tells them what to buy. They listen to popular music and watch the news and are forced to grow up too soon. They are too young to make judgements and they begin to act in ways mentioned in the book. They feel they must act out and be seen.I don't remember school being such a competitive place. I'm saddened by what our society has become. I hope I can study this book and help my daughter to become a self-confident young woman.I'm thankful Ms. Wiseman wrote this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some answers","review":"After having left the snuggly confines of a really caring and loving elementary school for the harse reality of middle school we were floored with how cruel the girls could really get. It was a ugly and rough first year with a lot of tears and silence on the part of our normally loving and outgoing daughter. This book tagged the root of our problem dead on 'the queen bee' and her den of tag alongs. After such a revelation we can finally start to plan our future and stand tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killer B's","review":"Mr. Blake and Mr. Bly are the \\"Killer B's\\" when it comes to encouraging creativity in ads. They recommend holding the status quo and not rocking the creative boat. Safe advice, but hardly inspiring to a newbie in the copywriting field.

In fact, I read it twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"As much as I enjoy Sandra Brown's books, this one is below the mark. I wanted to strangle Kathleen towards the end.I will stick with Brown's romantic thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Hopeless Romantic","review":"I have read several Sandra Brown books,this by far was her best. I felt like I was in this relationship. I thought about Erik and his loving worldly ways. I even thought about how he would look and his feelings for Kathleen, loving and strong. I felt for Seth, the husband, who Kathleen adored and cherished but her heart needed and longed for Erik. I didn't feel like it was adultery, I felt as SB said it was, it was love. She was meant to be w/ ERik. Seth was the angel that got them back together. A MUST READ... if you're a hopeless Romantic like me!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book on meditation","review":"Excellent book on meditation. I wanted to practice meditation for a long time but was afraid of picking a book that wouldn't provide a good path to it but delve in some kind of abstract practice or ritual. I happened to buy \\"Upanishads\\" by the same author and was highly impressed by the simplicity but yet clear Upanishad translation. So I bought this book on meditation. The book is simply fabulous. Not attached to any religion or mysticism but encompassing the message of all, Eknath Easwaran clearly brings the importance of meditation in clear and lucid language. Now I regularly practice meditation. And have found a great deal of change in myself. The book on Bhagavad Gita and Dhammapada by the same author are also great reading. A series of great books from the true master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy from here.","review":"Worst experience. I paid for this then they did not ship it when they said they would.

Anyone who has been frustrated trying to decipher the marketing nomenclature of the meat industry will appreciate Merle's straightforward and frank explanations. Hailing from the U.S. heartland and practicing his trade in California, Merle shows himself to be a knowledgable butcher with a knack for writing in a conversational style. The writing is puncuated by clear line drawings of carcasses and cuts that aid the exposition, as well as other drawings that bring out the romance of meat. A few B/W photographs illustrate the difference between Prime and other US Grades of meat. I've looked for similar information in many other cookbooks without success. My only criticism is that the text does not refer directly to figures. Rather they are dropped on the page and one must guess which figure relates to what part of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality!","review":"I have the 15\\" version of this, but it's the same, just smaller. The neoprene is THICK! Much thicker than a Sony neoprene case I had for my old laptop. The leather trim makes it very classy.Although it's a good fit, there's still a bit of room horizontally that makes the laptop move around a bit. Personally I'd prefer a tighter fit.Other than that, I am extremely happy about it, and glad that it keeps my Macbook Pro safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad translation of great work","review":"Chaucer's Canterbury Tales are a wonderful collection of stories which I highly recommend. This translation, however, takes liberties. Nicholson embellishes Chaucer's work, which does not need such additions, and changes words to fit his sentiment rather than keeping with the meaning of Chaucer's original. Examples:Chaucer: Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote ...Nicholson: When April with his showers sweet with fruit ...Chaucer: To Caunterbury with full devout corage, ...Nicholson: To Canterbury, full of devout homage, ...Corage means heart or spirit, NOT homage.I recommend an interlinear translation, it keeps the translators honest, and allows you to see where they have deviated from the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selected Canterbury Tales","review":"This book was wonderful and exciting.

The problem I encountered was with both magazines. Every time I tried to load the gun, after the fourth or fifth one, the pellets just sprayed everywhere. Cheap spring? Some other fault in the design? I really can't say, being new to airsoft. My advice would be to purchase this gun in person so that if it has the same problems mine had, you don't need to go through all the hassle of shipping it back or dealing with a warranty department somewhere in East Asia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colt 25 airsoft is junk","review":"I have the same problem as a previous reviewer. Pellets are spraying everywhere and if I do manage to get pellets in the magazine, one cock unloads all the pellets into the chamber at once. This pellet gun is a piece of junk.

As, I'm not the only person writing about this issue, you can imagine thousands of others have encountered the problem and Soft Air USA just doesn't care. This pellet gun is fit for the trash. Thankfully, I purchased this crap in-store and can get a refund tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamcatcher's usual standard","review":"Not a bad little game overall, though I emphasize the little (a day or two should see you through, and that's without a walkthrough). Graphics, acting, and interface are all unimpeachable. Game play is *extremely* linear, to the extent that you sometimes can't end a day without revisiting every scene and clicking on every dead end to see which one you missed. They've mixed in a fair amount of historical detail from the actual Jack the Ripper case, such as letters and so on, with fantasy and speculation. The most impressive part of the game is the authentic feel of fin de siecle New York City -- and that should tell you something.Still, it's an enjoyable enough way to spend a weekend. Parents, don't worry; there's no on-screen violence and very little gore (except for written descriptions in autopsy reports). The creepiness is all in the ambience.Be aware: There are a large number of bugs in the game, some of which will stop you in your tracks. Save early and often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother....","review":"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. First of all, I like games that make you think. This game is completely predictable. If you don't figure out something right away--you won't have to worry. Your cursor will figure it out for you. There are only a few logic puzzles, and even those are too easy. And if you like visiting the same locations over and over in a game, then this one's for you. I give it a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"The game has an interesting story, and the setup as a writer who is on the ripper's trail is pretty good.However, the game's technology is outdated, and its implementation overly buggy. Also, the gameplay itself is extremely dull. But I played through it all because the whole \\"Jack the Ripper\\" story kinda intrigues me anyway. Now I do not want to spoil the game for you by telling you the ending, but really, there simply isn't much to spoil. It was not worth it at all.This is one of those games with a real story. It makes you wish that there were more games with a story like this. But then you realize how bad this is actually implemented and you kinda lose hope for the whole genre...If I were you, I'd steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like to repeat yourself..","review":"Since other reviews touched on gameplay and it's graphics, I just want to say this...1. Sure, your surroundings are a pretty picture.. but I like games that are interactive. I want to go through drawers, look closer at pictures.. do something besides run around busy rooms that you can do nothing but run through.2. The plot is weak. I won't spoil the story-line, but each in game day you pretty much go to the same places, talking to the same people. You have to meet certain requirements to make the game progress, and non of it is interesting.The one thing I did like about the game, there are a couple real nice songs you can listen to while you play, or just wait in one of the bars and listen.Unfortunately, I got this as a present for my mom, thinking it would be a puzzle game and be creepy. Buzz, wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead End","review":"At the beginning of this game you feel like you're really going to solve a mystery but in places it gets really tedious and leaves a cliff hanger at the end.

That is all I can find good to say about this game. The ending was very disappointing to me. What a let down. The game play itself was boring and dragged on ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Flow Very Well","review":"I bought this game because I wanted to play a game that was intriguing and mysterious. Well, it turns out that this game is frustrating at best, because of its linear play. This game doesn't allow the player to do anything out of order, which results in time-consuming wandering back and forth between locations, or praying that something different happens the 100th time you visit a location. I found myself very frustrated with the narrowness of this game, and don't recommend it to anyone. The only reason why it gets 2 stars is because of the environment is very realistic, and one gets a good feel for early 1900's life, as well as the fact that the music and acting are actually done quite well. However, some sound bites cut off right in the middle of a sentence, which has the player wondering what was said. Finally, there are misspelled words and factual errors, such as the World Series in 1901. This game isn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detective work","review":"I thought this was a very interesting game.

I also love this particular topic, so I was all set to play it. There were a few times it crashed, but luckily after the first time, I remembered to save, save, save, and it helped a lot. I have to say this though, the game ends rather abruptly. It was like being side-swiped, and then realizing it's all over. There was no real conclusion to the game, I guess it was meant to lead on to something else, but like the character in the game, you really don't find out who really did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Never Worked!

Volume 2 is actually a compilation of both Slayers OVAs. I cannot say it is without fault; however, owing to the fact that the two discs in this set were made at different times with a long gap between them. The older of the two looks noticeably lower in quality in comparison to the newer disc which was released for the first time in 2007. Quality differences aside, the story lines are compelling, focused and funny, but best of all, it is the same price as Volume 1 which only contains the first disc. A worthy addition to any anime aficionado's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of this book but found it rather tedious somewhere in the middle after the \\"mysterious\\" character showed up.

In a nutshell, I was very disappointed when I got to the end of the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too predictible","review":"This book was way too predictible, you know the \\"big secret\\" about 100 pages in.

Whereas everybody and their friggin uncle are judging him all the time. I admire the writer who can say what he has to say and stand by those words. I've seen Vollmann on book tour twice here in Chicago. The first was for Butterfly Stories and the second was for The Atlas. When he asked the small crowd of students at Northwestern University who had read the Atlas, I raised my hand and told him that the Rifles was a better book. Some of the students snickered and Vollmann replied \\"Well that's a good book to.\\" Honestly it took several readings of the Atlas to finally appreciate it.

Let's face it, these guys unfortunately are an unjustly kept secret. Bellybutton is one of those albums that proves a project can be get screwed by the marketing department. However, despite the lack of respect and with a song list as strong as this, it still leaves the listener wondering \\"How in the hell did pop music do this to me?\\". One run through and you'll feel like you've been licked to the very edge of death by a puppy dog. The songs will stick to your brain like juji-fruit on a molar, but they're so good you won't mind.

I believe the dark glasses and dark clothing were just the way he wanted to market himself....to stand out from the crowd....not because of some deep dark pain as Mr. Lehman suggests.....But, then again, I thought (mistakenly) this book was going to be an biography, not an analytical writing.Sorry about that..~Cissy"},{"rating":"2","title":"gc2000pe garbage disposal","review":"arrived quickly, the install in my new kitchen was easy.it runs on test. have no doubts it will do so after Imove in."},{"rating":"2","title":"get this says me","review":"If you're familiar w/ broken beat all I can say is this is the best album in the genre I've ever heard.

Sometimes it's a tad on the 'jazz-lite' tip but it mostly avoids that.

However, I did enjoy this one. And that's because the story wasn't overfilled with the annoying sidekicks, Illuminada and Betty.Both characters have outworn themselves in this series, having turned into a couple of unlikeable, stereotypical caricatures. Illuminada, the impatient Cuban, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a \\"chiquita\\" and looking at her watch. Betty, the controlling African-American, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a \\"girlfriend\\" and barking out orders. These two got old a long time ago, and the series is just so much more enjoyable when Bel is interacting with Sol, Ma, Sofia, Wendy, her kids and her students.Hopefully the author has realized this and the series will continue in a positive manner, as it did with this installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than 1 month","review":"I bought this hair dryer and had to return it in less than 1 month, when the on/off/setting switch broke.

Also, I kept inadvertently pushing the cool button, since it is also in that area. Also, it was very heavy - My bicep on my right arm is bigger than my left now!

All of the usual cliches surrounding Benedict Arnold and his act of treason were fresh in my mind as I opened the front cover. But as I read the letters and diary entries in the words of both conspiritors, and allowed myself to feel the fears and passions of the time, I found myself questioning our current representation of those events in our history books. Were Benedict Arnold and John Andre dastardly, unscrupulous men? Or were they devoted patriotic soldiers from opposing sides who simply could no longer bear the price of war? The author examines the events that let up to that infamous act through the hearts and minds of Arndre and Arnold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to keep it up!!","review":"I had purchase this playard for my sister's baby shower because this product has everything!

Why, this feeder has to many disadvantages. The problems I encountered with this feeder were, It's too hard to clean, it's not even squirrel proof, it discoureges cardinals, doesn't look nice, paint chips, can't acessorize it, and the seed ports are too small. Now I replaced this feeder with a Wild birds unlimited tube feeder and it's a lot beeter and looks great. Cardinals come to my new feeder a lot more and I get more birds unlike this peice of junk. I can clean it with ease and I can attach a tray to keep the ground cleaner. So if you want a tube feeder that will last many years, get a wild birds unlimited tube feeder or a droll yankees. (Wild birds unlimited carries that too). The feeders I reccomended might be a few more dollars than this bad feeder but it's worth it!

The book certainly gives you a different look at stretching, though I had learned many of the techniques when I was a Martial Artist and Special Forces Soldier I have never seen it broken down into easy to understand articulate writings before this. Pavel has done an excellent job with this subject giving good lessons from history just as he has done before with kettle bells, free weights and body weight exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"Like most of this author's books, this one falls far short of all the hype and promises. The table of contents promises a lot but delivers little. The information isn't bad, its just that there is very little of it here. Most of the exercises are things you can find in any stretching book, yoga class, or martial arts class.I would recommend Kurz's Stretching Scientifically,or almost any other stretching book, over this book any day! The author really doesn'tdeserve your money for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am touching my toes!!","review":"I have been actively applying the techniques taught in the book for about a month and have seen results. I was what you would call SUPER stiff. I haven't touched my toes since.......a long time. Well, I am now seated on the floor toe touching for a good 30 seconds and more. For me this alone is more than worth the price. That said, for some the price of the book may be steep and perhaps the info is in other books out there. For me it was the right book at the right time. A lower price would have made it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, undersized","review":"This book is nothing more than big fonts, huge spacing, and large pictures to take up a lot of pages. For the price, you could buy two good books on stretching and get triple or more the information (Kurz is a good place to start). There's absolutely nothing new or fantastic about any of the ideas here, and he only has one or two stretches presented for each part of the body. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the book is a fast read and isn't the absolute worst place to start if you've never stretched before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insight","review":"The book is very informative and offers some new insights or avenues on flexibility. Nevertheless, it uses terms that would be unfamiliarized by novices or beginners. In addition, more details should be included when describing how to perform individual exercises. In general, it is a very good reference and companion book if you also own the video/DVD copy on the same title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author should give away for other materials for free to make up the differences. This is the same type of hype that the HIT stuff from Mentzer and the other false authors. Many claims yet little delivery. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and easy to use","review":"The book contains new ways of stretching....and they work wonders. I have 21 years of Taekwondo and a few years of Yoga and Hapkido under my belt, but I have never been able to preform a full sidesplit. And I have been working hard at it. But now after only two days of Pavel Tsatsouline's ways of stretching I gained 2 inch and I am nearly all the way down. I think it speaks for itself. Pavel's book is very easy to understand and put into action, and it makes perfect sense. I'm just sorry that I didn't get this book years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Substance to Outweigh the Hype","review":"Pavel clearly knows some good drills for improving flexibility. However, it's clear that with this more complicated topic, he can't produce anything remotely as innovative as 'Naked Warrior' or 'Power to the People'.As I said, Pavel knows some good drills and what he does would probably work. However, there are better books on the subject. Tom Kurz' 'Stretching Scientifically' comes to mind.Unfortunately, Pavel's charisma doesn't really shine through and the hype doesn't save the book from being relegated to also-ran status in the flexibilty manual stakes.I will say, however, his flexibilty video does better in terms of motivation and this book would work reasonably well with that video. The same can be said of Kurz' video and book, too, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you mean your not flexible?","review":"I ask as if I didn't have the flexibility of a fence post 4 months ago.This was my first purchase, in a long list of Tsatsouline products I now own, from Pavel Tsatsouline. My flexibility was terrible and the old stretches from my highschool years just didn't do it. One thing lead to another and this book and its author came to my attention.Suffice it to say that \\"...the flexibility of a mutant.\\" becomes your goal once you see the gains. Pavel is in typical form here providing great info and great stretches. If you pay attention as I did, you will become quite fond of the cossack and crawling lizard in no time.Buy it, your body has been screaming for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feet of Clay","review":"I learned from this book about so called leaders who have managed to gather followers and how they 'rule' them.

The sound quality just isn't there.As far as programming ringers into the phone, well, I hope you remember algebra. If you download the ringtoneconverter from Vtech's website a program is provided to convert midi to approprite key presses. The final result sounds nothing like the midi, or anything close...and the method to enter notes is ABSURD!It has nice aesthetic qualities, it would probably be best for a kid's phone, that is about it.

I finally caved and went to Target to get it for her. I returned home and set it up and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally after a day and a half of letting the phone charge it still didn't work and was a disappointment. I was disgusted! So I returned it back to Target and went out and bought the same phone from Best Buy. I charged the phone for the suggested 10 hours and it works great and my sister loves it. She uses all the features and has special ring tones set up for different people, if you are going to buy this phone, take my advice and go to another retailer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Try Again? Or NOT!","review":"Well the first time I brought this phone, there was a malfunction and wouldnt connect with my phone line. So I returned it but decided to give it another shot and I'm happy that I did. This is a great phone and I'm going to love it even more in college. The ringers are unique and the phone overall is just good. I love the fact that you can change the colors to match different areas. I dont have any static problems or any problems at all for that matter. Even if I did the phone has a limited 1 year warranty and a number you can call for help. This one is a winner in my book! Other say that had problems, maybe they have a phone that has a defect? It could happen, so just try again but with the same phone, its worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone!","review":"There must be somthing wrong with the phones that people are complaining about cuz mine is great and awsome and i love it and have no problems with it i saw this phone in the store and decided to order it here cause it was cheaper so i bought it despite the bad reviews it got cause if it had problems i could just return it anyways so i got it and its great i recommend anyone to get it whats the worst that could happen it dosint work? so send it back and get a full refound its worth a try just cause some peoples didint work dosint mean yours wont right? one thing though it says Changeable faceplates in 5 fashionable patterns but i olny have four red, yellow, blue and orange and shows olny those in the Pic but another great thing about it you can get any song using VTECHS program and your MIDI file to get anysong you want! i havint done it yet so i cant tell you if it works but i will try soon and i asum it works"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the bad reveiws?","review":"Why all the bad reveiws? this phone is cool and works good! everything worked for me, and i really liked the phone directory that can hold up to 50 phone numbers. i also liked the caller id and the cool ring tones. anyway, this phone is definately a teenager phone and it worked great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissatisfied","review":"I just had to have this phone because I like the different ring tones on it, but when I finally bought the phone and brought it home and started using it after charging it. It has ALOT of static in it, it has also cut me off of my conversations with my kids teacher and I was very upset. I'am currently looking for another phone after only having this one for less than six months. My advise to people looking to buy a phone is &quot;DO NOT BUY THIS ONE OR THE ONE WITH THE ANSWERING SYSTEM!&quot;"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I bought this phone and 3 months later it wouldn't work right. I would talk on it for about 10 minutes and it would start to make noise and I couldn't hear the person on the phone. And then it would cut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought one of these and had to have the company send me a new one. All that I had was constant static and the caller id call waiting didn't work. I decided to return the first one and send the second one back to the company. Save your money and time and aggravation. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"The idea of this phone was good, and it was awesome they had different color plates, yet... I got this phone about a year ago, waited for it to charge... for a week... yes I gave it a week, and nothing happened, nothing worked. Now it sits in the closet. This phone would have been fun, too bad it didn't work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Frustrating","review":"I've read some of the reviews here and they all seem to be either really for or against this phone. I would be on the against side. I purchased my phone some 6 months ago through my local phone company. For the first 2-3 month it worked great. I had the ring tones prgramed and the graphics were cute. Then one day I got a call, went to answer and the phone wouldn't let me. It would say \\"connecting...\\" then go straight back to \\"ringing.\\" Eventually after my friend called me for the third time I could answer the phone. Once the conversation was over I went to hang up and could not. No problem, just put it on the base. Since then I have been frustrated by my phone on almost every incoming or outgoing call I've tried to make with it, eventually I just stopped using it all together. If you want a phone that will last for any lenght of time, I do not recommend this phone. Even those people whose phones are working should watch out, it's not going to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Connect sign!!!!","review":"I have bought this phone here in Amazon months ago and I still can't make it work!!!. Everytime I connect it, appears a sign: \\"NO CONNECT\\", I tried several times here in my house and other friends's house and never worked. The same problem: \\"No Connect\\".Now I have here a beautifull phone wich never worked !!.I can't change it because I live outside USA, I sent it by mail, when I purchased, to a friend' house in NY. Now I have to come back there for change it or fix it? TOO EXPENSIVE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"This is the second V-tech phone that I've owned that completely stopped working after a few months. I've never had any luck with V-tech. The phone stops working and is unable to be fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This phone has some cool features with the different ring tones and the changeable face plates. But I ended up returning this phone because the static is horrible, even switching the channels does nothing. The static is worse than the twenty dollar GE phone I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone i ever bought","review":"i thought you know maybe this phone would be cool for the dorm, ive had it for a little over a year now and its horrible, granted the changeable faceplates and ringers are neat but it has very poor reception, i keep losing a signal, then i get this weird noise when im on the phone the person im talking to can hear me but i can't hear them and end result of that is i have to put it back on the charger for a few mins. its just a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away!!","review":"Bought and charged it overnite excited about its features then when its time to use it, its got horrible sound after few minutes. I used it for about 5 minutes then went to work. When I came back at night I used it again for about 10 mins and the phone cut me off! The battery is dead! I can't believe it. One day standby time, hissing sound after about 5 minute talking is enough for me to go back to Target. Bye bye Vtech that is my first and last phone from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but not a good product","review":"I saw this phone and fell in love with the fact that it played we will rock by queen. Once I got it home it worked for awhile until I put a powerstrip in my room. Within a week I started to get awful static regardless of where I was in the house. After calling customer service they tell me that this particular phone doesn't work anywhere near a powerstrip! (something that was NOT in the manual!) For all the cute littile features it has it really doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"I love the idea behind this phone, stylish, cool ringtones, graphics, and of course the face plates. A friend of mine had it and loved it, so, even after reading bad reviews for it, decided to buy it. Mistake. It worked great for the first week, then it started acting strangely. First, I noticed that not all the calls were detected on the caller id. It seemed like the calls detected were the ones that were answered. The next thing was awful static in the middle of phone calls, not every call though. The only way to get beyond the static was to hang up and call them back on a different phone. Then it just started cutting out in the middle of calls. After that I returned it and ended up buying refurbished Unidens (My previous phone was electrocuted by lightning and they don't make the model anymore). Two refurbished phones for the price of this, and NO problems at all...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashionable DUD","review":"I bought this phone and 3 months later I am looking for another phone. The battery life is really poor-the handset is suposed to warn you when it needs charging and it doesn't. If I talk even close to 20 mins I get static on my end so bad I cannot hear. The only cure for this is to put the phone on the base. It will not turn off, change channels or anything else unless this is done- which means you can't talk any longer and you have no warning. I really would not purchase this phone again. The ringer options are cute although some only sound remotely like the songs they are suposed to. I would not reccomend this phone and if you buy it I hope you have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first now I don't like it at all","review":"When I bought the phone less then a year ago I loved all the cool features about it. Now I am searching for a new one because when I am talking to someone all of a sudden they will be able to hear me but I can't hear them, all I hear is static on the line, pretty aggervating. This is a hassle I have to place the phone back on the charger a wait a few minutes. I have lost important calls because of it. I paid a higher price for this phone, I don't think it is even worth it's current price, sorry. I recommend you continue your search, I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - don't buy","review":"Nice LOOKING phone but useless, as it stopped working after only one month! I was so frustrated I threw it in the garbage, didn't even want to bother with the warranty. Should have recycled it though.. Too bad I had to give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone!","review":"When I got the phone I was already amazed by the face plates then I got into the ring tones and got even more amazed. Once it was charged up and ready to go I called 3 different people and there were no problems, at all. No static. There must be something wrong with the other peoples phone connection because I am 100% satisfied with this product and suggest it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great features, BAD phone","review":"I bought the phone because of the cool features like the ring tones and the faceplates, which all that was cool and as promised. But when it came time to actually talk on the phone, IT FAILS MISSERABLE the phone makes a clicking/popping noise when you are talking to anyone. It sounds like someone keeps pushing the flash button in the middle of your conversation, but 20 times per conversation. I loved the features and as much as I didn't want a boring phone, I had to face it. If you want a cool ringing phone this is it, but if you actually plan on talking on it, I'd shop elsewhere. And the funniest part is, is that I read a review of the same problem with popping on the line and I said &quot;oh well it was probably just hers, I want the cool phone and it is worth it&quot; Well I WAS WRONG, KEEP YOUR RECIEPT"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"This was the second Vtech I have bought in six months. The first one ended up having a talk time of about one minute and then would die. We bought a new battery and alas, same result. We headed off the the store and bought this piece of work! We have now had our phone for three months, and again, a one minute talk time, and the receiver fills with static. The battery is fully charged, there is no low battery warning, and the caller can still here you, as you curse and get up to get another phone!!!
