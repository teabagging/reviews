Im a guitar player wanting to play slide and I grabbed this book/cd off the rack. It doesnt really seem like this book is trying to start you from the ground up by teaching easy techniques then putting them together. It just kind of gives you some tab for an exercise, a track on the CD, the teacher talks while playing some neat sounding stuff, but never tells you HOW to do it. Sure, the tab is there, but give me some more guidance dude. Not much technique is ever given aside from the absolute basics. From there the book jumps to harder licks without giving enough guidance.Two Thumbs Down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LB has gone crazy!","review":"Lewis Black is dealing with the fact he's sixty, and in this special reminiscing to childhood about how sixty year olds looked to him is hilarious, and very true.

If you want to hear rap with good beats buy something else! Like Nelly, Murphy Lee, Ras Kass, Dr. Dre, XZibit, Outkast/Big Boi.... actually, I'd rather hear someone tap on a window and beat box over it than listen to him rap about his 3 minute cameo on Spider Man as a feature role.

Look at it this way, there's always a good chance that you could sign with the WWE and end up forming a new tag team with John Cena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macho can't rap..

But I heard the songs on the net (no, I didn't use kazaa to listen to the songs and not waste my money...)How does a wrestler challenge another wrestler outside of a wrestling organization? Wrestling is fake. Has Macho lost it? He wants to \\"wrestle\\" Hogan. Neither of them are even in the WWE! This doesn't make sense.Now, onto the cd...All I can say is that I truly feel less intelligent after having listened to it. I actually think I have become dumber as a result...Don't worry about me.

I can't believe this is the same person who put on that Wrestlemania 3 classic way back when. Randy Savage is losing his touch with reality fast. From his downright lousy attempt to call out Hulk Hogan to his pathetic meaningless rhymes, I think it's safe to say that no 50 year old washed up wrestler is allowed within the vicinities of the world of rap. I read an article which said that Savage has recently started to enjoy the music of Eminem and Run DMC. This album proves that absolutely anyone can make a rap CD to satisfy his ego as long as he has enough name credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!!!","review":"Macho Man's album is great! Granted, he's not a rapper, but it is what it is. It's a fun album with a variety of songs. Sometimes funny, sometimes serious,but nonetheless great songs, banging tracks and very well produced.

Whats he going to do to Hogan, a drive by closeline?! If I were Hulk Hogan I wouldnt even bother answering this crap. I would just let the critics rip this cd to shreds and have a good laugh! I love the part where he talks about his \\"feature\\" role in spiderman...I agree with that one guy who said it was a cameo role lol, besides in the movie he gets his ass kicked by Toby McGuire so thats not really something you should be singing about in a rap song about wanting someone to be a man.

This is a total joke. What the hell is up with people saying that THIS changed their lives? I had to put on a pair of pampers after reading the first few reviews. It was hilarious. Anyways, this is a totally disgraceful attempt to be filed under the genre of hip hop. If you wanna hear a guy with candy paint colored skin and a ridiculous voice rap, buy this cd. In fact, buy eight like that other idiot suggested. There's only one thing worse than being a joke and that's a bad joke. Ridiculous! I have a good mind to go to the Big Boss Man about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIEVEABLE!!!","review":"wow all you people have to be nuts by giving this 5 stars. first of all just the thought of randy savage making a RAP cd makes me laugh. but i thought i would listen to the samples on amazon and see how horrable it really is. then i saw all the 5 star reviews and thought either all these people are crazy or mabe the album really is......well no they have to be crazy. so after listening i have concluded that if you want a rap cd that you can just sit back and laugh at how pathetic it is then this is the one for you!!! because when randy talks normally he runs out of breath after about every word, so just think how he would sound trying to rap, ok thought about it. well that is exactly how it sounds, horrable!!! listen to the samples and you'll see why you should not waste your money on this. so if you just like randy savage so much that you gotta have anything with his name on it then go get it but if you want music then you don't want this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"Wow, this came out recently?

You bet.","review":"The songs on this CD have shown me a sensitivity and a depth of character that I just knew were hidden beneath Randy Savage's manly television brovado. Here's a man who just wants to love and be loved, but, like most wrestlers and wrestling fans just won't peek out of the closet long enough to find the affection he needs. His brave lyrics cry out from a life spent so close to his fellow wrestlers, yet so very far away. If you love wrestling, and you love wrestlers, don't let this CD pass you by."},{"rating":"1","title":"dear...lord.","review":"what the hell is happening here? Macho Man has a rap CD?

The genre of rap/hip-hop is pathetic. So thank goodness for Mach-O takin' it to the rack with this scorched earth policy rap conquest. Like the Sex Pistols laid waste to 70's bloated stadium concert banality, and Nirvana deflated the big hair bands, so to does Macho take rap back to ground zero. This is what rap was meant to be, before so many Huggy Bears and Roosters started shakin' their Rolies in the hot tub for the video shoot at their manager's house... until they fall off. One album, one shot, one full scale launch, and Macho makes you forget the last pathetic 10 years of rap -- (The Chronic and everything after)."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"The lyrics flow into your brain as if you were listening to a smooth jazz tune. The meaning behind the songs on this album is sensational and I am still slightly aroused. Listening to it makes you feel like you are right next to Macho Man while hes beating somebodys face in. The echos of Slick Rick, Big L, and Tupac are in his voice and his charisma. He will sure be the rise of the biggest thing to come from rap. He is an amazing lyricist bring a country swagger with a little bit of urban culture. His flow reminds me of Easy E and I am sure that he has all the moves to back it up.

He flows like a poet touching the air ever so softly with genious lyrics like, \\"we came to party hard, yo you don't need that weapon\\". He also has lyrics that show how hard a life he has had, and you really empathize with the struggles the \\"macho man\\" has dealt with in the wwf.

Macho Man needs to stick to slim jim commercials and if thinks of coming out with another cd please i hope he gets shot to death because nobody can take torture like this cd. If you think about buying this cd your a moron and you need to kill yourself. This cd belongs in the garbage along with macho mans career in anything. ooooooohhhhhhhhhhh yeah this cd is piece of crap. Don't buy this cd unless your ready yo die.

It is not a place for the Macho Man to be stompin around in. After I listened to the Intro to this album I realized I was bleeding profusely from my eyes and ears. The next track gave me the runs and the last track almost gave me a heart attack. I hope Macho Man is brought up for crimes against humanity and a coalition of the willing (Hulkster, Ultimate Warrior, Tom Mulherin) stop this godless creature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macho Man makes a statement with Be A Man","review":"After years of hard work and dedication in the wrestling business, Macho Man Randy Savage proves that today's modern man is a multi-tasker. Be A Man combines soothing lyrics to hip beats and creates an aural experience never heard before. He shows his versatility in songs such as Be A Man, where he aggressively \\"disses\\" rival Hulk Hogan, and songs like A Perfect Friend, where his tender side is revealed in a ballad-like eulogy to his fallen ally in the squared circle, Kurt Hennig. I give the album three thumbs up and hope that you all can enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"words cannot explain","review":"at first i heard macho man randy savage made an album from my friend. we had a good laugh about how funny it would be and i decide to look for his site to see if it was true and to listen to a few of his songs. so i listen to them, and to tell you the truth, i was absolutely disgusted at this horrendous attempt at an album. This is an abhorration. I want to knock some sense, or at least some teeth, into Macho Man after this one. I dont watch wrestling, but I know Randy Savage anyway. And I of course know who Hulk Hogan is. Randy Savage's thinly veiled \\"attack\\" on Hulk Hogan is quite simply the biggest joke I have ever heard. It's also the funniest things I have ever heard, and my jaw dropped when I heard it. Is Randy Savage out of his mind? Does he really think that Hulk Hogan will accept his \\"challenge\\"? They are professional wrestlers. Your feud is pure fabrication. IT IS NOT REAL! This is a joke. Don't even consider buying it. DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke - and a Bad one at that!","review":"Randy is a joke and so is this cd.

It was too funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing Your Sensitive Side","review":"Man, words can barely describe how much I love this album. I love it when the Macho Man shows off his sensitive side in a few of the songs. He loves to see them ladies shaking their \\"thang\\" at the club. No doubt. Where is the Miss Elizabeth tribute song? But the Mr. Perfect one is one of the best I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"ohhhhhhh NO!","review":"This is proof that a little bad advice can go a long way. It was apparently a chance meeting between savage and Big3 records chairman Bill Edwards that produced this joke of a CD. Mr Edwards should have been dragged out in the street and shot. Savage actually tried to promote this thing down in florida, and was heckled to the point of throwing down the microphone. Even funnier is the fact that his road agent is Bryan Adams( Demolition Crush ) of Kronik. I will say this, if you must buy this thing, buy two..one to burn and the other to keep the fire going."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke","review":"I liked Macho Man as a wrestler, but after hearing this album, I thought to myself \\"What is this mess.\\" I was appalled. Why would someone who had a large run in the WWE and WCW and had plenty of money to fall back on produce a CD full of garbage and boring one-line insults at past opponents? I still don't have an answer to that question. All I do have to say is DO NOT buy this CD at all costs. Unless you're a die hard Macho Man fan and want to hang this CD on the wall, other wise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC","review":"I feel bad for the poor souls who not only purchased this cd, but the ones whos ears even came in contact with this horrible garbage.

Macho man, i will pray to god, allah, buddah, jesus and maybe even satan that you are shot to death in a drive by...possibly by a old man riding a lawn mower just for comedic value.The fact that you're forced to give this album no less than 1 star on here already qualifies it as being overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most awesome thing in the Universe","review":"I must confess that the title of this review is somewhat misleading. It is not actually THE most awesome thing in the universe.

Get in the ring and buy this wonderful album now! Macho Man will be touring, and I hear Bono of U2 is really into his message and might appear on stage with him.

The performers are as would be expected, have heard Molly, Jay and Hampson for years and they certainly are familiar with this genre. They could've performed with their shoes off a bit more..The struggle is that nothing, absolutely nothing beats the 1977 Nonesuch Leslie Guinn and the late Jan de Gaetani double recordings of this music. They are heartbreakingly beautiful and so evoke the time like few others. The singers are \\"art\\" singers, no doubt, but as an earlier posting observed, Foster is the American Schubert. Nonesuch slapped together a single CD of these recordings- an ill-advised and boorish effort on their part, but the fragments that remain are transcendent. Long may the red rose live always............"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING PROGRAMMING","review":"I was surprised that Thomas Hampson chose to sing so few of Stephen Foster's most famous songs on this recording. Of those he sings, some are performed in a character that I do not believe is in keeping with the period. While the chosen instrumentation is one possible interpretation of the sound of the period, it lacks variety and fails to convey the importance of the rather formal parlor song as Foster's forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISMAYED FOLK MUSIC FAN","review":"I love Stephen Foster. I grew up singing his greatest songs: Oh! Susanna, Camptown Races, Old Folks At Home. Much to my dismay, Mr. Hampson does not sing Foster's most famous songs on this CD! The instrumental renditions are fine, but I miss the immortal Foster lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great AMERICAN music","review":"Stephen Foster, who lived in Pennsylvania, wrote some of the most memorable songs about the American South in the times leading up to the Civil War. This recording by fine baritone Thomas Hampson celebrates most of Foster's well-known tunes. The accompaniment is \\"minimalist,\\" consisting mostly of stringed instruments or piano, and contributes to the authentic feeling. Hampson is joined by other vocalists (including guest Garrison Keillor on a couple of cuts). Highly recommended for Stephen Foster fans, Civil War buffs, southerners, folk music enthusiasts, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous","review":"This is the best Randall Price book todate. His research and commitment to preparing this incrediable book is tremendous. The documentation and placement of scripture references are so helpful. This temple study leaves all others behind.

I also use it consistantly as an on-going bibical reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite toy!","review":"This is my 3 year old son's favorite toy. He needed help with it at first, but now he is able to do all four puzzles on his own. He puts the puzzles together over and over again each day. The size makes it a great toy to travel with. It is the perfect puzzle for a child who is ready to move on from the bigger wooden puzzles with the knobs. My only complaint is that the box should be slightly bigger. My son sometimes has trouble shutting the lid of the box when he puts all the pieces away. A bigger box would solve that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Last Ilsa Feature","review":"The last Ilsa picture is no better or worse than the other exploitation flicks with this character. Definitely started out with the same premise of Ilsa in charge of an oppressive violent group, but there was a nice change in plot to keep it interesting. Death scenes were laughably outrageous. There was some really sexy moments, too; Dyanne Thorne is as beautiful as ever. I found it interesting and enjoyable. Well worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the Ilsa's - she tortures men!?","review":"Technically probably the soundest, but the least entertainingof the Ilsa movies.

While many of the tunes are valiant attempts at recreating the original themes we all love, this CD does not contain the original themes and this is evident throughout the CD.

But i do disagree with Ruffian's placing. she was the greatest filly of all time with an undefeated record. I wish Blood-Horse would give her more credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"War\\" not enough Secretariat","review":"Man o' War was a great horse, but he was no Secretariat. Secretariat still owns the Kentucky Derby record and the world record on dirt at a mile and a half. In my opinion, Man o' War should be ranked behind both Secretariat and Citation. This book disappoints in its information on Secretariat and greats, other than MOW. There are other books containing much more information than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star because the bloodhorse...","review":"...editors are idiots. *secret* when the editors voted secretariat was firmly in first place with only one editor left to vote, and he LEFT OFF secretariat as one of the top thoroughbreds of the 20th century so man o'war could take first prize. what a putz! man o'war was great, but charlie hatton, longtime editor of the daily racing form who saw BOTH horses run in person always said that secretariat was the finest racehorse ever ('the pinnacle of achievement in thoroughbred racing, the finest example of the blooded horse'). can't argue with secretariat's 22 pound heart, largest on record."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"If there ever was a horse better than Secretariat, he would have had to spread his wings and fly!!

The author does not know what he's talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"War\\" is on","review":"I think this book had a great write-up of racehorses. Man o War is definitley the horses of the century. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of information. I wish they included more info on the top 20 horses. Otherwise a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated But Still Excellent","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book and the surprising ending. However, everyone seems to think that this is the best book by Christie but it isn't. I really liked it but she's written better and the plot is not exciting. The atmosphere and setting are all excellently detailed as well the excellent solution. A worthy read and you sould definatly pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you find out who did it, you'll kick yoursel!","review":"This is an excellent book. A masterpiece of crime fiction. If you always wanted to be a detective, here's your chance. The clues are there. This is a book that once you pick it up, you'll struggle to put it down.I must say though, I found the ending a bit morbid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Review","review":"Christie's \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" leaves you both breathless and puzzled. There is little action to recommend in the middle, so it can be a boring read at certain points. You want so badly to know WHO. As with all of Christie's mysteries, everyone is a suspect, and if you don't pay acute attention, you'll miss the clues. The ending was a shocker for me. I highly recommend this book, despite it's tedious middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait so long?!","review":"It was a long time between Agatha reads for me and now I wonder why I've left it so long. That funny little man Poirot is an absolute fav and the way that Ms Christie keeps me guessing right until the very end is amazing, every time she gets me."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Murder on the Orient Express","review":"This mystery is one, if not THE, best Poirot mystery I have read yet. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is up there with Murder on the Orient Express with it's unique plot, red herrings, characters, and the amazing ending.The plot revolves around a suicide of an older woman and the murder of a man by the name of Roger Ackroyd. It is told from the perspective of Dr. Shepperd, the town doctor. The ending of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one-of-a-kind. The culprit was a complete surprise to me. The answer was there all along, so obvious, and yet so concealed. A great mystery overall."},{"rating":"1","title":".....the story just wasn't entertaining","review":"Being a fan of past mystery book I have read, especially \\"And Then There Were None\\" by Agatha Christie I had no trouble picking up \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" The plot became a monotonous listing of facts and clues through dialog. It would've been almost impossible to predict the mystery through nearly the entire story with the given information. The end finally picked up and kept me interested, but the rest of the story just wasn't entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Clever","review":"First off, I was indeed surprised at the end. I had the unexpected displeasure of reading this book in bits and pieces over 3 weeks. So the subtle little clues alluded to at the end, in hindsight, I actually questioned at the time, but the time between readings let any questions be forgotten. So when the murderer was revealed I was a little ticked for not remembering these things.Oh, well. It was a very enjoyable read and I suggest it be read over a day or two paying close attention to the night of the murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Missed!","review":"I truly believe that if this book were released today, for the first time, it would be a hit. The mystery here is outstanding. This is a book to be enjoyed and savored. The problem is, you will be in such a hurry to figure out who the suspect is, you will race through the book in no time at all.Do yourself a favor and enjoy The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery, by Agatha Christie. It is a 5 star book. It is a true testament to the author's talents that over 80 years later, the novel is being re-released as a hardback. I expect nothing less than a new legion of fans to discover the fun of a Christie novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!","review":"This book is considered by many people to be one of the best mysteries ever published. In my opinion it ranks right up there with Conan-Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles, as a mystery. Agatha Christie relied on the convolutions of unraveling a mystery to motivate and pull a plot, along with a great many red-herrings.In this Mystery she employes one of the cleverest and rather subtle red-herring ever in a mystery.I warmly recomend this mystery. Its well written, well paced and exceptionally clever.The ending will shock you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Having read most of her books, Agatha Christie still outwits me. Very seldom one can guess the final outcome of her books and this is one of the very typical specimens. Actually, all her books offer surprises and this particular one offers nothing less. I would say it's another masterpiece of hers though the revelation of the real murderer actually saddens my heart.(Yes, very much....)I agree with one of the reviews that say the best books of Agatha Christie are And Then There Were None and The Murder On The Orient Express. (Try The Secret Adversary also).But the reviewer made a mistake by saying The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the first book of Poirot; actually it's not, that should be The Mystery Affair at Styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK FIRST!","review":"This is one of Christie's best stories. Considering how many mysteries she wrote, her most successful ones are those which turn the conventions of mysteries on their ear. Murder on the Orient Express did this, and so does Roger Ackroyd. The thing is, DON'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BEFOREHAND. People are so up-in-arms over the secret, they keep giving it away.Just read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best Christie","review":"It is so difficult to write a review of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd without spoilers, however, this is absolutely the best book by one of the finest mystery writers ever. Christie was a master at developing a solid plotline, laying out all the clues for those of us with the gray cells to assimilate them and put them all together. The mystery is one of her earlier ones and is a classic dead body in a room story. Poirot works with Dr. Sheppard, from whose point of view the story is told, to interview all the suspects and at the end puts everything together in a way that leaves us hitting ourselves over the head for not having seen what was right in front of our eyes.There are those who have argued that Christie cheated on the ending, which has a true surprise twist, but I think that her ending is one of the most brilliant plot devices ever used. She absolutely lays everything out, all the clues are there for us to see. This book is a work of genius from a brilliant writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites Christie's!","review":"It's one of my favorite Christie's because I actually was able to figure out who murdered Roger Ackroyd -a very very rare thing for me with her books. The reason I loved it and it wasn't spoiled for me, is because throughout the remainder of the book (from where I picked up on something) I watched all the little cunning tricks laid out for readers to follow...truly awe inspiring.This is a great Christie to read after reading at least a dozen others of hers..you'll remember why you appreciate her uniqueness. The setting, the timing, the characters, the plot, they are all superb and it amazes me that this was such an early novel of her mystery writing career. Trust me, read several before reading this one and you'll appreciate it so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"one of agatha christies best novels. it was fun to follow and enough clues were given so that i could figure out who the killer was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read !","review":"Excellent book for a read on a journey.

It was my first foray into Christie's world and I was surprised at how thoroughly I enjoyed this mystery novel. Christie is a gifted writer and this one will keep you guessing to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've never read Christie before, begin here!","review":"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was the first Christie I ever read - and it's a real masterpiece. The ending is pretty horrifying, but read the book again, and you'll wonder why you didn't notice various things - things the Murderer/Murderess (I'm not saying which it is!)said and did during the novel, that one didn't notice at the time. Extremely good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspect everyone!","review":"I am so glad our bookclub chose this- its my first christie and it won't be my last. It was amazing the subtle way the clues were introduced and how Poirot gets at the truth.

I was late for work because I needed to finish the book. No one writes like Dame Agatha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultivating vegetable marrow","review":"My husband and I listened to the audio version of this novel on a road trip. About halfway through the narrative, as we tried to figure out a solution to the mystery, my husband suggested one particular character might be the murderer. I scoffed at the idea since it was so unlikely and so outside the standard structure of a mystery. Guess what, he was right. Once again, Ms. Christie has turned the formula on its head and an intriguing story, one that makes you want to go back to the beginning and re-read it, is the result. No wonder this novel is on the list of the 20th Century's best mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius of a work. Mind-bending.","review":"Was telling myself subconsciously (or so I'd like to imagine) that it couldn't have been *that person* who committed the murder (when Poirot was in the midst of his exposition and the facts pointed to just one remaining suspect), but the mind really has a great capacity for denial...so I was really still surprised by the truth. (If you weren't and consider me an inutile...erm...well...Keep it to yourself! Haha!)This was heady rush of a whodunit. Enjoyed it immensely. Recommend it widely :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! BRAVO, BRAVO!!!","review":"Oh my God! This book is a complete masterpiece! Every element of a good book is found here, definately plot! As others have said, ou'll either love the ending or you'll hate it. I was just in awe. (It had me moaning) such brilliance! If you like this one, try Murder on the Orient Express, Sparkling Cyanide, and definately Curtain. (Her last book)I wish you could give this book more stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY fun twist!","review":"So this was the second Agatha Christie book that I read. And I read it immediatly following A Poirot Christmas. As much as I liked this one (probably more than the first), I think that it was a bad idea to read them back-to-back. Roger Ackroyd was very interesting and engaging, but even with that, I still got a little bored by the end. Luckily, she redeemed herself with the ending because it was an awesome twist that I didn't see coming, even though I tried really hard to think of all possibilities and reasons.The sister, Caroline, was a very funny supporting character in this novel. And Poirot seems to never disappoint.So I do highly recommend this book, but I feel like since it was so similar to A Poirot Christmas, that I should have read something else in between.I don't know HOW Christie thinks of such clever twists and turns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This book began to make to make sense in the beginning, but in the end, the true killer did not make any sense whatsoever.

There was no real motive provided..., it felt like a trick on the reader. I have found Christie's novels too far-fetched for me.

I also cook my quinoa in it and it comes out great."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, inexpensive rice cooker","review":"This is a great little rice cooker! It makes near perfect rice after making some adjustments. (and I think this is due more to my microwave than the cooker) Best of all, no mess. There is an inner lid on this one that helps keep froth from overflowing into the microwave, a problem common with these type of cookers. It also comes with a ladle and measuring cup, which I recommend using. You also don't have to worry about venting and unventing the cooker--just pop it in and go; take it out and let it set; then enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"But it is smaller than I imagined it would be. I did not pay attention to the size when I ordered and thought it would be the larger size of my previous such container.The design is exactly like my old microwave rice container.

So I don't want to spend to much on traditional rice cooker both in money and space. This set serves this purpose pretty nicely. It's light, cheap, small and easy to use. The only cons is the lid, which is not very easy to clean up after cooking. Even if you have a dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't make the best rice.","review":"I really hate to give low stars on products that I buy. I really wanted to love this microwave rice cooker, but I it wouldn't fully cook my rice. I ended up with a mix of cooked and halfway cooked rice. I followed the directions. I set the water to the right amount and set the microwave timer correctly. It might have been my microwave because I have a 800 watt microwave and the times in the directions seem to be made for 1000 watt microwaves. At any rate, for me, I kept it and will use it when I replace my microwave for a higher watt and I hope the rice will cook better.

If you like musicals, especailly Brigadoon, this CD is a perfect buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost definitive recording of a great work","review":"BRIGADOON finds on this CD a respectful, very thorough treatment. About the score, itself, little need be said other than \\"They do NOT write them like this anymore\\", more is the pity. The only problem with this recording is that it lacks any real chemistry, something that all \\"studio\\" casts have to battle. On the 1947 RCA Original, though the wonderful score's selectively recorded, the duets sound heartfelt, and there is a freshness with the material which only comes with a show being brand new. As well, Brent Barrett on the new recording has an edge to his voice which some listeners will find unattractive. Compared to the lyric warmth of David Brooks on the Original, he seems almost perfunctory. Still, the virtues of a complete version of a great score are indisputable, but do buy the Original Cast Recording first..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cast, full score","review":"This cast album includes more music than other cast albums, and has a great cast.

There are line drawings and photo's for many species. Semi-technical in approach- much more than a \\"picture-book,\\" yet not a forbidding technical manual. Excellent on the difficult grasses & sedges. It is a big paperback, printed on very high-quality paper, which makes it a bit heavy to carry on field trips.

This would be extremely challenging for someone who is not. I feel like this DVD is challenging enough where I will not master it right away but will not get frustrated trying.

I should have listened to the other reviewers (aside from the reviews by the guys who made the movies)but so often I can find something I like in spite of bad reviews. The simple fact is the plots (what plots?) are not even mediocre, the acting is horrible, some worse than others, audio is bad, and so on and so on. Out of the bunch, the only one that even comes close to a movie in my opinion is Old Man. If you are interested in paying this for something that looks like your kids typed up the screenplay in an afternoon and made it with their camcorder in the backyard, by all means proceed. If you are expecting the kind of movie you might see on Mystery Science Theater, this isn't it. I can't imagine even the MST folks sitting through these.

The basic plot is simple but good: Largo, working for Spectre, steals atomic missiles and demands a ransom. Unfortunately, \\"Thunderball\\" is considerably longer than the previous movies, but there's less plot. The script is dull and the direction lifeless. Most of the budget seems to have been spent on the underwater sequences. But they're not well made, only chaotic and go on for way too long. They become the anticlimax of a movie that had already lost my interest. \\"Thunderball\\" is one of the few Bond movies that manages to bore me. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring and Sean Connery doesn't care to be in the film","review":"This movie is the first to show that Sean Connery didn't care anymore about being James Bond. His acting is flat and the writing is kinda dull, kinda boring... it's a snooze fest. Dr. No, From Russia with Love and especially Goldfinger are much, much better films. Buy those and not this one. By all means though, if you are having trouble sleeping, buy it. You'll be out cold before Tom Jones finishes singing the opening theme.

The ending sequence where Largo has a harpoon in his back the boat looks like it's going about 500 mph. The only cool parts were where the Disco Vilante blows up by hittig a rock and, where the motorcycle fires a missle at the blue ford w/ Bond's DB5 nearby.

A plot that centers upon nuclear hijacking is more compelling, and even more contemporary in 2008 than it was when the film was originally released. Sean Connery is at his best. The film has just the right amount of gadgetry-miniaturized homing devices, etc, without bordering on the ridiculous. The locales are exotic. Italian actor Adolfo Celli is suberb as the cruel villian Largo. And what more can be said about redhead Lucianna Palluzzi! This is the James Bond film we watch at home all the time without ever tiring of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Movie","review":"An excellent Sean Connery movie as Bond.

The Ultimate set of 40 DVD's. Volumes 1,2,3 and 4. In Volume 2, Thunderball, the fourth Bond series film from 1965 was a surprise to watch. There is different background music when Bond meets Domino underwater for the first time. If you have an earlier version of Thunderball, listen for the two different tunes. This music was never released on any soundtrack, not even the newest one with additional tracks. A real treat! There are different versions of this film from over the years with different ending music but, this was a major surprise. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite BOND!","review":"Yes, out of the whole lot of them, THIS is the one I choose as my favorite (followed very closely by MOONRAKER as second). For starters, it has the most compelling and intruiging political plot of all of them, even more now that we live in the age of terror. It's classic Connery with that classic 60's environment that made the first batch of films so memorable. The underwater fighting sequence is by far the most exciting as compared to later scenes in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and LICENSE TO KILL.How disappointing it was to see this poorly remade in 1983 as NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN. But even the filmakers knew THUNDERBALL was the best story to choose from out of all the Bonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpler days","review":"This Bond script writing is average to above average and the film has interesting leading and supporting performances (stereotyped, of course).

The great action scenes(especially the ones underwater), the superb performances, the well written plot, and the fantastic score by John Barry all combine to make this a five star outing. Sean Connery turns in another fine performance as 007 and Adolfo Celi as Largo shows how to play a truly ruthless villian without crossing the line into camp. This entry also features great Bond girls(both good and bad) played by the beautiful Claudine Auger and Luciana Paluzzi. I recommend this fully packed DVD edition to any Bond fan. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond In Paradise","review":"Another action packed Bond with Sean Connery where the playboy spy goes off to paradise to save the world from sinister villains. A fun Bond with all of the standard quips, archvillains and Bond Bunnies.Bond is off to the Bahamas to find the location of a crashed NATO bomber carrying nuclear bombs. Standing out in the tropical paradise is SPECTER's second in command, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) who has lavish parties in his villa and disposes of unwelcome guests in his shark-infested sealable swimming pool. After seducing Laro's sexy mistress, Domino (Claudine Auger), Bond follows Largo to uncover his organization's sinister plan.A good Bond with plenty of sea-faring adventures both above and below water. Bond is of course equipped with his standard gadgets with the help of MI-6's uptight gadgetmaster \\"Q\\" (Desmond Llewelyn.)

The movie has an intriguing plot, exciting action and high tech gadgetry, not to mention some incredible underwater fights. The ending boat scene, however, was somewhat poorly done, obviously altered to seem more intense, which ended up making it look very awkward. Thunderball is not for everyone but is absolutely recommended for any Bond lovers or fans of Connery. Make the effort to rent if not buy this one, as it's worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This OO7 film had the best girls and action in the series.If there was a OO7 Academy Awards,this movie would clean up for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to a classic strategic bomber.","review":"This is a well-presented and useful introduction to anyone interested in the B-52 bomber. Its only drawback in my view is that being printed before recent crises such as the 1991 Gulf War and the 1999 Kosovo crisis, the action of B-52s in recent years are not featured.

While this is true, the book is not focused on just the babies in the womb. Only about a third of the book features the babies: pages 36-152 cover conception, the embryo, and the fetus. Pages 156-268 cover other portions of the bodies systems: organs, brain, bone, bacteria, etc.The pictures are all very interesting, to be sure, but I do wonder why hardly anyone mentioned the other parts of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work of Art","review":"Each photograph in this book is a work of art. My 3 and 6-yr-old children look through it all the time, and my 6-yr-old probably knows more about reproduction and biology than most junior high kids because we have this book. Each page has a large photograph with a short and simple description at the bottom, which is what makes it more appealing to the kids. We have lengthy discussions sparked by a single page of this book.The book not only has photographs of fetal development, but also hormones, chromosomes, conception, various organs and cells of the body, cancer cells, antibodies, etc. Amazing!

The listing suggests that there is a video of the Rat Packs performance at Villa Venice in 1962 when in fact it's just a very poor audio of a portion of that performance. I know it's a portion because I was at the show with my wife at the time. She also bought this combo package and was very disappointed. The DVD is only of one event in St. Louis that has been shown on TV on more than one occasion. If I wasn't so lazy I would have returned after watching it for the first time.

I would recommend a \\"nonlive\\" Rat Pack CD if you're looking for plain ole good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peel Sessions +","review":"Despite London Records insistance that the Heart & Soul boxset would have every Joy Division recording on it, it didn't. It left out some key Peel Sessions (all collected here) and what was on Still. This disc also collects some other BBC sessions, but really, little in the popular music canon of the past 25 years can compare with these songs, some of which (Transmission) appear in their most realized recorded states.As a bonus, the Peel version of Love Will Tear Us Apart is slightly different but just as good as the various released versions. Give this CD to someone who's only ever heard Nine Inch Nails and watch them become the toast of the underground rock community. Give it to someone who was there and watch a tear roll down their eyes. An excellent re-release. In summary, perfect music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, get the imported version of the Best of Joy Division instead.","review":"The rating above does not reflect my views on the importance or the quality of this release. John Peel's radio sessions often caused bands to reimagine and recreate their music in new and challenging ways, and Joy Division is no exception. All of these versions, with the band performing these songs live-in-the-studio, give a fresh perspective on the originals since these contain little overdubs, compared to their studio counterparts.My 2-star review reflects the case that this is out of print, very rare, and quite expensive when found. The actual album itself has been re-released as the bonus disc on the UK version of The Best of Joy Division, which is still in print and available, and cheaper as well. All of the songs on here are available on that, even the interview with Ian Curtis and Stephen Morris. Overall, I suggest you do buy this album, only in that format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I was there.","review":"\\"Live in Copenhagen\\" is relatively entertaining; I have trouble imagining a Buckley concert not being at least entertaining. However, Buckley does nothing new, so I estimate the cd is not worth buying. Buckley gives a good performance, and the band is alright, but it's extremely hard to tell how good the performance was because of the poor recording--definitely the worst recording quality in the Buckley canon. The concert would probably have sounded 10 times better live than on this recording. If the sound had been recorded flawlessly, it still would have been twice as good live. It just serves to remind me that the magic of music lies in making music for the moment at hand, and letting the moment own it; having it on record is just a cheap thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Who Love Country","review":"A great selection of country artists with some classic sounds.

In short, they all suck. Waste of time, waste of money. But hey, maybe it's just me....."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make good songs sound bad...","review":"It seems near impossible to take such finely crafted songs as Elliot's and turn them into rubbish. Unfortunately, this CD needs to go with the wrapping paper and into the bin. Elliot managed with his music to encompass complex emotions within a short 3min 30 pop frame. Elliot should be remembered for his ability to do so, especially in the fairly restrictive and limited genre of pop. None of these tracks capture any sense of their original complexity other than in recycled shallow plastique form. I'm heading straight back to listening to the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"there are a couple of passable covers on this, but the point escapes me. if someone wants to gain exposure to elliott's music, buy either/or and go from there. new moon (primarily outtakes/extras from that session) is also a good introduction. the icing on the cake for this tribute is the cover of thirteen, which is a big star song. aside from being a cover of a cover, this version is truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this is terrible.","review":"As a long time Elliott Smith fan who saw him in concert a few times, I can say that this CD is just plain BAD.A number of the covers sound like the singer is in an 80s hair band. The recording quality is poor and inconsistent between tracks. I only listened to the 2 minute sample tracks, but that was more than I could take.So, from what I heard, the songs were poor renditions and often poorly mixed. I suspect that this is a small record label's attempt to get your attention by releasing a tribute CD featuring a bunch of bands who don't have releases of their own. Don't let them fool you.In an interview linked to from the record label (double d records) website, I found the following quote, which sort of confirms my theory:\\"With no experience in the recording industry, Dickerson started the label in September with the initial goal of making a Smith tribute album.\\"Be sure to listen to the track samples for yourself to be sure you actually want to buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM WESLO","review":"DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY.

When you are using it the tread mill is louder than most other units. It also is a little unsteady - because I couldn't get the last nut to hold the head unit on.

If you have 10 bucks to spare, this CD is a great investment.-Dave"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good melodic radio oriented hard rock.","review":"Every song on here has the potential to become a radio hit except maybe the piano interlude on track 7 called \\"Reflections\\". They are great songwriters. have the potential to be one of the best rock bands in the last five years. the thing I like about theem is that they are just good old fashioned hard rock.This is what the world needs.

I loved the editing quality Clean Films offered, but since they are no longer in business, a friend recommended ClearPlay. ClearPlay comes up slightly short of the Clean Films editing quality, but I still love the concept and in fact have enjoyed the experience for as long as the DVD player worked. The problems with the DVD player started by not responding to the remote, then moved on to stating there was no filter found, though it was downloaded and the player would play the ClearPlay version of the movie. However, it has finally come to the point whereas now I can't even get it to open/close to watch the DVDs anymore. Good Concept, but I wish the hardware was up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Equipment - Worse Customer Service!","review":"We got this for Christmas and purchased a 1 year subscription.

Our friend had a similar problem with the same machine; they bought a new model... it died too. They only had a 30 day warranty.What kind of crap company only gives a 30 (or 90) day warranty and refuses to even help customers who paid for a year subscription.I give it 2 stars because when it worked it was great. DO NOT BY THIS UNIT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative book - an update would be welcome","review":"Napa is a fine book for anyone interested in wines in general and in the ones produced in Napa Valley in particular. The beginning of the book is really the best part. With a great deal of interesting details, the author recalls the beginning of wine production in the area. Reading the story of the pionners who settled there in the beginning of the century is really fascinating. The description of the lives of great characters such as Gustave Niebaum, Georges de Latour or John Daniel are really well written. The second part of the book is less interesting. It focusses too much on political battles in the late 80's and the author has clearly chosen his camp and shows too much the people that he does not like. It would be great if the author would suppress the last chapters and write about what happened in the 90's. Napa Valley has changed, new producers have emerged and an up-dated version of Napa would be a great gift for all wine lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sleaze, but it's FUN sleaze ...","review":"The author, a free-lance wine writer not widely regarded as a heavyweight, has done a National Enquirer treatment of Napa and its leading wine personalities, reprinting a lot of rumors, quoting a lot of unnamed sources.

Will Johnson has an amazing voice, and his lyrics continue to haunt me even though I have long since committed every one of these perfectly arranged words to memory. It's not often that you get such a great combination of appealing sound with lyrics that are so intelligent, introspective, and emotional.

I look forward to reading more of her timeless novels. Daniel W. Stuart"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Bodie and Brock Thoene!","review":"I've been reading the Thoene's books for several years and can't get enough of them. They write historical fiction, which is my favorite - I learn alot and also am entertained with a wonderful, engaging story.I especially like that they are Christians and their writing reflects Christian beliefs and values.There are three books in the this series called Shiloh Legacy and they are about World War I and the Great Depression of 1929. The stories follow the lives of four men who met fighting in the war, and then on to where the next 10 years takes them. A Thousand Shall Fall is the second book. I'm reading the last one now and can hardly wait to read what happens to these 4 main characters. It is great to be able to go to Amazon.com and find the titles of all their books.

BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"My son in law was very pleased to receive this book for a Christmas gift as he is a home brewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, great ideas!","review":"I'm enjoying this book immensely. This is my second home brewing book (Papazian was the first, about 15 years ago). Like Papazian, \\"Radical Brewing\\" includes plenty of lore in addition to hard core brewing info. And like Papazian this book has lots of humor in it. But Mosher's book is much more current, in terms of both information and viewpoint. And the humor is sardonic where Papazian's humor tends to be more goofy and quaint.If anything \\"Radical Brewing\\" is slightly less practical than \\"The Joy of Homebrewing.\\" It seems like Mosher focuses on giving the reader inspiration rather than step-by-step instructions, which is very wise considering how individualized each batch of homebrew is. Papazian has a certain recipe mentality, where Mosher is instead setting forth ideas and techniques. Good stuff, particularly for the intermediate or advanced brewer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best brewing book I've read","review":"Radical Brewing is definitely the most enjoyable and inspiring brewing book that I've read. The author presents a nicely balanced mix of history, humor, obscure facts, essential information and awesome recipes. Plenty of parts of this book are enjoyable to read just for their content even if you aren't a brewer.For me it is the authors personal writing style that makes the book great. I would reccomend it to all brewers, whether you've been doing it for 50 years or you've never brewed a drop, this book will inspire you to get off your butt and try something interesting, and to learn more than just the basics of the step-by-step process of brewing.The books attractive visual layout as well as its great content would also make it a reccomendable gift for anyone interested in brewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast to Read","review":"I have been a homebrewer for over 20 years. Definitely not an adventurous type, sticking to the mainstream brews. After reading this book, I'm going to get a little more radical. Mosher's writing style is fun and engaging. I found myself just wanting to read \\"one more chapter\\" at 2am. He doesn't pretend to give you a step by step cookbook of how to brew--that's been done. He just spins tale after tale, talking history here, techniques there, and beer styles everywhere.My one concern before buying this book was whether it would be dated. Not really. It's still very pertinent, and definitely has a permanent place on my brewshelf. If you're a newbie, go get Palmer or Papazian if you want to learn how to brew. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homebrew World-Altering","review":"The strange title fits. It is written with wit, humor, passion and loads of knowledge. I've got a couple dozen brewing books, but I keep coming back to this one.Like others, it covers the basics of techniques. Each chapter examines a different genera of beer, origins of similar beers, how they were brewed, how they evolved, how to brew similar beers (both all-grain and extract) and how you might personalize them. While Ray Daniels does a great job of nailing a style, Randy Mosher pushes well beyond the boundaries of defined styles and inspires you to be creative.Do you want to know how to use an unusual adjunct? How about the qualities of various spices? Fruits? Stranger ingredients? Randy provides example of historical brews using stuff I never would have dreamed of putting into my beer, and leaves you eager to try something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle version is AWFUL","review":"I've been rebuilding my brewing library on my Kindle since the fall. I find it convenient on brew days to have what amounts to a reference library in my pocket.Unfortunately, Radical Brewing for Kindle is a complete disappointment: it is both poorly edited and poorly formatted. Spelling mistakes abound. Some of the lambic section is entirely, if humorously, unreadable, \\"entire rather than using a bf Immediately 20 percent of the mash years ago.\\" Location 7085. Other formatting problems can only be fixed by setting my Kindle to the smallest font.To add insult to injury, the index, an essential part of any reference book, does not include links or even location numbers. It is, simply, a list of words.Do not buy the Kindle version. It's a shame since the dead tree version has become a staple of many brewers' shelves.Edit: the Kindle version was taken down several weeks ago pending revision."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got a bad copy","review":"Ok this book is great but my copy literally is missing 4 chapters.

Poor quality control on the publishers part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Full of Good Ideas and Inspiration","review":"I think the great thing about this book is that it focuses on using more malts than I normally use to devlop rich and complex beers. It discusses some techniques about how to get richer beers. One particular technique was using the wort from half a batch of a big brew (using 20+ lb of grain) as the mash in water for the second half of grain. This is praticularly helpful for people using 5-gallon Gatorade coolers as mash tuns to make really big beers.I found it funny how the writer doesn't really care for American hops, or appears not to discuss American-style IPAs and the hop bombs that they have become. I wasn't looking for any guidance on that style, but just wanted to let those of you who were hoping for something new on that style out of this book: it ain't there.Great historical stuff as well. I recommend this after reading How to Brew, and Brewing Classic Styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of hard drive.","review":"One of the best movies ever, gets one of the worst games ever. This game will ruin bowling for anyone. The game is frustrating because the ball will run into objects in the alley, unless you guide the ball with the arrow keys.

However, I have to say these Versa-Pak NiCad batteries are just the worst rechargeable batteries ever made. They will completely die somewhere within 6 months to 2 years of purchasing them. I purchased 2 of the 2-pack/charger kits (4 batteries), and that's what mine did. I subsequently replaced them with the NiMH batteries (which work with the same chargers), and they work like a charm.

However, as soon as I started reading this book it was obvious that the author Singular delves to far into self indulgence time and time again.At times it seems he is simply writing just for the sake of writing, often times describing the weather and a truly ridiculous paragraph about a certain crop that was imported into the Wichita area. And there is also a strong christian viewpoint the author is writing from, which grows rather tiresome.For anyone that is interested in true crime books, pass on this one, or at least wait until it comes out in paperback (I wasted over $20.00 dollars on this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singular is the unholy messenger","review":"He takes information he has received from public sources, which he doesn't even get accurate, and weaves them together with what he proclaims is Pastor Clark's theory. Next, he adds input from a local psychologist who has been suspected in the past of being BTK himself and NOT because his profiles have been accurate, they've been wrong, but because his profiles reflect his own suppressed feelings of self.Admittedly, the book is well written, but other than the fact it is about a real criminal whose real crimes are all of public record, it should not be labeled as true crime, but more along the lines of fiction. He has never interviewed the subject of his book who he in his own words admits is a man who lived inside his own world and never talked with anyone about his real self.If you're interested in a good read, but don't care about facts, this book is okay. As for myself, I would recommend waiting for a more accurate depiction of the story to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonic possission vs. Sociopath","review":"This version is very disappointing. It seems to focus more on the people within Rader's Luthern Church than on his evil pathology.

He has admitted this when confronted at book signings. He speaks with no authority whatsoever and merely repeats whatever tidbits of gossip he can pick up.Here's another fact: Stehen Singular completely blames Pastor Clark for his belief in demon possession. However, Singular is the one who approached Pastor Clark with the idea in the first place and purported to be an expert on demon possession. Also, the first letter that Singular wrote to Dennis Rader purports the same thing - and he used his so-called \\"experience\\" in demon possession to get interviews. Rader isn't the smartest crayon in the box, but at least he was smart enough not to fall for Singular's line.Singular writes well, but he has no integrity. Save your money and wait for the real truth to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless attempt to capitalize on BTK!","review":"As compared with all of the BTK killer books, this is the worst by far. A totally shameless attempt to capitalize on the terrible decades of fear lived by the citizens of Wichita, Kansas.The book is a rehash of material that has been spun ad-nauseum through a number of similar accounts. The problem here, however, is that much of the information which the author seems to take as given is simply not based on fact. He seems to surround much of his story with surmise.The Booklist reviews it as \\"riveting....macabre.....scary\\". This reviewer would have to say, \\"not reviting .... not all that macabre .... and definitely not scary\\", rather \\"same-same-same, wrong-wrong and mostly boring-boring-boring\\".A total hack attempt at documentary journalism.

Although the first few tracks seem very dancy (and they are), they are still very well done. Blue room is absolutely gorgeous. A few tracks later, toxygen and asylum provide more wonderful songs. And of course, mickey mars and towers of dub provide a different aspect of the Orb's skill.

My favorite song is Fool for you, which according to my intellect is a terrible song, yet there is something in me that just melts when I hear it. The love in this album is very maternal.

No producer has been involved in the recording of this album. Heather Nova has recorded the album all by herself and gave it afterwards in license to the record label.

Maybe one reason for this is that Heather Nova is pregnant and that the baby should not be frightened from the beginning. The intensity, however, is not less in any way.

Minna is concise and uplifting in that she provides a different type of cardio workout. The routine is not boring and very doable.

Her recipe for Beef Stew with Stout sounded mouth-wateringly good, but was vastly inferior to my regular stew recipe; watery with very little flavor. The Jambalaya recipe was a disaster. Rice was mushy, and the meat was rubbery and underseasoned. I know it may be unfair to judge a whole book based on two recipes, but I'm honestly scared to try again.

I think it develops better flavors in these dishes than if you were to just dump everything in and turn the slow cooker on.So far, I've made 6 or 7 of the recipes and have really liked all of them.

I called the company telling them the cots seemed defective since they'd ripped along the seems that had been sewn. They said they'd replace them if I paid shipping to return the defective cots, and pay shipping for the replacement cots. Wasn't worth the money.

Cesar and Rosalie is one of his best with memorable performances by Yves Montand, Sami Frey, and the extraordinary Romy Schneider. The love triangle in this film is unpredicatable and touching. Another Sautet film that should be released is Vincent Francois Paul and the Others, which is a melancholy ode to love and friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and to the point","review":"This book is quite complete for anyone needing to deal with software risks and its organisation makes it particularly handy.

The appalling low-fi sound is due to the fact that it was recorded in its entirety on a dying Panasonic boom box, and you can hear the whine of the grinding gears. It sounds like a demo tape, because it basically is a demo tape, but somehow that sound is perfect for the feeling of the songs. The lyrics are kind of contextless, but clearly the whole album is about people finding good things and hope in bad situations and despair. It's just John Darnielle and his guitar, and you can feel the heat in the air and smell the ashtray that needs emptying as he plays and sings about running away with a girl on a motorcycle, or trying to figure out how to feed two infants, or about how Cyrus and Jeff's death metal dreams of stardom were broken up by their parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Although some songs in this collection are upbeat, a number of them are very haunting.

I highly recommend it, but the movie lacks beyond the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiri delivers Kern","review":"Before the advent of lapel microphones singers on the musical stage had to learn to project the voice just like opera singers still do. There was no fudging, no \\"style,\\" and no fakery. That's the kind of singing that Kern wrote his music for. His best ballads, full of beauty, subtlety and delicious harmonies work best with that approach. After listening to several new compilations of Kerns songs this album strikes me as a refreshing gift to fans of the composers' work. Many of his greatest songs are included except for, unaccountably, \\"They didn't believe me\\" which has always been one of my favorites. Perhaps Te Kanawa's approach is too straightforward for some listeners but, knowing that Kern hated Jazz, this direct approach surely would have pleased him. In any case the creamy beauty of Kiri's voice is recommendation enough by itself. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong roles for a dame","review":"Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, with all my applauding hands on her appearance in other recordings like Bernstein's West Side Story with José Carreras, and with all my respect for a fantastic career recently ended, I have to say that in standard songbooks used to play a wrong role, by compulsive advancinng herself to the refrains of songs, at the point that it seemed that she was the orchestra conductor at the moment: the musical effect produced is anoying and hard, please note that on 'Kiri sings Porter' almost all tracks were originally meant for male roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedestrians should be loved...","review":"Little wonder that the characters of this wonderful story (and the preceding The Twelve Chairs) have become household names in Russia.

The villians are introduced way too fast, there's not enough mystery remaining, the characters aren't really latched on to, and the ending wasn't anything overly powerful. Still, All Hallow's Eve isn't too bad...it kept me reading, and that's saying something. If a novel is genuinely bad, I usually won't finish it. I finished this one, because it DID have some saving grace. One being the well written detective, another being morbid curiosity for the show down (although my expectations weren't that high), and another being that while the plot was disorganized and jumbled, it wasn't exactly dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of print and deservedly so.","review":"After reading some of the reviews but mostly the 1 star reviews I had to jump in. I realize this book is out of print and was published 6 years ago but I still have to put my two cents in.Nobody in their reviews (especially the one star reviews) said anything about how poorly this book is written. Some have even said it was well written. I take issue with that. For example the protagonists are a twenty something year old man and a 7 year old child. So at one point in the story why does Al refer to them as children? At another time a police officer is firing his pistol and it goes from a revolver to an automatic and back again. In fact he reloads his revolver by shoving a loaded magazine into it!?!Ugh, this author is the worst and I have no desire to read anything else by him. I've only hung on to the paperback because I love the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"Hallow's Eve is yet another one of the countless \\"horror\\" novels following the \\"Someone returns to their hometown to confront an ancient evil\\" scenario, which has, along with the concept of Halloween in general, been beaten to a very uninteresting pulp.The book while apropriately atmospheric is rather unspectacular and often features very boring characters, none of which forge a relationship with the reader.The book is well written when reflecting on the context to which it is based. Being well written however, is (as any avid reader will attest to) not enough! One must have thought evoking concepts, emotional connections, as well as excellent character constructs to be deemed \\"a good book\\", or at least a book worth reading.That being said, I would not deem Hallow's Eve \\"a good book\\". It is not by any stretch of the imagination an \\"awful book\\" but is definitly not worth reading when compared to the much better stories that are most definitly out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god, this is such a good album.","review":"What do you get if you put a Norwegian guitar genius, an American gospel group and some African singers and musicians together on one CD? A mess, right? Not this time. This album explores the nexus between the blues, gospel and the African music that spawned both, all with a little of Norway thrown in. It works. For example, it's got the best version of \\"Baby, Please Don't Go\\" I've ever heard, merging Europe, America and Africa.The Five Blind Boys only show up on a couple of tracks, but they are good. Mostly it's Knut and the Africans. But the opening track has nothing to do with Africa: it's an improvisation based on a Norwegian folk song. It starts with aome amazing guitar work and then a mighty organ descends upon the proceedings and elevates the whole thing.If you like world music even a little bit, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice knobs 5 stars","review":"The knobs are as pictured and very well made.

It's kind of a let-down when you've unwrapped the box and it's obvious what's inside before you open it. No need to go on then. When I was a kid, we used to have to try and guess what was in the box before we unwrapped the gift. It made it even more fun and slowed down the greedy unwrapping frenzy that occurs on Christmas morning.Besides, the plain box makes it easier to hide what's in it from little eyes before Christmas!

It is a record that deserves to be in a dj's collection, but only for the first 5 tracks. Could this be the reason why disco died? It could be. The rest of the tracks are noisy and unenjoyable. Popular bands and singers aee featured in this cd, but it isn't reason enough to actually listen to their songs.

Sorry for the guy who ends up with a wife like that. However, the way the group kept fishing despite a dead body floating nearby, is just beyond me. Of course, it shows how numb one's existence becomes through ups and downs of life, that smallest opportunity to be happy or to be in peace (like fishing) seems too valuable to be spoiled by a minority dead-body. The movie did bring some underlying social questions of class and racism. By the way, it was scary to know that the main killer remained unpunished.Very good acting from all involved.

Mastroantonio. After all of the effort they must have expended in order to make this film, I have to wonder why they fell so short on the storytelling. Did they run out of cash for the screenwriter or better yet, did they even have one? If the desire was to make the movie beautiful, yet ambiguous--they succeeded, however for me this movie was also an exercise in frustration. The characters were all fascinating to a degree, they were never truly defined, what motivated any of them, what is/was the point of it all? This movie had so much promise, yet just didn't deliver on so many levels. Why start with a roar and then ramble off into subtlety? Why???"},{"rating":"2","title":"An astonishing film","review":"\\"Jindabyne\\" is a most compelling and intelligent film. I was absolutely riveted and entranced while watching this study of the erosion of our out-of-balance society. But what really makes \\"Jindabyne\\" one of the highest quality films I've ever seen is the beautiful and subtle screenplay that does a wonderful job of demonstrating the ways of the modern world, how out-of-touch we've become with nature (which includes ourselves and each other), and how this affects everyone and everything. I've read some comments to the effect that this film bashes the dominant (i.e. white) culture, but really no one gets a pass in \\"Jindabyne.\\" Rather, this work looks at the after-effects of Western Expansion and the consumer culture it's created (while essentially destroying the divine nature of the world) and it does so in an entertaining, edgy manner.

Haunted by the press and local opinion, not to speak of family problems and being spit on and vandalized by the local aborigines tribe, who \\"NATURALLY\\" have every right to do so!! At least I didn't see any police presence for these acts of violence. In the meantime the murderer sits in his truck waiting for his next victim - END OF STORY!

It's got great bass and sounds pretty crisp.CON'S: Everything else. They will NOT stay on your ears if you so much as sneeze. They leak a LOT of sound so everyone within 5 feet will hear your song well enough to recite the words. It's pretty cheaply made - the chord split open, exposing the wires, at 4 different spots.

The sound is crystal clear and is very well balanced, with any type of music. The headphones are durable enough to be mushed between two books in a bag for quite a while without any problems.There are only a few downsides to this product. Lots of outside sound is let in while listening which gets annoying, and it lets out lots of sound that other people can hear, at almost any volume.

Wow, how I was wrong! Anyone who has a concern about annoying people around them (which should be everyone) should steer clear of these headphones, as they sound almost as loud to others as they do in your ear. While the fit is fairly awkward, they do stay on your ear as long as you are not doing a lot of bouncing up and down (i.e. jogging). The sound quality is OK, not great. I also tried the Sennheiser MX-500s, which are an improvement on the sound leak issue, but utterly uncomfortable. You are better off just spending the money and getting a much better product with the Sony Earbud Headphones (MDR-EX70LP). My advice is to search around for a good price.

Addictions take on the craziest forms.The first few minutes of the film suggested a creatively written, good sets, well acted and directed story but soon degenerated into a scene after scene formula of a few roadies journeying to escape an apocalyptic future filled with bad humans and equally bad semi-humans to find refuge in the virgin north. It turned out to be cheaply produced for the usual obviously fake blood (raspberry jam), stakes (for vampires) in a multitude of forms, shotguns (for zombies) and trashy vehicles from a wrecking yard for ambience and, of course, the somewhat dead who always seem to walk the same way - like they're imitating some other primates.The storyline comes down to a few of the traveling buds get toasted for vamp food, because otherwise the film would be totally devoid of emotion or suspense; nothing happens at the end except boy and girl are happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"should have a cult following","review":"Really great filming, acting and surprise scares--I've seen a lot of post-apocalyptic films, vampire films...this definitely kept me guessing.

Don't get me wrong, I like zombies as much as the next guy, but now there are almost, dare I say it, to many zombie movie out there right now.And what makes this movie really stand out is the acting, top notch! You care about the characters, they behave in a way that is what I think realistic under such circumstances.

I like movies with vampires that look like vampires, not ones that look like half-eaten undead.

Bleak, vampires, apocalypse, plague, gore, religious fanatics, and hope are pretty much the keywords that best describe Stake Land. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't just another vampire gore fest. It focused more on the human interactions following the fall of society than anything and how a small group of humans that have little in common can work to together.

An older man rescues and teaches a younger man how to survive in the recently destroyed world. They travel from community to community and set piece to set piece until the end of the film. It's a lot like zombie land, but that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed this film if for no other reason than it was exactly what I expected. A campy movie with some over arching messages about religious fundamentalism and how evil deeds transcend any human condition. It's a rare movie that gives different viewers each what they want.

I love Belgian saison beers, and with a handful of tips I gleaned from this book I was able to brew a deliciously complex example on my first try.

If you ever followed Mr. Raitt on Broadway or in summer stock, you will love this album -- his voice when he was in his mid-70's hardly varied from his voice as a young man. Some of his biggest shows - Carousel, Pajama Game -- are represented here. Rogers, Hammerstein, Berlin, Porter -- they were the brains that created the modern musical from musical comedy, but it was John Raitt and his colleague Francis Drake who make their ideas work every night on the stage. This album is a welcome reminder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Back Cover description: When Zoe's baby arrived on February 14, it seemed only natural to call him Valentine! But as far as Zoe was concerned, Valentine had been the only romance in her brief marriage to Justin Gifford. And since Justin had harshly declared that he never wanted to see her again, she hadn't had the chance to tell him that he had a son....But then the unthinkable happened: Valentine became desperately ill and Zoe knew that she would do anything to save him-even if that meant seducing her own husband!I didn't even finish this one. The plot and characters are too unreal. Zoe's personality is about as exciting as limp macaroni and Justin belongs in a medieval romance. He never talks to her, and avoids upsetting her, and doesn't see the problem with his assistant.

My 5 yr. old son got this for Christmas and we play it more than any of his other games. It's great especially as a beginner to N64, as he gets to practice using the controller alot, and it's easy for him to understand. There's minimal reading, he just has to choose a difficulty level,(and he's learned to recognize the word \\"amateur\\") and the course, which he can do by sight. The comments that the characters make, in their original voices, are really great. I think that they are so cute--and we even fight over who gets to be which character!! Up to 4 people can play, or you can just play alone--which I sometimes do after he goes to bed!! It's kind of addictive--and we LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"My children (ages 6 and 8)and I found this game to be very enjoyable. My only criticism is that each of the racers have different racing qualities and that Mickey and Donald, in my opinion, have a distict advantage over the others. My kids loved it, however, and, when given a choice of what game to purchase, out of 3 racing games we had rented, chose it hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"If you like racing games that are a bunch of fun, try Mickey's Speedway USA.

Actually, I was really suprised when I played it along with my cousins. I couldn't put it down. Mickey's Speedway USA is a great game. It's really fun when you play it multiplayer. I think that's the best part of the game when you play it multiplayer. The tracks are really fun as well. They aren't long and boring but short and challenging. The weapons are super. I think the weapons could be the greatest ever. The characters are great. Mickey's best friends are dueling against eachother in this racing game. Each one has different attributes that makes it great. The only downside is that there aren't that many tracks so you just do the same ones over again. Other than that it's a great game for all ages!

I used it often, but handled it very carefully. I have other digital and film cameras I use more and have had longer. In February, 2006, the camera just stopped working. It still looked like new and absolutely nothing had been done to it to render it completely useless. I sent it to the Mack Warranty people (those warranties are a joke, by the way) who sent it to Panasonic, telling me that they don't cover repairs WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR!!! Then the repair department at Panasonic returned the camera after two months, saying it would cost more to repair than it was worth. So I was SOL - out of a camera after less than a year of use.I think the Panasonic Lumix cameras were badly made in the first place and that's why their new version of the camera, the FZ30, is almost entirely different from the FZ20 - it doesn't even use the same battery.

Unfortunately I cannot say the same for this book. From page one every character is throughly unlikable. Any romance that opens on a scene in an opium den-well that should have given me a clue. This books storyline is based on lies, secrets and a host of unpleasantness.The hero has his own motives and the heroine is frankly a spoiled brat who wants to be treated like a queen but is extremly naive about the ways of the world.Implausibilities abound- like fifty pages into the book the author has the two characters having sex while barely knowing more than each others names, and the hero forces his way into her room.Simply annoying-this author can do better than this.

However, I have now learned that Peg Perego sells a travel system adaptor (all 2005 strollers come with the adaptor) that allows any carseat to fit within the stroller. The Peg Perego carseat is TERRIBLE...it is to narrow and too deep (my daughter looked so uncomfortable and would cry every time I put her in it). I also found that I had a difficult time locking the carseat into the base and had to climb into the SUV to secure it everytime. Lastly, the sun shield didn't even extend over the top of her head and was useless. I have since then purchased the Graco Snuggle Ride and love it.

This is an all instrumental suite from the master of flute, 'Jethro Tull' frontman Ian Anderson. The music is top notch, qualitywise comparable to any record produced ever. This a mixture of Jethro Tull kind of music and western classical with a little touch of Indian Classical music (In The Times Of India).

What we have here is a flute player arranging and playing some very innovative flute.The entire album is instrumental, so we miss out on Anderson's outstanding lyric writing talents.Ian trades his lyrics in for some of the finest flute music you will ever want to hear.There is not a bad song on the CD. The highlights for me include, In a Stone Circle, In the Grips of Stronger Stuff, and in defence of Faiths. These 3 compositions are not only outstanding but will stand the test of time, which in my mind is the only true test of music. You will never hear Ian Anderson compose anything more solid. The rest of the CD is basically elevator music with occasional highlights.Ian plays the flute in his patented style and is in top form.This is much better than its predecessor Walk into Light.If you are a Jethro Tull fan this should interest you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this music...it makes me in a great mood!","review":"I like this CD so well that...though I originally purchased it in 1995, and played it all the time, it got ruined in my car's CD player so that it doesn't play perfectly in some parts any longer.

This oscar-winning movie is in favor of illegal abortion, adultery, law breaking, disobedience of authority, yet it is shot in soft focus, like a Capra, feel-good movie!. The constant references to Dickens are more wishful than actual; old Charles would most likely be against all the values this film celebrate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cider House Rules","review":"This movie left me thinking that the plot was to lead the viewer to believe that the young man had no future except to follow in the old doctor's footsteps, return to the orphange and perform abortions.

Children in orphanages during WW1 and WW2 were there because their parents could not take care of them for different reasons. I doubt that abortions were ever performed in orphanages. I lived in one and while there was a hospital on the grounds, abortions were never performed. I don't feel abortions are ever justified and I found no enjoyment in seeing it portrayed in a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abortions","review":"Although this movie was very well directed and had great performances by Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, and Delroy Lindo, I was thoroughly disgusted with the overwhelming pro-abortion theme. I watch movies to be entertained. I don't want to be preached to. This story was way off the mark.I felt very ill after watching it because of the complete disregard for human life. The most obvious scenes were the disposals of the fetuses (and older?) into the fire in the back yard. The way it was filmed made it obvious that there should be no consideration whatsoever for the lives of babies, that they are to be thrown away at the whim of whatever parent just happens to be \\"inconvenienced\\" by their births.I am a fan of Tobey Maguire and very much enjoyed his performance in \\"Ride with the Devil\\" a lot more than this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth in Advertising","review":"With the hope that you will not be mislead as I was, you need to know that this movie is a story about a kindly, old abortionist and his protege.If you can live with that, it's a good film.

No offense intended, but it is what it is. The film is well made. The acting is great, but it is still pro-abortion propaganda. The movie basically tries to present an extreme circumstance (filled with emotion) to make it seem okay to kill a baby. I'm sorry it never is."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"This is what William Goldman would call a \\"medicinal\\" movie. Because it's politically correct and addresses serious issues, you're supposed to be in awe of it. Because it's good for you and medicinally sound. One failing is that it is tedious to sit through. And, personally, I can't stand Toby Maguire (even though he's probably a very nice person). His high monotonous voice, and thin-lipped, bulgy-eyed face and narrow acting annoys me. The movie is beautifully shot...but what big budget studio movie isn't beautifully shot these days. Caine and others are good, etc. But when people say \\"The stars were good, but the material wasn't\\" it should sink into their skulls that acting is much easier to pull off than writing (10 year olds win asting Oscars, but not writing Oscars...that tells you something). If you're a sucker for period pieces and don't mind glacial pacing, check this out. But otherwise forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For young and for old!","review":"Well, although when I watched the movie I was but 14 yaers old,( I am now 16). I can say that I liked it! I know that you must be thinking \\"what? this is a wierd kid\\", but the truth is that I have always had a certain inclination towards this kind of movie, and although i think that the book is much better, i think that the movie lives up to it enough for me to have enjoyed it. I always like the issue, both in the book and movie, and the superb acting in the movie makes the whole experience even more enjoyable. I recomend this movie to anyone who thinks they have enogh maturity to understand it and to take it seriousley, as did i. This goes for grown ups and youg people alike. thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully disappointing","review":"I read the book first. It's a wonderful story, but compared to the text, the movie is didactic, the characters flat, and the whole intonation terribly false. The movie makes the orphanage to look like a kindergarten birthday party, Dr. Larch and the nurses like Sunday charity workers, and Homer Wells like a stuttering half-wit. None of this is in the book. It's a shame it got so maimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent film about the complexities of life","review":"This movie is beautiful to look at, well-acted, and artfully written. Its examination of how the \\"rules\\" we're asked to live by don't always make sense in our everyday lives is subtle and beautifully handled. The story, too, is very touching and believable, particularly the relationship between Caine and McGuire.

Homer learns the tribulations and lessons of life, love, and freedom in this powerful Academy Award winner. Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, Delroy Lindo, and Erykah Badu all lend surprisingly strong support in their three-dimensional roles. \\"The Cider House Rules\\" was snubbed of the Academy Award for Best Picture this past year, but will live in the hearts of moviegoers forever. An American classic if there ever was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"cider house","review":"This is an excellent movie which highlights Michael Cane, Toby Mcguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo and Erykah Badu's acting skills. The cast is multicultured, colorful and seasoned. It highlights the question of abortion and adoption and what is missing in the lives of orphans: LOVE. I read the novel and bought the movie. All the book can't be in the movie, but the director did a great job of merging 2 minor characters to keep the main story flowing along. This move is one that you will add to your collection. I recommend it strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, a must see.","review":"This movie was outstanding. I laugthed, I cried, I was amazed.Don't wait bye this film while you still can I bet you'll love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad","review":"I have mixed feelings about this movie. It's not horrible, the themes and subject matter of the movie is highly controversial and might make some viewers uncomfortable depending upon their personal opinions on abortion. Somehow, though, this movie sensitively and affectively conveys the subject matter in a way that's watchable. Even though the acting was mediocre, I really liked Tobey Mcguire as the main character (i think he's such a cutie...). However, i felt that this movie was just way too long. It tends to drag along and barely picks up until it comes to the most emotional scenes, which I have to admit were a bit abject and hard to watch. But overall, the film is packed with emotion and is worth renting at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and pointless","review":"i thought this film was not only not good, but definitely not oscar-nominated worthy. it was boring, simply boring. it did not draw me in to like the characters. i didnt really care what happened to them.

I recommend giving it your full attention to appreciate it's subtleties."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance","review":"some might pass over this movie because of of the material on abortion, but I think that would be a mistake. True, there will never be a movie where they show the typical face of abortion, women who have other options but don't take them, but at least this film doesn't ram its views down your throat. Rather, the story is a lot like the music, gentle and relaxed, moving at the pace of the wide eyed innocent, Homer. I love Lasse's movies anyway, and wasn't disappointed with this one. He brings you along without any high drama, infusing things with a sweetness most directors pass over in favor of over the top action and dialogue.Give this movie a chance. It's a deftly crafted piece with a slew of great performances. A nice surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":".... homer who?","review":"...Irving must have been in dire straits to accept payment for this adaptation .... cramming over 40-years into a couple of hours can't be easy , BUT completely obliterating two of the most relevant and interesting characters in the novel ( Angel & Melanie .... WHO ? you ask ,if you haven't read it) pretty much makes it a big waste of time & Caine's talent.... I was quite sad after viewing the film, my anticipation of seeing the roles played out as written in the novel & expecting the characters to age & develop as read over years of growth left me feeling totally cheated.

This is the only movie that has ever brought tears to my eyes while watching it. There are some parts that really tugged at my heart, but there are also parts that brought a smile to my face. Many movies adapted from books are just not very good. But this movie, adapted from a book, is excellent. There are a lot of good messages in it, despite it's controversial subject matter.

It has a sense of old-time character mixed with sincerity, belonging, passion, love and self-discovery.The acting is superb and maintains a quality lacking in so many modern films. If you are looking for a good film to watch, I recommend this. I would call it the perfect movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Upgrading to Blu Ray","review":"This is a truly wonderful movie and better than I remembered. It is a great period piece and is a feel good movie. The upgrade to blu ray is well worth it since the visuals are spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"As you may have surmised, I was surprised by this film. Note the term film, one that I reserve for true works of cinematic art. I was surprised when I found myself enjoying this film due to the subject matter, which is abortion. I imagine that I am what most people would consider extremely pro-life, however, this film did not offend my sensibilities at all. The subject matter was, in my opinion, handled very tactfully. It did not change my views, but then, it was not meant to. To say that this film is a pro-abortion movie is to say that Apocalypse Now was anti-Vietnam. While both statements are true, the focus of the movies lies elsewhere. At its core The Cider House Rules is a masterfully crafted love story and coming-of-age drama. It is magnificentally photographed, well-acted, and superbly transfered to the big screen by John Irving from his novel. Special kudos to Micheal Caine and Lasse Hallstrom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The craft of story and character","review":"After multiple viewings, I still adore the richness and humanity of this modest little story. The subject matter, the setting, the era, the details, the characters, they're all exquisitely rendered. Toby Maguire offers a supremely generous lead. He is a canvas, basically, upon which the other actors draw their characters. Michael Caine is particularly stunning, but the whole cast is in capital form. Kids have never looked better or more believable on film, ever. Lasse Hallestrom gets my vote as the reigning saint of intelligent film-making. Everything he does is ambitious and edifying and humanscale, and altogether marvelously uncommercial. He is everything that Hollywood should aspire to be, but does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible adaptation of book","review":"The film is a terrible adaptation of the book, which I loved.

The only form I had it in was video tape. So happy to get it on DVD! The story is about an orphanage and the children who live there and the staff who work there. A mother-to-be could go there for one of two reasons: to deliver her baby and give it to the orphanage or she could have an abortion. The doctor there performs both procedures. The doctor has an assistant who was a former orphan of the facility, who basically grew up there. He was fully trained and experienced to deliver babies or perform abortions, but was not a graduated physician with a degree. The movie is mostly about his life (Toby Macguire). The doctor thinks he is the best choice to take over the practice there, but instead he chooses to leave the facility to make a living on his own. He ends up returning to the orphanage when he hears that the doctor has died. It is a really sweet story. One of my favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"If This Film Had Been Anti-Abortion...","review":"...it NEVER could have been made, and it CERTAINLY never could have won an academy award.

It was so slow and so uneventful. John-Boy and the rest of the Waltons were more exciting than this.This film gets high ratings because it's a pro abortion film. There are only two young girls in this film and they both get abortions for different reasons. The story itself goes no where . No Plot, no memorable lines, no story. Just a real snore.I feel that just about anyone could have written a better coming of age story for this cast. This movie isn't worth the 2 hrs. to keep watching to see if something will happen. Nothing does...."},{"rating":"1","title":"liberal junk","review":"A beautifully filmed but only adequately-acted movie oozing with pro-choice and maudlin romantic sentiments. Rightfully overlooked at the Oscars.

Director Lasse Hallstrom intends to deliver some mildly shocking material here to provide thoughtful deep questions, but it is presented in a common, simplified and almost soap opera-like way. The rest is a sweet little romance between the appealing leads Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron, two cofused young adults who don\`t understand their envoironment. To their credit, they perform their roles well, as does Michael Caine, so there\`s still a reason to watch the movie. Overall, though, it\`s just another fluffy well-made Hollywood movie with pleasant direction and a plot that could have been from an above average TV-movie.Probably worth watching once, and that\`s it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a push for someone's agenda that should have been rated R","review":"We rented this while traveling to entertain the family. We also shut it off part way through and were tempted to change the rating for them. It was a blatant attempt to have the writers political and moral views stamped all over us. It was NOT for children. Besides the subject, they had some scenes that should have been cut out if they expected kids to see it. We both hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie has a poorly illustrated theme","review":"Tobey Maguire is good as always and Charlize Theron has a laughable excuse for a southern accent.This movie poorly illustrates the theme that there are difficult decisions in life - that not all decisions are black-and-white: the main character doesn't seem to face any more significant moral dilemnas besides the one in the Cider House.He gives up hope in the world outside the orphanage he grew up in: after losing in love and dealing with a shocking situation, he conservatively retreats to a comfortable life of familiarity.I heard the book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Laugher !!","review":"Read the other reviews to get the \\"storyline.\\" Boring, predictable and a total waste of two hours.

It helps that John Irving himself wrote the script. It's a nice, touchy-feely movie but the plot somewhat drags in the middle and the characters become somewhat fuzzy as well.

The atmosphere in the New England creepy house is captured beautifully and in the expertly filmed overhead shots of the spiral staircase, we can actually feel ourselves being pulled downward into the maelstrom. Between more pleasant scenes of old movie theaters, the wonderful architecture of the interiors and the character development are scenes of unbearable tension for Helen, the mute servant girl played by Dorothy Maguire, as she realizes the mad killer who murders women with physical afflictions is coming after her next. The murderer who is closer than she ever imagined possible is about to pounce and she has no way to scream for help. Ethyl Barrymore is great, as always, playing Helen's unsympathetic employer.

On the other hand the interpretation is well structured and every phrase gets it right. The Würtembergische Kammerorchester under Jörg Färber are equal partners on this wonderful CD. Mozart is coupled with a contemporary composer called Krommer. Of course the composition is not on the same level, but Mrs. Kam's playing makes it a very enjoyable virtuoso concerto."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALPS Mountaineering Directors Chair","review":"Very lightweight yet well made, solid quality with good back support.

I tried to wax my bikini area and found it virtually impossible to pull the strip in the opposite direction of growth, since the hair grows in many different directions. Consequently, the hair was painfully pulled -- but not pulled out. I even experienced some bleeding. They provided plenty of cloth and the wax would presumably last through several waxings. Also, it washes off with warm water, as advertised, and there are good directions in the package, and I didn't experience extended discomfort after pulling off the cloth.

She is so good. I was listening to clips and she is even better live, but her CD is so awesome, you would never guess she could be even better live. Go see her if you get the chance.Her version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow was the most incredible and unique version besides Brother Izie from Hawaii's version. In concert she said it wasn't available except for download, but I couldn't find it here. If anyone knows where I can get that one, let me know via the amazon conversation.

I found so much information and found out she is a prolific and graceful singer with a voice that is not only powerful but smooth as velvet.I say don't miss this CD. It's an incredible bargain but more importantly, it's a rare find for a CD. It's not just country, but standard beautiful music. Since I wanted to hear her voice first, I did Google her as I said and found her site that had clips of everything. I don't know why she doesn't have them posted here.

The main character, Svetlana, goes with her family to Germany and eventually finds herself 12 years old and alone again in Russia. The book follows the twists and turns in her life, caused sometimes by her decisions, but more often by things outside of her control. I found the book full of suspense, so I will not tell you any more about what happens. It seemed that in every page, there was uncertainty looming.

This is a poorly transferred version of the film, edited for TV with language edited and terrible commercial breaks inserted. Unfortunately, his review was buried at the bottom of the page and it was only when I started looking for negative comments that I found it. I'm posting this review to increase the likelihood that nobody else gets duped into the digital version of this movie.The movie itself was decent, but it looks like someone taped this off the television and uploaded it to YouTube.

In some ways it is better since the book does spend 100 pages going off on a tangent that the movie condenses into a 10 minute introduction. John Preston (Michael Caine) is an MI5 agent who happens upon a plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in the United Kingdom and must convince his superiors of the threat. Against him is Vladimir Petrofsky (Pierce Brosnan) who is deadly and ruthless as the Soviet agent sent to carry out this act. It's a race against time to see if Preston can put all the pieces together and stop Petrofsky. The movie adaptation has a higher body count than the book and throws in a bit of sex but is otherwise a faithful adaptation. The biggest complaint that could be made is that the movie has fallen into obscurity which is a shame considering the stars and the story. If you can find it, it's highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whow did I like this","review":"I read some reviews about this movie that some said they didn't think to much of it.I disagree two great actors, a good plot keeps you glued to the screen.

Most of the cast is wasted and Brosnan is somnambulic.Somehow in spite of the Cold War plot, the film seems divorced fromreality.

College kids keep wandering into the house for various reasons, and they all get killed. When a beer-guzzling jock runs over the Nixon-killer with his car, his girlfriend tells him, \\"You must have a low IQ!\\" It barely makes sense, it's supposed to be funny, but can only manage to be weird and boring.

I felt like this books was a poor rip off of a pulpy detective novel with none of the intrigue. The alien races all blended into one another to the point I couldn't keep lizards, chipmunks, and bulldogs straight.

For the money I spent on this, it should not be this way!

Rand had one confrontation in some alley. That's it! There is a lot of women bickering with one another, we get to hear everyone's deepest thoughts and view the most mundane of actions in grueling detail. In my opinion, Jordan is drinking deeply of the one true power (MONEY). At this rate he is going to write 20 more books in this series and be only halfway to the end, but Blood and Bloody Ashes!

Oh well the wheel weaves as the wheel wills...."},{"rating":"1","title":"MINDBOGGLINGLY HORRIBLE","review":"I read this book because I have read them all and must find eventual absolution, even at the price of extreme boredom, but after the last few books I had few expectations. Well, I should have had NO expectations. This is even worse than Path of Daggers....This book goes on ad nauseum about nothing...Perrin doing nothing, Elayne doing nothing and plotting about nothing, Matt doing at least a little something, and Rand doing a bit, as well as doing his concubines. Unfortunately, to get to anything that is interesting, you have to wade through page after page of useless descriptions and dialogue that seem to be there only to take up space. They don't really matter. After the first painful 200 pages, I started just skipping most of it and just reading parts that seemed pertinent, and even most of them were not...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"The series is at last starting to feel climatical. Rand and company overcome (or at least it seems that way) a pivotal antagonist while further evolving in character. A lot of the questions I had have been answered, to some extent, in this latest chapter. My only problem lies in the first few chapters that deal with Perrin's plight; an outcome is never reached. The book is amazing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame","review":"I'm afraid Robert Jordan's good writing stopped at Book 6. It hasn't started up again. The plot-line has become glacially slow and RJ only seems interested in: (a) drawing out the nuances of the tiniest of inter-personal relationships between his main good characters that NO-ONE cares about (braid-tug, sniff etc); (b) creating new characters no-one will ever remember; (c) forgetting about those existing characters that one does recall (hello, RJ, there's one called Mat); (d) laughing up his sleeve at fans puzzling to work out the Adeleas/Asmodean/Demandred threads that have been happening for, oh, 3-4 books now & badly need to be cleared up. And only spiced up at the end after the publishers realised that nothing had happened in the book. I'm waiting for someone to write a 100 page summary of books 7-9.

Before you read it, you know that you shouldn't do it. It won't be good for you. But you can't help yourself. You have to get that Rand Fix. Once you start, you can't stop. But when its over, you are left feeling a little worse than before. You realize that the reality does not match with the expectation.Robert Jordan needs to have something happen in his books. There are a number of storylines that are started and dropped. Why even start the book with Perrin and Faile? Their story disappears.What is the need to introduce \\"Seekers of Truth\\"? We all know that Terry Goodkind has taken liberties in the \\"Sword or Truth\\" series, but why does Jordan recipricate.Robert Jordan needs to get the story moving.

If the next book is like this one it may be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series continues and keeps getting better","review":"The majority of people who have read Jordan's Wheel Of Time series agree that his work is finely crafted with complex stories weaved into one. Even though, I cannot do anyhting but recommend starting the series at book 1, The Eye of the World, I must say that book 9 is unquestionnably my personnal favorite. Jordan is full of surprises, leading the reader to new events affecting every character in the book. The ending itself is a breathtaking finale in its suspense and happenings, and leaves eagerly awaiting the tenth book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ebay Time","review":"Look, everyone seems to be hacking at Jordan now because his once great epic story seems to be bogged down in repetitive descriptions, slow moving plot, added, useless plot lines and slumber parties. Well, I would like to join in. This sucks. I am nine books into a series that should've been over by now. I've been limping along (like so many) since book eight and clearly Jordan has lost his ability, his nerve and his voice.

It was great! For a while. Then it started to become less than expected. Still I looked forward to the next book in the series. Now, after one less thrilling book after another, and the lack of anything from Mr. Jordan in a very long time, I have decided that if there ever is a 10th book, I will probably not buy it. For those readers who have not given up yet, I salute you."},{"rating":"1","title":"still too slow","review":"OK, we know Robert Jordan is arguably the best fantasy writer since Tolkien (or was till George RR Martin started his series), but he's now lost the plot. Literally. From a gripping first three books, to a mediocre second three through to a far too slow and intricate third three that add almost nothing to the overall plot and don't take it very much further. And Winter's Heart is no real exception -- still far too much braid pulling and blushing by the female characters and not enough dialogue or action or historical reference points. I'm very pleased Mr Jordan is now making lots more money than if he had kept this the tighter 5-6 book series he clearly originally planned, but he has now completely wasted his historic opportunity to create something of lasting merit and now is merely doing something good. Still a clear cut above the rest of the field, but well below what we know he is himself capable of. A great pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A never ending story","review":"Instead of this story coming to any resolutions the author add move plots and sub-plots and characters until you cannot even keep up.

It gets really confusing - you read pages not having a clue who you're reading about until suddenly you remember, or you read something that rings a bell, and you have to go back and reread it. A full list of characters at the back of the book would help, and also maybe a synopsis...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subplots are distracting from this series!","review":"My wife got me hooked on \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series - I thought for years they were just more of her romantic novels. Then I started reading them. I was astonished by the first several books, finding a world to rival Tolkien's! Characters to care about and root for! Descriptions of places and events to surpass others I had read.But now I have become concerned that I am reading \\"the never ending story\\"! Particularly after \\"Winter's Heart\\", I am concerned I shall loss patience and never know what became of our heroes as I've lost track of the subplots - actually resorting to a synopsis I found on the web to try to figure out what was going on!The last 50 pages were tremendous but it took perseverence to get there.Other authors that I enjoy, such as McCaffery, Modesitt and Goodkind, want to tell a story while Jordan seems more intent on confusing me with a myriad of subplots, similar names, and repetion."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I must say that after reading all of the books in the series up until now, I am very disappointed. Even though the ending of this book is OK, there are still to many unanswered questions, too many sub stories to follow. In his first few books of the series, I enjoyed the plots because they were relatively few and easy to follow. Now though, there are too many plots and questions; when is the series going to actually approach some sort of ending? The way things are going, it will take another 9 books, especially if Jordan continues to answer half the questions posed by previous books and introduces more than were answered. I really wish I could give the book more stars but in good conscience, I can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish the damn series for Gods sake!","review":"Nearly 800 pages and only one major event took place in this book. Ever since the dragon reborn, this series has begun to drag....and drag!. It took 300 pages in Winters Heart for anything significant to occur. The book kept my interest....but just barely. Robert Jordan spends entirely too much time setting the scene and describing the battles of will between the HUNDREDS of characters is these books. It is nearly impossible to keep every character straight. I very nearly did not purchase this book because of the same long windedness in the previous 6 books. If this series extends beyond 10 books, I will give up on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little, Too Late","review":"Once again, Mr. Jordan has toh to all all his faithful readers. The tip off that this book was going to be more of the same nonsense is the title - Winters Heart. Very exciting, huh? In the future, if there is no verb in the title, I'm going to think twice about buying any book.Jordan seems to get some perverse pleasure by creating endless new characters who are virtually undistinguishable from other characters - there must be 1,000 by now. Who cares about them?Imagine the excitement and power of a final book that resolved all of the major prophecies. If Jordan had decided to make a 5-book series, we would be happily into the sequels 5-book series now. There is absolutely no point to a 10,11,12. . .part series, other than to be greedy and an egomaniac.Jordan could have been *THE* Fantasy writer of the century - but he continues to diminish himself by dragging this out and spoonfeeding us bits and pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary M@sturb@tion","review":"This is yet another in what's become a looooong line of:1) Jordan's introduction of dozens and dozens of irrelevant characters2) Eyeball-glazing descriptions of irrelevant places & items3) Fights with the forsaken that end in either escape or are reincarnated by the dark one4) Expounding upon a dizzying array of barely relevant subplots5) RJ expecting author-worship for every tree-killing page he spews forthI humbly propose a boycott on this series until the story is moved substantially closer to it's finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"the plot thickens and my skin thins","review":"I quickly became a fan of Jordan at the onset of the WoT series. I had read some of his other stuff, jumped headlong into this particular series, and quickly became miffed around book six.While I enjoy the plot, the neverending line of new characters, subplots, minor drivel between inconsequential characters and a diluted diatribe have turned me off.Jordan doesn't keep the reader enthralled at this junction in the series. It is quite beyond time to wrap this series up and move on. DO NOT begin this lump of work unless you enjoy the aforementioned.With the amount of time I've invested, I'll continue the series, but I don't recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was just a serial set-up","review":"The 'action' and 'movement' in this book were just to set up book 10 so RJ could sell a few more copies ala \\"When we last left our intrepid hero.\\" (Something he's been in the habit of doing since Dumai Wells at least). Knowing what we know now, the story isn't a decology, and faced with the crisis of being caught extending this series ad naseaum and not being able to sell book 11 he rolls out a prequel to prove to us he can still advance a plot. The problem is he won't do too much in book 11 or the series will be done before he dies/book 30 (whichever comes first). Jordan is playing us for suckers. This series is a train wreck and the engineer is still asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please finish this before you die!!!","review":"I must say that Robert Jordan has such a vivid idea of his world that it really does come to life on the pages. People who complain about too many characters and the complicated plot can go and read picture books and fairy tales. My only concern now is that Mr. Jordan may well die before the conclusion of this story (especially if he writes other books in the meantime) and that would be a tradgedy.All I can say is hurry up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart","review":"I hope that our Mr.Jordan has made enough money off of books 8 and 9 of The Wheel of Time series.

And not put anymore money in Mr. Jordans pocket until he proves that he deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a cliff notes version???? Please","review":"In all my years of reading, I have come to the conclusion that no writter is capable of keeping a story going longer than 3 books. I don't know if I will be able to finish this one. It has so many meaningless plots and characters that its impossible to keep up with what's going on. And in a lot of parts there is a lot of dialog or whatever and nothing happens. Parts of the book seem to exist that should have been removed by an editor. What I would love to know is, where was Jordan going early on. Did he loose the original idea? Anyway, I'm sorry to say. Don't buy this book. If you have to read it. Go to a library or borrow it from some poor fool who bought it like me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy!","review":"I'm not going to tell you anything different from the other million reviewers on here. In a nutshell, very little happens in this book to further the story that Jordan began so promisingly... NINE books and more than three THOUSAND pages ago. He hops around in the story like a child that's eaten too many sweets, and manages to move his plot lines along not a whit. If you've read this far in the series you'll probably finish this novel and read the next when it comes out. You won't really enjoy it though. Even Rand, who I thought was the most exciting character to follow in the first seven books, is flat and one dimensional. So, I will await the next book, without bated breath, and will purchase it despite the queasy feeling in my stomach brought on by the thirty dollar price tag. Oy!And apparently those fellows at Tor were awful rushed trying to get this masterpiece out for Christmas judging by all those typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"Another disappointment. What Jordan does in 100 words, most authors do in 10. This series started out great but in the last few books, it's just dragged on. I have about 10 years into this series and I'm just about at the point of saying enough is enough. There has been so many characters and subplots introduced it's difficult to figure out what's happened between books. It's almost as if Jordan does not know where he's going with it and hoping he will think up something. In the meantime, he is getting rich writting crap. Get with it Jordan and move this series along."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up...","review":"This series started out fantastically, but having read Terry Goodkind(now that's a man that knows how to save a series!) and others, Jordan is a waste of my time. This is the first book I will have ever only partially read. I've read 200 pages or so and have agonized over those. See ya 'round Jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still a good read.","review":"Although this has been the best series I have ever read (and I think I have read each book at least 4 times) I think it's starting to slow down a bit. I would love to say each one gets better, but the first book (which I would rate about 6 stars) is still the best. I liked Winter's Heart very much though."},{"rating":"2","title":"building the forces to face the dark","review":"Rand begins to put into place the necessary allies and situations he needs to face The Dark One. This book is full of wonderful happenings - Mat's meeting with the Daughter of the Nine Moons (which we knew was coming soon), Rand taking the warder bond with the women he loves, the Seanchan groundswell of invasion (or return) and the supposed success in cleansing the male side of the One Power. I could not put this book down. The last quarter of the book, especially, held me spellbound.

Sounds long and drawn out and badly in need of editing, basically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Time needs winding up.","review":"I have read all of the Wheel of Time series and have become dismayed at the change in style with the last three books. Mr. Jordan is belaboring old issues and is not at all clear how new ones relate to the plot. He does nothing to assist the reader's memory in recalling characters and their importance. A prologue would help or, at least, a more elaborate glossary which includes the dozens of minor repeated characters, locations, and events. Certainly one motivation for this stretching out of the story would be to continue his revenue; his editor would gain by that tactic also. For number 10 and beyond I will wait for others to read and review his production and not automatically get the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling in the Ways!","review":"As he closed book nine of the series, Kyle thought he had gone mad. There was a flash of blinding light that ripped the air around him as the dull thud of closing the book echoed distantly. -Light, where am I?- As it donned on him that he was actually in the Ways, that once majestic means of travel created by the Aes Sedai and grown by Ogier, his heart began to pound in his chest as if it were trying to break free. Darkness closed in around him. Heart racing ever faster. \\"Hello? Help,\\" he gasped. He took a step back by instinct, like stepping away from an attacking badger, but the edge didn't hold. He slipped over the edge of the island and began a fall that would last for eternity.-----------------------Will this story every freaking end? Light help me. Light help us all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valandir","review":"The last three books have been frustrating. The trend continues, if Jordan is developing a style it is that of a shclock-pumping serial pulp writer. The first books got my attention, but now he has betrayed his former works and slipped into the role of the non-story teller. I hope the he gets with the program or we'll be better off watching Sienfeld reruns (same level of content, but at least its humorous)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great improvement","review":"Unlike other critics -- who in my opinion are naggy idealistic ignorant wolheads-- I believe that this book is a major improvement. There is a decent amount of action and a lot of mysteries are resolved. I liked the book and am impatiently waiting for the next one to come out. If I have to mention a flaw in this book; Id have to say that the editing could be better. :( What happened guys? Did your kids edit it?. There are plenty of misspellings, mising commas and just plain bad grammar. It looks like the first draft was published. Either way Good job on this one RJ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And I love the series?!","review":"This book is about 90% mush and 10% plot advancement. \\"The Eye of The World\\" entranced me from the first chapter and kept me going straight through the next 8 books. Then I had to stop and wait, and wait, and wait, and finally \\"Winter's Heart\\" arrived. The worst part is I bought it in hardback, oh! the money! I love this series, I greatly enjoy this author, but he is falling into the trap so many epic authors succumb to. Where do we go from here? So many fights, so much heroism, so many twists, is Jordan beginning to lose the threads? I hope not because even now, so many months and years after beginning this series, I still occasionally wonder, what's going to happen to Rand? Mr. Jordan, are we there yet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Series starts well!","review":"When I picked up the first book of this series I was pleasantly surprised. Good characters, nice story line, good action. Unfortunately, book two wasn't quite up to par. Book three a little worse, book four even worse...you get the picture. Way to much time spent on needless details and insignificant characters. Books 6,7,8,9 were a major struggle. Save yourself the time, read books 1 and 2, and create the rest of the story on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, an endurance test for Jordan fans!","review":"Jordan fans must endure this only because we want to see how it finally ends. Readers new to this series, please, don't start it until Jordan proves that he can wrap it up in the next decade or so. Jordan's latest provides about 100 pages of real enjoyment, layered in 500 pages of filler. Jordan introduces/retains characters and sub-plots that provide little value-added to a once great story. He should take a lesson from George R.R. Martin and start killing off a few hundred main characters or so!With his latest installment, I found myself skipping/skimming entire chapters without missing a whiff of the real story.Let the buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"There is a good deal to complain about in this book, but nearly as much as with the last few books.The complaint I have is not necessarily in the exquisite detail which is what sold many of us long ago, but in the rehashing of said exquisite detail over and over. Some things seem to be described a coulpe times each book... that's 18 times by now...The secret is to just skip the fluff, which is now boring, and to get on to the actual events that transpire in the novel. Fortunately, unlike the last couple, this one has a lot going on and was, once again, a rather good read. I would have given it only a '3' though... but the ending is tremendous and actually has me pumped up and ready for the next book. I hope he continues the torrid pace now that threads seem to be weaving back together, and finds a way to end it with book ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually things are picking up again","review":"What a differance Matt makes in this story. He was painfully absent in POD (book 8). Rand Al Thor shows that no one...no one can stand up to him anymore. Moridin/Ishmael once again has failed badly for the Dark One. At least this time he had the common sense to send the other forsaken after Rand. Don't want to spoil it for those haven't read this, lets just say not many made it out alive. Al Thor Rules, nice to see the series alive. For those who keep complaining. Suggest you try George R.R. Martin's \\"song of ice\\" series. Which is admittedly far superior. I think what the Dark One needs to compete with Rand is the \\"Tyrion\\" character from Martin's series. You know someone \\"smart\\". enough rambling. Laters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am amazed at how high this book is rated!","review":"I can't believe so many people actually like this book. Nothing happened in it. Well OK the story progressed a little tiny bit but for the most part everyone is in the same place they were when the story started.To me it seems like Jorden is milking a cash cow. He keeps writing books thinking we will keep buying them because we are hooked on the series. If the characters continued to make progress the series would eventually end. I don't think Jorden wants it to end so he has started to write books where very little progress is made!The reviews on book 10 are dreadful. I am done with the series. It is really a shame since the first several books were so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get to the end man!","review":"I have read this series through book 9. 1-5 I enjoyed. The rest has been down hill. I only bought 9 thinking it would finally end the story I started years ago. I will not buy another WOT until the final chapter is written. A long story I can take. This garbage that has been written of late is a very poor and frustrating read.Get to the bloody point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, except the last chapter","review":"Found myself skipping over half the book due to elaborate details about womens clothing and their squabbles. Criminey.1000 pages about women straightening their skirts and wondering if they were showing to much 'bosom' Excuse me, wasn't this an adventure series at one point?Lost in the wilderness, they stumbled upon Redbook...and that was all she wrote.

Jordan's first few books in this series were enthralling and I eagerly awaited the next one. Since book 4, he has consistently gone down hill, hitting a new bottom with this one. I would compare reading this with transcripts from the House or Senate. Keep it by your bedside when you need something to lull you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of series, not just book","review":"OK, I thought fantasy was supposed to be fun, supposed to take you away. This series has gotten harder to read than a John LeCarre novel. Granted Winter's Heart is better than the past few books, but I am beginning to believe I deserve at least a dinner and a movie for what Jordan is doing to me. Like everyone else, I just want to see the end. And if you are like me and remember when fantasy was fun, do what I did and go back and read Edding's Belgariad or The Lord of the Rings and see if you still have patience left for this series. At the end of the Belgariad I still cared about those characters and was disappointed to see their story end (until the Mallorean) but with the WOT I hope they all die in Book 10 and we wrap this up. Who truly cares anymore? Lucas will make 5 more Star Wars movies before this thing is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraged","review":"Volume eight and volume nine have moved the story along at a snails pace. One gets the feeling that the author and publisher are taking advantage of early volume success by stringing along the loyal readers who have been with them since volume one. It's discouraging to see Mr. Jordan going for quantity over quality and going the way of Tom Clanc and Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Like Watching an Old Boxer Get the Snot Beat Out of Him","review":"I wonder how much Jordan has been manipulated by his Editor and Publisher. Milk it baby! He has probably described \\"wool dress\\" close on 1,000 times. I remember reading about a proposed 8 volumes about five years ago. This garbage is no better than a soap opera and is probably worse since formulaic suspense has at least a rhythm and flow that is predictable and comforting. This stuff is like a car that's missing on one cylinder. So much incredible promise having degenerated into such pathos - its a crying shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had enough!","review":"Mr. Jordan has finally gone too far by not going far enough. I've been faithful from the beginning, but this one reads like a bad soap opera and his fixation with manipulative women borders on boring. Too many characters, too many subplots and not enough happening to the main characters, at least I assume Rand is a main character. The menage-a-trois plus one is too much. I enjoyed the series up until Path of Daggers, held out hope for a conclusion with that one and now there will be yet another book, which patterns woven tell me will also not end it. At this point I don't care if it never ends, I'm finished. Read it at your own risk, but be prepared to skim pages just to find out IF anything is happening. A real disappointment for what was a potentially good story - in the distant beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing much....","review":"I've been an avid reader of the series, enjoying each successive Jordan missive as they've been releases. For books 4-8, I re-read the entire series before reading the latest release, just for the continuity and because the books are, well, re-readable.But now...ugh!See, to me, it's all about \\"suspension of disbelief\\"...or, in other words, the ability to be immersed in a story line so convincing that your right-brain takes over and mundane things, such as time, cease to be.Just didn't happen in this book. I actually found myself forcing my hands to pick up and continue where I had lost dropped the tome in distracted disgust. I think this is the last Jordan issue I will buy. Part of my problem with the story line is that the characters lose their \\"other ordinariness\\" because they take so damn long to *make* things happen. Rand as a re-active (as opposed to proactive) character just isn't a convincing sell.Sorry...on to other novels..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a tiresome book!","review":"Robert Jordan is just too long winded for me. I enjoyed the first six books, but lately, especially with this last book, it is just not fun anymore. Unless you are obsessed with the Wheel of Time series, go spend your money on something better and more tightly written books. All the characters continue to whine and nothing ever really happens (...). Read the first six books and skip the rest until he decides to finally end this long winded series that rambles on and on and on and on. LIGHT, what a bore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan does not deserve our loyalty.","review":"Ah, it coulda been good. If only we could rewind to book 5 or 6 and take away all the bad, boring nothingness between all the great character building and plot. I feel personally betrayed, as at this point I have invested god knows how many hours in pouring over this story, and I think jordan has actually gone and stopped telling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooorrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnggg","review":"How do these guys think they can get away with writing these volumes of :xxxx\\". I bought the first book, it was great. The second was too. The next was good, the one after that OK, and then it was below par and then it just went down hill. Now I have read and paid for nine books and I am still no closer to finding out anything! This last book was increadly boring. I went through it in about 3 days, eager to find out what happens. Only to discover that NOTHING happens in this book what-so-ever. It could be left out of the series and no one would ever know.Let's call this book what it really wis, A BIG disapointment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, just get on with it!!!!","review":"I have to agree with most of the previous reviews on this book. Whilst the first 4 or 5 in the series were very good, ever since then the books have just been more padding and less story. The characters have become continuingly 1 dimensional, the female characters especially. (While they appear to be strong willed, all they ever seem to do is complain about the men, and compare how low cut their dresses are.) As you progress through to the end of this book you realize that while the book is close to 1000 pages long, the whole books' story line could have been compressed down to about 30. We are continuingly waiting for something to happen.Based on the reading of the 7th and 8th books I was unsure whether to buy this book, but I did more to continue on with a series I initially enjoyed. I am now telling my friends not to bother buying it, just go to a bookstore, pick it off the shelf and read the last 50 pages. They are the only ones with anything actually in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORINGG","review":"I feel as if Robert Jordan ran out of steam and is trying to milk as much money from this series as possible before readers catch on to his scheme. I absolutely LOVE the first five or six books now but I have lost a lot of my interest. I didn't even finish book 9. It usually would take me a day or two to finish a good book. But after three weeks, I cannot find myself reading any more of Winter's Heart. It is a little bit better than book 7 where nothing was accomplished. My attention is now drawn to the Sword of Truth series. check it out if you haven't already"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will he never end this story?","review":"I have read all the installments in the series. As the series progressed, (slowly,...very slowly) I have expected less and less from each installment. The latest installment is no different. The characters and plot lines are now spread so thin that they appear as cartoon cut-outs rather than characters with any depth. The pacing of the plot is so slow, and the books appear so infrequently that neither Mr. Jordan or myself are likely to be around to write/read about the final battle of good and evil. Save your money; if you have to read this book go the library or borrow it from a friend. It is no longer worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back To Writing Conan.......","review":"Dear Robert,I recommend you stop wasting everyones time and hard earned cash and complete this mess.

The series should have been completed in six volumes max! As I read, I found myself skipping the unnecessary chapters that focused on minor characters because I don't care enough about them to bother reading their stories.I am so fed up that I refuse to buy the books anymore.

All the others were awesome to OK. But, let's face it - Get on with it! I'm not really interested in +++pages of Matt traveling with the circus, or Elayne's torment becoming Queen, or Egwene's mishaps with other Aes Sedai. I want some ACTION. What's going on in the AshAman (sp?)'s heads- I mean, how cool would that be since the Taint is gone? I'm sick of this. But I'll still read the rest, who knows how much time I've already spent. SURELY IT MUST BE OVER SOON. Not even Tolkien could go on this long. Wrap it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop it with the Aiel!!!! They were quaint early on..","review":"The Aiel is the first time in man's history where more men live in a barren wasteland than in the furtile places. The Aiel have never seen snow but adapt to it with no problems even though where they come it is so extremely hot that no one else can survive in it long. Just think of what the story is saying and realize it doesn't make sense, it is NOT an easy or smooth read. Unfortunately, I bought too many books!!! Read the first three or four and make up your own ending is the only reasonable advice I have for someone thinking of reading this series... I have several friends who have already given up with this series for too many good reasons not to listen to them!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Jordan is on the path to redemption","review":"For all of those who say that too little happened in A Path of Dagger and A Crown Of Swords I agree with you. Jordan could have not written those two books and nothing would have changed. Yet in this book he does not give the reader a whole lot (certainly less than in the first five books), but there are some monumental changes that make this book worth reading if you wish to read the rest of the series. For those who truley loved the first five give this one a try and read it all the way to the end and you will find that the series is starting to pick up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to Robert Jordan?","review":"I like RJ as much as the next fan but this book was pure disappointment. Slow plot lines and too much detail is how I would describe it. As a fan of the series you keep reading through the chapters, not because the story grabs you, but because you're waiting for something to happen. Nothing really does. RJ should have added the \\"major event\\" in this book to his last and saved us all the trouble of book nine.With the last few books, it's beginning to feel as if he's milking($) his fans instead of making sure his storyline continues to be exiting and imaginary and move towards it's natural conclusion.Just my opinion......."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long Days Journey Into Futility","review":"Well here we are Book 9 of the Wheel of Time series and I still scratch my head wondering why I continue to bother. True, as others have mentioned, after investing so much time in this, it's almost mandatory reading now, as if I was still in school. Winter's Heart is an improvement over the preceding 3 books, but it in no way captures the spirit of the early volumes. Jordan is obviously in it only for the money now and suckers like me will continue to line his pockets. The ending by the way, had the potential to be terrific, but Jordan drops the ball by failing to complete the narrative action on many of the point of view set pieces. He becomes lazy by setting up the individual conflicts then abandons them. You only discover threads of what transpired when it's all over. Very sloppy, and not considerate to the reader who had to endure much minutia before reaching the climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid performance by Robert Jordan","review":"Once again, Robert Jordan has come through with a very enjoyable installment in his epic saga, The Wheel of Time. Each of the 650 plus pages holds on to you and leaves you breathless for the next installment. I'm not holding my breath though...but I would if it would make Jordan write faster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's Book 9, now pay me.","review":"Okay. I have read, waited, forgotten, read again, waited, forgotten. I started this series years ago, when it had promise, and like everyone else, I am sick of this drawn out drivel Mr. Jordan is passing for a fantasy novel. It all boils down to this: He is padding his retirement portfolio! What was originally going to be an eight to ten book series, has ballooned into the 'teens! Or more, from what I've heard!It's all about the Benjamins now. Too bad, as this series was one of the best, if not the best, since Tolkein. Then came Book Seven...then Eight...then Nine. God forbid Mr. Jordan should have a heart attack. We'd never know how the series ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart","review":"Even though this was sold new, two of the CDs were defective and chapters could not be listened to.

This series shouldn't have gotten to a ninth book; it's incredibly wordy, and too long. However, THE END IS IN SIGHT! Important stuff happens in this book, and major plot points are ended. This is something that didn't seem to be true of books seven and eight..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wheel picks up the pace and turns faster...","review":"Everyone knows that the Wheel of TIme series is excellent through The Fires of Heaven. Lord of Chaos, although it did have its moments (coughcoughDUMAI'S WELLScoughcough), was overburdened with too much politics. Its name shoulda been \\"How to [Anger] Aes Sedai in Three Easy Steps.\\" A Crown of Swords and The Path of Daggers started to pick up the pace a little, but some events got dragged out way too much. Although this fault keeps up in Winter's Heart, it is much better and puts some adventure back into this epic.Although Egwene ought to have deposed Elaida, Elayne should be queen be now (and why doesn't RJ just go ahead and kill Faile already???), there are some truly great parts, such as Mat's return to the series in Seanchan-occupied Eby Dar, and Rand's quest to cleanse the Dark One's tain from Saidin. Although Winter's Heart isn't the return of WoT in full force, it does promise an amazing (The Shadow Rising-Quality) sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I'd just like to point out the fact that Robert Jordan knows what he's doing. I'm getting sick of the people bombing this book; everything he ever does in every book, he does for a reason. Some parts are slow, sure, but they're necessary for the plotline to develop. I've even seen some bombers say that they got bored after the first 70 pages...look, if you get bored that fast, don't bother reading decent fantasy at all. You obviously have no patience whatsoever. This book is one of the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I strongly suggest not buying any of these \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series books until the final conclusion book is out in paperback. It just isn't worth hardback dollars.Sadly, I would not be suprised if Roberts Jordan's creative talents ever again rise to anywhere near the level that he had before starting \\"The Wheel of Time series.\\" Mr. Jordan's creative ability has been so misused by this publisher, who seeks to get so many volumes out of a good story that the story begins to die of boredom, that it may have been deeply harmed. He has spent about 10 years doing this series and probably has lost his creative desire and is left with a talent that is covered with mold and dust.This story is one that has been page stuffed well beyond the 3 volumes it could easily be condensed into. Mostly, when the series is finally (if ever) concluded, it need to be sent to the Reader's Digest staff to be condensed into it's proper size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another tedious entry in the series","review":"This is another tedious entry in this seemingly endless series. Jordan needs to start wrapping it up. He's losing his audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I Had trouble putting it down. I will start 10 immediately.Every plot turn makes you eager for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOTSA ERRORS!!!","review":"This book is sloooooow... at least till you get to the end. There are lots of charactors that are very unfamiliar and to make it all even worse, there are tons of gramatical errors (one of my pet peaves). The previous 8 books weren't nearly so poorly edited and there seemed to be some effort at keeping charactors somewhat familiar. It got 2 stars simply because I didn't \\"HATE IT\\". But I do need it to get to the next one. If book 10 is as poorly written, I probably won't be going any further in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Lack luster and full of annoying female characters that cover up their lack of whit with annoying bullying and brow beating. As a woman I even find this annoying... He doesn't have a single stron female character any more. Even those that started out so strongly have lost their power."},{"rating":"1","title":"What more can be said?","review":"Well, this review is a little late in coming. I read this book a few months after it first came out (over 10 years ago). After trudging through book 8 I just kept hoping for things to get better. This book was a painful read for me. By the the end of this book the Robert Jordan rose colored glasses cracked, the spark went out, and my enjoyment of the series turned to disdain. I swore off the series because of this book. Although, after 10 years I decided to pick up book 10 to see if Jordan redeemed himself (book 10 is probably even worse).The creative reviews of this book, far, far exceed the actual book itself! A sore disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Unremarkable","review":"This installment of the series borders on unnecessary. While Mat and Rand have plot lines that are actually resolved in the end, despite hundreds of pages with no development, Perrin's quest to get Faile back continues to go unfulfilled.I loved the atmosphere of the novel. It's a shame that such a striking change in the aesthetics wasn't accompanied by a big change in the story itself. We have gone through eight books of the Wheel of Time series with no winter. Finally the natural order has been restored and we have snow-covered lands and a world of white. This changes the dynamic of the world we've come to know in interesting ways. It's not until end of the book we have great sweeping changes in the story to accompany the snow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to put this dog to bed","review":"This series would have been one of the BEST fantasy series ever had Jordan kept it to 4 - or maybe 5 - books. He's no longer beating a dead horse - he's now beating the greasy spot where the horse used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can it get?","review":"The quality of the Wheel of Time has been going steadily downhill. I thought we had scraped the bottom with the last one and the series would pick up again as we neared a conclusion. However large parts of this book are completely unreadable. Characters become more and more superficial and their motivations quetionable. Half the chapters and characters have no relevance to the main story. Robert Jordan should have mercy on us all and bring the series to a quick end. What a shame after such an excellent start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan Not Back on Track Yet","review":"As with the last book in the series (Path of Daggers) I was very disappointed at the waste in failing to address the major plots and focussing on minor, boring plots. About half the book is wasted on Elayne and her political machinations to secure the throne of Andor. When Jordan finally does get around to the three main characters (the three men from Emond's Field) there finally is some action and resolution to some questions, but these interesting sections are less than half the book. The book also fails to advance chronologically. The events in Winter's Heart are contemporanius with the second half of Path of Daggers. Obviously these two books really should have been one book, but they were stretched into two books and a lot of boring filler added, making the series suffer tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a box of NO-DOZE -- you're going to need it","review":"I used to eagerly await new books in this series but now I've decided to walk away from it. This lastest installment is just boring. If your into political intrigue that has very little to do with plot then this is your cup of tea. However, I honestly believe that Mr. Jordan has gotten a sizable extension from his publisher and is now milking this series for as long as possible. Its a shame. It was a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be brief.","review":"There are two side of the issue, and a stunning debate that I'm not really qualified to approach, so I'll just say this: Jordan doesn't have an evil strong enough to carry 13 novels. He started well (really, really well), but the whole thing is getting old. And the inactivity! It's like Shakespeare stretching Hamlet out for aproximately 8,000 pages, it just isn't happening.I agree with the other reviewer that action is not the most important ingredient of a fantasy novel, but it is an ingredient. If there was an evil strong enough, this would work (maybe), but there isn't the \\"presence\\" that drives good, and without it, it loses urgency, and falls flat. For heaven's sake, I practically fell asleep reading the TEASER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Milking it","review":"BRING ON TARMON GAI'DON!

I've read all of Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series and this book has little or nothing to offer. It's filled with bitchy, foul-tempered women and weak, no-impact characters. It's time to end the Wheel of Time series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the Fashion","review":"This is the last of this series to me. I feel ripped off. I just don't care what happens. I have stuck it out with Nine books. I cannot take it anymore...The story is still progressing too slowly, one or two significient events in each of the last few books and the rest filled with over emotional fluff. It's time to bring the group back together and march. As Corwin says \\"Talk is cheap...Whiskey costs money\\"A real sore point with me is that I estimate that the number of words describing the frequent changes in attire of the female characters is enough to fill at least 2 of the 9 books to date.I also have no sense of the amount of time that has past. Is it months or years? Do we have a new L. Ron Hubbard in the making here.This is supposed to be Sword & Sorcery ??? No way would Tolkein write this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star poll","review":"for veryone who gave this book a 5 star rec: 1 quick assignment, please write a 1 paragraph bio of the 87 main characters, so the rest of us can appreciate it too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish it, already!","review":"Don't buy this book until Jordan finishes the series -- I have my suspicions that he never will.This series has degenerated into books, written a year or more apart, that detail a myriad of character plots, but do little to advance the major plot. Jordan has a cash cow here, and he's going to ride it as long as he can. I started reading this series many years ago, and by the time Winter's Heart came out, it took me several hundred pages before I was even close to up to speed again. And how much is really happening here. Not much. We keep meeting new people and being diverted by new character plots.Is Jordan stalling? Does he have no clue how to finish this series? At the rate he is going, he is going to die before book 47, the final in the series, can be written.Personally, if I was doing it over again, I'd wait until the series was done, then read them all back to back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was wondering why the gender stereotypes were annoying...","review":"Now I find out his wife edits them.

I agree that books 7 and eight have been merely \\"getting there\\" in their structure,but I think book eight,\\"Winters Heart\\" has actually moved on quite alot. I noticed the stories about each of the main characters were longer,less changing the subject. Each had a suspenseful ending,and were much more complete. Good,Good. However,my complaint is the difficulty of remembering the characters names! Was this one good or bad ,were they a Darkfriend or Black Ajah ,or whatever. With the long downtime between books I wish the list of names in the index was more complete,so that very similar names could be recognised.Particularly the Aes Sedai,so many of them. All in all I feel Jordan is coming back on track,but however many books are their going to be!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It keeps going and going...","review":"With so many reviews I'm suprised that this book rated as high as it did. Jordan obviously gained many devoted fans with the first few books of the series, which were among the best I have ever read.The problem is that Jordan has introduced so many side characters, that 90% of recent books is taken up by useless dialog that does nothing to further the main plot. If it wasn't already taken, I would recommend that the series be renamed \\"The Never Ending Story\\".If you haven't yet started the series, read the first 6 or so books and wait for the last one, if it ever comes out. There's nothing in the more recent books but filler dialog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book went no where. It took me 4 months to finish because I kept putting it down in favor of more interesting books(like my dish washer manual). If its content were edited to half the number pages and a small climax and partial conclusion were added, the book would have been much more enjoyable. I don't consider the encounter at the end a climax. It seems like it was just pasted in. I won't buy book 10 unless it's the conclusion, and that's only because I've invested so much time already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for #9","review":"I don't understand what all the criticism is about. So your unhappy the books moving slowly, characters left out, questions not be answered immediately, right? Well it just has to happen. This is the ninth book in the series. Jordan has by this point spread out his plot and cast so thickly that he cannot maintain the rapid speed that his first couple books held. If he tried to it would be an injustice to his whole plot buildup. In the first couple books he had one plot line and one central group of characters which enabled Jordan to move quickly, but now he must keep track of all the characters, seperate conflicts and stories and still makes it enjoyable to read. And he does. The story loses momentum, yes. But it does not lose that magical feeling that has always made the series great. So to all the criticism I say you try to write nine novels of one plotline and still have many, much awaited, fantastical events yet to occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 9 of The Wheel of Tedium","review":"How very sad to observe a gifted writer like Robert Jordan become trapped upon his own wheel..The Wheel of Tedium. The plot meanders, the pace is like marching through molasses. Characters are named and seemingly never heard from again. Questions raised books ago are never resolved and new questions are raised with little hope of resolution. I skimmed entire chapters at a time. Worst of all, Jordan no longer loves his characters. He's probably becoming as bored with them as we are.Robert, please...from a devoted fan whose been along from the beginning: do us all a favor, take what remaining new ideas you have left, bundle them together in a final book and end the saga. And if it's about the money, not to worry: just start the wheel turning again with book one of the next epoch."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a stinkeroo","review":"I loved the first six books in this series. Books seven and eight were the beginning of a slow decline. This book was the worst. It was about 600 pages too long.

HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH THE PLOT - HE HAS NO PARTICULAR ENDING IN MIND.So, if you have any illusions about Robert Jordan being a great writer who will safetly bring you home to a brilliant conclusion to this series - put them at rest, BECAUSE HE WON'T.Still it's been interesting reading how frustrated all his readers are - the question I have is - why are you still reading this if it is so bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"read the last 50 pages, the rest is filler","review":"Another miserable 650 pages to slog through in Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series. The first several in the series were good, but this is ridiculous. Not even the L. Ron Hubbard's (hope the Church of Scientology doesn't mind me using his name in vain) Battlefield Earth series was this painful, or this long.Seriously, this has to be longest series ever written to not have a conclusion, and yet promise one. His minor characters, and small plot twists spanning multiple volumes add nothing to the story. which are issued out every two years.It takes this long to write a book that has no major plot events, adds nothing noteworthy, and manages to skip through the admittedly interesting conclusion to get to the end in a length readers might stand?Ask yourself this, when the ending that you've read ~7000 pages (and running) to get to happens, will you look back and say \\"oh, yeah, that added to the story?\\"Don't even bother with the first 32 chapters. Nothing happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience is a virture, but. . . .","review":"This book reminds me of the first 5 books of this series. Those books I could not put down until I was finished. This is less so in part because it is so difficult to keep all of the characters and subplots straight after leaving them behind for two years.If anything, I would ask Mr. Jordan to put a list of characters and where they fit into the plot in order to help out next time around. The glossary is not adequate.But, Rand is getting it together.

It seems that I cannot stop reading this series due to all the time and energy I have invested in memorizing all the names and places, wondering when Nyneave will pull out all her hair, or if the Aes Sedia are actually Bene-Jeserits in disguise. I still see glimpses of the writing that got me hooked, but they are so few and far between, I find myself skipping paragraph after paragraph until I see something that cathces my eye.

It's not quite as good as the first few books, but it's definitely a step up from \\"Path of Daggers\\", which was horrible. The last chapter was the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disapointment","review":"For all the Jordan fans waiting for the series to finally get back on track...don't hold your breath. Jordan starts off with an utterly useless section about Perrin and continues with hundreds of pages about Elayne's political troubles. There is virtually no major advancement of the main plot until the very end of the novel. Remember what the main plot is? Don't feel bad if you forgot. It's been a long time since anything important has happened in Rand land. As for those who think this series is as good as Tolkien's 'Lord of the Ring', get real! On sheer imagination, Jordan's series is immense. However, it's too unfocused and divergent to be ever considered as good as Tolkien's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good book","review":"I got this book for Christmas and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I picked it up, and started reading. Like some of the last few books, it was not very interesting for the first few hundred pages. Jordan seems to be losing his style that first interested me in the Wheel of Time series. A bunch of useless instances, and emphasis on what people are wearing and how they look. Seriously folks, WHO THE HELL CARES? It came across to me that it was just some filler. But if you think about it, these last few books have had endings where you know that something in the next, or later book(s) is going to happen. Putting the boredom aside for the half of the book, you reach the ending, which is undoubtly one of the best in the series. Robert Jordan couldn't have come up with a better one. Sure it's a little predictable, but once you read it, you can't stop until the end. Then you'll find yourself waiting for the next book. I just can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WHEEL OF TIME IS STILL FROZEN IN THIS WINTER'S HEART","review":"as an avid reader if the wheel of time series, i can't help but continue to be disappointed. where some questions were answered most were not. and can someone please tell me what is happening w/perrin and fail? this story line begins the book and then just disappears. also, did i miss something, or shouldn't winter be over? i could have sworn that was what the bowl of winds was for. as w/the last 3 books, i spent much of the time just skimming pages looking for something of real interest. it is no longer the series that enthralled me w/magic and monsters galore. now we are lucky to have rand channel to just to bring a pitcher of wine to himself or to see a grey man pop up. where has all the fun and action gone? i just want to get to the last battle and be done..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I still don't know why this book has such a good rating...It was much worse than the 8th book yet people seem to like it more. I have to say, you really only need to read the last 100 pages or so if you are a WoT fan. The rest is junk. I don't criticize books very often. I understand that the author has to make a living. But sheesh...Jordan sure is making a living at the expense of those who have grown to love his series. Hopefully, he'll write some better stuff in the future..."},{"rating":"1","title":"And in yet another installment....","review":"...our heroes spend 600 some odd pages waiting for the light to turn green so they can cross the street. Does anyone need to point out that Tolstoy wrote the entire War and Peace in about 1600 pages. Must we keep killing trees for this poor Tolkien rip-off. Poorly written, boring, goes on and on and at the end you're just waiting for the next part to see if it could possibly be more boring...and it is!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like getting lost in a maze","review":"I loved the beginning of this series, so much so that I turned on 2 or 3 buddies onto it as well. Started out great, the plot lines, sub plots, deep characters and just a great read.But enough is enough. I find myself hoping a plague or magic will wipe out 3 sub plots as it is getting too confusing.There is such a great story underneath all of this, but when 4 main characters turn into 6, then 8, then 10, now 27...Crimanry, I have to re-read it before I'm done to keep on top of things. One of my friends started a outline of characters just to follow along and another had abandoned it all together.Simplify and find the heart of this series, it had such promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"I find it hard to believe that the last few books were written by the same author that wrote the first few. This series had more promise than any other fantasy series I have ever read. Robert Jordan got bogged down in his many plotlines and minor characters. Nothing happens. When you can skip whole chapters and pages of description, and pick up right where you left off, that's a bad thing.Some editor needs to slap the author and make him write again. Simply compare his writing style (descriptions, level of dialogue, advancement of plot, action) between the first 5 books and the last 4. He has begun writing simply for the act of writing, not for the reader. It shows, and it sucks.I would no longer reccommend even starting this series as it has become such a gigantic disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Once again","review":"The last few books, I have to admit were not as great as the first five, with the exception of some really great parts, the last 2 were just good, not great. With this book though, you get back to great, this book has everything you could ask for, it resolves many questions that were still up in the air before. Now, thankfully many are coming around to a nice close for what I expect to be a 12 book series. This book has a killer, awesome, amazing last chapter, probably the best since Dumais Well. I thought before that that was the best, most monumental chapter in any of the books, but this one took the cake by far. It answers just about every question that you have, and it also brings up some new ones. All in all it was a really good book with the exeption that it leaves out several major players especially egwene. Her story seems to be far from being resolved. But hopefully in the next book, rj will take care of much of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again...","review":"After Crown of Swords I resolved not to buy anymore books in this series. Jordan's first few books in this series seemed to be going somewhere but then I realized he was just writing a soap opera: no plot, no action, no momentum; just endless scenes of pointless bickering, traveling, and whining, with a tiny bit of action thrown in at the end of each book.I decided that if the next one(Winter's Heart) was the LAST book in the series and he FINALLY wrapped it up I would buy the last two but low and behold I read the sleeve description that said: Rand continues his journey, Elaida continues, continues, continues... on and on it goes. That's it. I'm NEVER reading this series again!! Ten years is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"read only if you want to grind your teeth in frustration!","review":"sections from the crown of swords to the crossroads of twilight, meaningful to the orginal story, can be contained in one single book! the rest is all about hair tugging, description of clothes, anotomy etc. robert jordan is probably dead - the publishers are milking it for all it is worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at best","review":"I used to be a big fan of Robert Jordan. Then he started milking the series for all its worth. As one of my friends would say, \\"After the 4th book in the series he started describing useless things. He would spend 4 or 5 pages describing some guy's horse and then you never hear about the guy or the horse ever again.\\"I do like Robert Jordan's style of writting. His characters are rich, vivid, and realistic. If you get sucked into the Wheel of Time books, then it is hard to not finish them. However, save yourself some time and money and don't get hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still hanging","review":"I have just finished Jordan's 9th book. It was everthing I had expected it to be. Adventure, mystery, cheesy teenage love, and total frustration that I have to wait another two years for the tenth book to come out. While this book was better then some of the other later ones, it still was lacking in some subjects, namely Perrin. Once again, Jordan devotes only a few chapters to the most interesting one of the bunch (in my opinion). I am hoping that the tenth book will finish the series, so we can all get some closure. If you are keeping up with the series, read it. Otherwise wait until the final book comes out, and read the entire series without the two year breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"a reader","review":"Since book 5, Jordan has been losing touch with his story and more importantly, his characters. Also, his writing seems to be getting worse. It's choppy and seems so drag on and on in some cases. I wish he would stop making his characters complain all the time and create some real dialog. If it wasn't for the last 50 pages, this book would have been a waste.A better series is the \\"Sword of Truth\\" by Terry Goodkind. The writing and the plot far exceeds Jordan's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The heart of \\"Winter's Heart\\"","review":"I had been waiting a long time for this book. I admit to being completely enthralled by the entire series and this book was not enought to satisfy my appetite for Jordan's creation. This new book did not have the character details that I feel have been bogging down the plot for the last two books. When you reach the ninth book in a series, it is safe to assume that most of those who will be reading have read enough of the other books to know what is happening and who is who. The book really pushed the pace of the plot throughout and I found it much more fulfilling than the last two. I didn't want the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story","review":"I like the characters and adventurous situations of the plot.A good break from everyday routines in a different time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish it already!","review":"As the series drags on with so much build up towards a supposed end, I don't know how Jordan will ever finish without the final book being anti-climactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it is quite good","review":"This is a big improvement over number Seven which was rather diapointing. It actually leads to a good conclusion unlike Path of Daggers with one of the most cataclismic events of the series so far and perhaps one of the first clear victories for the light. It also clears up a lot of lose ends like who is the daughter of the nine moons and the organ'or thing. A good section of the overall story and the begining of the conclusion to the wheel of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have the Cliff Notes please?","review":"What abosulte crap. Characters as shallow as a daytime soap, meaningless dialogue, absent characters... should I continue???No author of any credit needs to \\"Build Up\\" characters for 5 books!

As for the readers, I want to say that they are excellent. The male reads all the parts of the book told from a male perspective (which in this book, is sadly not the majority), and the female in turn reads the parts written from a female perspective. Though I found the male to be the stronger reader of the two, I absolutely recommend this recording, even to those of you who consider yourself very picky book listeners--this is a great choice! It will also be back on the market later this year or next--they're slowly releasing all the books on tape and CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, but not horrible","review":"The most frustrating part of this book is its failure to advance one of the most critical plot points from Book 8: The Rebel Aes Sedai War against Tar Valon.Rand's and Mat's stories move forward nicely. The complication with Faile and Perrin, even while interesting, ultimately detracts from the flow of the story that has been established over the previous eight books.From reading this book, you don't get the feeling that the series is drawing to a conclusion, which after almost 7,000 pages is sorely needed for te sake of all our sanities."},{"rating":"1","title":"End it Now","review":"Robert Jordon, please end this series now and put us all - readers, characters, and yourself- out of our misery. What a wonderful series this was in the beginning. Somehow, it has turned into a plodding and boring lecture with plotlines that go nowhere and are not interesting. Most of us in this life need closure, and with this series we get nothing close to that. Just end the whole thing now. I refuse to read any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter's Heart","review":"I think that this is a great book, which has a perfect amount of plot twists and mini-plots to keep the story interesting.

With so many characters it's easy for the author to take a diversion when the \\"inspiration\\" isn't there. The first few books in this series were quite remarkable, but it's become a chore to get through each successive tome. I think I've ordered my last hardcover, I'll just wait for the paperback to go on the discount rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"not to happy","review":"I just finished Winter's Heart and I have to say that aside from the end of the book I am not too impressed. It seems since A Crown of Swords Robert Jordan has developed a formula: short books with minimal plot development. There are so many storylines that he only addresses once every other book that it makes the waiting between installments seem like wasted time. I would prefer to wait a couple more years and get a big honking whopper of a novel instead of these 600 page snippits. I am beginning to lose faith..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but when it will it end","review":"First of fans won't be disappointed. This was a good book. But its becoming obvious that Jordan is needlessly perpetuating the series. I mean, cmon, RJ just get it over with already. I feel fortunate that I didn't start reading this series until book six came out. As such I've only been waiting for ending now for about six years. At the rate you going I'll be in a rest home and you'll probably be dead before you finish. If your not going to pick up the pace of writing the books then do us a favor and finish the series already. Your making it hard to pick up new fans because how many are not going to be daunted at having to read 5000 pages just to get caught up and your annoying long time fans by making us wait for years between volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart (the wheel of time, book 9)","review":"In truth it is the writer who has lost his heart. The plot drags on and on. Even the new civilizations Jordan is trying to create for Matt falls so short of the Aiel that its embaressing. In the first four books the readers could feel the characters, know their strengths and failings, see how they grow from boys to men and girls to women. In this book, not even Elayne getting laid did much to help the story along. She's become such an incidental character her story doesnt really matter and Jordan is so lost with all the other characters he has invented for the sake of plot, that if you never read this book, you wouldnt miss much from the series. Id wait until paperback comes out if you consider buying it. Where has the thrill of reading this story gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This series Just gets worst","review":"This is the worst book in the Wheel Of Time series.

Not worth the time to read ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we please get on with it...","review":"This series ground to an almost complete standstill 2 books ago, and this newest one is upholding that fine tradition. These 600+ page books seem to be written so as to draw this serious out as long as possible, dribbling just enough actual story at the end of each to rekindle your interest in the next one.I've lost any respect for Jordan as an author, this is shameless. Keep in mind that this series started over 10 years ago, it's actually LIKELY at this point that Jordan may die before finishing it. He'll have spent at least 13 years on it, making that just over 1/5 of the average human lifespan.(edit) Yep, he died before finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"This book is better than PoD (that's why I gave WH two stars instead of one). The writing is technically good (not elegant, but solid) and the plot limps along, but at least it limps, which is more than I can say for PoD. Some plot lines, esp. the one handled at the end of the book, are closed in a rather lame way, but some people might like it. My advice: buy the book if you are a die-hard fan (but wait, if you're a diehard, you already have it), but if you're not a fanatic, wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so over for me with this series...","review":"I have never before given up on a series, but I am quite thrilled to be dropping this one. WoT has become a complete waste of my time and energy. So sorry, but I cannot recommend this series to anyone. I feel Mr. Jordan has become only interested in how long he can spin this series out, and receive more royalties."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, excellent","review":"one thing i've always had against fantasy stories, including this series is that they never seem to give the enemies more than a two dimensional characterization. this one attempts it rather well with the forsaken and some of the darkfriends, but trollocs are just fodder for rand's lightning strikes.but my own pet pieves aside, this story is rich and complex. this world that robert jordan has created is imaginative and innovative. it may seem like he is using some stereotypes from our own cultures throughout our world, but he's mixed it up well enough to be considered his own creation.the story will engross you, as it should and you will be caught up in the characters' drive for survival. enjoy it, and all nine books so far.this one gave me hope for his future books. now that rand did what he did, the tide will turn against the dark ones. great idea, robert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan has set a new standard for boring","review":"Jordan unfortunately has sold out and it seems is only interested in the money. Another boring book that is tiresome reading, i'd say about the last 30 pages were worth reading. Whats next 700 pages on how the sea folk build ships. Someone e-mail me when the last book comes out, maybe in about 20 years. I'd ask for Jordan to e-mail me but I couldn't handle 600 pages of boring e-mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are no endings to the Wheel of Time...","review":"It is hard to come away from reading this latest book in the WoT series and not give credit to the critics who charge that Mr. Jordan is only for the money at this point. In 600+ pages, no effort is made to progress the plot that has become very stale over the last few books. This latest book doesn't even have a complete sub-plot, rather it closes some sub-plots from previous books and starts new ones.I have come to expect more from Mr. Jordan and whether he only now cares for the money, has run out of ideas, or has taken to writing only while on weekend long benders the result is the same; a poor ending to a great start. I will buy the next book(s) just to finish it out, but they will be from the used book store and not pre-ordered at full price. At least then I will get my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened","review":"I am trying to remain faithful to the amazing story created in the first five books, but after the last few books in this series I'm unsure. The main plot is not advancing and main characters are not present, but you've got plenty of detail on not as interesting sub plots. I will buy the next book, but if it continues like the last two I may put the series to rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"After Path of Daggers, which wasnt really disappointing and a good read, but without the magic of the first books, I was starting to lose interest in Jordan's books. After reading Storm of Swords by G R R Martin, it only went downhill. I still bought Winter's Heart before the release date (go Holland!) and went to read.And yes, yes, yes! Jordan proved that he still can do it!I had some minor points of irritations: the arrogant Sea Folk and Kin, Perrin's lack of action, and the fact that the Battle of Tar Valon hasnt started yet (*insert dutch curse here*)......but that last chapter, 'With the Choedal Kan' made up for it. By far. That chapter was one of the best I *ever* read. The quick POV switching, and the intensity, made me feel that good old stomach knot and breathing problems again. What a finale, it was SO good.Tension, two serious plot boosts (Mat and... well, ehm, Rand), intensity, and a marvellous final chapter.So, RJ, you did it again. You left me, wanting more. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Zipay, Puh-leese!","review":"Some readers apparently confuse length with depth. An epic is defined by its content, not its length or complexity. Beowulf is an epic. So is the Song of Roland. So are the works of Tolkien and Herbert and MacCaffery. But they seemed to be able to tell their epics in a few thousand pages or less. Can any reader out there really say that he or she is following everything that's going on in WOT? I downloaded a glossary/cast of characters after three or four books from a WOT site that was 100 pages long! Jordan needs to tie off some loose ends, ignore others, focus on the three ta'averan and can the travelogue, architecture tour, and fashion show.

The walls are covered in thousands of Post-it notes for every character name, plot, place, and thread in the weaving of a decade of writing, over 7,000 pages. Every once in a while a note coated in dust falls to the floor, only to be forgotten under a desk or stuck to RJ's shoe. Another character lost. No matter, there are plenty more where that one came from. New notes are created and pasted over others - insuring that pages on pages will be filled with detailed descriptions, names, and quirks of characters who have very little to do with what plot is hidden on the walls behind them.Stubs from publisher's advance checks litter the desk and floor as well. Characters stuck to the live ones get top billing in the next 1,000 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"MZ","review":"The book is terrible due to Jordan's inability to say \\"the end\\", I think he is lost in his own fantasy land. Maybe he is afraid to let this series end--if he had stopped 3 books ago this series could have been a classic impossible to top with any follow-up series.I don't want to argue but even the people who gave this book high marks pointed out the overbearing flaws in this book and the series. The book received high marks on a relative basis. Comments prevail like, \\"best book in a while...first good one since book 5\\" etc. That fact does not make it a good book. The story has degenerated.Bottom line, lets not make this one a bestseller, borrow the thing or visit your library, you're not missing anything by waiting 6 months for a paperback or your friend's copy.Sorry, I'm not intending to be mean, the series is over for me and many others, just an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly, while were still young!!","review":"This series will never end.

Too bad, Robert Jordan once had me as a fan but this is too much...will it take 10, 12 or even 15 books before the publisher lets him out of this overdone dollar game he has been in? It reminds me of \\"Friday the 13th - part 13\\". If they bought the last one, let's sell the 10 more like it with a fresh coat of paint.

How could such a fine story devolve into a major disappointment?I'll be the first to say how much I liked the first four books in the series; in fact I would rate them all at five stars. Since that time there has been a downward spiral (read plunge). For some reason the plot has stagnated, there has been no character develpment and nothing of import has happened in the last five books! The grand Aes Sedai sisterhood seems to spend their time bickering about petty, trivial matters, such as necklines and hemlines rather than serious threats to their existance.The characters have not matured in any respect, but neither has the story line.One theory we have among us is that Robert has actually passed away and someone has been trying to finish this series based on his notes they found lying about.This would not be such a disappointment if not for the promise of earlier books.

The end of book 8 has Egwene transporting her army to depose Elaida while book 9 never even addresses what happens. I read at one point this series would consist of 10 books -- good luck. I figure at least 3 or 4 more just to straighten out the various conflicts/competitions and then probably a couple more to give a second by second description of the final battle. It's too bad that RJ seems to have slammed the brakes on this story development as the early books were very enjoyable.

I loved this book, and unlike some, I like the fact that Mr. Jordan actually writes out his sub-sub-plots for us to enjoy. I think the main problem people have is the nature of our instant gratification society. Yes, you have a long wait between books, yes there is a lot of side plots that don't have too much to do with the main thrust of the stories. That's ok. A well fleshed out story requires such things. he could have said- Rand was born, did stuff, fought in the last battle... would that be a \\"good read\\"? I don't personally think so.

The last few books were a serious let down. However, the more I thought about it, the more I see that the last few books aren't as good as the earlier WOT volumes, but compared to most fantasy works out there, they are top notch. Be happy that you have been spoiled by this magnificent series and get off Jordan's back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This is what the last book in the Wheel of Time series should have been. Despite what some people say about it being longwinded, its really not. It is Jordans typical style of giving the book a feeling of realness. There are great plot twists and character development. The only bad thing I could really say about the book is, if someone new to the series (ie, never read the other books) tried to read this book, they would not have a good time. A knowledge of the previous books is essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addicted--which is not a good thing.","review":"Yes, I am addicted to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I need to know how the story ends, but unfortunately, Jordan's Wheel of Time books (aside from the first few) do not have conclusive endings. Winter's Heart is no more than a segment in a soap opera. This entire saga has rambled on too long. There are too many characters and subplots to keep track of. This is made worse when many characters and plots are not even visited from one book to the next. While Winter's Heart does provide some answers to the mysteries posed in previous books, the story in Winter's Heart could have been told in almost half the pages that were used. Do not buy this book if you have not read the previous eight books in the series.

Also, it has a more interesting ending. This book ends with something that will effect the rest of the series, not just another \\"I must fight a Forsaken\\" type ending. The book has the main characters interacting with each other more than in the last two books as well. Overall, an enjoyable read. It is still better than most of the fantasy being put out today and appears like it may be finally heading towards a conclusion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Neverending Story","review":"For anyone thinking of jumping in to the Jordan series, I'd recommend waiting until it finally ends before buying any of the books. I coughed up the cash for the first five, but this series has really died out in the last three books.Series as a whole: excellent take on the epic fantasy concept, but the basic limitations of the genre are truly taking their toll on this reader's interest.Nothing happened in this book. At all. I haven't bought the last three books, I just checked them out from the library. I wouldn't recommend the investment of time, much less cash on this book.I'll probably check the next one out of the library when it comes out, but if Jordan continues his trend of churning out mass quantities of pointless text, I might not make it all of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Satisfied, But Still Great","review":"As with everyone else, I think WoT needs to end.

If you like over 600 pages of identical women trying to manipulate each other, while yanking on their braids, twirling their skirts, and turning a well-turned calf, this book is for you. If you like anything resembling the earlier books in this series (that's to say, anything resembling an interesting story), I suggest you skip to the very end of the book -- I certainly did.Normally, I hate abridged books -- I feel like they are an insult to the author's vision. However, if there is any book in the history of mankind that needs it, it's this one.To compare Jordan to Tolkien is like comparing a Harlequin Romance book to Homer's Odessey.

In case he does not, I suggest printing Book ten with biodegradable ink, and pressing little seeds between the pages. This way, if the next book stinks as bad as this one, the reader can dig a hole, bury the book, and with luck...by the time WOT ends, have contributed back to the earth at least one tree to atone in some way for the needless slaughter of it's brethren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, God, make it stop. Just make it stop.","review":"The first couple of books were decent formula fantasy potboilers -- nothing to write home about, but nicely imagined and certainly better than some I could name. At some point, though, it all has to end. There's simply no conceivable excuse for spinning out exactly the same exhausted plot elements, over and over, book after book, until the end of recorded time. This thing is longer than the Bible. It's longer than the Bible and The Lord of the Rings combined. It's longer than the Bible, The Lord of the Rings, and the Annotated Works of Stephen King, with a little Proust thrown in for desert. It's even longer than that, and NOTHING IS HAPPENING. The girls get into trouble. The girls get out of trouble. Rand is tormented. Rand kills a Forsaken. Over and over and over and over and over. Just END IT, Mr. Jordan. Please.On the other hand, of course, there is a lot more spanking here than one generally finds in epic fantasy. If you're into that kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"An otherwise tolerable installment in Jordan's once-great Wheel of Time series has been ruined by exactly one character: Cadsuane. If you thought Jordan's women were annoying in previous books, you will probably despise Cadsuane. I was hoping that Rand would balefire her or at least show her how to treat the Dragon Reborn. Unfortunately, Rand, in a stunning (and, in my opinion, extremely out-of-character) move continues to accept her abuse. The other women in the book haven't changed from being annoying and ludicrously hypocritical, either. This trend throughout the series has always detracted from its epic atmosphere, and in Winter's Heart it is simply unbearable. I would love to finish the series, but I cannot bear to read such \\"tainted\\" books. I will always wonder what compelled the author to give the vast majority of the women in his books such characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"God of Writing","review":"I can't see why anyone can possibly think that Robert Jordan's writing is deterioratng. The series only gets better with each new installment, and Winter's Heart is by far the best book ever written. The depth of description that Jordan can muster is second to none, and the richness of the seven thousand-odd subplots in each book is something to revel in, rather than a tedium that should be found to be rebarbative. I originally read this book in December 2000, and did again this December, wondering if perhaps I'd make it a yearly tradition. For any fan of Fantasy, this series is a must, even if only to get to this book, Winter's Heart.Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great one","review":"all you jordan bashers can go finish your homework and leave jordan and his complex world and characters to the adults who understand and enjoy the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for reviews","review":"After books 7&8 I believe I will wait & see before investing any more tme into this series.

I, for one, prefer to have something left for me to do with my brain beyond passive entertainment (or I'd be watching TV instead). I'm afraid that Mr. Jordan has stretched 6 books worth of plot into 9 books worth of pages in a distressingly Jean Auel (Clan of the Cavebear series) like manner. I appreciate the fact that complexity of plot is important but GET ON WITH IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmm...","review":"Well, I understand where everyone is coming from with this whole thing about the series being to slow. Each book contains ~800 pages, and there are nine books and going, but I still think it's worth it. Slow, yes, but that makes it interesting. I think Jordan could definately speed it up, but all in all the series is the best in print. There are enough plots, sub-plots, and major and minor characters to get almost confusing. This, however, is what makes the series so good. Admit it, every Jordan fan was first drawn in by the deep, and realistic like story lines and characters. No offense, but I just don't understand people who \\"bite the hand that feeds them.\\" Anyway, just thought that I'd like to put up what I was thinking"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is only for hardcore fans","review":"Along with other fans of this series, I was anxiously awaiting the next installment. But all I can say is that I hope Mr. Jordan will slow down and take a bit more time before publishing the next book. This is a disjointed, dull effort with little plot, not at all on par wwith earlier, exciting novels. Characters who were developed at length in other books do not appear here. Most of this novel's characters -- and their often complicated backgrounds -- are never reintroduced. It is assumed that the reader understands the most casual of references to events that occurred in previous books. But only those who have thoroughly digested all eight other books have a prayer of understanding what is going on. I was very disappointed in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please finish the series","review":"I read the first book in the series and couldn't wait for the second, read that one two and then the third, fourth and fifth.

I was nearly ready to though this book out the window halfway through, but I pesiviered at the behest of the reveiws here. With that ending Im glad i did, this book was worth it. I've read most of the concerns of the other reveiwers of this book and found that most of you have a few good points. The female characters can be painfully similar, and Jordan did wander a little bit. However it is clearly possible for Jordan to end his searies in one or two more books, something i thought was imposible before reading this book. This book is clearly the beginning of the End Rejoyce! Get this book, if for no other reason get it for the ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Everyone Crying About?","review":"The reviews I've been reading complain that Jordan is losing steam. I think that the books are still very good, it's just difficult to fit so many plots and subplots into one text and still make it light enough to lift and carry from one room to another.

Sure, I'd like to quit buying the books but, after 10 years, I am bound and determined to get to the end....If there is one.On to the Review: Stale, boring, and Hemmingwayesque in detail. When I finished the book I sat back and realized that only one plot item was truly advanced with this book. My advice for those looking to keep up with the series but not willing to pony up the dollars is to read the book jacket and then read the last chapter...

There's no plot, little action, and little apparent effort by the author to do more than meet a publisher's deadline. What started out as a truly great example of fine story telling has become nothing more than an effort to make a buck.I would not recommend this book to anyone, nor will I waste another dollar on anything \\"written\\" by Robert Jordan. Like I said above, it appears that the author has worn out any interest in the story line which he so carefully created in the first four or five books in this series. It's on to better literature for this fantasy reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"In the beginning, there was a great story. So where did it go? I have more than drifted away from enjoying the story. I don't even remember half of it anymore. To many inconsequential characters with too much time spent on them and not an end in sight. The first books in this series were masterful, but I really believe that Robert Jordan has lost the direction for his tale. I seriously doubt with all the garbage he added in the last two books that he can tie everything together for a big finale in SIX more books let alone three. The last two books were so boring that I found myself skipping whole sections that didn't deal with the main characters. And in this last book I found myself skipping sections devoted to the main characters. Please, find your way back to the real story and stop the bickering between characters. A real personality and something to like about them would be nice, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Again","review":"As someone who has been reading this series since the first book was released, I have to say I was extremely dissappointed in this book. It used to be whenever the next Robert Jordan book was released, everything would stop for me until I finished reading it. With Winters Heart, I found myself struggling to get through most of it. In fact, I read several other books while trying to finish it. The first half of the book was extremely slow filled with what seemed like mundane details, focusing on events that just weren't very interesting. Not to mention the fact that I was having a hard time remembering what had happened in the previous books.I know I sound like I'm being disloyal, but I'm ready for the series to end. There are some cool things that that occur in the book, so if you can make it through the first half, you'll have some intersting reading. Hopefully the next book won't take as long or be as boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding...","review":"Let me begin by saying that this is the most effective teaching tool that I have ever encountered, with the likely exception of Crossroads of Twilight. If you want to teach students the effect of early success then burning out and milking the cow, this is *the* book for you (again, with the notable exception of CoT).Having somewhat mildly said what I really think, I will offer this suggestion: novel writers, like songwriters, really don't care whether you love or hate their work, they just don't want you to be indifferent. If you are indifferent, then the book/song won't get any attention at all (do people often write reviews about a mediocre book? No)and the next book won't see the light of day. That's what authors fear.When the wheels fall off, as they have in this series, then ignore it.

Literally 3 or 4 events occurred in this book - Nothing is happening in the series since book 6.Please Mr Jordan, give us a book like books 1 - 6 and let us know how the series ends. Some suggestions... Moiraine returns from limbo where she was sent (book ?), Lan unites the north behind Rand, Perrin unites old Manetheran, Matt is the general, they all meet to fight the Trollocs, etc., and Rand and company win. Rand writes a book entitled \\"From there and back again\\" and sails off with the Seachan. The end.

How can Mr. Jordan waste that much time and never get anywhere? I am hopelessly caught in a never ending loop of useless description of charactors and what they are wearing. Why does Mr. Jordan spend so much time describing what someone is wearing and then only devote a couple of pages of a very long book to any real action? Of 766 pages, only the last two chapters did anything to advance the story. I got caught into what I thought was going to be a very good series and have now been left feeling I have wasted my time.

I can't keep track of who anyone is anymore, but by gum I know what they all are wearing in excruciating detail. Perhaps Robert Jordan should consider writing for Cosmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad disintegration","review":"This book marks the sad disintegration of what might have been a great series by Robert Jordan into a verbose, confusing, fragmented, unsatisfying mess.

That will keep you informed enough to make sense of what comes in the next book-maybe, and, it will keep you from having to slush through page after page of boredom.

It feels like Robert Jordan is simply shuffling through drudgery in the attempts to satisfy publishers. This book is REALLY hard to read. Not for difficulty, but for sheer boredom. The women in this book are irritating and mindless. The CONSTANT references to sniffing, snorting, pulling of braids, blah blah blah. Come up with some new descriptions.

I first read the six first volumes in one, and wish I could have done the same with all the books. If you read one after the other, no problem, you can follow the story. But by the time you understand what's going on, after two years of forgetting the story line, the present volume is already over. My recommendation is for anyone that has not read a single volume of the series: start from the beginnning and you'll have the best of time. For others, do read the previous book at least partially, so that you can enjoy the new book from the start.

I think that Jordan is the king of stupid comparisons. The book is frustratingly packed with \\"medieval cliche,\\" terribly slow, and not worthy of the acclaim that the first eight books might have received.

It is truly sad, not because I will not read this series any more, but because Mr Jordan no longer has my respect as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 years...Will Jordan live to finish the series","review":"The Wheel of Time started off as one of the best series i'd ever read. The last three including this one have been really poor. And I'm a fan. Jordan's really struggling now but seeing as i've given it 10 years I'll hang about for the last two or three. Tell you what even with Mat coming back in this one its still poor. The next book cannot get any worse!! Maybe Jordan needs to read one of the Malazan Books of The Fallen for a bit of inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"More turning of the Wheel","review":"I found myself really enjoying this installment of the Wheel of Time. I believe more than usual the main characters get to be the focus. Even the prologue has a lot of the main people in it. Rand is in this one a lot as well.The book is pretty good throughout but it is the ending that really wowed me. A lot happens. The plot has some major forward momentum.So in summary this is a good book for fans. Now on to book 10!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the World Already","review":"When the series first started, it was great and wonderful. I was amused at the attention to details and the not so subtle jabs at other fantasy series. However, it is the 9th book already and it feels like it. It's great and wonderful that Rand's three loves are bonded to him but I am finding all of the \\"extra information\\" slowing and I am finding it somewhat trite. I remember inhaling the earlier books in only a couple of days. The thrill left me after having a building drop on Matt and having to wait a whole book to find out what happened to him. I might fall in love with the series in the future but right now I am looking at other books in my digital library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Forward!","review":"Winter's Heart gives a great jolt to the midpoint action of the Wheel of Time.

For me, I love the character development and the number of subplots. I really enjoy how each book is not a novel in and of itself, but instead they are almost like long chapters. Alot of people out there are whining and want RJ to wrap it up. NOT ME. By his pace I figure the series will reach 20 to 25 books, and maybe more. And I will be there for all them. His stories are rich and complex with numerous good and evil characters, usually working for a variety of different goals and with incomplete information. The only thing I ask of RJ is to make the books closer to 1000 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treading water","review":"Blood and bloody ashes, 766 pages of treading water!

Gee, that sounds familiar....","review":"I loved the Wheel of Time series and I started reading them years ago. However, it's been so long since the last book came out that I've lost track of everything. It's gotten so convoluted, that I feel I have to reread the whole series again just to refresh myself with what has happened. I'm sure Jordan still spins a good tale, but this reader has a life and can't wait years and years for the next unfinished chapter. Because that's what the story has become-unfinished and only the most die hard fans can keep up. I'm afraid the rest of our attention spans are not quite blessed with such fortitude. Maybe I'll return once the series is wrapped up and and I can enjoy a good story, but until then I've already moved on."},{"rating":"2","title":"going somewhere...","review":"the gambler finaly meets the daughter of the nine moons. finalythe series looks to be going somewhere.

Encyclopaedia Britannica is detailed but is not a compelling read. The only reason this book was better than the previous two was the action in the last 50 pages. So I paid for fifty pages of action and 600+ pages of dull plotting between Windfinder/Aes Sedai/Andor factions that just aren't that central to the plot?Please, take your hard-earned dollar and go buy George R.R.

Instead of reading it because I had to, as I had been recently, I found myself reading a spellbinding page-turner. For the first time in ages, all three of the ta'veren had something significant to do, with only Egwene left out of the action. Even Egwene's relative absence didn't bother me much, since I have grown a little tired of Aes Sedai maneuvering. Mat's bits were, of course, the highlight of the book. My only regret was not seeing Perrin tear into the Shaido. I even started liking Rand again. That in itself is a miracle. More like this, please, Mr. Jordan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, kill me now.","review":"This would have been a good book, five books ago. I appreciate complex plot developments.

So I may be more critical than I would have been if I had just read Winter's Heart.Winter's Heart is boring. Well at least, large sections of it are. The first six hundred pages could have been edited down to two hundred pages without losing one bit of important information. The last fity pages could have been expanded to two hundred pages with the timeline advancing a bit more and this book could have been a good, maybe even great book. As it is, I'm just hanging on to this series by my fingertips. The next one in the series is not on my \\"have to have\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart","review":"The book is ok. SOMETHING finally happens. But Mr. Jordan's seemingly endless colthing discriptions may do him well in getting a job at Vogue but after nine books it's getting a bit old.

Mat gets into another amazing scrape, and causes incredible side effects as he extricates himself.There is a climatic battle scene involving most of the Forsaken but NOT Rand al'Thor. That's a nice twist.There are some slow chapters, particularly with Perrin, but fewer than in Path of Daggers.

I got the book at the library....Why anyone would spend money on this nonsense is beyond me. Books like this should be condensed from over 600 pages to less than 100.

However, Robert Jordan is trying even my patience. The first 4 or 5 books of this series were some of the best I've ever read. In my honest opinion, Jordan has writing skills in the top 10 of this genre. However, having said that, I'm extremely displeased with the progress of this series over the last 2 books. Characters and situations are left hanging from book to book. Mat was entirely left out of book 8, and Perrin only touched on in this one. I can't even keep track of the Aes Sedai anymore. Their names and previous deeds all begin to mix together as I wait the two years for the next book.I hope the snail's pace at which this series is progressing picks up soon, or I will seriously consider abandoning the remainder of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have to...","review":"Look, I'm not going to trash this series. I've enjoyed it so far and I'm not angry. Just disapointed. Books one through seven have been great. Yeah, they lagged a little bit but they were great none-the-less. However, when book 8 kind of lagged, I became suspicious of treachery from Jordan. And with this book, I'm right. It seems like a soap opera now and since I saw the reviews for the 10th book, I don't think I want to finish the series unless it ends or something good happens. Oh, well. Maybe Jordan will get out of whatever 'funk' he's in and start writing stuff like he did before. (Or better) Anyways, if you must read this book then read like the last 100 pages or so to get the jist of it and then read the 11th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is no rating, just another story","review":"I have read this story front to back 12 times, starting ten years ago. Each time a new book came out I read the story twice, keeping the storyline as a single thread. Over 150,000 pages later the story is still as captivating as the first time I read it. Many feel that the story drags or forstalls an ending, but in order for it to be a story it must have an end. For there are neither beginnings or nor endings, but it was AN ending. My favorite character is Matrim Cauthon, for much like life, luck has a little to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emergency Liposuction...stat","review":"Would someone please edit this book! After wading through chapter after boring chapter of wasted paper you get a little action at the end. Would someone remind Robert Jordan of the old adage \\"short sweet and to the point\\".

I personally am enjoying the rich world and 500 story lines - still. I struggled through Book 5 but ever since then I have devoured each book, and continue to want more. I'm pretty sure that if you haven't enjoyed the last few books, you won't be enjoying the next 3 (Jordan has said that it will take at least 3 more to finish it). Stop looking for an end and start enjoying the world again! The reason the first 4 books were so exciting for all of you is because Jordan brings a new world and cultures to life. Now you're used to them but I still enjoy my little trips into this strange land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever Lasting Anguish","review":"I would love to take a peek into Jordan's source for the Aiel and most of the descriptions that interlace in his plots. One thing I highly reccomend of his readers is to read a single book on the tribes of Arabia; trust me, you would be shocked. The Aiel for instances are a copy cat in all their toh and traditions of the Tribal Traditions of Southern Arabia Desert!!!?Even the clothing. Lets spin it a bit, the name al'Thore is actually a name of a famous Tribe in Yemen. How about the name Isam, again its an arabian name. Many things in his epic are diluted from the Middle East, its as if he pulled the threads from there and formulated the WOT. Nevertheless, everybody needs an inspiration. Thanx to my History class, I know where that inspiration came from. Still, the series are marked with nothing but a fantastic. I wouldn't hesitate to read them all over again.

The worst is yet to come.I was actually impressed that something significant happens at the end of this book. I won't spoil it, but I would like to in order to save you the time and money. Besides the last chapter or so, NOTHING happens in this book. And if you are stoked about this Event happening at the end, do not, I repeat, DO NOT read the tenth book. You think that the plot is really going to pick up in the next book, but it does not. I thought it would, so after I finished the ninth book, I waited eagerly for Ten and I am still traumatized from the utter disappointment. So save yourself from the pain by not reading this book and especially not the tenth book.If you want something interesting and really funny, read the customer reviews--I mean bashings--for Crossroads of Twilight. You get a summary of this book and the next all for free told a hundred times better than Robert Jordan ever could."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downward spiral continues","review":"Busy with a project of my own I have finally found time to catch up on the WOT series. Unfortunately RJ has continued to add subplots with out closing out some of the existing ones. In short, WOT has become infested with too many major and minor characters running around doing their own thing. One of the more aggrevating additions RJ has made is the insertion budding technology into WOT in the form of steam engines, gunpowder, etc. It basically detracts from the main storyline and everytime I run across it I skip ahead. Winter's Heart does not move the story ahead much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart","review":"What is wrong with Mr. Jordan?

As in: when is Egwene FINALLY going to get to the White Tower to (hopefully) consolidate her power? And FINALLY Elayne lays claim to the throne of Andor, only to be beseiged by multiple plots and problems. Does any main character in this epic ever just DO anything? Obviously NOT, everything is extremely complicated with gobs of details, most of which should have been left out to move the plot along. Jordan should learn from the movie makers who have taken this art to new highs (or lows: DUNE, 2 hours, come on now).Thankfully, Jordon does include one significant event at the end of the book. That being, of course the cleansing of Saidin.I've got a great idea, in the future we can take the significant parts from books 6-10 and combine them into one smaller book. It will make Jordon look like the literary genius he was supposed to be after he wrote the first few of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descriptions, no action","review":"As the series has progressed, Jordan has grown more and more fond of his own flowery descriptive style, at the expense of story and action. I frankly do not care to know the color of the piping on everyone's coat, or to live and relive sceens from various character's points of view! In this book, we visit every group of characters...and none of them move! Literally, except for Rand (and retineu), they are in the same place at the end that they started at the begining! Maybe the story has grown too complex, but frankly I should get half my money back because I didn't read every other paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsk tsk name callers","review":"Just because some of us are disenchanted with these books is no reason to insult folks.WOT was a fabulous story, WAS, IMHO it as become bogged down by it's negative sterotype behavior of the characters.I was re-reading all the books before I got to book 9 so it isn't from a lack of memory that I say this as some reviewers would assume.I've read a lot of multiple book series and the one thing that always turns me off from a book is when the main charaters become so unsympathetic that I want the bad guys to win. That is where this series is headed at this point. I only hope RJ pulls it out of that rut by book 10 or I may never read his stuff again!That is my humble opinion. If you still like it, I am happy for you, but don't tell me I have no right to disagree with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next book - this one's the pits","review":"Talk about a wordy waste of paper. RJ has contracted Stephen King Syndrome - make 3 pages of babble where 1 paragraph of literature would do. Seriously, the plot slows down even more than before. There is more plot movement in any 2 chapters of the first 3 books than in this entire volume. RJ must be paid by the word and Tor is trying to make this series go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I like the story, but it could have been done in 4 books, and done well. But Jordan/Tor have decided to milk this out and make it a lifetime project. Don't waste your money buying this book now - wait for the next book and buy THIS book at the used book store for 99 cents. If you don't die of old age waiting first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - there are better books out there","review":"Sorry, fans of Wheel of Time, there are better books out there. I really enjoyed the first 3 books of this series, then it got boring, long, and dull.

For anyone who has not started the series I offer you this advice: Wait for the series to end (sometime in 2040), read books One through Three, then read the finale. Use the following summary for all the books in between: 1.) Rand ineffective. 2.) Aes Sedai imperious. 3.) Female characters insufferably arrogant. 4.) Rand's companions travel a lot.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's worse than I feared...","review":"I've had #9 for one week and have barely made it through the first 200 pages.

I think I will force myself to flip and skim through the last 600+ pages and try to find out what happens to any of the people I care about. This book is difficult to fight through because Jordan taunts us with brief stories about our old friends from the first 4 books. #9 means I'll have to wait another few years for the next installment that may be a disappointment again.

No wonder Jordan writes such stereotypical \\"tough\\" (arms crossed, hair pulling) female characters, and such meek men; he doesn't want to ... off his wife! And what a poor editor she is: I have never read a book with so much fluff and as many spelling/grammatical errors.

He begins the bit(s) at the end of the album by talking about how he's being pressured to release a novelty song to promote, but ends up spending way too much time with his take on them, including a full length song at the end. The crowd eats it up, but as per irony, that's the point - but it never should have been put on the album. Absolutely worth the purchase price for the first two-thirds of the album, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"Well, all I have to say is that i just ordered the cd and I can't wait for it to come in.

There is very little information on Dave Grohl the person and not even that much on the Foo Fighters. Instead the author simply tries to analyse each and everytrack that Grohl and his bands have released and then analyses every track that influenced those tracks and then analyses the bands that performed those tracks. In a nutshell this book is a collection of interviews with various magazines. If you were to take the information on Grohl alone the book would be a good 5 pages.A complete waste of time. Do not even bother! Go and spend the money on music mags instead. I seriously think the reason the author has worked for so many different publications is because he got fired for trying to sound clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially great but disappointing","review":"I love a good biography, especially those of musicians. I love all of Dave Grohl's creations esp. the Foo Fighters. I was really looking forward to learn more about the man. Unfortunately this book doesn't focus much on Dave but rather on the Punk music scene and a who's who of punk music. I didn't need a whole chapter on Cobain either. Who's bio is this anyway? The book does have some really good pictures, just not much personal info on the man. I grew bored and didn't even bother to finish it, which is rare for me. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"How NOT to make a game","review":"This has to be the worse game i've ever bought. The graffics are horrible.

The game itself is confusing and does not reflect at all the surfing scene as it is today. I am asking EA BIG, please give us a surfing game worth buying.

The only way I was able to make any progress - and even minimal progress at that - was to hold the controller wrong (sideways, with the dPad at the top and the X/O/Tri/Square buttons at the bottom).I figured maybe I'm just not good at it...even though I'm usually pretty good at most games, at the very least after a lot of practice. So I let a few other people play - all different ages and levels of experience.

Surfing H30 just plain ... The game is hard to master, and has horrible controls. WHy would you have to press the R3 button down to stand up? They don't take advantage of the PS2 control which can handle more than the anolog and R buttons. Also, the camera angles are horrible. Whenever you turn the angle switches, i almost ... my food let alone my money. This game is made by an ameteur company who has no right producing a game at this point. Get some more experience before you try and come out with an enticing ps2 game.

I had read the bad reviews before buying it but decided to give it a try, mostly because I really like SSX and Surfing H30 seemed similar. Save your money. The graphics are lousy, the action unrealistic, and the control functions aren't intuitive. The training video is nearly impossible to follow, so you're pretty much on your own trying to figure out how to play. If you really want surf-like action, buy SSX and pretend you're in Hawaii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atari was fresh","review":"I bought this game without renting it first, oops! this game should be recalled it is so weak.

The wave and the riding is terrible. First of all every time you cut back in this game the nose of your board goes under water, which in real life would send you flying over the front of your board. And another thing that caused this came to be a dismal failure is the controls, in my opinion they were to aquard. They have you using both analog sticks to stear the front and back of your board which just gets confusing. I live on Maui and do surf and I can honestly say the going outside and learning to surf would be easier than playing this game. I played mine for a day before I pawned it off. So in short, do yourself a favor and DONT BUY THIS WORTHLESS GAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I beat this game in 1 hour, that's how easy it is.

The game play is generic, the graphics reek of N64, and above all, this is absolutely nothing like surfing. Instead of concentrating on cutbacks and bottom turns, you spend all of your time collecting buoys in order to gain enough points to advance to the next level. I wish that every set brought the perfect wave and paddling into that wave was effortless. According to this game that is how easy it is. I bought this game in hopes for a somewhat realistic simulation, but I was sadly mistaken. Also, I unlocked all of the levels, surfers, and surfboards in about 4 hours. If any developers read this, please realize that there is a large market for a realistic surfing simulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surfing?

It came in the day of the service, and I didn't have a chance to preview it and only heard it for the first time at the service.

Are you kidding me? Not every song has to swing! Previn can swing when he wants to, but that would be way out of place on this album. These are ballads-- tunes that need gentleness, subtlety.

The answer was yes. I read the proper techniques and after creating a VERY sticky mess on my legs, I removed only three hairs. Convinced I'd done something wrong, I tried the other leg. Same results.

Not having been spoiled on any plot points, but still with mental pictures of the characters, I could easily imagine the action as a movie unfolding. However, I was frustrated with the focus on Cee Cee's parenting of Nina, and how the book ran through sevenyears showing us only snippets of their lives. More attention could have been paid to Nina's thoughts and struggles than their search for a school or Cee Cee's continued attempts to force Michael to acknowledge his daughter.The writing style is dramatic and soap-opera-ish, and if you thought Beaches was written with screenplay in mind, I'll Be There definitely is.

It is stuck to my stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful yet unsatisfying","review":"I first heard of Hildegard Von Bingen years ago while taking a music appreciation class in college, and immediately I was hooked on this prodigy's work. Recently, I saw this album at the public library and checked it out. While it's still beautiful and relaxing, I couldn't fully appreciate Richard Souther's effort. His music gives it a mystical, relaxing feel, but is dismissed as too new-age. It takes away the sacredness from Hildegard's original purpose for those songs: to elevate the listener into communion with a higher being. The music, although adds to the mystical beauty, makes it mundane. I like the album, I'll still buy it, but it doesn't fulfill my needs (I go for what Hildegard aimed for). It's just a nice album to listen to when I'm stressed and need to relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, inconsistent execution","review":"Some people take offense at the very suggestion of modernizing medieval music by adding electronic accompaniment. I have no problem with the concept of this recording, but Souther's understanding of Hildegard's music seems limited and simplistic. While there are some really gorgeous moments when the synthesizers truly complement the modal structures of the melodies, too often Souther falls back on cliched romantic chromaticism that is only a cut or two above Yanni in inventiveness and clashes with the purity and elegance of Hildegard's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep, stirring and powerful music","review":"Hildegard's melodies are crystal-clear, Souther's arrangment adds a \\"modern\\", new-wave background, that for the most part blends well with the medieval music, and sometimes even enhances it.

I have talked to the people who are responsible for bringing her music and prose works into modern translation. When I first heard the CD on the radio, I thought I was receiving two stations at once. What makes Hildegard's music so profound is its simplicity. The \\"New Age\\" background did nothing for the music and for me either. Don't get me wrong. I am no music purist.

I grew frustrated early and never recovered because I had a hard time relating to the main character and his laziness, which ultimately made me question Donleavy's own view of the world and ability to propel his subjects forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny at all","review":"Critics quoted on the back of this book called it a comedy. But I saw nothing funny about the scenes where he mistreats his wife and child or any of the other people in his life. Do not understand at all how this book made it on the Modern Library's top 100 list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation Joyce","review":"Yet another book about drinking,fighting,and whoring in Ireland. Author is a good writer, but uses a \\"poetic\\" style that is not always effective. A rather bleak book with little comedy.I really would not put this book in the top 100,no matter what Random House thinks. I suspect the book is somewhat autobiographical, which would explain why it has such a weak plot. If you must read it, I suggest speed-reading ;if you invest too much time you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had never read it","review":"Simply atrocious. The stream of consciousness style of the book is inaffective and obnoxious. Donleavy makes no attempt to develop any of his characters, Dangerfield included. I didn't laugh a single time, found no compelling traits in any character, and found myself dreaming of the day I would be finished wasting my time on such a terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donleavy Proves that Art Doesn't Have to Be Pretty.","review":"A college professor once told me a profound truth that is very pertinent to this work: Art Doesn't Have to be Pretty. This novel certainly isn't! I think I could have enjoyed this novel, but I kept on waiting to be amused. Unfortunately, I didn't find Dangerfield very funny at all. The author presented the character in a fairly sympathetic, yet not pathetic way. I especially enjoyed the stream of conciousness writing technique.In the final analysis, I just couldn't overlook the fact that I thought that Dangerfield was a poor excuse for a human being. I will be very dissapointed if \\"Ulysses\\" focuses on a character just as dispicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant, uninteresting and unfunny","review":"I found this book to be a complete waste of my time. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry - I just didn't care about whatever it was the author was trying to convey. Who wants to read about the crap between his character's toes, not I, and I am not easily disgusted. If you want something funny read Confederacy of Dunces or David Sedaris' stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't squeeze an ounce of enjoyment from this one.","review":"I must agree with Dave_Gannon@msn.com regarding this \\"abomination.\\" Reviews on the front cover called it a \\"comic masterpiece\\" but I found Sebastian Dangerfield a terribly depressing character with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. There was not a single character of which to endear me and as Gannon said I only finished the book because I have a strict policy that I finish each novel I begin hoping in this case that Mr. Donleavy was going to surprise me at the end and justify my decision to finish the book. Unfortunately the last paragraph left me frustrated and confused and feeling that maybe I should rethink my policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny At All","review":"Great art? I guess. I'll take the serious critics' word. Art need not be pretty? I can accept that. Lusty? Sure enough, but there are many lustier tales around. But wildly funny? A comic masterpiece? Not for me. I could barely manage a smile now and then.

So glad I bought it used!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"Even if I don't particularly like a critically acclaimed novel, I can usually understand the reason for the acclaim. Not so with \\"The Ginger Man.\\" I honestly don't understand why this book is so praised by the literary establishment. It doesn't break any new ground stylistically (in fact, I think J.P. Donleavy's writing is pretty anonymous) or thematically. The description on the book's back cover would have you believe this is a rollicking farce about a lovable cad---don't you believe it. This book isn't funny. The \\"lovable cad\\" is actually a jerk and by the time he'd gotten drunk and abusive for the thousandth time, I had made up my mind that the literary establishment that loves \\"The Ginger Man\\" must have all been drunk themselves when they decided this book is a must read.It's not difficult, but neither is it in the least bit interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"bastante bien conservado el long play","review":"El artículo está bastante bien, a pesar que data de 1978, estuvo bien empacado, y el vinil en buen estado."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored in Space","review":"Graphics - 1/5Very low poly count for a PS2 game.

Shaving is quicker, less irritating, and works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product worked great on legs and arms. ...","review":"This product worked great on legs and arms. It takes off all the hair in one application and really does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without the very strong smells that I remember from earlier products. When I used it on my upper lip, it was very irritating -- leaving my skin red for several hours and actually causing little blisters on the top border of my lip. It's possible I left it on a bit longer that the minimum four minutes they recommend, or that I may be more sensitive than the average person, but I certainly didn't leave it on longer than the 10 minutes that the product packaging recommends. I'll use this product again because for certain areas it did a fabulous job... but I'll certainly be cautious about using it on the more sensitive areas of my body again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product was very disappointing. Even though I ...","review":"This product was very disappointing. Even though I showered right before using Nair 3 in 1 to soften the hair, it still worked poorly. My legs weren't as smooth as with shaving, and they became irritated. I used the product three times in one week and the only difference between that and shaving is that the Nair moisturized my legs. That one benefit is not worth me sitting for 10-15 minutes to wait for the product to work. I feel the package needs to be clearer, as well. I had to read the tiny print of the \\"\\"warning\\"\\" to learn where on my body I could and couldn't use it. I won't be purchasing this product for myself, and certainly won't recommend it to anyone. Just keep your razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was amazed at how well this product ...","review":"I was amazed at how well this product worked. I've tried depilatories in the past with very little success, so expected similar performance from this product. But it worked remarkably well. I still needed to touch up a few patches with a razor, but I'll try to put the lotion on thicker next time and leave it on just a little longer. I had to use a lot of this lotion in order to get decent coverage: don't expect a 6-oz. bottle to last for more than two applications for your legs. An added bonus is that this particular product has moisturizers to help keep your skin soft. I tested a small patch of skin on my face, and it didn't have the typical redness and swelling, although it did sting and leave it a little numb afterwards. I wouldn't recommend using this product on your face, but for legs, it has worked wonderfully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This whole collection is awful, don't waster your money.

It's garbage like this that leaves a black mark on the face of Low-Budget work.For the love of god, do NOT waste the $5 it costs for 6 movies!

And not only do the contents dump out they fly out because the bowl is so lightweight. My LO is 1year old and she only has to barely move the bowl before it pops off the table and then she tips it. When it pops off the contents are out and on the floor very quickly. Luckily, I have only put dry cereal in them - for easy clean up - but what is the point, I could use any bowl.

I've tried making sure the tray is perfectly clean & smooth, wetting the bottom suction cup, etc., but nothing will keep it on. My son doesn't even try to lift the bowl and it pops up and moves around while he is trying to eat. Once even popped up before anyone had touched it at all! If you want bowls that actually stay suctioned on, I would suggest the similar \\"Sassy\\" bowl set that also has lids. Their design has a removable suction cup that fits all three bowls. I think it works better because the suction cup is all one piece of flexible rubber and is not joined to the hard plastic bowl like the Munchkin set is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, they don't stick to anything","review":"These bowls are completely useless.

Nice bowls, just don't expect them to actually suction to the table/high chair tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction mediocre, lids ill-fitting","review":"Like many other reviewers, I found the suction to be mediocre on these. I bought 2 sets and some of them stick really well and don't come off at all and others don't suction at all, even with a little water on the bottom. Fortunately, my toddler is starting to get over the 'let's pick up the bowl and dump everything on the floor' phase so the suction thing doesn't bother me as much anymore. However, the lids are really hard to use. They are really ill-fitting and it takes a lot of time and effort to get them to snap on. Who's got time to mess with lids with a young toddler running around? So, if you don't need lids much or suction, then these bowls are nice and deep and the variety of sizes available is very handy (although that would sort of defeat the purpose of buying these, right?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lids do not fit and take a huge amt of arm stregnth to close!!","review":"These bowls are an absolute waste of money.

It turns out they are just such a piece of junk, they didn't want them back!The suction does not stay put at all. Like other reviewers hae said, you have to constantly push down on the bowl to keep it from sticking, which defeats the purpose of a suction cup bowl because then the baby thinks it's a game to get the bowl off the tray.

However, they do not know how to properly hold the container and eat at the same time. This leads to spilled food. The lids are detached, so there is no way to stop the spill or prevent it. Also, the lids are do not really secure the container. The suction does not stay on a tray or a table.Really, these are just small, nice looking tupperware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay put?

They're really good when your child is self-feeding cold cereal, applesauce, oatmeal, etc. A smart buy, but will come in handy a little later than you might think.One more thing - the suction is greatly improved if you lick the bottom of the bowl before you stick it to the table. Unfortunately this lead to a period when my son felt it was customary to lick things before putting them on the table, but this passed quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with other reviewers...bowls don't stay put","review":"I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray.

None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two.On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them.

I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds.

So you can buy them for less, & return them if you don't like them. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a WASTE!","review":"I hate these bowls. I'm going to return them. The lids are super hard to get off and the suction doesn't work at all! Sometimes I can get the bowl to stick for a matter of seconds, and I can't get them off. Then my son reaches over and pulls them off with no effort at all.If these are washed in the dishwasher and the suction cup is touching anything during the dry cycle, it will become deformed and ruin any chance you ever had of it suctioning.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Thought these would be a great learning bowl for my daughter to use. She figured out how to un-suction the bowl in about 3 seconds flat. Totally defeats the purpose of the suction bottoms. The lids do hold the food in well for traveling, but quite bulky. You're better off using plain ole tupperware when toting around food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction Sucks! (By sucks, I mean there's no suction)","review":"I bought these bowls because they had suction cups underneath the bowls, but the suction does not hold.

I would NOT recommend these bowls."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money these are worthless!","review":"I read negative reviews and bought these anyway because I was tire of feeding my son off the high chair tray or dirty tables when we went places!

A real dissapointment,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck on our high chair tray","review":"We read the reviews and we were worried this product wouldn't stick but we tried it and it worked for us on our wooden kitchen table, granite countertop and our son's plastic tray.

The lids are difficult to put on but overall we're happy with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"They will get thrown on the floor","review":"Don't know what to add that someone else hasn't said but, yeah.... if you have an infant that throws his food on the floor, these bowls will not help you. I just used them for the first time and my ten-month-old son just threw a bowl of cottage cheese on the floor. Wet or dry, they do not stick for long no matter what you do. They're cute, though and I like the lids. Time to mop the floor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well on a high chair","review":"Love the size of these bowls, how colorful they are and the fact that its easy for new spoon eaters to eat with a spoon fairly easily without corners, sides to get tripped up on. My only dislike is that the only place these bowls seem to suction on is my lil guy's high chair. Great for structured eating and meal time but my husband and I do casual snack time with a movie in the afternoon and use a kids picnic table. The bowls do not suction to picnic table at all so we are trying to figure out another option. Again, FANTASTIC for my 18 month old at his high chair...he loves to dump food from plates and bowls and this prevents him from doing so and allows him to switch focus from playing to eating but would be nice if it worked on slightly less perfectly smooth surfaces;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't stay put!","review":"The bowls are fine, but the suction doesn't work for even a minute on the smoothest plastic.

My son takes any dish that is set before him and picks it up to take a look at it, and the contents go wherever they fall. In my mind the idea of a dish that is not pick-up-able was brilliant. It still is. But I have to find a dish that fits that description and these do not. The suction has not lasted for longer than 3 minutes. At first I thought it was because my wooden table is porous and air sneaks in. So I started shopping around for plastic place-mats that would not be porous. When I finally found one, the suction did not last any longer on it. Once my son starts trying to pull the dish up it takes him less than 10 seconds. He has figured out that you have to scratch at the bottom and this will make the dish come up pretty fast. I like the design, the colors truly are gender neutral and these bowls have turned into a cute toy for my son. But they don't really work the way they are supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, if you teach your kid","review":"My 16-month old can pull the bowl off his tray, so the suction isn't extremely strong. The trick is to just teach your child not to do that. Once he/she is disciplined to not pull on the bowl, then it serves a great use in staying in place while your child learns to use a spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just use it as tupperware because it doesn't work!!!","review":"Very disappointed!

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I purchased these bowls in hopes of starting to teach my son how to eat off a plate and not play with it. Well they don't work.

It struck me then as bizarre, as you can imagine it would to a teenager in the early 70's. Having perused it again it still strikes me as ghastely and unimaginable but strangely compelling. I believe it to carry a strong message, a warning no less of the traps and pitfalls of human excesses and how lusty, violent tendencies can overwhelm even apparently ordinary people should they succumb to the hysterical abandonment of decency and proper civil norms and behaviour.

There are very graphic scenes of sex and violence and an over indulgence in the sadistic rituals of the games. I would question the accuracy of much of this book.

Those expectations, I felt, were quickly dashed. The books became more about the narrative of a detective investigating a case than an attempt to solve the mystery oneself. I was all set to give this book only a couple of disappointed stars, but the twist at the end made it all worthwhile.

Thus, if you love Poirot mysteries because you enjoy the company of M. Poirot and Captain Hastings, this one will leave you smiling, but looking to the next one on your shelf.However, if your preferences lay in following the mechanism of his searching, pensive, relentless investigations, you will likely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"predictable ending, but good read","review":"agatha christie ventures into somewhat uncharted territory - the this time, poirot is on the trail of a homicidal maniac. Christie fans will see the ending coming. the characters are a bit bland.

The story is outstanding and keeps you interested, and is set in 1935 in England. Hercule Poirot, the great detective, receives anonymous letters from someone called ABC. These letters state a city and a date inside them, and Poirot suspects a crime. I liked this book mainly because it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The only dislike I have is that sometimes it was hard to follow, but later things clear up. Therefore, if you like mystery novels that make you not want to stop reading, you should definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Christie mysteries!","review":"The \\"ABC\\" murders is one of the all time great mysteries ever written.

The book starts with Poirot receiving a note indicating that something will happen to someone whose name begins with \\"A\\" in Andover on a given date. The something of course is murder and the chase is on as the murderer proceeds deeper and deeper into the alphabet.Atypical of Christie's works is that the murderer calls his shots in advance. As can be expected, there is the typically fine sleuthing. Unexpected, however, best describes the ending.A fun read and highly recommend.

The arrangements and the way in which he weaves the varous pieces together, sometimes playing both themes simultaneously, are incredible. They lift you up and carry you away. The various instrumental additions (such as the guitar in track 2, drums in track 6, strings in track 5, the sound of the wind in track 4) add just the right touch---lightly sprinkled in when needed. As a professional pianist myself, I also appreciate his considerable technique and the emotion with which he infuses his music. Anyone who likes classical music and movies should own this CD. Anyone who has friends who like classical music and movies should purchase this CD for them. They will love you for it. It is my favorite CD. I never tire of listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book in Public Economics","review":"I am using this book for an Introductory Public Financ/Economics Course.

Want to know aout Alzheimers or preventing it? About Autism? Learning disabilities? Photographic memory? Schizophrenia? Or even why we like spicy foods? This book provides truly interesting real life stories and examples.

The author does a great job putting in lay terms how to think about the different functions of the brain, from sensory, to motor, attention and consciousness. In my opinion he used just the right amount of scientific terms and lay terms. My only desire would be to refresh the book since it was written in 2001-2002.

However in, \\"A User's Guide to the Brain,\\" it seems that Ratey trys to tackle too much or reaches too far outside his practice in an attempt to explain the current understanding of brain chemistry, genes, behavior, and their relevance in psychotherapy. I was excited to dig in to this book but keep wondering when the concepts (The \\"theaters\\") would develop into a cohesive thesis. The level of detail of brain anatomy detracted rather than aided the presentation. I also found the copious analogies to be somewhat digressive and awkward. This work would have been much better if it were more focused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I just received this book from a friend. I barely got past the introduction. While the book is advertised to present the latest finding the author decides that most current brain models are too influenced by cognitive science and determines that the brain is \\"analog\\" by which he means it works in analogies! His introduction says he will therefore talk about the brain largely in analogies and metaphors. The author even claims this type of discourse will replace much of the logical reasoning we use today. The few sections I looked into are full of loose language and a singular lack of scientific rigor.

This is a good thing for a world starved for inspiring instrumental post-rock. Other woodwinds are implicated, angular percussion punctuates the songs, melodies come and go, a guitar comes into and out of focus Fripp style, and odd noises meander through the tracks. Alternatively contemplative and boppy, airy and dense, this one should be filed alongside Tortoise, Brokeback, Isotope 217 and your other favorite post-rockers. Influences are too many to enumerate -- for instance, Track 12 is based on klezmer, which makes sense for a band with a tuba! The music could also be filed with trance-inspired drum and bass on the jazzier side, such as Amon Tobin. Drums and Tuba, who hail from New York by way of Austin, thankfully prove that post-rock can survive outside of the rarefied air of Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I learned to read on this book!

That sub-story is over in the first few pages and really does little but set the scene. What this story is really about is courage, self-sacrifice, and the protection of innocent life against a world that often is far too dangerous. Many adults could benefit from giving this a read and taking it to heart, and yet it's not preachy or over the heads of the children it is targetted towards. Add to this the absolutely gorgeous colored-pencil artwork (Bill Peet worked for Disney for a while; his character designs give the original 101 Dalmations and the Sword in the Stone much of their charm) and some truly memorable characters, and you have my favorite children's book, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be who you are","review":"This was a great story.

I was amazed to see how well Garcia Marquez could write from a woman's perspective.The book is very short and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the only copy of the book I've seen was in my university's library. I've tried for a long time to find this book on a bookstore, but have been unsuccessful.

His Music of the Night, in my opinion, is even better than Michael Crawford's. I recommend this to Musical Theatre actors who want to learn how to sing really well. For anyone else it really just depends on whether or not they are willing to pay 17 dollars for 11 songs (all amazing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Leave it to Thomas Hampson and his giant ego to title an album, Leading Man. We all look forward to that day when Hampson wakes up from his reverie and realizes that he cannot sing everything. Here is the album that states the case emphatically that Opera singers have no business singing American Musical Theater. Particularly Opera singers who THINK they CAN sing this repertoire. Hampson's indulgent, charicatured, pompous and bloated renderings of this strong material is an embarassment. His performance of \\"Not A Day Goes By\\" is painful, and for all the wrongs reasons. He uses his celebrated falsetto to mamby-pamby effect in \\"Bring Him Home\\", a song written for the tenor voice. Maestro Raitt must have cringed while recording \\"Hey There\\".

However, for a classically trained violinist, she seems to have forgotten her roots. While she demonstrates nearly flawless technique, that's pretty much all there is. Brief glimpses of musicality are its only saving grace. The Bach, especially, is excrutiatingly shallow. There's just not much to it. It is very immature for her supposed musicality. If you're looking for good unaccompanied Bach, try Heifitz-- a phenomenal standard --or even Hilary Hahn (her Bach is strikingly intuitive, despite her youth).Bottom line: She sounds bored, which makes it boring. If you're a hardcore V-M enthusiast, stick with the original, fiery, vamped-up Vanessa-Mae."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful fantasy of classical music","review":"Vanessa-Mae is a musical genius. Not only can she play difficult, beautiful music, she can compose as well. The solo violin pieces by Bach are haunting and the \\"Romance No. 2\\" by Beethoven is mesmirizing. Vanessa-Mae's own arrangement of \\"I'm a doun for lack o' Johnnie\\" has been released on her new album \\"Storm\\" also. It is a modern retelling of the poem and the Scottish folk music. I love Vanessa-Mae's music and recommend her classic recordings as well as her pop-rock recordings. If you like the Classical Album 1, get the Classical Album 2: China Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's in over her head","review":"While these are not horrible performances, they are exceedingly shallow. Vanessa-Mae clearly has no understanding of how one is supposed to build and shape a piece of music. This is particularly apparent with the Bach Partita, where one cannot rely on spiffy orchestration to save one's [...] --- it's just the violinist and the music, and it's up to the performer alone to make the music speak to the audience.In this performer's hands, the music simply drifts along without direction or focus. Clearly there is no musical maturity here. For those apologists who would say, \\"but she was only 17 when she recorded it,\\" I would reply that she should do her musical growing up before stepping into a recording studio. Besides, I thought she was supposed to be a prodigy. This doesn't sound prodigious, only lackluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should stick to techno","review":"Serious classical music fans will no doubt be disappointed with the quality of playing on this CD. While Mae seems to have carved out a niche market for herself with her electronically-enhanced versions of some classical pieces, she is not a wonderful classical artist: this is made obvious with her attempt to join the mainstream classical community. While she demonstrates decent technique, there are a countless number of other musicians who play Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Bruch better than she does, with much better phrasing and tone quality. (Any senior student at Julliard or Curtis would sound better than she does.)It would be silly to compare Mae's Brahms and Beethoven with the thoughtful, beautiful renditions that Zukerman has recorded, likewise the Bach and Bruch of Heifetz is in a completely different leagues than Mae's. If you like Mae stick to her other work, if you like Brahms, Beethoven, Bach, and Bruch, stick to bona fide classical artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sense of classics","review":"I was lucky to have not wasted any buck on it.Thanks for the lovely service!the sample of 1 minute aimless lousing on note leaded me to an immediate decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"well lady, could you go back and practise?","review":"i do not mean she's bad, while any academic student could play like this. one could play down from classical to pop, and a pop star could use classical as a flavor; while now you started from below. if you go on like this, i'm just afraid that neither your pop fans nor any classical fans would stick on you. in addition, people would continuosly recall these \\"similarities\\" between you and pagnini as mentioned by advertisements, so, please, have more practices. one day, as you no longer have to struggle to play bach's partitas, hopefully you could be re-recognized as a moderate player, though i don't think that's the right way for you to go. why not go on with your commercial performances? don't get ashamed, there would be people like that, even if i'm not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drums, bass, lead guitar...BUT LOSE THE VOCALS!","review":"A friend of mine told me of this band in Milwaukee.

Sure some songs are better than others, and there are better AC/DC albums than this (Back in Black, Highway to Hell), but the formula is still there. AC/DC always stuck to their guns. When a lot of our favorite bands have gone out into la la land and released really bizarre stuff, AC/DC were there to keep us anchored. They may never have an Unplugged Session on MTV or release a 'concept' album, but I don't think AC/DC fans want them too.

The beat is steady and strong, courtesy of Simon Wright,a totally different drummer than Phil Rudd; Cliff Williams's bass reached an all time low in the final mix, you can't barely hear it. Johnson's vocals never sounded so bad, totally obscured in the back of the mix, as if singing from another room ina big house. Very weird. The tunes, however, are definitely very good.

The only one tracks I have loved, are only BONZO's Montreaux and the new version of I can't quit ya baby. The other tracks on this cd are part of major musically taste..... Sometimes I dunno understand! why some fanatical said that they are the best band of all time?? if they were the best one,....logically means that their last album must have been very very good! not like this Poor CODA....."},{"rating":"1","title":"last testament of this band","review":"The only one song I admired was Bonzo's Montreaux (solo drumming Bonham!) the other one symbolized the end of ZEPPELIN as a super group. need I say more??

Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you.

This album should never have been released. No serious Zeppelin fan could enjoy this garbage. A similarly bad album is \\"In through the out door\\". Led Zeppelin was over after Houses of the Holy. Physical Graffiti was also pretty bad - with the exception of Kashmir (which was probably left over from Houses of the Holy). Too bad the record company felt it necessary to try and make some money off fans who would blindly buy anything with Led Zeppelin's name on it. I don't imagine Amazon is going to post this review - since it certainly won't help to sell any copies of this. At least they let you preview the songs; so don't take my word for it, listen yourself to how bad this stuff is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Song","review":"The first time I heard about this album was right after Robert Plant released his 1st solo album. I was anticipating a lot of new material (looking at the track listing on the back record cover). Only to be disappointed at the quality of the songs. Thus with my entire Led Zeppelin collection (I have them all), this is the least played album with the exception of the song \\"Wearing & Tearing\\".And with a limited amout of studio recording material to put on the album, I was suprised they didn't include \\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\\" which was only released on B side of a 45 RMP record instead of a live version of \\"I Can't Quit You\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end","review":"This album holds strong memories for me and possibly for Zeppelin fans, released in '82 it was the last of led Zeppelin, 8 songs only 33 minutes long and classic. This proved many things about the band, Robert was a fantastic singer, Jimmy was a guitar god, JPJ was an amazing bass player and arranger, and John Bonham was an amazing drummer and you would be sadly missed. The pictures inside go from the early years around '68 and '69 to the last years going into the 80s where Robert got a little bigger, Jimmy got smaller, JPJ looked better, and John Bonham's alcohol abuse got worse and he got very big and bear like compared to the rest of the members. This album will always make me happy when I listen and the closing of \\"bonzo's Montreux\\" will always remind me the power of John \\"bonzo\\" bonham!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The leftover bin","review":"Like most posthumous leftover albums, this one is weak. Not entirely bad, however: on \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" they proved they could still play fast and heavy, and \\"Poor Tom\\" and \\"Ozone Baby\\" are not without their charm. This is definitely not the Zep album to buy first. However, fans will want it to complete their collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jeebus review","review":"This is probably the best Jan Wayne CD. My favorites songs in this cd are the following: The Total Eclipse of the Heart, Because the Night, Ready to Fly, Only You, Take My Breath Away, and Get into the Groove.

It's as amateurish as a paper describing a high school science-fair project. I don't think I could recommend this book to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for beginners.

However, I think he treats 8051 as PIC, which is not the objective of the 8051 book.

It's missing here, maybe for politically correct reasons, and the edit chops with incredible crudeness directly from Lady Bellingham sipping tea to the lord to that gentleman unaccountably attacking Sophie. The result is that a lof of subsequent plot makes no sense at all.That alone would justify giving this one the miss, but the transfer is also hazy and unfocused, and may even have been made from a VHS tape.

York is the epitome of fair English beauty, and Finney carries off the central role with gusto. Sumptuous color photography is another bonus.

It is a 2 dimensional map.I wanted it for a wall-hanging (e.g. mounted in a frame).The Michelin map is folded, but a little steam \\"work\\" flattens it nicely.If you are not interested in the historical view of Alsace, this map probably has little value to you.I am an amateur military historian and found the map very useful for reference against various regimental histories (available via the San Jose, CA library).It is an excellent historical check-and-balance map (e.g. some town names have changed, road names, etc. from the mid-twentieth century).Although I have not used it in this way, it is probably very useful as an overlay of modern maps, if you are doing a WW2 tour. It is, of course, a map from that time period, so you would have to cross reference memorials and monuments from a modern map and then find the associated reference on the Michelin map.Pete"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent bag","review":"Seems like a decent keyboard bag, haven't had too many chances to use it yet.

The Gator case doesn't have pockets, but since it's for an 88 key keyboard, you get some extra space at one end that can fit a small gig bag. The great part about the Gator case is how tight they keyboard fits. It doesn't shift, and I found the keyboard feels 20 pounds lighter because of it!Oh, and do NOT buy the Gator 76 economy case.

The game is a first person perspective shooter. The controls are easy to learn and are laid out in a very easy format. You also get to customize your robot with secondary and optional weapons giving you a custom robot according to the mission objectives. The game runs very smooth and you'll feel as if you were playing an arcade game. My only grip about the game is that there is no built in map or radar in the game. But this is compensated by the mission briefing before each mission (which shows a map) and that the instructions manuel comes with a general map for each mission.Other than that, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a fast pace game who likes go out on military missions in thier 'mech'anized robots carrying a big gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you'd think!","review":"A sequel to the 2 Saturn games(the second was not released in the US), Gungriffon is now here in the states , courtesy of Working Designs.

Gungriffon Blaze has a lot going for it. Graphics are good for a 1st gen game, and as usual, Game Arts gameplay is excellent.

The camera reads the situation and sets an excellent level most every time. It really depends on what kind of brightness you're looking for.

The size and case that comes with it is also a plus as it takes up very little space in your bag. The only negative that I have experienced is that you can not shoot consecutive pictures very fast and it takes at least 3-4 seconds to reset itself even with fully charged batteries.

You can't do this. You can't do that.Realizing that this is basically the pop-up flash on steroids and nothing more makes life a lot easier. What advantage does it have? You can bounce the flash (very important), it has a little bit more power AND... it is extremely small. That means it doesn't take up a lot of space, and it also doesn't intimidate people as much as a large flash.Don't dismiss is little flash too quickly, it has its place and it's actually used more than my three SB-600's together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy flash for Nikon SLR's","review":"Purchased for use on a D7000.In years past I've run with sets of lights and strobes such as the SB800's, but that's overkill with my current lifestyle.The new SB-400 arrived, I put batteries in it, and stuck it on the D7000.A few quick interior shots revealed that the SB-400 is a little gem that does great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small flash.","review":"This is no substitute for a bigger and more expensive speedlight. It lacks their power and features. But if you are looking for a very small light flash, with a reasonable recycle time, this is the one to get.

Also great to have in your bag as a backup to your prime light."},{"rating":"2","title":"SB-400 Speed light works great with my Nikon D60","review":"This flash works great with my D60. I also have a diffuser unit which I use with the flash most of the time - no harsh shadows and the flash has plenty of power for most room shots.Before I used the diffuser, I used the bounce off the ceiling and that worked most of the time; but I would need to adjust the angle to get the right results.The cycle time is very good and the communication with the camera is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent flash","review":"Good for almost every situation, and the form factor is excellent. Highly recommended by many internet reviewers, and they were right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners (esp. w/ D40) to Flash Photography","review":"As versatile as the SB-600 is, the SB-400 is a much less intimidating start to flash photography for the beginner. Using the 400 opens your eyes to the possibilities of bouncing and diffusing the flash. When used in the manual or priority modes on the D40 (and D40X), it is also a great introduction to manual flash settings. With this inexpensive flash, you can learn to bounce, diffuse, and balance ambient lighting.Once you are done with this, you can then go on to Strobist-style off-camera flash photography and spend all that money on the 600s and the light stands, etc.NB The SC-28 cable allows you to take the 400 off camera but it more than a few bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Beat","review":"Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras... The Nikon SB-400 flash handles 95 percent of what I want a flash for on a D40x. I have even had good results in large rooms. An off camera cord will come in very handy if you like to bounce and control your shadows.It has a very low profile, even smaller than the old SB-23 which didn't have the bounce capability. Outdoor fill flash is excellent. I doubt you will be dissapointed with this flash unless you are trying to use it in multiple flash arrays, even then I can see some possibilites... If you need a small flash with bounce capability get this one. If you want full control get an off camera extension cord then you can put the light wherever you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little flash!","review":"I got this as a christmas gift. The best gift I have ever had! The flash works perfectly with my Nikon D40X. It is small enough to always carry it with me. The flash head rotates upward if you want bounced light (I use that a lot). Bounced light makes a big difference as compared to the fill-in (pointing forward) flash. The angle of rotation appears to be automatically transmitted to the camera, so the camera adjusts the shutter speed and aperture automatically depending on how the flash is pointed, always producing beautiful shots! The recharge time is extremely fast! I can take one shot after another pretty much immediately, and the flash is always ready. I almost never use the built-in flash anymore after I got this one. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little off Camera Light","review":"I purchased this light for my son to use with his D40. This little light works great. TTL is almost right on without using the exposure compensation. In my opinion, a shoe mount flash makes a huge difference in light quality. The actual light swivels up so that you can bounce the light off the ceiling. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that it can not swivel side to side. Therefore you can not bounce off a side wall. For the price and the difference this light will make in your photos, I highly reccommend the sb-400.

Angle it up to use the ceiling as a reflector or build a small diffuser or reflector with a sheet of paper.

I have not been disappointed. My pictures turn out much better when I'm able to use a flash (my house is poorly lit). I have only shot indoors and have mostly taken pictures of my kids (much less motion-blur now). The light is strong so I've pointed it up at 90 degrees almost exclusively.

The biggest downside was that it could only bounce the flash off of ceilings in landscape shots. Put your camera vertical, and you can only bounce off of side walls. It doesn't swivel.Unfortunately while looking for a replacement today, I've found that the SB-400 is out of stock at large retailers, and only available at about 50% more than what I got it for in 2008 (and close to what the SB-600 used to go for)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Speedlight","review":"So small, yet so nice.

The SB-400 is pretty amazing. The exposures it takes are spot-on most of the time, plus you get the ability to bounce the flash. The only thing I wished it could do is to bounce sideways too, but otherwise an excellent accessory for my D40."},{"rating":"2","title":"SB-400 AF","review":"Excellent flash, very powerful for its size, light and convinient.

An extensive instruction sheet & elegant zippered case are included.The flash uses two AA cells [not included]."},{"rating":"2","title":"SB-400: Who could ask for anything more?","review":"This little guy is fantastic! I used it to shoot a wedding recently, and was very pleased with the performance, especially when coupled with a flash bracket. This is now my \\"carry\\" flash.If you are shooting an event with this guy, make sure to have plenty of spare AA batteries!

I shoot a D90 indoors a few times a year for parties and such and my pictures looked much better when bouncing this flash. After using it maybe 10-15 times, it up and died, so I sent it in to Nikon for repair (I was just out of warranty). I got the repair estimate back today and my jaw dropped. Total cost was $103!!!! Seeing how I could (but won't) buy a brand new one for $17 more, I was in total shock and called up customer service. They didn't care and a supervisor declined my request to speak with them.A+ product when it works.F- for product support and customer service.I won't buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little flash","review":"I bought a Nikon D40 to take pictures of our new son, and wasn't happy with the way flash pictures looked: too harsh. I bought this unit for its bounch flash capability and have been very happy with it. It's small, light, and uses two AA batteries. It communicates very well with the Nikon: for example, the camera knows when the flash is aimed up, it does can do very nice redeye reduction, and the user can control the power of the flash. The recycle time is just fine. I wouldn't recommend it for shooting big groups of people in a very large room with high ceilings, but it's perfect for shooting inside a house with standard-height ceilings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small external flash that's portable","review":"Use of an external flash unit is a good way to improve your photography. The built-in flash on the average camera is okay, but it only points forward and you can't rotate it. With an external flash unit, you have a more powerful flash and you can change the position of the flash in order to bounce the light off a wall or off the ceiling.This small size of this external flash makes it easier to carry around and also doesn't make the camera itself significantly heavier. While you may want a larger flash for a studio shoot, this is perfect if you want an external flash unit when you're on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, worth the money","review":"I needed an inexpensive flash, mostly for fill. The re-cycle time was a bit slow at times, but on the whole, it was perfect for my needs. And because it is Nikon, the unit has a stronger feel,it easily talks to the camera, it has a lockable metal shoe, and the flash can be angled up to 90 degrees. The photos had a nice color to them. It would be nice if it had a horizonal movement. It's size makes it easy to handle, but the small size means there are only 2 batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this flash. Makes indoor pictures look so much nicer!","review":"I was kind of against my husband spending even more money on our already very expensive camera, but this flash really makes a big difference in how pictures turn out.

We've returned it to Nikon and are waiting to see how they respond. Will update when we find out. I was disappointed that it broke so fast and we are both very careful with the camera and the flash.Update 2: Nikon sent us an email saying they received the flash and that it is covered 100% by warranty. $0 cost to us.

No more red eye and now I have beautiful lighting for my indoor shots. Even my puppy's eyes no longer glow in photos. It's small, lightweight and does exactly everything I hoped it would do.

I chronicle my family and our travels with this camera. I bought the Nikon SB400 so I could bounce the flash off the ceiling while taking indoor photos. It works great for what I use it for. The entire room lights up with no shadows. I did have to increase the exposure compensation value on my camera to a +0.7 to get the room light enough if I was more than five feet away. However for the price and my limited expertise it does just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little flash","review":"Chose it as it would work with my Nikon D5100 camera and its ability for bounce lighting indoors.

I use it on a D4 that has enough ISO range and with lenses that are f/2.8 or faster so there is less need for the flash but occasionally I need some fill flash and this fits the bill. It's a fraction of the cost of the SB-910 and substantially less weight. Unless you really have a need for a full size flash, the SB-400 will do the job with more discretion. It's a sleeper of a flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real joy","review":"Yancey both entertains and causes the reader to ponder several aspects of the Lord drawing from his background rich in cultural works and various life experiences.

Although the orchestrations are better, the singers in the original cast are much better. Jonathan Pryce is good. His singing voice sounds very different from when he speaks, although I'm sure his stage presence made up for his minor flaws (but that doesn't make a good CD.)The Oliver has a beautiful voice but maybe a little to pretty. He sounds much older than the character is intended to be. But he does have a good voice. What really turned me off from this CD was the Sally Dexter. She is the worst Nancy I have ever heard. She puts no feeling into the music and her rendition of \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" needs a lot of work. Her voice is nice but not incredible. Nancy is probably one of the greatest roles in Broadway history and she brings down the whole production. If you want to hear a good Nancy listen to Georgia Brown!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown Revival","review":"I too looked forward to this recording. Oliver was one of my favorite shows from the 1960s. This recording lacks all of the charm of the original recording (Broadway cast.)

Stick to the original Broadway or London cast recordings - you'll hear the show as it was originally intended. Short, to the point and quite poignant.

While it lacks the intensity of \\"Streetcar\\" or the heartbreaking tenderness of \\"The Glass Menagerie,\\" \\"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\\" is vintage Williams just the same. Williams once said that he was interested in characters who \\"were frightened of life. . .who were desperate to reach out to another person.\\" Karen Stone, a lonely, fragile woman who is desperate to \\"stop the drift\\" following the death of her husband and her own fading youth and beauty, is such a character.

Williams finely portrays the mindset of an aging actress that would be applicable to any modern celebrity, male or female, today. We see the maniacle focus on career and staying on top, the disdain of other people, the internal fear and desparation that ultimatley leaves Mrs. Stone completely adrift and ruderless. The setting is post-war Rome where all Romans, aristocratic or otherwise, are poor, and all Americans are rich. Williams is a great wordsmith. His language and story flow nicely and his insight is very good. There was a particular loose end that didn't seem to get tied up. Also the brevity didn't allow for other characters to be developed or subplots to be introduced.

And the instrumentation is fresh and different and ROCKING compared to any other version.I've had the vinyl for years. Memorized it. This listing says discontinued, but there was a remastered 30'th anniversary reissue in 2005 and it's absolutely beautiful, a revelation in sound quality.I was finally able to order it from a Spanish website (12/2009) about $40 including shipping to California.

Two questions are vivid in my mind: I asked: Who will I marry?\\"(remember how young I was) The response was \\"Leo\\". Another friends asked \\"How old will I be when I die?\\" The response was \\"17\\" At that point everyone freaked out completely and we stopped playing. I don't remember the other questions, but these are the facts after the experience:- I married a man whose father's name is Leonel (and, no, I have never had a thing for my father-in-law)- The girl whom I was friends with ended up going to a different middle school and high school.

He throws away all of the products I own that he didn't endorse, for example, all of my paper towels. I have to clean all my messes with Zorbeez, as he will not allow me to keep anything else. Its not all bad, I came home on my birthday and he had gotten me a Big City Slider Station, which actually works pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are there always fanatics?","review":"Of course there are fanatics calling this toy evil because B movies give it a bad name but the fact is this IS a toy. This is a toy. It's a fun toy. It's a rectangular piece of card board with the alphabet drawn on it and then painted with glow in the dark paint. The planchet (the triangle thing) is plastic. It wasn't 'carved by Satan.' It's not Evil. It's a toy. Think about it. What self respecting demon is going to show up using a glow in the dark piece of plastic? If that's your idea of evil clearly you don't know about the cruelty and violence in the world today that you have to rant about a TOY! Get a grip!Little girls use these at slumber parties and I've yet to see anyone sucked into Hell for asking the piece of cardboard 'Does Timmy like me?' Some of these negative reviews calling this evil and Satanic are out right silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ouija Board","review":"I've played this game all my life and I have always loved it. It doesn't work the first time you play it but you really have to believe in the unknown to get the spirits to answer you. Don't play around with it, it's not a game. But also don't take it too seriously or you'll start basing your decisions on it and it might not make you do the right things. I think it's a really good thing to have when you're looking for answers and it's a lot of fun. The glow in the dark feature is really cool and it sets the mood when you're playing. To get answers from your board it is important that you relax and concentrate only on your question. Try to clear your mind of everything else. The Ouija Board is my favorite game and I thank my aunt for introducing it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideomotor Effect: The Game","review":"I'm very saddened that so many people are scared of this silly toy, look up the Ideomotor Effect. Yes, I was creeped out too as a little, uninformed kid. Then I learned science. Now, if someone has this, then have a Ouija session with the participants BLINDFOLDED (with an observer or videocamera recording the results). Now, what does it spell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort Of Hokey","review":"I used an original one when I was a kid, but haven't since, because it goes against my personal faith. But that is beside the point. I bought this glow-in-the-dark board as a prop for a short film, thinking it would be something different and kind of spooky for the camera. Instead, it came across more like a toy, sort of a cheaper version of the real thing--not the exact effect I was looking for, so I ended up not using it for the film and tossing it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glow in dark ouija board","review":"Was sent the wrong item was sent a cheaper regular board.want to send it back on there dime or give me the $6.00 difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's only a game isn't it?","review":"One night my mom and I were playing with my Ouija board. It was pretty cool and freaky at the same time. Because I asked it if we have any spirits in our house and it told us we have seven. That was pretty freaky! Then my dog started running around because she was scard of the board. It's a lot of fun playing by yourself. But becareful when you're playing with the board. It can be dangerous! It's only a game isn't it? GOOD BYE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural Fun!","review":"I've had my board for a very long time now, and there has been so many fun and creepy times I've had with it. I truly believe that after awhile the board really starts to work and you are truly communicating with a spirit.It's not always fun and games, though. There are many things you need to know before starting to play with a ouija board. If you don't know the rules and facts to this game, do not play with it. The rules are not included in the box, so I suggest you learn about the board before buying it. Even though this is just a game, atleast one person playing needs to know some things about it, like what you shouldn't ask and what you should. Some of the simplest questions are the msot dangreous.But if you do know about it and you are playing, have a great time with it. It's so fun and puts a slight taste of darkness into your life... but be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"great board for use","review":"I got my ouija board and have used it multiple times now with great results. however, there weren't very detailed directions, so we just went online and found appropriate directions. Cool product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than the original but it serves its purpose","review":"I had an old original Ouija Board that was about twice as big as this one that my mother told me to, \\"Get out of the house!\\" when I was a teenager. A lot of people associate this board game with negative energies but I just think it's plain fun- especially at parties. It's fun to spook each other out. Whether or not your are actually \\"connecting\\" with the other side, I have no idea but I've never had any adverse affects because of its use. The only thing about this glow in the dark set that needs upgrading is the size and quality of the plugs you put on the bottom of the pointer. My original had felt bottoms for easier sliding across the board. This on just has rounded plastic pegs that don't move as smoothly and one does not want to stay in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good","review":"I bought this for my 14 year old son for his birthday. It is more of a collector's item, but I couldn't find any \\"new\\" games on the market. The seller represented it well in their ad. I was pleased with the overall purchase, and it shipped quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS","review":"This product has been misclassified. It is not suitable for children of any age (or adults for that matter!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!! This is not a game or a toy!!! DANGEROUS!!!","review":"Anyone who says that a Ouija Board is just a toy or a game does not know what he is talking about. Anyone who says that it is not dagerous has not yet had a bad experience from using one. I have had a very bad experience and the only way to get relief from it was to start going to church!By the way, William Fuld who marketed this \\"game\\" in the early 1900's went to court to prove that it was an occult device and not a game! And, the court ruled that it was not a game!These \\"spirits\\" that operate the board are called demons and demons are bad or evil or whatever you want to call them. They are no good. Don't let your children ever use them! Make them stop. And don't ever use one!Anyone who says you can use them safely are either fools or liars. These New Agers are misguided souls turning to evil spirits instead of God.This is no joke! Please take my advice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You all are crazy.","review":"All of the reviews warning people not to use this particular board make me laugh. This board is JUST PLASTIC AND CARDBOARD! They are all made in the factory where all of our favorite dolls and board games are made. They are all made the way Monopoly and other fun games are made. They can't be posessed because you would need to have the board cursed by a witch person. They are made by the thousands just as all other toys are. I bought this and you have to move the pointer yourself and the board overall is just basically nothing. It is like paper and pencil. However, there are homemade boards you can buy on eBay that are posessed and that are dangerous. But I think it is ridiculous that some supernatural being would want to hang out in a peice of cardboard for all eternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUIJA BOARDS","review":"ONE CHRISTMASS I GOT AN OUIJA BOARD.

This is not a toy.","review":"This is merely a form of a channeling tool used to open up the doorway to mediumship. As someone that delved deeply into all of that junk and had it come back to bite me in the butt I speak truth when I say that all items that endorse mediumship and predicting the future or other events through mediumship are channels or doorways for evil spirits. No matter what may be coming through, spiritism can and will lead to things such as mental conditions, spiritual possession, and it can mess your life up (seriously!). We truly are in control of our own destinies, but the choices that we make get us there. Playing with spiritism and mediums like Ouija boards open the user up and basically say \\"I do\\" to evil entities wanting to mess with your mind and your life. When you play with ouija boards you make a choice to let the demonic play with your mind and spirit. Its an invitation for spiritism to come into your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This game was not fun at all and I don't think I will be buying from amazon ever again...complete waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, its not exactly about the game...","review":"Look, I've been reading about reviews but, alot of them are'nt about toy.

We were sure it was just fun, not evil like some people believe. So we asked it stupid questions like who we were going to marry and stuff and it didn't appear to work. Then I suggested we ask the Ouija Board what it was because I was curious if it would work. The answer we recieved was \\"Be not afraid. I am demon.\\" I have never touched one since because I know the truth. For awhile after that night I always felt like someone was behind me watching me. Now it is only once in a very long while. I opened a door I shouldn't have and there is no way to close it. All this is the truth told by a 16 year old American girl who wants to help others from making her mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL!!!","review":"This game is not a good game!

This is no game. It is fooling around with something you don't want to mess with. Please don't introduce your children or grandchildren to it. It does work by demonic power, not the power of angels. It may seem like a whole lot of fun but it is dangerous to say the least. This \\"game\\" should be sold in back alleys, not reputable toy stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOARD IS POSSESED!","review":"ONetime, I saw these people, and they were all possesed by the ouiji board, and they were all saying weird things, And my uncle playd it and it scared him to death, because they asked questions and the board actually new the right answer...

Nothing happened. I tried almost every day since I bought it and... nothing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be so sure.","review":"okay. this is more than a game. games dont move around on themselves and talk to you. It has worked for me and my friends and it is bad news. They are not real spirits, they could say anything to trick you. When you are dead, you go either to heaven or hell, you dont stay around and talk to ouija boards. God would not do that with spirits, but satan would with his to trick them. Be careful guys, it's some sort of strange force that causes it and it is not \\"just a game\\". Wether you are religious or not, you can not deny stuff that has really happened due to those boards. It's satanic wether u believe in it or not. do your research"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do you want a Ouija board?","review":"Is it just curiosity? It works. Everyone that's tried it can tell you. But what are you looking to get out of it? Spiritual advice, answers you feel you can't answer yourself? or is it just for fun? what kind of fun do you expect out of it? do you think it's a fun family game? or fun for a slumber party? well, try Gestures, or Pictionary, or maybe even Scrabble. But this isn't a game to be bought. if you're that curious, get it...but be smart, and be careful. think before you ask questions, remember to always close the \\"door\\" to that unknown place the answers come from. i won't say don't get it...everyone always do what they're told not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a piece of cardboard NOT CURSED","review":"I dont understand why so many people claim that the ouija board is cursed. I tried it myself just to see what happens, i played with one other person and absolutely nothing happened. i even turned off the lights and lit up candles and still nothing happened. I tested it out several times and even cursed it out and everything and still the stupid board didn't do anything. So all these stories about weird things happening when you play ouija is all made up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This is not a game, if you really do it.It is not spirits either, its evil demons that lie to impersonate spirits. I guess that for the ouja board to work, you must be devoid of the holy spirit. Demons have been around and watching everything for a long time, they know past events and can easily impersonate \\"a spirit\\". It is not necessarily safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This board ate my dog","review":"The happenings after buying a Oiuja board are indeed evil. The first thing that happened when I opened the box, was a paper-cut. Sure...harmless, right? Hardly. A drop of blood hit the board, and it started snapping open and closed, while a vortex appeared at its center. In a futile attempt to ward off this evil, my terrier attacked the board and was consumed in its spiral-like vortex. Wiggles is gone forever I fear...it has been four months. In addition to this, for some reason, every morning at 7, a Jehovah's Witness appears on my porch with booklets. After she leaves, two lifeless Chinese girls materialize on the porch holding a remote control.Hey....maybe you should get one of these after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky Buy","review":"I have played this game many times and all I have learned is that it dosen't work!

Nobody ever died from playing with a Ouija board..LOL They are fun and NO they aren't real, but who cares, It simple playful fun! When I was younger my girlfriends would try to scare each other at sleepovers,we would play tricks, and tell ghost stories, it was part of growing up.

You wouldnt suspect that from a toy company would you? I wouldnt, but bad things happen when you use it. When u use it, You allow spirits to come into yur house. Good Or Evil, Theyll come in.

He took it over to the campfire and threw the game in it. The campfire immediately burst into a huge bonfire (it literally quadrupled in size), with green flames. It scared the heck out of all of us.

If you order something from outside United States make sure that you pay attention the the region and be prepared to wait for more than a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Little Escape to Rio","review":"Put your inhibitions and prejudices on the back burner, and savor the beauty, innocence, humor, and humanity of this movie. Michael Caine is great as always. Michelle Johnson may never win an Oscar, but she is perfect as the liberated, honest, voluptuous daughter of Caine's best friend (Joseph Bologna). She lures Caine into an affair, presumably based on love, without any hint of malice. A young, pre-implant Demi Moore is pretty, but mostly background. Valerie Harper has funny moments as Caine's wife. Family conflict abounds, and is wrapped up in a mostly satisfying ending. Spiced up with local culture and natural beauty, including numerous topless ladies on the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle Johnson's first movie","review":"Back when this movie came out, Michelle Johnson figured prominently in the ads. So what happens? Lower billed co-star Demi Moore becomes a big star, and poor Michelle winds up doing B-fare like Waxworks. This is still a good movie, and if you want to see Michelle in another good role, order Body Shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cute 80's Film","review":"This movie portrays Brazilian in kind of a peculiar way, but I won't even go there, despite the fact that I could go on about some things that were misrepresented about Brazilians. Overall the move was cute and pretty decent. If you love light hearted romantic comedies from the 1980's, then you'll really dig this. It's the perfect movie to pop in whenever you are in the mood for something light and reminiscent of the 80's, a decade when things were fun and full of spirit. One surprising thing about this movie is that the music in it is pretty nice. It's very reflective of the era, so compard to today's Brazilian music it might sound a little cheezy, but I thought it was pretty refreshing. This movie also serves as a good introduction to what Rio de Janeiro (\\"hee-ew-gee-ja-nay-ru\\") looks like."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD sexy comedy from the 1980's","review":"Along with other sexy comedies from the 80's this was one that showed lots of skin from one of the leading actress's, however it was disappointing not to see more of Demi Moore...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love letter to Michelle","review":"Okay this is not a great movie,but it is fun to watch. The main reason I bought this is that I fell in love with Michelle Johnson in the Movie Far and Away and I must have everything she's acted in.That being said it is funny and some of the scenery is beautiful even when Michelle's not in the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad script, nice scenery","review":"I can't believe we were watching the same movie here. Apart from the gorgeous body of Michelle Johnson and the scenic shots of Rio there is very little to like about this flick. Michelle's acting is bad, the script is sophomorish, the audio is amateurish, and subject matter borders on disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like La Cage Aux Folles","review":"I just saw this movie at a friend's house. Oh my God this is so funny albeit the moral issues. It's like The Birdcage- that old French school of hysterical comedies you can watch a million times. Caine's best friend was the best part of this movie. This guy really made me scream on the floor because he's like Robert Deniro's character in \\"Meet The Parents\\" on Benzedrine (\\"iF YOU DO ANYTHING TO CORRUPT MY PRECIOUS FIRST BORN DAUGHTER i WILL BRING YOU DOWN. I WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO CHINA TOWN!)And remember the look on that maid's face when she walked in on Caine and his friend in a suggestive position?!Although an old guy shagging with a young girl can make one hurl- it works in this film. You know- in a Froggie way.Good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why it's worth watching","review":"Come on guys lets be honest...Only reason to watch this is Michelle Johnson. She has an amazing body, and she's topless in several scenes. If Mindy Cohen (Facts of Life) played the part this video would have been out of print by 1988."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD is too dark","review":"I wrote a 4-star review of the VHS version of this movie on 11/22/00. Later I bought the DVD version. The DVD was much darker. Some of the night scenes were almost completely black. This was annoying and made the DVD useless to me. It made no sense to me why they did this. The VHS version is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soft pop porn","review":"I watched this movie with two people who consider it a comedy classic and was \\"udderly\\" bored. The acting was horrible, the plot was boring, and the comedy was very thin indeed. Watch this if you must on mute. The scenery is great and if you like to see old geezers fumbling young half nude girls, this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Wow! This movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time. I watched it last night and I woke up in a bad mood. Everything about it sucked except for the nudity (hence the single star). I understand it was supposed to be something of a \\"comedy\\", but without a touch of reality, I found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it. The acting is awful, the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke. Michael Caine's goofy appearance was accentuated with some GINORMOUS glasses... there isn't a teen girl alive who would find that \\"sexy\\". When I saw the 'Blame it on Rio' reviews on this site, I felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than 2 stars (many gave it 5!!), strangle them, then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this title carefully","review":"There are two versions of this disc available on Amazon from different distributors. The one-star rating relates to the cheap non-MGM version but this review may appear elsewhere. Be sure to buy the one with the blue bar at the top of the box that has the MGM logo and says \\"Movie Time\\". The other version has the same picture on the cover but no blue bar at the top (and is cheaper). The cheap version as you might expect is poorly authored in 480i (interlaced) format and has no menu, extras or subtitles. Depending on your player, moving objects have jagged edges and the entire movie lacks video quality. The MGM version (with the blue bar on the box) is 480p (progressive scan) and has sharper images, smoother pans and higher contrast. Still not much on extras beyond the theatrical trailer but it does have an interactive menu and some non-English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Party Scenes Are Wild","review":"BLAME IT ON RIO is a comedy about two pals taking a holiday in Rio from their work in San Paulo. While on vacation the daughter of one man has an affair with the other guy who incidentally is her father's best friend.To make matters worse, it later turns out that her dad has been having an affair with the wife of her new lover.It is difficult to keep the mood cheerful in the midst of such a mess but the lively party scenes help to give the movie a lift.Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna do a commendable job in spite of their challenging assignments."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleazy plot","review":"This film has some flashy scenery, and a topless Demi Moore before her overdone breast enhancement; still, a sleazy plot. Two friends and their daughters make trip to Rio, one dad decides to bone his friend's beautiful daughter, who is high school age. GROSS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All together now YUCK!!","review":"Comedy? If you think it's funny that two over 50yrs. fathers take their nubile, underaged, daughters on a trip to topless brazil and then ogle them lecherously at the nude beach, making lewd remarks before they realize the hot girls are their own babies. The bustier of the two young girls ( Demi is pre boob surgery in this movie)gets into bed with her father. No judgement, but, if you think one of the fathers that has sex with one of the daughters is funny then I for one think you need psyciatric help. This is hands down some of the worst crap that's been put on film, granted there is worse, but this is got to be in the top ten, at least. Like I said - YUCK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blame it on the Actors, Writers, Director et al.","review":"Unfunny and sordid tale about an aging man (Michael Caine)who goes down to Rio and has an affair with his best friend's (Joseph Bolognna) teenage daughter, played by Michelle Johnson.Most of this mess fails to find any laughs and how any characters with any sense of decency could stoop this low. Of course, this could be a statement about the general lack of morality in Hollywood where a babysitter one day becomes a wife the next.Valerie Harper and Demi Moore have decent, if undersued roles. Caine, of course, has gotten much better roles in recent years. These days though, the only attraction in this movie is to see Michelle Johnson, who is now Michelle Williams, wife of Matt Williams of the World Series winning Arizona Diamondbacks. Hope she is set for life so she never has to dig this low for a role again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"I saw this production in B'way back in 1994 and liked it a lot. Now, as years have gone by, my addiction to it has increased, probably due to the great amount of recent shows that do not deserve much attention. This is one of the theatrical events that surpass its origins. Being the Ettore Scola's movie a most enchanting production, this musical overpasses it in terms of poetical and romantic appeal. Some songs are simply awesome, like the opening \\"Happiness\\" and the most wonderful of all, \\"No one Has ever loved you\\". Donna Murphy and Gere OShea are wonderful both in singing as in acting. The story is beautiful and very moving. Possible future revivals might work even better in a small round-the-circle kind of stage rather than in the frontal, large scale production like the one I saw in B'way."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't play","review":"received the cd in a cracked case which is always irritating. But when the cd didn't play, it was time to start shopping locally again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST play EVER!!!!","review":"This was the WORST play I have EVER seen in my life!!! It was depressing and all the songs sounded exactly the same. My family and I would have left early, but I guess Sonheim thought that might happen, so there's no intermission. I'm not sure how long the actual running time of the play was, but it felt like the worst 10 hours of my life!!!! I WOULD NOT recommend this soundtrack to anyone with any kind of taste in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely maginficent!","review":"I found this recording to be one of Sondheim's best. It perfectly captures the magnificence of the score and the performers. Marin Mazzie's lush voice is perfect for the role of Clara and Donna Murphy is Fosca to a tee. The plot can be sluggish (this is more of a problem in the video, than on the CD, but the video is one of the best recordings of a musical that is commercially available and is well worth the money.) All in all, though, it is a pleasure to listen to and great for any musical lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD is damaged","review":"I bought 3 cds from amazon and was happy that I received them days earlier and excited to listen to all of them, the first one I opened was Passion. To my great disappointment, when I played this recording, half of the tracks sounded like the cd was scratched. Tried it on to other players and it's the same, while the other two cds I bought with Passion seemed perfectly fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING INSIGHT INTO SCIENCE","review":"This is a wonderful book that details the difference between how men and women approach science. It demonstrates those charactoristics that women can uniquely bring to science. As a mathematician I was impressed with Dr. Shepherd's rigorous scholarship and enjoyed her interviews with living women scientists. I'm a father of a teenage girl who plans a career in science, and I appreciate the author's efforts to highlight the special ways that women contribute to the scientific effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"I was skeptical about this movie but I had heard some good things...I'm glad I bought it, its really very good. I didn't realize that it was based on a true story. In the end of the movie....just kidding. Enjoy =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent Music with perfect technique","review":"This is a wonderful CD for every Schubert lover, done by a musicians working together for a long time. I, as an amateur cellist, was especially moved by the exellent music with perfect technique of Perenyi. The sound is beautiful, interpretation persuasive, tempo stable but not tedious, and music expressive. I especially like his \\"Arpeggione Sonata.\\" But it's not only his music and sound that is great. As a recording of Chamber music, \\"ensemble\\" must be the priority....and this is exactly what I appreciate so much. As a ensemble group, these three are one of the best. I hope as many musicians as possibe would share their well-done work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritless technology","review":"Very disappointing. True, the technique is superb. Every sound is heard, in absolute accordance with the score. The recording is more than satisfactory. But the performance is spiritless, especially when Schiff is playing. Perenyi does make an effort to put some life into the music, but the cello alone is not enough to compensate for his coleagues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camisole","review":"It's okay.

Any abridgements are very judiciously made, so that none of the essential ideas are left out. The introduction is excellent, and the translation very coherent and easy to follow. It is one of the most engrossing of philosphical primary texts, much easier to understand than Kant, and the presentation and translation are excellent. Anyone with an interest in philosophy, especially in the period of 19th Century philosophy from Kant to Nietzche, will find it indispensable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy General Books LLC \\"The World as Will and Idea\\"","review":"This \\"translation\\" of The World as Will and Idea printed by General Books LLC is terrible.No translator is listed.

I love Snow Patrol's more recent stuff, and I bought this to just get into them more...it's just horrid.

I had to consider sending a written apology to the person who bought me a gift card that contributed towards the buying of this.

My concern was that I might get one of the 'poorly finished' pieces. I also looked at the very expensive vises (2 to 3 times the price) and decided I didn't have much to risk at the Amazon price.The vise came within a week and it was packaged well. The fit and finish are probably a 4 out of 5...some of the machined threads are a little rough at the very end of the unit, but not a big deal. There are NO instructions included, but if you're adding a front vise you are probably already very handy and you wouldn't use instructions anyway. However, a template for drilling holes would have been a nice addition. Note too that there is no handle nor wood faces included; you will have to make these yourself.Bottom line: it's a good value, the fit and finish are acceptable, and the vise provides tremendous torque due to the large size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect glare controllers","review":"I bought 3 of these to keep the sun glare out of my eyes when I'm outdoors.

The character Yano has to dance, I don't know why. Then a wrecking ball hits the building and you have to run from it. It is quite difficult but once you get the hang of it, you progress. If you like weird story type games, you'll like IC."},{"rating":"2","title":"a departure from the norm","review":"Give this one a try if you are looking for a change.

After 20 minutes of not getting anywhere, I gave up and threw it away. (And I was able to beat \\"Parappa\\" so I know I'm not totally inept at this sort of game.)

I forgot about this game for a solid ten years or so and randomly saw it online. I decided it's cheap and read some reviews and decided to go ahead and order it. As soon as I put this game in, I was laughing.The graphics are a little dated, but I can generally get past that. The gameplay has a lot of variety, many different mini games that last longer than current microgames in the Wario Wares, WTF, and Mario Party styles. Most of the games are pretty good, but a few (stretcher steering) can be a little annoying.The story is great, an intertwining story of this goofy family with slapstick humor showing how everything that can possibly go wrong will.

The down fall of this is most certainly the degree of patients this requires. I tell you some of those games had me wanted to send the playstation out the window but yet, thats half the fun.Basicly you play differn't family members of an old man in which you must return home early for his special day. You then go through silly games like parapa the rapper (the actual hitting the buttons at the right time) and running from a ball like on Indiana Jones.I give the game 4 stars for its music and humor, but not five stars only because the game is brutally hard and I still haven't found out how to save."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying!!!!","review":"A friend of mine has this game. i found it really annoying and frustrating.

A poignant, playful, perfect love theme, brilliant action music unlike anything else I've heard and the added bonus of the music from the finale which was cut after the film did badly with test audiences. (Of course, the fact that Elizabeth Shue died halfway through the original version might have had something to do with the average viewer not liking it) Without this ending, the film never seemed to conclude musically, hear Mr. Revell's fantastic music here and see how it would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe it's out of production!","review":"I bought this about 6 years ago when the movie first came out. Had to wait for the score to enter the scene, not the soundtrack that so many clerks mistakenly assumed I was seeking.

Great standalone, or companion piece to the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"This is one of the best scores of the last few years. Even though the film sucked, big time, Revell was inspired to write one of his best works (alongside The Crow).

This is not opinion, just fact. The arrangements here are not very good. She sounds great but the cheesy arrangements destroy any chance to salvage more than one or two of these - songs?

Their talents blend effortlessly and there's a definite artistic chemistry between these two. Nearly every track is a stunner: \\"Back In Your Own Backyard\\" and \\"Got You On My Mind\\" swing like a lazy afternoon in a hammock. Francophiles will love how \\"J'ai Duex Amours\\" segues into \\"Flambee Mantalbanese\\" - and having Carly Simon 'guest voice' on \\"Shoulda Known\\" just adds to the treat - but \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" is a near-poetic masterpiece which moves me to tears every time I hear it.

Today's ritual differs by jurisdiction. Most researchers are interested in very old ritual which was never written. This text represents somebody's rendering of some recent past interpretation. Masonically, it is of limited value. The secret of Freemasonry is ineffable. The ritual is designed to make a man think and find the meaning for himself. Read this and know nothing, but have it cause you to seek further light, then you will have something. This is the purpose of the ritual. Do not get hung up in \\"discovering\\" Masonry's secret.

At a time when most Masonic publishers are going to paperback, this hardcover edition is not only pleasing to the eye and a welcome addition to any Masonic library, it is useful to those who are seeking more light and who might need a little extra help in memorizing the lectures and degree work. The only caveat is that the clue to the sanctum sanctorum is purposely witheld and some of the work for the Sublime Degree appears misleading. What is to be expected? The work is not an expose.

A great film with creative cinematography and decent acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.The plot line is too convoluted to explain in this review and to do so would spoil the story. The story is however quite creative and explores some rather complex psychological/philosophical premises as to the function of memory and relationships. Is the memory of a departed lover merely a nuisance to one's state of mind or is it a reminder about what our subconscious minds feel is best for us? Can we truly erase memories or do they stay with us one way or another no matter what we do. These are some of the themes the film seems to touch upon in its plot.This is an interesting film typical of Kaufmann's imagination found in other screenplays by him such as 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.' This is a fun film to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smart movie","review":"Very good make you think movie. Not the same old mindless movie.

Teaming with famed playwright Charlie Kaufman, Gondry delivers a genuine love story that links the emotionally distant Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) with the effervescent, free-spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet). Unbeknownst to them, they just ended a relationship with each other. But in their yearning to move on, they had their memories erased by a medical firm based in New York--well, Joel almost did...until he woke up during the procedure, turning his world into one of mental confusion and illogicality.Gondry is a visionary, and Eternal Sunshine is both his crowning work as an artist and one of the most innovative, audacious comedies of the last decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt story","review":"This is a beautiful movie with great characters, great acting and a great cast.

This is a great date movie too because men really like to watch it. It is definitely one that you need to watch more then once to truly understand it and value it. Highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"visual splendor; hazy story","review":"visually very impressive and thoroughly captivating. At times stirring and very moving performances. Somewhat interesting and thought-provoking, but maddening story-line that almost left me with a headache: (scenes like the two young lovers dancing atop his body while he is undergoing \\"the procedure\\" truly required a massive stretch of the imagination - despite the joy of seeing Kirsten in action!)Definitely requires a suspension of belief and a real open-mindedness to visionary cinema. It's a unique film that's worth a look, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put","review":"I thought that it was one of the best films released in awhile. I give credit to Jim Carrey for once again stepping out of the quirky face rear-end talking roles. For those who can not look beyond the simple love story of the movie I pitty you. There is not be a cliche that can be attatched to this movie. Some would say this is a simple \\"its better to have loved and lost....blah blah blah\\" but to them I say look deeper.

On a side note MR Money Bags... can the attitude, if this was SUCH a HORRIBLE movie then please let the rest of us know what you would consider a masterpiece of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with everything","review":"When I saw this movie in the theater, it made me cry AND laugh. The writing was genius - a love story told in reverse, from the disasterous ending to the hopeful, cautious beginning. When you watch this movie, it reminds you of your own disaster-ending relationships - who hasn't ended a relationship at some point on such bad terms, that you can no longer remember any of the reasons you fell in love with the person in the first place? Gondry and Kaufman have done an amazing job, making a unique movie that forces you to think AND enjoy the visuals. This is not a movie that you're going to enjoy if you prefer to just stare at the screen, and expect the movie to explain things the way they would a 5-year old. The best movie of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"a twisted, odd film","review":"i really don't know what to say about this movie. it blew me away.i've had mixed feelings about the director (i liked being john...however you spell it, quite a bit, but i didn't care for adaptation at all).he's back on my good side.some very strange things happen in this movie, and unlike adaptation, you don't have to watch it like you're reading a research article to understand it.pick it up and be weirded out."},{"rating":"2","title":"love, love, love this movie","review":"I want it the day it comes out.

Jim Carrey is wonderful in the lead role. And Kate Winslet is also really good in it.The story itself is very interesting, but somewhat complicated.Its kind of a Science-Fiction-Love Story.

But still very enjoyable.And the acting performances are outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT - I'll never get tired of it.","review":"This movie is brilliantly made. The cinematography is truly beautiful, and the story is extraordinarily original.Watch it over and over to discover details such as the color of her hair as a mechanism keeping track of time.My favorite thing about this movie is that it portrays realistically (unlike so much media) that love is not perfect happily ever after.Way to go to Jim Carrey for proving that he can make quality movies with complicated parts... beyond just The Truman Show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, crazy, romantic","review":"Guys, you seriously should see this one! I don't know if it's for everyone to buy, but definitely at least go out and rent it. Crazy special effects and story around a basic love story.

IT IS WORTH IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top Ten Films of 2004","review":"What a fantastic film. I was so surprised at the emotion the Jim Carrey draws from you during this film. The story revolves are Carrey's character going through a mind erasure of his ex-girlfriend. During the process, he regrets his decision and attempts to stop the process. Unfortunately, he is asleep for the whole thing and cannot wake himself up. What ensues is a very touching attempt by Carrey to save his memories by stowing them away in places where they don't belong (like his childhood). The screenplay is by Charlie Kauffman, and he delivers his usual quirky high quality tale. The story is beautifully told and the actors portray their characters with such realism that you really get taken for an emotional ride.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films that are considered good for their writing and acting, not for big budget and effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insansely Creative and Original","review":"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If for nothing else watch this movie to see Jim Carey in a totally different element. We have seen him before in a few serious roles films such as Man on the Moon and The Majestic but this one trully shows what he can do as a great actor of not only comedy but a wide spectrum of genres.He is paired wonderfully with Kate Winslet as the free spireted moody girl who longs for someone to belong with. This is trully a heartwarming story that makes one think if we went through the procedure described in the film, would we really be more happy? A lot of pain is described and even felt when the characters decide to undertake the procedure and i think that this is the movies strong point, that audiences relate to the characters profoundly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","review":"There are no words for how this movie left me feeling. I loved it. It was romantic, and touching and thought provoking. At first I went to see it because I heard Elijah Wood was in it, but Jim Carrey was just heartbreakingly wonderful. I know most people like him in his more crazy roles, but I like him in these sort of 'quiet' more serious films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy.....","review":"I should have been notified that the parts to hold the DVD in place were broken, so from the time it left you to the time I received it, the movie was rattling around in its case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brilliant Kauffman Flick!","review":"If you thought that Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Human Nature were all just luck, maybe this one will prove you wrong. Following up his best commercially successful film to date, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine does not disappoint. Besides a brilliant plot and storyline, Kauffman and Gondry team up to provide another truly original film with creative editing, shots, and casting. Jim Carrey once again proves that he can hold his own in dramatic roles, and Kate Winslett provides a perfect counter balance. They don't dress her up too pretty and she pulls off being a 'normal' girl (better than Diaz in Being John). I don't really think that Kirsten Dunst's role was necessary at all but who am I to argue with Kauffman. Anyhow... Overall, one of the best movies I have seen since Adaptation and it is a must see. My friends and I were talking about it for hours after, and I still can't stop thinking about it... I will be until I see it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bland execution of old concept","review":"What would it be like to have one's memories erased? Hasn't this concept been beaten to death by at least a dozen films in recent years? This flick is dull, dark, and often stupid (see Kirsten Dunst's role for illustration). Carrey's talents are not suited for a serious movie, and I kept expecting him to just start making those silly faces that propelled him to stardom. He did reach a new level in his abilities to annoy the heck out of me.Kate Winslet is the only saving grace here. How does she manage to make something out of this largely thankless role is a mystery. The point is that she does -- she's very convincing and interesting to watch. Therefore, I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring","review":"I saw Jim Carrey on the cover, so I assumed it was good. I was wrong. Sooooo boring.

We love you Jim, but only in comedies! He's a great actor but it's almost as if he's trying way too hard. I have to give him credit for effort, most people can't play the lead in Me, Myself, and Irene and be able to do this movie.This flick was just plain odd. I found it similar to the recent Adam Sandler drama movie-the one with the dramatic color effects.

Their acting is indeed very strong, but I don't see anything diserving Oscar here, especally for Jim Carrey. If you are looking for the Oscar for the best male performance watch Tom Hanks in \\"The Terminal\\".Story of the \\"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind\\" is very unique and till the last minutes of the movie you don't know what is happening.

What a disappointment! I watched in growing boredom as the repetitious images, present and past, rolled past in slow motion. A few attempts at humour were feeble and silly. What about dialogue? Can no screen writer write good dialogue anymore? Are subtle stares and maudlin looks supposed to supplant carefully crafted words and is shrill, combatitive and nonsensical communication the norm in film today? I only wish when I attend a lousy film that wastes acting talent that I could get a refund when I leave the theater and the overpriced popcorn behind.

I then tried to keep watching, couldn't, and skipped ahead to the end. Bottom line: I did NOT like it. I didn't find it entertaining, interesting, funny and the least bit feasible. The acting was fine. In fact, I think this is the first movie I actually liked Jim Carrey in, but what a waste of my time. There was NOTHING about it I liked, except maybe seeing Mark Ruffalo in his underwear. I find it funny that people are so hostile if you say that you didn't like it.

Carrey gives the performance of his life, and Winslet is utterly believable, beautiful, and paradoxically earthy and flighty. But curiously it is Dunst in her supporting role who makes the point we all will remember, and Ruffalo who allows her to do it in one brief moment of lowering his head and walking away.I simply couldn't recommend this film more highly for anyone who loves or dreams of love--i.e., everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time!

When Joal's spontaneous girlfriend decides to specifically erase memories of him after a break up, she sets off a whacky chain of events. Though science thinks it's found a way to erase painful memories, the couple discovers that maybe memories are best left alone, even if they're bad. Though the film is a drama, there is some humor thrown in. A great watch for those looking for something 'different'.Chrissy K.

Have you noticed how all stories of love are about fighting to overcome something in order to come together? Here the two lovers are fighting to retain such a basic good: their own memories. Disillusioned, as lovers often are, they had tried to blot out all memories and thoughts about each other and find out that the good ones are far more valuable than the bad ones. Here the love story is a fight for self-transcendence. As all love story ultimately is.But there is something more. When he, desperate to hold on to her, thinks of her she is actively there giving him ideas and pushing him on. So is she really there or not? What reality consists of is maybe the most fundamental question there is, and I think this movie as well as the great movie \\"Solaris\\" by Andrei Tarkovsky make you think about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"People hardly ever see funny man Jim Carrey in a serious movie- but his performance in this creative movie is superb! Not only his performance but the cast of Kate Winslet and many other great actor/actresses proves perfect and beautiful in a movie such as this.This is the story of a man whose girlfriend was so much in love, that upon the completion of their relationship opts to get her memory of him erased. He soon discovers this proceedure and does the same thing. However, once the process has began, he has a change of heart and although the memories are disappearing one by one, he is fighting for just one more moment with the woman he loves.There are a few subplots on the side that are equally as great and dramatic that builds up for an exciting yet glorious ending. Hardly ever does a movie really make you feel good when its over, Eternal Sunshine accomplishes just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Never in my life did I think anyone could accurately capture the things that go on in our heads. Now it has been done! I was moved to tears by this movie and continue to be every time I watch it. At first you are thinking, \\"This is strange. I'm not sure what's happening here.\\" Before you realize it, you are reminded of your own memories and dreams.Of course, this is from the point of view of a man, but it is absolutely on the mark. You don't have to have the same memories as the characters in the film to feel the connection. It is so rare for a filmmaker/screenwriter to create characters and images that are so real. Jim Carrey is phenomenal as 'everyman'. I have never seen a better performance from him. Every nuance in this movie is realistic, even the surreal!The special effects, done in-camera (the old-fashioned way), are mind-blowing. This movie deserved several Academy Awards.I rank it in my top 5 of all time, and there hasn't been one of those since 1992 (Until the End of the World)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful film","review":"i am a huge fan of Eternal Sunshine's writter, Charlie Kaufman. he has a mind unlike any other. Even the most difficult and depressing parts of his scripts are combined with a great since of humor, which make the film bitter-sweet.in this film Charlie has been greater than in his other films, if it is at all possible.he combined his sarcasm and wittiness with a sensitive, beautiful, romance story. the result is an absolutly beautiful film. touching and brilliant. a must see movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a critics darling and hit movie on DVD but I couldn't stand this film and I really tried to understand why this film is so special. Kate Winslet's Oscar nominated performance is reason alone to watch this over-analytical comedy. Winslet is a fearless and unique actress, Jim Carrey and Mark Ruffalo are also good, I just wish Kristen Dunst wasn't in this, she's a one-trick pony! Eternal Sunshine... left me clouded and confused, pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thinking Romantic Dra-medy!","review":"Off the bat, I typically can only tolerate so much Jim Carrey. But I loved Adaptation, and the premise of this film, that one could, for a fee, erase painful relationship memories, and continue living as though a person never came into our lives, intrigued me. And this may be Jim Carrey's best role: it's more serious, but it also allows him just enough room to \\"be Jim.\\" By the end, you will really ask yourself three questions: 1) Given the chance, would you consider erasing someone from your memory? 2) Really? Remember: they're entirely gone. and 3) If you could go back in time, back to that moment where you first met this person, knowing in advance how the relationship would turn out, would you make the same choice you made the first time?Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest Charlie Kaufmann piece to enjoy","review":"I wasn't sure what to think the first time I saw Being John Malkovich, I didn't dislike it but I didn't like it either. It certainly kept me interested throughout as a concept, very very bizarre. I read Susan Orlean's The Orchid thief and was interested to see Adaptation which was equally bizarre but easier to get into. I didn't know what to think about Eternal Sunshine when I saw the previews but I knew I had to see it, and to this point in 2004 it is bar none my favorite movie. The plot line is intense and interesting througout never allowing you to feel comfortable until the credits start to roll. Extremely well acted and layed out, the cinematography is first rate. Characterization in this film is different from his other works because the majority of moviegoers can relate to the feelings and predicament Jim Carrey's character ends up in."},{"rating":"2","title":"..*wow*..","review":"Look, other reviews on here tell you what you need to know about the movie.. but, for me.. just going through what Joel has.. this movie left me speechless.

What if this kind of technology was real, would I have somebody or something erased, and if I did who or what would it be?Upon first viewing of this movie I thought it was a little drawn out and not as entertaining as I thought it would be, but as the days pass I find myself thinking about it and thinking about who or what I would erase and I find that I can't get this movie out of my head, and by that standard I find this to be a great movie.Definitely worth the watch, but don't expect the Jim Carrey of old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable pictures.","review":"I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a remarkable film because of the original story of Charlie Kaufman and the increasing talent of the young Michel Gondry.

It has a significant meaning to me. Its a good movie to watch if your just out of a long relationship. Jim carrey is great. He is far more than just a good comic actor. He is a great overall actor period. His dramatic performances are pretty over looked. he did great in this movie. I recommend this to pretty much everyone. its a movie you will want to watch more than once so you catch more of whats going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could this mark a new direction for romantic comedies?","review":"A romantic comedy that breaks away from the tired formula. Its worthwhile and I enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like was the scenes inside the apartment of Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) goofing off while Joel (Jim Carrey) lies unconcious on the bed - jumping around half naked on the bed and so forth. It felt forced. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give great performances while the others aren't on the same level."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever","review":"People always get excited when something \\"different\\" comes out in theatres. Anything that's \\"different\\" is always praised by the foolish movie going public. Eternal Sunshine is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen.

I figured with Jim Carey in it, it would be funny. What was the story line? What was happening during the movie? Who rated this a funny, romatic, movie? It was not funny or romantic. I never laughed once. I wish I had read a review about this movie, then I never would have bought it. I do not recommend this movie, save your money.

It was so boring and never made any sense at all. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't know why anyone likes this. It wasn't funny, and it wasn't interesting, and I found that my personality can be decieving and I'm sometimes like Joel Barish, even though I don't like this movie, {but I like the actors in other films}, but if you're like me, ESSM is not worth seeing more than once if you don't like movies that don't make any sense.

I could only get through about half of the movie before I shut it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sleeper (Snore)","review":"A sleeper in the sense that it made me doze off!!!What a waste of time. I only finished watching it because my son was watching it with me and he actually liked it!I thought it was pretentious, incoherent, and plodding. The so-called plot was ludicrous and contrived. It was way too strange for this viewer.I have taken to calling this movie \\"Eternally Mindless\\", which would seem to be a better title.Skip this stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"This movie is about two losers trying to find love and meaning in life between their loser lives. Obviously, a hopeless cause. I have never seen a worse, more stupid movie in my life. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and time...","review":"This movie is sooo not worh it. While Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both gave decent performances my question is why they wasted their talent on a movie like this. The storyline kept going back and forth between reality and memories so much so that you couldn't tell which was which. At times you didn't know what was going on at all. All of this craziness doesn't allow the viewer to get involved with the so-called love story going on between the leading actors. I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am surprised, actually shocked, by the amount of good ratings on amazon.com it has recieved. It was hard to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I can't believe I watched the whole thing. Tasteless, pathetic, boring nonsense. Cartoonish bohemian characters. It is not funny or romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison to the Truman Show","review":"This movie starts out kinda slow and boring. So stick with it if you want it to make sense. It gets better, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.The movie is too serious to be very funny, and too silly to be taken seriously. The story starts in the middle and catches back up with itself in a somewhat unique way, but that's probably the most interesting part. If you like movies that feature loose sexual morality, then you might enjoy it, but it's really a slow paced movie.Eternal Sunshine replaces The Cable Guy as my least favorite Jim Carey movie. I really think Carey is a great actor, but I thought he was too old for this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overated","review":"I found this movie offensive, only occasionally funny, and not just a little bit depressing. Perhaps I'm too far removed from the zeitgeist to appreciate the emotional ties, the current \\"language of love,\\" and the easy jump in/jump out of relationships among modern couples. In years past, the young would extend more courtliness to whores than these people extend to each other. I thought this movie stunk. It's a shame too, since Jim Carrey, one of those \\"Look at me, how outrageous I am\\" clowns, acts almost human herein. And he does it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading list of extras","review":"I got the DVD and now bought the Blu-ray. That is a waste - there is no extra on the Blu-ray. When is Amazon going to give us the real list of extras on Blu-ray instead of recycling the DVD material? Surely, Amazon can afford to let us have just that one section to list down what is in the Blu-ray. Well, I am not guessing any more and I am not buying any more Blu-ray from Amazon to upgrade from DVD until I am sure of what is in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I NEED A REFUND","review":"I love this movie, I've seen it before, it's one of my favorites but the DVD I bought is for Region 2 (NOT US) could have make it a little more clear that this won't play in my DVD player.

Then along came \\"The Truman Show\\", a really good drama. Next came \\"The Majestic\\", which was even better. Now it is \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", a truly GREAT movie, with fantastic performances by the entire cast.

It took a while to get into the entire plot, since there are many things which I notice each time I go back, that I hadn't noticed before.this movie captures that weird \\"you and me\\" feeling of being unsure in love, and deciding to just leap into it. It's very touching in many places.This is the movie which makes Jim Carrey into a \\"real\\" actor, not the Truman Show. Kate Winslet continues to portray the zeitgeist of womanly roles that makes her so dynamic.One thing which I tire of is the office hijinks of the Lacuna people..the subplot regarding the doctor and someone else doesn't really retain it's humor or punch under repeated viewings, although the plot demands repeated viewings.Typical Kaufman: mostly pitch perfect, but slightly off. but still daring and fresh.I don't own a DVD player but I am going to buy one now, so that I can buy this movie and watch it when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost fell asleep","review":"Jim Carrey needs to stay from these weird, serious movies. They are all bad, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the worst yet. Clementine (Winslet) eraces Joel (Carrey)from her memory. To get even joel eraces her from his memory. They meet, don't know each other, and fall in love all over again. I think the point was love is love no matter what, but is was a really weird way of comeing to that point. Not only was it weird, it was boring. I almost fell asleep. I felt like I was watching a movie making experiment. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad stuff","review":"This movie is pretty bad.

This is not true at all. Men and women and especially men are interested in basically one thing and that one thing is sex. Once the sex gets boring people move on. That is why there are so many break ups and divorces. We need to make more realistic movies that investigate sex and sexuality. This movie was crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I would honestly give this negative five stars if I could. It had the promise of a great story line, but I don't feel that it did anywhere near where it could have. Neither did the rest of the audience in the theatre.

Maybe I'm not artsey fartsey enough but I just didn't get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a fantastic movie if you're easily manipulated.","review":"This movie has a particularly insidious gimmick that fools over-sentimental fobs who are easily manipulated by memories of love lost into breathing some wistful sighs and thinking they've seen a great movie when its their own memories they're in love with. How ironic.Most reviewers will try and pretend this is a great movie using the most pretentious lexicon available to film students, but this isn't a great movie. It plods and stutters and stammers and doesn't take a single turn that any thinking person can't anticipate well in advance. It really doesn't make us think about anything we don't already know. Love can be painful but it's ultimately rewarding? My oh my! Well stop the presses, I've never heard that one before!The acting isn't good. Kate Winslet made her fame screeching in Titanic, and Jim Carrey made a name for himself due to his asanine rubber-faced mugging. There's no acting here. There's an ideal, but no acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This was the worse movie that I have ever seen. It's pretty bad when you have to shut the movie off 30 minutes into it.

Unfortunately, by the time these scenes were shown I was sick and tired of the various characters. They were whiney, boring, combative, and very profane.(The R rating is well deserved). At times I felt I would have very pleased if the entire cast(almost) had been rolled by a beer truck--at least then the misery I was feeling at having to watch these neurotic n'er-do-wells would be over. It didn't happen and some masochistic urge forced me to watch to the end.To be fair, there was one enjoyable area. The tenacity and will of the Jim Carrey character in refusing to let go of the memory of the Kate Winslet character, along with some nice special effects as this played out. Also, the ending would have been very compelling--if only I could have cared! I didn't.This should have been an excellent movie, but wasn't.

It has an interesting premise that I won't give away in case you haven't already heard. (The scene where all the patients are in the waiting room clutching onto their stuff was one of the funniest in the movie.) This movie is one that rapidly transitions back and forth in time. Kate Winslet's hair color was used as a clever way to help keep track of where we were in time, but for me it wasn't enough. That lack of orientation together with the rapid time shifts made me feel almost motion sick at times. It takes a huge amount of acting talent to play a depressed personality and be engaging. Jim Carrey who has an incredible range of emotion and facial expressions in his comedic roles was flat here. Pretty much the one look. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddening but mezmerizing","review":"This movie is not for the sequentially minded. The story line is more scrambled than a three egg omlette. And that's what keeps it suspenseful and intriguing right up to the end. For the mainstream movie goer, it may be a bit \\"artsy\\" with it's sudden change-ups and hard cuts. But the movie takes a risk and there's not a lot of studios willing to do that.

I'm a very curious guy so when I was told there is something so insanely mesmerising about this film, I saw it again and even after watching it twice, I failed to feel it. This film is self conscious, stuckup, morally confused and pretty badly edited. I found two scenes in this film which tried to be very thunderous but failed miserably at evoking any sort of amusement or \\"whoa\\" out of me, except the original intented intent.I did not sleep during this film. It isnt the worst film I have ever seen. I'd still give it a four.All this is my opinion. Try not to knock on me.Do I hate it?

He played very nice and should play such kind of guys continuously in the future, I thought.

For those of you who are jaded by the typical blockbuster film with expensive special effects and cliche one-liners, this is the movie for you. It's funny,creative, and philosophical. You leave the movie thinking about life and the purpose of love.It's defintely a romantic film, but not overwhelmingly so. I am not usually a fan of cheesy romance films, but this one isn't like your Drew Barrymore/Ben Affleck type cheesy films. Its a movie that makes you wonder about every relationship you've ever had. And Jim Carry does an amazing job of portraying his character. He's come a long way since the Mask..I think he could be the Tom Hanks of this generation.However, if you are the type of person who enjoys movies like The Wedding PLanner or Gigli, and every Will Smith end-of-the-world catastrophe summer movie, then this is not the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So well done.","review":"The thought that went into the script is unbelieveable.

No, the real surprise is how sweet and touching is the love story that emerges through all of the imaginative convolutions.With, perhaps, Jim Carrey's most sincere and accomplished \\"straight\\" acting job, matched in full by a fine performance by Kate Winslet, we finally get beyond adroit inventiveness in a Charlie Kauffman script, and get down to some real heart: very touching and ringing true.Well done in all departments, it is the bittersweet longing for love in the eyes and actions of the leads that brings this film home. 4-1/2 stars.

The language was more in tune with a woman from the 20th century. It was almost offensive. No woman from this time period would dress, or act in the way they did. Mrs. St George was ..well, just awful, just so overdone I don't know why they bothered to include her in the cast, except to put down women. If you look at the movie as a broad, overdone soap opera, well I guess they made the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Masterpiece series","review":"The Buccaneers was a BBC mini-series I had seen and greatly enjoyed in 1995. It is the story of four American girls who dream of love with high-society English men. Their happiness is short-lived. The story is very interesting. I was really glad to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Beware. If you are looking for the wholesomeness of Wives and Daughters and Pride and Prejudice, this is not it. There is a scene where a woman finds her husband in bed with a man (his lover). Definitely not family-oriented material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Beautiful scenery and costuming, but the underlying theme throughout the movie is what I consider \\"smutty\\" - with adultery in various forms, including homosexuality. I like to watch period movies to get away from the things of today's world... I threw this one in the trash can - literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing content and quality","review":"I believe this DVD is a digitized version of a 1995 film. I haven't seen the original video production but the DVD version had contrast problems and the quality of the image was poor throughout.I was fully prepared to ignore the visual issues with this otherwise sumpteous production except that the story line was a deep disappointment. I've read many other Edith Wharton novels and found them subtle, detailed, and melancholic. I was expecting something similar here but found the plot developed like a bad soap opera and ended in a truly modern and shallow manner. The historic background to this period - fascintating in itself - was sometimes referred to but usually under-developed and the characters were rarely truly fleshed out properly. Since this is an unfinished novel, I would have expected the screen writer would have found a more appropriate end to Annabelle's story rather than callow infidelity.I love BBC drama but this one went straight in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Being a fan of most BBC drama productions in general, I was disappointed with this mini-series. The dialogue was cleverly written, the plot was interesting, and the actors were all very convincing, but I was expecting either the light hearted type of wit like that of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", or a romantic drama like \\"North and South.\\" \\"The Buccaneers\\" was indeed a hardcore drama, but focused on the unhappy relationships of all the characters, and the consequences of their decisions in marriage and elsewhere, with little or no redemption. The film was extremely well made, and the performances were solid, but fans of fairy tale romances and happy endings may find it a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgusting disappointment","review":"I thought this would be one of those wonderful BBC movies like Wives and Daughters, but what a disappointment! The first two episodes weren't that bad, but when I got to the third one I had to stop watching it because of a very disgusting sex scene. Definetly not family friendly or anyone friendly for that matter. I would definetly not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No happily ever after","review":"This was one of the most depressing movies I have ever watched. It doesn't have a happy ending like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". This is not a family friendly movie either. One of the characters finding her husband in bed with another man and being \\"raped by her husband\\". If you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good at the end do not watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one if possible this was soap opera in period clothes","review":"What a waste of money. If you put modern costumes on some of these actors, you would have a modern day soap opera. After watching Cranford, Sense and Sensibilities and North and South, this movie was a total disappointment. Supposed women of class drinking whiskey from flasks, smoking and a newly wed woman already in search of a rich man to have an affair with was not what I expected from a period drama. Add the syphillis of one husband and the homosexuality of another and you are projected right into today, minus the costumes of yesteryear. Not a movie you would enjoy watching with your daughter, grandaughter (or even your husband, for that matter), it's right up there with Another World. They've also managed to throw in a few profanities and rape scenes for an already piece of trite work.Total waste of money, in my opinion.Don't waste your money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover Appears Promising, But No Substance.","review":"This film's attractive cover is deceptive, as this film is completely disappointing. Without the class of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"North & South\\", or \\" Wives & Daughters\\", and without adventure.Portrays older adults as immoral or stupid. Therefore, may be entertaining to the MTV generation, for all the wrong reasons. Emptiness in the like of: \\"Troy\\", \\"Tristan and Isolde\\", \\"Tess\\", and \\"Sex in the City\\". None of the values of the period; without good story, without values, without admirable characters, without true romance, without heart, without mind, that is not even mindlessly entertaining.For anyone with depth this is painful to watch. Hit yourself in the head with a broom handle for the same experience and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victorian England From The Point of View of an American Feminist","review":"This is a good example of how any book can become recreated in the tawdry image of modern liberal America.Worse still, this adaptation actually seems to attempt to make heroines out of brainless young women who come to England with their boobs almost hanging out of their dresses, giggling about everything, taking nothing seriously, in love with, and toying with, the idea of becoming aristocrats but intensely chauvinistic about their superior American-ness.They become upset when the stupid decisions, of all but one of them, to marry, culturally and in every conceivable way, unsuitable partners and, like today's American women, of course it is everyone's fault but their own when things go awry.I noted with interest the way the adaptation changed a great deal of the novel to achieve this transformation makes it worthless as an instructive tale, and just another mindless liberal television drama which, at ten a penny, would be overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...read the book if you really want to enjoy the \\"Buccaneers\\"!","review":"I had high hopes for this DVD. I should have thought twice about it. Even though the price is right the movie is very low quality. The acting is very poor. Where did they find these people??? Oh yeah...that's right where did they find them...except for a few I have never seen any of them before or since! The actress who played the mother of the lead was a nightmare! Really except for Mira Sorvino and Greg Wise the rest were B-actors at best, and you hardly see them in the stupid production!I think the problem was that it was low budgeted and hastily made. It sure seemed so to me. For a BBC production I sure would have expected much better.Rent, borrow or just read the book! Don't buy this one, you won't watch it a 2nd time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited and waited","review":"I waited and waited, even after the last possible date and have still to get the product. very saddened and disappointed because i was going to show it to a group of girls i tutored after we read the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"the buccaneers","review":"I loved it!!! This is a beautifully made BBC series. Top notch all the way. The actors and scenery are perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"The plot synopsis didn't begin to describe all the immorality this film contains. Virtue is completely absent in the majority of the characters. The viewer gains nothing from this film save how not to live. The reviews I read emphasized the beautiful costumes and superb acting; granted, that is true. What good does all that do if the film is replete with illicit relationships, foul language, women that behaved so unladylike, men without self-control, and nitwit parents that didn't care in what their adult children were involved. To tell you how disappointed I was, I threw the DVD in the trash. As far as I am concerned, no one, ever need watch this film. I had to rate it one star because there was not an option to give it zero stars; I would have given it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! DO NOT WATCH!","review":"Very sleazy undertone. I turned it off within the first few minutes. Couldn't bear to watch great actresses so horribly degraded. NOT LIKE JANE AUSTEN! Not the good Jane Austen films anyway (there were a few movies equally bad... namely 1999 Mansfield Park and modern Northanger Abbey). Time better spent elsewhere. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"torture, spinless little wimps..save yourself the 8 hrs...","review":"Save yourself the 20 bucks and freakin 8 hours..The women are not likeable, they are spinless wimps. Instead try North and South, Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, just skip this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Buccaneers","review":"If you love historical romance, you'll like this movie. It's about several naive young girls coming out and the problems they encounter on their quest for love. The story follows them and their relationships as they grow into young women and settle into the lives they've chose."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so interesting.","review":"Beautiful costumes but the story is not to my liking. The situations on the movie is realistic, it's like watching a true to life gossip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austin-Gaskell-esque","review":"I enjoyed the story. Parts were a tad cheesy such as the intro narration, the scene where two characters run off to a wheat field together, & the intro was a little slow but after the first episode I felt hooked. If you enjoy Jane Austin & Elizabeth Gaskell you should watch this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this!","review":"I had seen this and recorded it many years ago on VHS, so I was so glad to see it in DVD form for such a good price! I loved the characters and the costumes so much! Even my husband watched this with me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing....and well depressing","review":"I usually am a fan of period pieces, but this movie is so depressing. It makes you never want to be a Duchess for sure. It was long and depressing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Buccaneers lacks substance","review":"I was disappointed in \\"The Buccanners.\\" I expected a higher quality production. Because I have not read the book I cannot vouch for accuracy of plot. I found the series hard to watch and finish. The story makes the American rich look empty and shallow. Not to the quality of a Master Piece Theater Production. I wish the USA had something to compare to the BBC productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Buccaneers","review":"I found this mini series to be boring. I didn't finish all of it because it was torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I saw this year","review":"This is soap opera trash.

The era is timeless and romantic, the costumes stunning. The characters are played well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me down","review":"I was suckered in by the characters, the costumes and the story line until the end where I was left flat and confused by the unexciting conclusion. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Jane Austen kind of film","review":"If you enjoy the kind of period pieces with happy endings, high morals, and the heroine and other principal characters emerging mostly unscathed at the end of the narrative, this is not the film for you. I only wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this film but I didn't want to spoil the movie before seeing it. In my opinion the movie spoiled itself. I stopped in the middle, read the reviews and now plan to get rid of it. I was surprised by some of the movie's content which without a rating I was completely caught off-guard by. The movie would probably be rated at least PG-13 in America. Some might feel this movie only accurately reflects life and its many compromises and disappointments but, whatever the case, this film's take on life was not to my liking and I did not enjoy it, definitely not an upbuilding film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Buccaneers","review":"Years ago I had seen The Buccaneers on PBS. I had forgotten a lot about it, and it was a lot of fun watching the adventures of these American girls in Enbland. There are amusing scenes, happy scenes and very sad events which for me, completes the requirements for a good movie. I recommend The Buccaneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"History at its best","review":"The Buccaneers shows what society was like and how people wanted to be accepted out of the sphere to which they were born. This period piece goes behind the facade to show what sacrifices girls would go to - just to make a brilliant marriage. Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Meal or Snack!","review":"If you like protein bars with good flavor and substance, you might wish to try these!

Thank you Nada Surf for being here showing your feelings that could be ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"Bought this album 2 weeks ago and haven't listened to anything but this and Let Go.

The best unknown band around, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous","review":"There is really no word to describe this cd's excellence, so I chose fantabulous, as in fanstastic and fabulous. I admit I had only known Nada Surf from \\"popular\\" and didn't really like it, but recently my friend had played this cd and I can't get enough of it. If you are even wasting your time reading this review, you obviously have some interest in Nada Surf, so I say to you sir: stop wasting your time and get out your wallet. The only problem is finding the damn album at stores, NO ONE here in colorado seems to have it. Thank god for amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nada Surf is ba-ack!","review":"I could not understand why this cd was not release in the us...and now that I know it, i realize what a great injustice this is.

A bit in the style of weezer this is a cd that will not leave your car stereo for many days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nada Surf does it again","review":"This album is great, it may even be better than their first. i have a hard time believing that it is only now being released in the states. They definitely should not be considered a one hit wonder (Popular). If radio people had any brains they would play '80 windows' now, it is an amazing tune, better than anything Pearl Jam or the Smashing Pumpkins have done recently. If you like rock and roll go get this cd now! The best songs on this great album are: 1. Hyperspace 2. Amateur 3. Why Are You So Mean To Me 6. 80 Windows 13. Robot"},{"rating":"2","title":"the most underated band of the 90s","review":"Nada Surf scored a hit a few years back with popular on the CD high/low, most people never journeyed deeper into the CD, it was filled with wit, charm and charsima that few bands today have. The album was a master piece, well Nada Surf have done it again, The Proximity Effect is fantasic, the only song that seems to be lacking is \\"why are you so mean to me?\\" witch is a cover tune. If you dont buy this album, your braindead, it kicks ASS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The datedness effect","review":"2 1/2While not as generic as their debut, ironically even that album had a little more energy in places. The songwriting is a mild step up from the standardized alterna-pop melodies of Hi/Lo, but far less than initially remembered; unlike Nada Surf's following refinement in Let Go, the vast majority of PE won't stand any test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hit wonders mature into SOLID MODERN ROCK GODS.","review":"From the unbridled R&R energy of the album opener \\"hyperspace\\" to the beautiful recipe of dramatics, attitude, and joy that define The Proximity Effect, Nada Surf's second album is light years ahead of their debut High/Low. Whereas their were a handful of quality tunes on High/Low, each and every track on the Proximity Effect has something simply amazing to offer today's discerning rock fan. Pick this album up at all costs. [p.s. I'm aware that all are entitled to their own opinion; however, I can't concieve the disconnected nature of the mind who wrote AMAZON's obnoxiously misrepresentative review. Don't let it influence you!]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Album of 2000","review":"I must confess that i wasn't too impressed with Nada Surf's first album, High/Low, but this second one really impressed me. The rocking songs, are more rocking, and the quiet songs are more melodic, well the entire album is melodic. I would have to say this is the second best album of 2000, next to Radiohead's Kid A (amazing album by the way). Every song is great. Pick it up! I took the risk and it was well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story on this album coming out is pretty crazy","review":"The record company didn't want to release it in 1998 due to the fact that they didn't think it had a single. Therefore they wanted Nada Surf to promote the album with some cover songs and even to do a new version of popular (WTF?) The album did have at least a couple of songs that could have been singles. I think Mother's Day would have been a good follow up to popular. Dispossession would be equally as good of a choice. I can't figure out why the label wanted to put those covers on the album Nada Surf has never really been good at covers. In 2000 the album was released with the covers gone and two origionals in it's place. It was good that the band stood their ground and never gave in to what the record company wanted. Instead of trying to chase after chart success they would focus on writing probably the best album of the decade with their next record."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album has it All","review":"The Proximity Effect was the soundtrack to my freshmen year in college and has remained in my music rotation since then. As the title suggests, this is an one of the best \\"complete, cohesive\\" albums I've listened to. From driving rock (Hyperspace, Firecracker, Slow Down) to the introspective (Troublemaker, 80 Windows) to sublime songs that arrest you on the first listen (Bacardi, Spooky, Robot). It will make you shake you a**, bob your head and most of all sing along with a smile on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"I think the book was really boring.

It is their passion to preserve and conserve that comes through and it is infectious. The book inspires the reader to analyse their relationship to place and modes of behaviour driven by place. The antithesis of economic consumption exists in all of us, however repressed. Bill brings it to the fore.

Joanna Ampil made a pretty good kim, but i must say that Lea Salonga is the best. The engineer and ellen were also both portrayed very well. i thought peter cousens really didn't fit the part of chris though (not necessarily a bad singer, but he just doesnt make a good chris). i've seen several chris's perform in real life that were 10 times better than him. simon bowman even played the part better. overall the cd isn't horrible because it is Miss saigon, but but definetly not as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete is good!","review":"I love this CD. I've never seen this show in New York, but I just bought the CD on a whim, knowing it was by the same composers as \\"Les Miserables\\" which is probably the best show ever written for the theater. The recording I have of \\"Les Mis\\" is the complete symphonic recording, and I loved it, despite the complaints in the reviews that Valjean was disgusting...I figured I'd try out the complete version of Miss Saigon. I don't know who the characters are yet, because I haven't been listening very closely, but the music really flows. It's great for background music for working on the computer...which is what I'm using it for now. Someone said the character Chris is hideous on this CD, and at times, I agree, but overall, I think he's great. Hinton Battle is great, and Joanna Ampil is good. She sings with great emotion.

Now, I guess I have to believe the reviews next time. Joanna's \\"innocent\\" and beautiful voice is comparable to and at times better than Lea Salonga's. But her duets with Chris and John are terribly executed. Chris and John's voices are not \\"miscible\\" with hers. They are \\"shouting\\" rather than singing, specially the Engineer, very irritating squeaky voice. While listening in disbelief, I suddenly utter that \\"I could sing better than this guys\\". IMHO, the only good thing about the CD is the included libretto and listening to it reminded me of the live show I saw in the Philippines featuring Lea Salonga and Cez Campos.

Get the OLC, it's a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't rate any MS CD lower than 4 but...","review":"If you are just buying your first Miss Saigon CD, buy the OLC. This is a Miss Saigon serious fan purchase only. Joanna Ampil is fine in the role of Kim, she has a lovely voice. Peter Cousens is the absolute worst Chris I've ever heard. I'm not sure the producers listened to him sing before they included him in the cast. Kevin Gray is not a very good engineer either. He doesn't give the character the \\"scummy yet best friend\\" characteristics The Engineer should portray. Overall, they could have done a much better selection in the cast.

Musically, however, Peter Cousens is every bit as unpreposessing as he was live: if only the recording had opted for the magnificent CoCoy Laurel, whose energy, talent and drop-dead brilliance endeared him to audiences as the Engineer in Sydney! Joanna Ampil, compelling as Kim, however, redeems the recording markedly.Ultimately, however, the CD sounds like it was recorded in a variety of bathrooms around the world and edited together: there is very little interraction between the cast, or a cohesiveness about the piece - which is sad given its scope and power to move, as demonstrated by the London Cast Recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"1989 London Cast is much better that this CD","review":"Lea Solonga will always be Miss Saigon.

Gosh! its like they recite a poem or a declamation or what? Its not melodic, I dont wanna be respectable to these people but to be honest, its not worth buying.

For others it probably is a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soy free?","review":"The ad for these CoQ10 softgels specifically says that they are soy free, which is why I putchased them. Unfortunately, it was only after getting them, opening them that I read the label which says they have soy as an ingredient. For someone who cannot have soy, this was a true eye opener. Never, ever go by what you read about a product listed on Amazon. Make sure to check the label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, this book droned On and On and On...","review":"Whether it was the un inspiringly one-dimensional characters; the many boring mundane pages I gritted my teeth to get through; the mirror-mirror-on-the-wall theme I at first thought was clever but grew very tired of; the romance that came about so late in the book that I was indifferent to it; the same old, same old storyline back at castle MacKeltar (enough already! give us something fresh and new!); the weak barely there villain; the rushed bland ending; or the mention of the next two possible books that are going to be the exact same as this one...I just could not wait for this one to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Read, absolutely stood up after reading al!","review":"I read this book first in the series and then read the rest of them. I'm a sucker for romance, for intelligence and for poignancy and this had them all. When you let yourself think about anybody surviving 1100 years in a mirror and then imagine some of the horror and then the agony of finally having his shot at revenge and yet at the same time being faced with the dream he'll never have...well, it's powerful hard to put down.LOVED Cian. I think that he and Adam and Adam's son were my absolute faves. The others were oh so close behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and light romance","review":"Got into this series because I was told it is better to read all of these first before I read the Fever series. This series is mostly a romance novel. Good books and story though. After you read these-read the fever series-not a romance series but just awesome reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunk of Mirror Mirror","review":"I liked this story that kept me reading till the end. I love it when the author brings back characters from past books in the series which makes it alot more interesting being that you know them from previous books. I can't wait for book 8 and 9 in this series. Great writting and reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought The Highlander's Touch, The Dark Highlander, Spell of the Highlander and The Immortal Highlander based on the reviews these books received. Each book had basically the same plot...like a Harlequin romance book. I think I'll read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series again...at least it had a lot more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy, Yummy Druid!!!","review":"Karen Marie Moning has given her readers another super YUMMY installment in her \\"Highland\\" series. You can read this book alone, but it has much deeper meaning if you read the previous books. Cian is a yummy, strong alpha male. Jessica is a strong, smart heroine. The perfect Druid mates. I could not put this book down. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"romance novel","review":"I really love this series, I admit, I have read these books many times. karen moning writes very well and keeps me captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SERIES EVER!","review":"This book is a great read. It is the 7th and last in the Highlander Series (although I hope KMM comes back to it again in the future!) It is linked to her Fever series (dreamfever, faefever etc) I couldnt put it down. Each one is just as good as the last, my favorite was the Dark Highlander (dageus McKeltar is just...*sigh*) I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good 'strong' love story:) But beware... dont start this one until youve read the others, and preferably in order to get the full effects of the series! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alpha hero!","review":"I love these highlanders. Although this one wasn't my favorite in the series, these alpha highlanders never fail to make me laugh. This book was no different.I was reading this on while on a plane at 5:30am, hoping to avoid conversation with other passengers. That only worked until I started laughing...out loud. Seriously. When Jessi frees Cian, convinced the beautiful man is a dream, sidles up behind him, figures \\"why not, it's my dream\\" and licks him, I laughed so hard I almost dropped my book.As usual, Karen Marie Moning writes a great alpha highlander. Cian is a ninth century alpha male who definitely looks, thinks and behaves like one. I love all of the highlanders in this series. I hope she writes more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"This is the third book in this series that I have read. Kiss of the HL and Dark HL being the other two, and I am glad I read the other two first. Cian is the worst character of the three. Drustan and Daegus are written with much more love and tenderness in their hearts. Now don't get me wrong I love an Alpha Male in my romance novels but he has to have a heart underneath that muscular chest. The whole couldn't keep their hands off each other was stupid, with the \\"tupping\\" in the hallway while everyone else is trapped in the library. I just wanted Drustan and Daegus to beat the crap out of him. I also did not like the heroine and I really tried to like her. I would only recommend this book if you read the other two and wanted to see Drustan and Daegus again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed In This Boring Tale","review":"I loved other books by this author, especially the books about Grimm & Hawk, but this one, featuring Cian [KEY-on] & Jessi, was pretty boring. It had its moments but quite frankly, until Daegus got involved at the end there, in a surprisingly witty and compassionate role, this book was doomed. I guess using the mirror was a necessary plot idea to the overall theme of Moning's tales, but I wasn't thrilled about this approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not castle MacKeltar again!","review":"Why does Karen Marie Moning insist on spoiling a good story by re-hashing the endings of the other MacKelter books. For the last three books I have been really enjoying the story and then she decides it's time to return to the castle Mackelter and the reader immediately knows that the books is going to go down the same tired old route all the other stories have gone down. Even worse she has now turned me off of the the characters of Drustan and Dageus and their wives who have become farcical thanks to the books that have come after their stories - especially the wives who seemed to do a lot of running around acting silly. I think it is time for Ms Moning to come up with a new way of resolving her stories, and reward the reader with something original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmm, May I Have Some More?","review":"Okay, admittedly, my favorite of the series still remains Daegus from Dark Highlander, but this book is still sexy and very entertaining!I quite enjoyed Jessi. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion, I found her to be intelligent and her reactions realistic for someone in her situation.Ciar is one of those alpha heroes that makes you howl and growl all at once. I thought Moning handled it well by making him a Ninth Century man. If he'd acted that way absent all the factors she wrote for him he may have come off as an ass, but instead, he was realistic for his own time frame. Nicely done.The chemistry? Oh yeah. The sex was very well written and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the next books entail.My only complaint? It wasn't long enough, LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Great book. There seems to be a lot of the same \\"talk\\" through out the book but it is easilly skimmed over for me. I still recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Now I'm going back to book 1 to read them all! I don't know what I was expecting I jut randomly picked this now I'm pleasantly surprised I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell of the Highlander","review":"Same general theme as the other Highlander books, but still worth the read. This book brings back the MacKelter's, and they are still fine to read about."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"A die hard Diana Gabaldon fan I had high hope this author could deliver. Unfortunately she falls short. For me too much explicit sex and not enough detail and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, but could be better","review":"It felt incredibly rushed, and I'm still confused about the importance of the Dark Book. Some serious sequel baiting was involved. I think I'm going to wait for paperback for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the stories....","review":"without getting wordy - I agree with several other readers, I love the stories but hate the porn !! I also preferred the first several books covers to the newer ones..I was glad that I got this book from the library while on a visit to the states instead of spending my money on it ( I live in France).. so far I have all her books in paperback - and was awaiting the new ones ..now I have a feeling she is kranking them out too fast and using porn to catch new readers..what a shame...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback!!!!!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. This was just a retread of the Immortal Highlander and not even a good one at that! The villian in this was so pathetic and one dimensional as were all of the characters. The storyline was so predictable that even the villian knew where Jessi and Cian were going to hide. Please save your money on this one. check it out from the library or wait for the paperback and get it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"I eagerly awaited the publication of this book. Unfortunately, the plot is exactly the same as the previous books in this series. I was very surprised that Drustan and Dageus figured in the resolution of the story, again.Wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complicated character","review":"I'm a loyal fan of KMM. I pre-ordered this book months ago. I loved the book, Cian's character, and the complexity of him. Though, and not to be negative, just a little bit of critique, this book did seem a bit more rushed than usual. But all put together, this book was GREAT. KMM writes with such wit and humor and I can only hope to write as well as she one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing if you wanted another 1977","review":"This is probably the most disappointing CD I have ever purchased. I have listened to Girl from Mars over 100 times and there is nothing even close to that in Nu-Clear Sounds. There are no catchy tunes like Kung-Fu. The music sounds muffled. Unfortunately for me, I did not preview any of the tracks because I was impatient enough to buy the import version. I would much rather have received a CD with remixes of 1977. I have heard some people who like this CD as much as 1977. Don't believe that they are anything alike or you will be disappointed. The band has taken a different direction which I was unfortunately unable to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ash grow up but don't sell out","review":"Nu-Clear Sounds is a great album. It's got an abundance of hooks, sweet love songs, and little boy vocals. The songs still have a feeling of boyhood charm, but it works on the most important level; it moves forward and takes risks. The band have added another guitar player, Charlotte Hatherly, and gone are their sci-fi lyrics and teenybopper charm. Tim has shed his teen hearthrob image but still kept some of the charm; you can hear the youthful optimism in songs like Wild Surf and Numbskull. He can still make the girls swoon too. Aphrodite and I'm Gonna Fall are achingly gorgeous. Unfortunately, some of those girls won't understand songs like Jesus Says and Death Trip 21, which employs a D.J. and sounds more like the Chemical Brothers. It's a shame such forward thinking risktaking got them dropped from their American record label and saw them slide down the charts in the U.K. Thankfully, this album proves Ash will be in it for the long haul, not a flash in the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Love flows to terrific production.","review":"\\"Return of the B-Girl\\" features a great deal of excellent rapping over tracks sampled and mixed by That Kid Miles. Guest appearances and strong verses from T-Love herself make this album and excellent listen through and through.Miles digs to the dusty depths of the record crates to pull out great samples you've never heard anywhere else. If you're into jazz-based hip-hop that doesn't get too agressive, then this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly terrible. Not surprised.","review":"This is the WORST prep book for the SAT (along with the Princeton Review's Math workout). Do not buy this, it is extremely short and is filled with errors ranging from incorrect answers to faulty grammar. Having grammatical errors in a SAT Reading and writing prep book shows how seriously PR takes the SAT. I felt like I was editing the damn thing.Another thing to note is THEY USE THE SAME QUESTIONS MULTIPLE TIMES. I do not understand the point of this... too lazy to make up new questions? I bought both the Reading and Math book and feel cheated and used. This is a warning out there to everyone, do not waste your precious time on this book. As I have said in my other review, somebody sue these flukes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inadaquate","review":"If you don't know anything about the SAT and want to study for it just a little bit, this is a good book for you.This book is too short and all the stuff in this book and more are in Cracking the SAT so if you have that book, you shouldn't even bother with this one.There are some questions that are exactly the same but appear in two different quizes.Vocab on the back is the only good part of this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Starters... Only!","review":"This book is only good for starters. If you think you can get a good score just by reading this book then be prepared to be rejected by the college you want to get in!I'm putting 4 stars on this book based on how it is written. It's easy to understand, and is good for people who have just started studying for the SAT. It's concise and to the point and easy to understand. The vocabs on the back is helpful too!And I agree with the others that this book is too short! I hate that!Again, GOOD FOR STARTERS ONLY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SAT strategies","review":"As an educator and an SAT tutor, this is my top pick for the SAT review. This book may not have as many practice tests as some have complained, but it has strategies, and that is what's key. For instance, how to eliminate choices, how to figure out the answer when you don't know any of the vocabulary words, and what grammar concepts are tested most often. Use this in conjunction with an SAT practice book from the college board, and you're set. You won't find a better book in terms of explanation and strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical information","review":"This is a book I read online years ago and thought I needed to add to my bookshelf. I believe Isaac Newton spent a lot of time with God going to him with questions on his mind and God answered him with the small things like an apple hitting him on the head. I agree with a lot of his historical views of interpretation but am not premillenial. During his time (as he states in his book)a lot of expositor's saw more fullfilment of the prophesies of Daniel in the first coming of Christ as do I. I also believe the feet of iron and clay are both Roman and Jew. The kingdoms represented are kingdoms that ruled Jerusalem and at the time of Christ the Jews had a priestly rulership though it was a man-made one (clay) while the Romans had a strong-arm rulership (iron). This is an eye opener for anyone who has not read any interpretation from a historical viewpoint and well worth the price. Relatively short and to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing","review":"I should have known what I was getting myself into reading Newton but I tried it anyway. I can't understand it, and I am an avid reader and English teacher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for.","review":"I did not 'hate' this book. I can see that a great deal of Biblical scholarship went into it, but the book was not what I hoped it would be - I have no right to criticise Newton - but was he not a little dogmatic about the 'meaning' of these prophecies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely book","review":"I liked so much this book because it describe so much truth about the future events that will take place in our present world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope Music from the Finest of bands!!!","review":"The sounds and skills produced and displayed on this album are incredible.

The plot and the talents seemed to be better and more thought out then some of the ones Piers gets from fans. If you like Xanth then you will enjoy it. If you don't, then this may not be the best choice for you. Now, I suggest that you stop reading this review and order this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dastard","review":"The Dastard is on of Piers Anthony's better Xanth books. It has a lot of humor and too many puns (as usual), but the puns don't detract from the story. I have been waiting for the last 2 years for Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm to make an appearance as major characters and I really like their personalities. I would have liked them to star more as children (like Ivy did in Dragon on a Pedestal, my favorite Xanth novel), but maybe next time. Becka also proved to be a dynamic character. She had her dragon heratige to keep the Dastard in line, but also her morals and common sense to provide an alternate point of view from the Dastard and to move the plot along. Castle Maidragon was great fun and I hope it appears in future books. I'm glad Becka got her wish (though I won't say what it is). I thought the ending needed work and I would have prefered to see the Dastard work on using his talent for good. Over all, it was a terrific book and it kept me enthralled till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Love Piers Anthony books! This book was punningly funny! The story was delightful...the ending perfect! I thought that some of the puns were distasteful, yet it must be expected at some point in time. The story kept me captivated, right until the end!

There was a lot of focus on the suffering of the citizens of Okinawa and Diego Garcia. While I sympathize with them, the strategic location of those islands means that it is highly likely that they would be occupied and used for military purposes, whether or not the US is the occupying force.

Don't panic if you have conflicts. I found after making the CR-Writer the Master and the CD-ROM the Slave there were conflicts so I just switch them, and they now work perfectly.

The Nero software that comes with it is very easy to use.

It is simply fantastic-just get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYBODY Has copied This......","review":"While I personally don't think Neil Young needed to publicly distance himself from his debut LP (released just a few months prior to \\"Everybody Knows....\\")I can certainly understand his need to put the past behind him and move forward at such blinding speed, after all, this great recording is the payoff! I probably can't add anything new to the tons of praise heaped on Young's output, put come on, any LP containing \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" is top notch in my book. This classic also serves as the template followed by most other Southern-influenced, rock/jam bands that came along in the 70's and 80's and is still inspiring young upstarts to this very day. Crazy Horse would prove to be Young's perfect companions in creativity and the catalyst for some of his most wrenching, emotional songwriting later in the decade. Anyone looking to start a classic rock collection should proceed directly to this album.

Instead I found a lackluster series of marketing-like evangelisms that have neither valid science nor learning theory to back them up. By using a sales-pitch approach in an attempt to convince the reader, this book can do more damage than good to the field of educational videogame design and research.

The didgeridoo and percussion complement the Scandinavian fiddles and Wilhelms's lovely voice as though they were made for each other. This album somehow unites the more hard-edged sensibility of progressive groups like Hedningarna with a sweeter traditional sound without ever losing its edge. Plus it's got a beat you can dance to. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scandinavian folk-rock fusion","review":"Based on traditional folk music of Swedish-speaking Finns. Definite modern style folk-rock fusion using a mixture of vocals, fiddle playing, didgeridoo, and other instruments. If you like Hedningarna and Garmarna, you'll certainly like this CD. A couple of the tracks are a little too new-age for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sum of its Parts","review":"A fine novel worth your time, but definitely not a mystery book. Sure the first 10 pages describe a murder scene, but there's nothing to solve. Actually, it doesn't get solved, it's lived with, and really that can be said for much of what the Duff family experiences.All members of the family Duff are unique, as are their relationships. All are enjoyable with only the Scottish Uncle seeming a little too polished; his dialogue a little too precise. But that's a quibble because overall, Doig does very well with his characters. Throw in the dam as another major character and Montana itself, and you have a book worth your time; a great tableau of the 1930s Depression in America.And if you know what the cover of the first Life Magazine looks like, you know Fort Peck. Doig weaves many real events into his fiction including a visit by FDR, a major dam mishap, and a visit from a Life photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doig makes the Dirty 'Thirties come to life on the page","review":"This is the second Ivan Doig novel I've read. In \\"Dancing at the Rascal Fair\\" I learned a lot more about sheep-herding than I ever thought I would like, but like it I did. In fact, I loved it, 5 stars worth. In this book I learned a lot more about how those big Western dams were built than I ever thought I would like, but only 4 stars for this one.Doig is a wonderful popular historian, well worth reading on whatever topic he decides on. He took on a difficult story here. He got the history right but it's still a difficult read. Several times as I was reading \\"Bucking the Sun\\" I wondered if he introduced the mysterious Duff adultery/homicide at the beginning just to keep us reading to the end.I'll be reading more Ivan Doig, that I know. He has the knack of making history come alive, even when the history is as gritty as the story of the Great Depression and how people lived through it -- or didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONGEST HAIR","review":"BEAUTIFUL!!This doll has the LONGEST HAIR EVER & is SUPER BEAUTIFUL!!1,000,000,000,000,000 STARS!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it","review":"Well I was in need a good air hose and when you order it you ussualy anticipate resonable shipment, after they got my money they told me that it was damged and it would take unitl feb.( jan 12 is today) who needs an air hose (or any tool) in a month.

HIs first album was more ballads, which I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craig David is the Best","review":"I love this CD.

His first album 'Born To Do It' was outstanding with the tracks 'Walking Away', '7 Days', and 'Fill Me In'. 'Slicker Than Your Average' is just as good or better.. My favorite track is 'Rise And Fall'. Followed closely by 'You Don't Miss Your Water ('Til The Well Runs Dry)'. The tracks 'Personal', 'What's Your Flava', and 'Fast Cars' just set this album off!! It is a must buy!! You can't go wrong with this!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average","review":"I have to admit I slept on Craig David's first album. The first single, \\"What's Your Flava\\" is what got me noticing this CD. I really liked this song and am I saddened that it didn't get much play (at least where I'm from, it didn't). Craig David has a very beautiful and unique voice and he uses very well throughout this CD. The best songs are:-What's Your Flava: nice beat-Fast Cars: a dance number-Rise and Fall: a nice duet with Sting-Personal: a song guaranteed to get you in the mood-Spanish: a catchy latin-inspired songDefinitely add this CD to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Good!","review":"Craig David is a song-writing phenomenon with a smooth voice. I caught onto C.David when he hit to top of the charts with Fill Me In & 7 Days and fell for his sound. He continued with the slow, soulfull vibes of Rendez-vous & Walking Away...BUT, now we get Slicker Than Your Average!Here he has kept the strong RnB vibe and has recorded a track with Sting - although he said he wanted to make fame on his own without working with anyone! He unfortumately turned down tracks with Janet Jackson & J Lo because of his statement.Well I do think has topped artists like Musiq Soulchild & Joe BUT this album doesn't top his last...One of the best songs on the album is his first single - What's Ur Flava - which sounds like one of Blackstreets best songs.This album is definately worth buying but I think Craig David will develope into a much stronger artist and reach Stevie Wonder & Lionel Ritchie's level and will look back as this being one of his weaker albums....we will just worship the best though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"[bad]!","review":"Not the best music EVER made. But most certainly has comedy value, its just so bad its interesting. Whats your flava, tell me whats your flava OOOOHHHH.Whats so hilarious is the way that Craig David seems to think he's a genius. He's not.He also seems to have a superiority complex. It is people like this who are destroying our music world, people!BOYCOTT MODERN MUSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slicker Than Your Average rates well","review":"All in all this was a good cd. I preferred his first cd overall, but this is a true to life cd. He very plainly says that he has made mistakes in his life, has learned from them, and is getting on with his life. Mistakes can't hold him back. This cd shows him to be growing up. Innocence doesn't last forever. His eyes are open. Don't let mistakes hold you down, get back up and move forward. I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Thing Out of England Since the Beatles!","review":"Craig David is seriously the best performer to come out of England since the Beatles.

This is the best album I have bought in ages and I would buy another one if I had money :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Craig is back and showing his influences and changes","review":"From the moment the disc started I kept hearing Craig's(and his producers')debt to Terence Trent Darby and Michael Jackson. Does anyone agree with me? I grew up with Michael's music and then later with Darby's. I think this is an excellent disc showing a major star's path to maturity in terms of experience and inspiration. \\"Rise and Fall\\" is truly excellent as most of the other customer reviews have indicated. I do agree with one who said that Born to Do It might end up having a longer shelf-life, but this is a superb follow up to a brilliant recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good....","review":"I am so happy with this new album, I loved Born to do it and Slicker Than Your Average is unbelievable. My top three favorites are Hidden Agenda, You Don't Miss Your Water, and What's Changed.

It's truly amazing and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick.","review":"This cd is one of a kind. Each song has a little different feel to it.

Born to do it was firing but Slicker then your average is a complete different sound and can't be compared to it. Slicker then your average revovles around the whole TWO STEP GARAGE rather then R'n'B as in Born to do it, but it still has many tracks from the R'n'B genre. My favourite track is 'fast cars' as its a real upbeat song and really wakes you up ready to go out. After the amount of time Craig David has spent in the U.S he has really come back with a bang! Well Done Craig! I know it will do fab!My advise would be buy it, it will be the best money you will ever spend as you get hours of enjoyment from it, great christmas present! As Craig would say is 'Off The Hook'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slicker than any 1s average","review":"this cd is a real hit . it holds hot meaningful lyrics that makes me feel the song by my heart & as i think its the best album of the month so i advise every1 2 go & snap it from a nearby music store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slicker than your Average","review":"This ablum was better than Born to do it.

Songs range from just piano and Craig David's amazing voice, as in \\"Water Runs Dry\\", to move-your-body songs such as \\"Fast Cars\\" and \\"Spanish.\\" Craig trys out new kinds of music and different techniques in his new album. It is different enough that makes it a unique album but it has similar elements to his last one. Craig David combines genuine lyrics, catchy tunes, and an amazing voice to make the album slicker than your average."},{"rating":"2","title":"STYA - he certainly is !","review":"I am gonna keep it short and sweet- this album will make the best christmas present for all of your friends and family!Britsh superstar Craig David has the vocals of an angel and the beats of a bad boy!

ITS A MUST HAVE for YOUR CD COLLECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than your average CD","review":"I was very anxious to hear this CD. I thought the CD was not only different from all the rest of the same ol' repetitive R&B singers. You can tell right from the start of that CD that he isn't just some thug posing as a fake crooner to get money and the ladies. No 2 songs sounded the same and he used a variety of styles across. After waiting so long for the second cd, I must admit I was disappointed; BUT only because the first CD was so good. This CD is better than most CD's out there easily. Fast tracks are mixed in with slow tracks very smoothly and all sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLICKER DOESN'T MEAN BETTER","review":"Craig David is back in his sophomore effort \\"Slicker Than Average\\", which is absolutely no comparison to debut breakout album \\"Born To Do It\\".Slicker is over produced, and loses Davids vocals in a mish mash of rough instrumentals and slip shoddy rhythms.The first single \\"Whats Your Flava\\", I swear was on \\"Born To Do It\\", I had to look at my album to see if it was, ...it wasn't but it sounded like it belonged on that album. The rest of the album is boring, dull and feels like it was rushed out.Craig David isn't hitting any marks on the Billboard Album Charts either, not even hitting Top 20, and the single \\"What's Your Flava\\" hasn't even cracked Billboards Top 100 Singles Chart.I think Davids Flava is in bad taste, and that slicker is absolutely right...an oil slick.If you haven't tried any of Davids works out yet, get his first album \\"Born To Do It\\", it is awesome, and not one bad song in the bunch. Slicker is just trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no. It's just average.","review":"When Born To Do It premiered in the US last year, it was a daring crossover success -- mixing enough uk garage 2-step beats with proper R&B production and smooth lyrical skills. Unfortunately, the follow-up is seemingly less about the perfect intimate bonding of 2-step with R&B and more about the bonding between R&B and what R. Kelly is reminded of. The opening single \\"What's Your Flava?\\" is probably the tightest on the album as it bounces through fun lyrics about different shades of women -- it's Raekwon's 1995 tune \\"Ice Cream\\" recycled for 2002/3. While Craig might've taken that chancier step into more gangster territory, he forewent the unison with ex-producer Mark Hill (of uk garage Artful Dodger fame) this time and got caught in a slump. Possible other hits would be \\"Eenie Meenie\\" or the interesting duet with Sting, but radio and will probably pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Halloween Album. Ever!","review":"Once in awhile, you pick up that random album that totally rocks your world and changes your life. I've always loved surf and psychobilly and this disc turned me on to so many awesome bands I never knew about. Especially the Dead Elvi! They have become one of my favorite bands.(psst-find their website for more of their tunes)And when you toss in Rob Zombie, The Bomboras, The Ghastly Ones (2 more new favorites!), and Zacherle you just know you're in for a treat! All the tunes stay true to the spirit of Halloween without any cheesy soud effects like other compilations. While \\"Ribcage Mambo\\" isn't the same type of music as the rest of the disc, the crazy lyrics and swanky vibe make it fit perfectly thematically.After getting this, it quickly became my #1 Halloween disc and it gets played year round, at least once a week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's.

Imagine James Brolin in a role made memorable by Richard Widmark, and the picture's problem becomes even clearer. About the only shade left of noir here is the motivation of communist menace and the casting of Claire Trevor. Her presence is of little help to the effort, however, as she is blowzied out as an apparent ex-hooker in a role that makes a mockery of Thelma Ritter's previous portrayal of a dowdy, world-weary peddler. Even Brolin's waterfront shack looks like a fumigated, cleaned-by-mom clubhouse where, thanks to modern indulgence, nude pinups remain taped cutely cocky to the walls. Ho hum.

It is true that both discs have a walloping amount of material, but Kevin Shirley's mixing was for crap. Derek Shirinian's keys were too high in the mix, often drowning out the other player's efforts with too much volume. Mike Portnoy's killer drumming was muffled with little color coming from his toms or snare. I place the sound quality of the 6 song EP live at the Marquee high above OIALT. The Marquee's sound was brilliant. Portnoy's drums shone with clarity and force and the other players were shimmering in the spotlight as well. Sorry DT, but my voice must be heard.

I picked it up again today - after reading the new Dune series book and other - well more interesting - books in between, I found it hard to keep reading.Why? Well I decided, sadly, that the story is just plain boring, It drones. It reads like a sad tired addition to the series that I get the distinct impression that Larry Niven probably did not want to write.I honestly do not think I can finish it - which is probably the worst thing I can say about a book.

If I could have given it zero stars I would have. Larry Niven was once an exciting writer whose excitement in novelties carried you along with him. Now he seems to be drearily trying to tie together the loose ends of most of his previous work, to little or no effect - just going through the motions.Where can I start? Lack of characterisation. Slack plotting (which Niven now seems to believe is purely mechanical). Ho-hum action sequences. Personal obsessions (inter-species sex). Here-and-there action to no great purpose. And a resolution which is wholly deus ex machina.Sad to see an author who once had it all together (and remember the younger Niven justifiably won both Hugo and Nebula awards) lose it to this extent.

It happened to Heinlein, and sadly, it's happening to Niven, two of my favorite authors from childhood.I've read most of Niven's work, loved all his known space series, even if he's made some serious physics blunders, and loved Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers. Ringworld Throne would have been a short story if you ripped out every page with his twisted interspecies sex fantasies, and I promosed myself that I would toss Rindworld's Children if I encountered a single scene of gratuitous rishathra that didn't propel the plot line.Surprisingly, I got through half the book, but that sucker is on the curb for recycling as I write this.Larry, get a ticket to Thailand, get yourself thoroughly laid, and then write your next story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I used to read a lot of science fiction, and I enjoyed Larry Niven's stories.

I would have been SO much happier if Niven had filled his pages with more descriptions (much more description)... like, in every scene of the book! So many times I had to re-read a paragraph to \\"guess\\" what was going on or who was speaking.

The hero wanders aimlessly through the movie, unhampered by even the barest elements of a cohesive plot. Strange things happen without explanation. For example, in one scene the hero puts a lit stick of dynamite in his mouth. After it goes off his personality changes, okay. Strangeness can be a great asset to a movie (i.e. Brazil) but the audience needs to be able to relate to what is happening on the screen to some degree. \\"Out\\" does not even allow that. Overall the film plays like the producer's own practical joke rather than a movie, and as such it has nothing to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Pay Attention...

Perhaps wisely quitting while they were still ahead, Lamb brought a level of sophistication, lyrically, musically and emotionally, almost unique in the world of drum and bass, although this is a music that cannot be wholly ascribed to any one category. In this record they have achieved a summation of their art, be it in the deceptively pastoral passages of Clouds Clear, or the attack on your loudspeakers that is Sugar 5. At times exploring the darkest corners of human relationships, while at others celebrating the joys of living, Lamb can only make one look forward to what they come up with individually in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightness in the dark","review":"Lamb's direction has increasingly turned melancholic over the years. From the upbeat of their debut self-titled album to the increasingly mellow What Sound, the duo returns with their fourth effort Between Darkness and Wonder which showcases Lou's vocals in that even greater splendour.Though many viewed the opening Darkness as a disjointed piece of burbles, I have quite enjoyed it for its many turns and twists, frequently reminiscent of Bjork. As one reviewer mentioned, this album is more heavily string-laden this time round, almost giving an acoustic feel sometimes, but Lou's voice never detaches from the songs. My favorite would be the slightly upbeat Please.I must admit I enjoyed this a little more than What Sound but more happily, Koch Records is willing to invest on a non-mainstream band who could have never seen the light in the US for not being megasellers!

I have no idea what happened, but this is not the same Lamb that produced one of my favorite songs of all time, the soaring, epic, \\"Gorecki,\\" but a once-interesting and innovative group pushing for popular, Dido-sized and -shaped success.

Caine takes apart the works of Mahler, adds, subtracts, and rearranges them into new incredible pieces.

Thanks to these puzzles, she has developed her attention span and motor skills as well as her speech! She never gets bored with them and she has developed several different techniqes for putting them together. As other parents of autistic children know, reaching their children is not an easy task.

The biggest problem is that the author does not build her case on anything more than supposition. there are almost no footnotes or references or anything to indicate that what she is saying is more than opinion of idea. There is no proof for anything she says and then she builds her case on the point that she didn't justify in the first place! Also, the text is far too flowery for nonfiction and written in a pompous style.

I was able to see everything much more clearly. Then, after 6 months of use, the magnifier screen wouldn't stay up because it loosened up. I couldn't find any way to tighten it either. Too bad...

I am not sure where this analysis comes from but it does not hold up.Let's take one example page 297, has a variation of the Italian game. It is game 7. The note for move 12 says that white can not stand to play a3 because of ... Ba6. Well, the delorie computer webpage basically disproves that quite simply. The basic point is that black has a bishop that is hanging. He has no time to play either ...c5 or ...Ba6. After ...Bxd2 13. Qxd2 Ba6 black does not seem to have a way to get at the \\"stuck\\" king. Since white simply plays Qc2 and Ng5 is aways a threat. This whole line seems to be predicated on some wild dream. The book is full of this kind of blathering and not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"We should have more game soundtracks from this guy","review":"First of all I bought this CD because I had first played the game from which this music is from. So when I first played the game I was astonished that this kind of music was in a game. Well I just had to bought this CD. Well after I've listened it quite much I can't say anything else that this is one of the most imressive soundtracks I've ever heard. Michael Land has made a real masterpiece. It's just a pitty that he hasn't released more albums from the games that he has composed the musics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great example of scoring a game","review":"I loved the game, and I love this CD. The Dig is one of the few games that manage to make you believe that you are actually there. The music was one of the most important factors in creating the desperate and mysterious mood in The Dig. So why don't I rate it 5 stars ? This has two main reasons. One is that while it served greatly in the game, the music isn't as strong as a stand-alone product. Second is, that out of some reason, some of the synthesizer samples were changed and/or replaced with other instruments while converting the music from the game to the CD. Still, I would recommend this CD to anyone who liked the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated Gem","review":"The great A.R.Kane's often-dismissed third album pales in comparison only to the band's previous work; taken on its own merits it's a lovely little dreamy pop record not unlike similar-era releases by, say, Saint Etienne, with especially evocative lyrics and nice production. (See also Rudi Tambala's subsequent releases as Sufi for comparison.) It's just that earlier A.R.Kane records, particularly 'Up Home', 69, and i, are more on the order of Sgt. Pepper's or Bitches Brew or Tago Mago, Joy Division's Closer, Cocteau Twins' Treasure, MBV's Loveless - monumental. That said, a couple of this album's songs would fit in nicely on the earlier i album, and there are several other excellent versions of \\"Sea Like a Child\\" that are superior to the one included here - including some by the band's Alex!

Oh dear....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Cold war thrillers are one of my guilty pleasures and I was expecting a little-known gem after reading the other reviews. But this book was somewhat of a disappointment.The dialogue seems forced and even stilted. For example, several Americans are asked to join a trip. After one accepts, another says, \\"I, also, of course.\\" Now, have you ever heard an American say \\"I, also\\" instead of \\"me, too\\"?The lead female character is also a problem. Almost none of her actions or dialogue rang true for me. She seemed liked nothing more than a clumsy device to move the plot along. If the plot required a tantrum, she threw a tantrum. What's worse, for a thriller, this book wasn't very, well, thrilling. The first half of the book seemed to drag, although it did pick up in the second half.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: I also disliked the ending, or should I say, the non-ending.

Hardly.My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack. This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there. These racks have crossbars with a \\"reverse wing\\" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise. The Thule \\"universal\\" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle. It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd.Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches.My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"no title","review":"What a potboiler! Basically a retelling of \\"The Prodical Son\\", but with nice descriptions of Harvard and Newport, Rhode Island, as they were at the turn of the century. Not nearly as good (well, not actually good at all) as his later book, \\"His Children's Children\\". Why do I suspect Train of being something of a prig? Here it seems he lashed together all the moral adages ever told to young men about going straight, loving home and hearth and Mother, to make a semblance of a story, a thinly disguised parable of the hero who went wrong, but found true love in the end. Such claptrap! Unfortunately, I had inadvertently glanced at the last page, so I knew how it would all turn out, though it was pretty predictable anyway. The description of the houses and society of Newport was fascinating, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but it's very boring","review":"This is not one of Berger's best: in fact it's not far short of the worst thing he's ever written.

It does however try to cover a number of bases in it's musical choices and as a result you may feel, like me, more fondly towards some tracks than others - in my case, I could easily have done without 'Whistle Bump', 'Do Your Dance' and Freddie James' rubbish 'Hollywood'. The other tracks however are very welcome on CD, especially Venus Dodson's little remembered 'Night Rider'. Overall this CD shows that there are some people out there that really care about the music. Well done and let's hope that this is the beginning of a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Disco!","review":"I just received this CD yesterday and have been playing it since.

The opening sounds of \\"Burning Airlines Give You So Much More\\", odd & quirky and all the more catchy for it, let you know what kind of album it'll be.

The first two were great, and the third one good, but the following books have not met that standard.Ransom of Love is a good title for the story line of this book. They do a wonderful job of showing two different illustrations of how Christ has paid our ransom. The information on slavery was interesting and the hate and bigotry toward the slaves is unfortunately true. However, I found the book itself redundantly wordy and at times too simply written.I only recommend this book if you have read the others in the series.

This is a great recording and I must agree with one of the other reviewers, this needs to be heard straight through. Redman is top form. There is a lot to absorb on this and the extra tracks(the last is my fave on the record) make it even more worthwhile. Great stuff...must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Living Music","review":"First of all, let me just correct the editorial review on one important point. The musette is not related in any way to the bagpipes. It's a very old double-reed instrument (something like the oboe) that is found in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. That said, this is a very fine early effort from the great Dewey Redman. He never recorded with this kind of backing ever again, and the sound is refreshing. It's also nice to hear more of his alto, an instrument on which he has a very individual voice. Redman stood apart from free players of his day by his versatility, which is well-featured on the deep blues of \\"Boody,\\" one of the album's highlights. The atmospheric \\"Imani\\" is also striking. Some of the instrumentation slightly recalls Ayler's later work, but Dewey's individuality as both a soloist and leader shines through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soap Opera Christmas","review":"Soap Opera Christmas i wonderful Christmas music sung by soaps stars.

The mystery deals with the mysterious death of an Irish bootlegger, Jimmy \\"Sweet Rolls\\" Sullivan and once again Nuala has the feeling something is not quite right with the story. But the mystery plays second fiddle to two sub-plots; the upcoming wedding of Nuala and her stalwart Watson, Dermot, and a case against Dermot concerning how he achieved the financial independence he has. The former is a problem due to the machinations of Nuala's oldest brother; the latter is caused by a vindictive figure from Dermot's past. Both these storylines take away from the original mystery, which plays second fiddle to these soap opera plot lines.

The story begins seven years after spores are dropped; the earth is nearly consumed with plants 600 feet tall that are stripping the earth of its resources: soil and water.

The meditative OM and the easy ability to start the Prana Yama by listening to this music is a affirmation of the beauty of the chants, that aid the generation of essential endorphins. I would recommend this to critical listeners, those practising the Raja Yoga, and interested others.

Ravishankar) is a legendary composer, and I love many of his compositions since my childhood. But this album has not touched that level.

It is clear that he accustomed to writing shorter essays and getting paid by the word. He spared no words or overstatements. This book is about a federal investigation of a coin wanted by collectors. I am a federal investigator and a coin collector. The first eighty pages of the book are a good read and a nice discussion of U.S. coins and the double eagle. The book then drones on and on discussing an unlikely series of circular interviews described with pointless details. The author attempts to tell the story in a colorful fashion by including passages that are reminiscent of detective novels but falling far short - to the point of being trite. Face it, this investigation lagged for 60 years. Obviously, evidence discovery was slow.If you are getting on an airplane and want a pleasant read that will put you to sleep, go ahead and buy it.

The book is simply brilliant. A great American story about the social interaction of race, justice, and survival in 1920's Harlem with all the pomp, ceremony, and show of a traveling circus.

It skimmed the surface with suggestions about dressing cute, exercising, taking time for yourself...things I've heard a thousand times before.

I thought algae was growing in the filter, so I removed it, but that didn't help the problem. I don't know if the icky brown stuff was algae or mineral buildup, but regardless, it grossed me out and created a lot of extra work.

The first time I bought it, it worked for about 2 weeks, then had decreased output due to the black paint flaking off of the nebulizer (the part that makes the mist). So I returned it and bought another one...this one worked off and on for about a week and then never worked right after that, despite my careful cleaning and disinfecting, just like the owners manual instructs. I use it in my baby's room (very small room) and, after the first week, couldn't get the humidity above 20%.

In my office, with is exactly 1/2 the 350 square foot size that Honeywell claims the product can handle, the mister, going full blast, even over night, fails to deliver enough mist, even on the highest setting, to nudge the baseline 25% humidity level up even one percent notch. So, yeah, it looks pretty, but you know what they say about looks aren't everything. I guess I need either to replace this thing or get another mister that is maybe less decorative and more functionally effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe in filterless!!","review":"I bought 2 of these. Filterless sounded great until you read the instructions. You have to carefully clean with a vinegar solution. If you touch the ultrasonic baffle you could damage it. It is a real pain to maintain.

It is quite pleasant. What is disturbing is the \\"GURGLE GURGLE GURGLE\\" every 4 minutes from the water chamber. It is certainly not quiet and it wakes me up. If it was a consistent gurgle I suppose I could get used to it, but it is very annoying and loud. I guess air bubbles get released into the chamber like a water cooler.

They are among the first farm animals that children learn the names of, and she enjoyed repeating their names and making their sounds. The other puzzles she got were just puzzles, but it was as though this one had a personality that made it a toy as well. I don't think it's a good puzzle for an older toddler, but at one year most children's \\"shape-fitting\\" skills are pretty limited. I think a puzzle with a few, simple pieces that can double as toys is a great first puzzle for the 12-month old set."},{"rating":"1","title":"This puzzle should be pulled off the shelves!","review":"Let me first say that I have several Melissa & Doug puzzles & love them. I bought this puzzle in a specialty store (for a lot more $$), & had a problem within DAYS. The fuzz was coming off in clumps, & several edges were very rough & splintered. I'm suprised my son didn't get hurt. I did call Melissa & Doug, & they replaced the puzzle for a different one. I think if more people call about problems with this puzzle, maybe they'll see that they have to change it.

We tried several times and ended up contacting GE about it, who told us to unplug everything (including batteries from the phones) for 30 minutes and then try again. When that didn't work, we were basically told, \\"Oh well\\", and no offer of repair of replacement was made. We were told to return it to AMEX, but it was outside the 30-day window for AMEX returns, so we are stuck with this and 2 handsets that don't work and GE doesn't give a damn.

We see this interesting man in the context of the British settlement in Canada at a time when the new nation to the south (the USA)were forcibly moving the Cherokees and other eastern tribes to west of the Mississippi.

He wrote ambitious things, but also a lot of good movie music. You can find Pacific 231 on Youtube, a piece where he builds momentum while the tempo slows down. Enjoy also parts of my favorite opus \\"King David.\\"The book is made of interviews and comments of Honegger on music. I like it very much because it is very honest, very \\"protestant\\"and fresh. These qualities make of it a rare book. The reverse of the medal is that it shows a protestant misogyny as well.There is happily, a lot of thoughts about music itself. Honegger discusses for instance atonal music and the possibility to do new things without necessrily looking for new sounds.A very interesting read, but it is all very French, the context is French, the composers and writers quoted are French, so if you are not too familar with Europe in the first half of the 20th century, you might get very lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our daughter loves this book.","review":"My 8 year old daughter loves butterflies, and really loves this book.

Since I have to pay the delivery (Costco doesn't delivery big item TV), I called Toshiba customer support and try to get the refund for the delivery. They just refused and their attitude was very bad. Since I got a defective product up front and I just want to exchange for the same product, it is fair to ask for refund for the delivery. Toshiba support doesn't want to even accommendate this. It is very bad customer relationship management and their attitude is just arrogant.

We saw these floor puzzles and knew that these had to be a part of Christmas morning. After ordering on Thanksgiving a nice size order, only one gift arrived on Dec. 1st. I was taken back since I ordered two puzzles by the same company and now I am only getting one. Sadly our $7.49 puzzle came with a $30 shipping tag. The scam was up. After asking for a refund, our order was suddenly not going to be shipped in time for Christmas. So, these fantastic puzzles that would have made an incredible gift for Christmas Day went ungiven. I am a mother who is somewhat disabled and cannot go out shopping and depend on online shopping. So, I truly was disappointed.

The cover art is a Mac trademark, it is a pun on knots in your stomach from being nervous.

Too much subjective dialog to give the story the strength it needed.The second story, \\"The Vagabond Knight\\", written by Margaret Moore to my surprise was boring. I've read quite a few books by her and found them to be enjoyable, but in this one, the main character just didn't come through. It was obvious what she had intended, it just didn't work, leaving him appearing weak and confused.The third story, \\"The Uninvited Guest\\" written by Deborah Simmons, the best writer of the three, who for some reason wrote the worst story of three, was a real let down. I've read her prior 6 books on those wonderful deBurgh males and if anyone deserved a good story it was Campion! It paled in comparison to her other works. Another good book from her is \\"The Devil's Lady\\", a highly likeable heroine, an interesting story, and of course, a great Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shorter works!","review":"Normally, short works are dull for me because they aren't long enough to develop the characters... but Beverley was awesome in her The Wise Virgin, which appears in this book!

And if the horrifying events (hauntings) are not enough to make you want to read this book, the mystery and history of Harrow and the family should be. This book makes me want more. I am craving the rest of the story of Harrow.

We already have 9 other puzzles by Melissa and Doug and my kids love them. This puzzle is a 10 foot long train and in two different places the picture doesn't line up between two pieces.

We are disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab this puzzle!","review":"This has got to be one of the best puzzles or tools to teach the alphabet. My little one just received this for his birthday and has put it together all by himself already (he's 3)! It teaches great motor dexterity as well as the alphabet and 26 animals. He loves to make all their sounds as he goes along. It stretches clear across the kitchen floor and it's a bunch of fun for the cat too! My son is getting a big jump on the alphabet with this puzzle and it's just a great investment. Here's a little hint though. Don't wait until the last minute to get it for Christmas.

Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for teaching the alphabet","review":"My 4 yr. old grandson who is a train enthusiast really enjoyed the puzzle. I do think there is a problem with the choice of pictures such as a G for goldfish. He kept saying G is for fish and several other symbols like that were confusing. I did like that they put upper and lower case letters on each piece. Good for getting a child interested in learning the alphabet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware-X is not for fox!","review":"We recieved this as a present and my son was very excited to put it together. The pictures are nice and the big size makes it fun. As with any alphabet activities, we enjoyed practicing our letters by saying, \\"C is for Cow,\\" etc. But when we got to X we were shocked to see they put a fox. The age range for the puzzle will expect the traditional \\"X is for...\\" set up and not be looking for the letter in the final position. They did U is for umbrella so why they felt they had to do fox for x is unclear. We love most Melissa & Doug items, but fell that this one missed on this. We have to keep correcting our little one that X is not for fox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just great .but..","review":"kids love it ..but there is one flaw ..what to say ..the kids are looking more for the animal than for the letter of the alphabet - so if the intention is to teach the alphabet one got to find a way to draw the attention to the letter too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the 'C'","review":"At first I thought this was a great puzzle and would have given it 5 stars; the pictures are great, it is sturdy and it fits together well. But I guess my son will have to learn his A B Ds because the C is missing! This makes the alphabet train pretty worthless. I'm sure this is cut all at once so where did the C go? We opened the box and pulled the pieces out one by one as we put it together so I know the C didn't get lost.

There isn't really a bad or wasted line in here. This opinion is based on my knowledge of Bukowski derived from having read maybe 90 percent of his books. If you can have only one volume of Bukowski poetry, this should be it, in good part because it includes musings from his East Hollywood period and the affluent San Pedro days. In this regard, You may notice that Bukowski almost never mentions money or personal finances in his earlier work, but in San Pedro, mortgages, tax accountants, and the price of automobiles enter his view."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, period.","review":"I got into Bukowski through his short stories and novels, but my entire perspective changed with my introduction to his poetry.

While Trey Ellis is trying to poke fun at the contrived nature of Black literary politics from the mid-1980s, he ends up presenting a very weak caricature of how a feminist author would write.

I ran it for a few minutes the first day just to make sure it worked OK. On day two, I used it to dry my car. After a couple of minutes it sounded like it was slowing down and began emitting a burning smell and the sparks inside the motor (from the DC brushes) seemed very excessive. I figured the bearings were fine because it coasted down normally when the power was turned off. It came with a 2nd set of DC brushes, so I replaced them.

As an added bonus the solar charger can also charge the Game Boy Advanced (at the same time!!). We were highly amused that the solar charger is basically the shell of a GBA with solar panels where the screen and controls would be. That means it fits in a standard game carry case.

Although the ending leaves much to be desired, the content of the book will make you laugh, and say, \\"WHAT!\\" several times.

It slid around on my leather seat and he could not get a grip on it, so he slid around too.

I accidentally gave them the wrong delivery address in Del Mar, CA instead of Corona Del Mar, CA, but I sent them emails immediately to make a correction. Got no response, so I sent a msg asking them to call me immediately, which they did -- 3 times. On one phone call, I got a lady on the phone, gave her the correct address, and she put me on hold for 15 minutes, then I got disconnected. I gave up because I was told repeatedly (and it says this also on the website) that if it is delivered to the wrong address, don't worry, it will be returned. I just have the inconvenience of ordering again. No big deal. But this didn't happen. They delivered it to the wrong address -- it was not returned, and now I have informed my credit card company that I will not pay the bill. Huge mess that could've been avoided.

Sometimes it crashes when I'm using iTunes, and sometimes it will crash after I use that program and quit the application. It doesn't seem to matter what I do. And yes, this is a legal, registered version of the OS. And yes, I have re-installed it twice, all to no effect. Apple has some serious work to do to make this latest OS viable for their not-too-distant machines. I hear they are completely giving up on their G-Series machines with OS 10.6, so if you have 10.4, hold on to it and don't let go.

Leopard is the smartest OS I've ever used, and the prettiest. But if you're wondering how much this OS is really going to cost you, take a deep breath. The upgrades I need to get my essential software running on this OS total more than $2000, and that's more than I can afford (and more than the price of the most expensive iMac). For example, my older Adobe package won't run on 10.5, and the upgrade is over $1300. In fact, the only older software I've found that does run on Leopard is Appleworks 6 and a few shareware programs. Now how is it that an old Claris software program can still work without a hitch and nothing else does? Apple and its software providers need to rethink their marketing strategy.

Arcangelo Corelli wrote and performed his series of Op. 6 Concerti Grossi over a period of twenty years until the time of his death, but they weren't published until the year following.

And it works very well, to boot. So, WHO CARES if it was geared to reach a broader market? Certainly not me. This gem has cuts ranging from the low down and dirtiest to the toe tappin'-est. The guest \\"all stars\\" (Mick, Taj, Healey, Clapton, and more) on this CD are HUGE assets. They compliment, enhance, blend, and meld with Rogers' voice and playing like nobody's business. In my humble opinion I say, if you like the blues, especially the more modern ones, then don't just walk, walk, walk to buy Blues, Blues, Blues...

I thought, being BBC and a long version it would be a definitive one, but I have to agree with the other reviewer. This version left out some very important events, and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving. I like long movies, but this dragged because it just doesn't hold your attention. The 1997 Masterpiece Theatre version is so much more powerful, and keeps all important events intact, spending less time on Maggie's mother worrying about the fate of her china, and more on character and plot development, with a very haunting score. I really hope the other version is released on DVD-if so, I will probably donate this one to the library, because I can't quite see myself rewatching it.

There is a much better version by Takako Nishizaki. In fact the interpretations with Traditional Chinese musical instruments such as er-wu, pipa (conducted by Henry Shek, the acclaimed conductor in China) express this violin concerto even more lyrically.I don't know whether this is due to the process of the recording or because of Vanessa Mae's playing herself, but her techniques are poor and at times it just sounds like a junior hacksaw sawing a lump of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't read the description well enough","review":"I thought this book was a group of his normal western stories and was thrilled to have found it.

However, I have owned this book of poetry for about 6 or 7 years, and it continues to amaze me. The variety of poetical styles is impressive. There are humorous anecdotes in poem form, love poems, and haunting poems of wanderlust. Naturally, there are a lot of poems addressing wanderlust, seeing as it was a driving force in L'Amour's life.

Though I cannot say it is better then the live showing I saw, it still brings back the memories of poor little Bobbys life. 'Ladys Who Lunch' is wonderful, as is 'Not Getting married Today'.

I especially liked \\"Company\\" and \\"Another Hundred People.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"\\"Company\\" is my favorite Sondheim show, and out of the four recordings of it that I have, this is my least favorite. The CD does not leave me satisfied and haunted as the original Broadway CD does. The singers evoke no passion, and the orchestra is too synthesizer-dependent. The only track of note on this CD is Veanna Cox's \\"Getting Married Today\\" - her diction is unbelievable, but she, as the other singers so, seems to leave behind the feeling that is supposed to go into the song. This is at best an interesting buy for those who are already familiar with the score, but for first-time listeners: go with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different side of Sondheim","review":"If you want to see a new side to sondheim then I truly suggest this CD. It is different from his touching and more profound musicals. Bobby is the only person who is single amongst a group of friends, and each of these friends are giving him advice and trying to get him married. The score includes great musical numbers from a variety of well-knowns including Jane Krakowski, Robert Westenberg, and LaChanze. Highlights on this CD as opposed to the one from the 70's version are the addition of Bobby's number Marry Me A Little. Also Getting Married Today is a hilarious number done with in a deadpan style reminiscent of Madeleine Kahn. I promise that you will not be dissappointed. The only thing that could make this CD better would be the presence of Elaine Stritch, just because she is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"Though the Original B Cast of Company is legendary, this is recording will be a wonderful addition to anyone's Sondheim collection. In my humble opinion the original is somewhat disturbed by the constant reprises of the Bobby-Bubi theme and some unpleasant (but nevertheless interresting) spoken parts. In addition this recording features the wonderful Marry Me A Little. Get the OBC immediately, but don't hesitate to buy this one as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great score, disgusting recording.","review":"It's a pity that this rotten version of this genius score had to ever happen. The production was a theme-park version of Company, meaningless and artificial. And poor Debra Monk was stuck with nothing to do but try not to be Elaine Stritch. Stick to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Intermediate Puzzle","review":"My 3-year-old daughter loves this puzzle. It's brightly-colored and visually interesting, and the pieces are easy for her to put in place since they're made from sturdy wood instead of flimsy cardboard.It's a great choice for kids who've outgrown the traditional peg-piece wooden puzzle, but as yet lack the motor skills to move onto cardboard jigsaw puzzles.This puzzle helped my daughter learn to think about the picture as a whole in order to put the puzzle together, to match colors, and to put the corners and edges in.

It works well enough and in bright light it's acceptable. Stills from it are very lo-res and grainy. It's ok i guess, but the BT headpiece outshines it, and you can use the BT dongle on computers without BT for small file transfers like text files, but it takes way too long for mp3's etc. which I guess is to be expected from Bluetooth?I was surprised to see the $99. price tag on this and I'd look for used before paying that much, or for something else.

In my new smaller yard, I was hoping that this enclosed model would compost quickly and relatively easily and discourage pests. Granted, I haven't seen rats, but the compost is crawling with cockroaches. There are some minor things that you can do to try and discourage roaches - keep compost damp, turn regularly, etc, but none of them are completely effective, and I really hate being the person infesting our urban neighborhood with cockroaches. I'm afraid it just doesn't seem practical and considerate to compost when houses are so close together.

It is obvious that Sire records is trying to break the band on the last album which saved them money in the long run but I feel has hurt the band with their already established fan base. It also makes me wonder if the band has any really good new songs. By evidence of the new songs such as \\"Do It\\" it doesn't sound like they do. I find this extremely disappointing because I really loved the last one, I just found nothing new on this one that would make me pick up the next.

I had enjoyed Tommy Bolin's studio albums and I thought Coverdale and Hughes sounded great when I saw them in California Jam on TV 30 years ago. But the performances here are awful! These singers have both made some excellent recordings but in this concert they just had nothing. Coverdale was flat but Hughes manages to do little but offer up frequent and useless screams. They sound wasted.The liner notes document Bolin's hand problems during this tour and that may explain his subpar performance. Some of his solos just lay there as if he was expecting Jon Lord to fill in everywhere. Lord and Paice both play great and the remastering is excellent, but its not enough. This was a concert best left forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oblivious in more ways than one","review":"Those who consider Bolin's performance on this recording to be anything but an embarrassment must hold American right-wing \\"conservative\\" views: i.e. they are oblivious to reality.

Tommy bolin was not in good condition at that night, but he tried to do his best solo guitar and his WILD DOGS SONG. Glenn Hughes was in the good mood,....but Coverdale sang and screamed all the time (this only make me feel a bit confused.) The re-made in Japan 1975 was also good as Made in JAPAN 1972.

Redeemed only by the few cuts on the bonus 2nd CD -- which emphatically prove that Joan is still Joan and account for the two stars, this collection is otherwise, and sadly, a failure -- simply because this is not the Joan Baez we love so dearly.

The novel where one, some, or all of the characters has a dark cloud over their head and you know something bad will come their way.

I have not actually read any book in that time frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth what I paid.","review":"If you're into the series and you've always wanted to know what went on in the years in between the books, this is a great book for you. It can be a little confusing at times because of Weis and Hickman's descriptive tendencies but it doesn't detract from the book, a good solid start in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Companions Are Back!","review":"This is a trilogy centered around the companions and the War of the Lance. It helps to fill in parts that were just simply mentioned in the original Chronicles Trilogy and takes those instances to a greater depth. In essence, this trilogy will help you to understand addition struggles and stories from the dread time known as: the War of the Lance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely atrocious","review":"Note: This review is for the Audiobook version.The Audiobook is a tragedy of ... everything. At first, I appreciated that the reader attempted to give a different voice to each character. Although, the first two speaking characters were draconians, and after 7 minutes of scratchy, guttural, and ssssssnakey dialogue, I was fairly annoyed. It really made me appreciate the reader for Dragons of Autumn Twilight.But when she got to Tasslehoff, I had to stop. The reader's interpretation and presentation was quite cartoonish and ... I couldn't help but imagine a retarded gully dwarf clown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Effort","review":"I was eager to read this because like many I am entranced by the Dragonlance Universe, and I enjoyed the brief glimpse of backstory- I feel like this might have been intended or at the least contemplated 26 years ago when the first novel was published, because I was always puzzled/ frustrated by the gaps in storyline.Unfortunately the stilted writing, grammatical errors and shallow overview of the emotional depths of the characters ruined the story line for me. It was as if the entire story was dictated to a text to speech and sent off to be published without any effort at... well anything really.Perhaps the most poignant thing I can say about it is I read this three months ago, and despite a strong hunger to know what happens in the other two in this trilogy, I haven't been able to bring myself to buy Dragons of a Highlord Sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was the Editor on Vacation!?","review":"The number of spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical errors in this book is off the charts. Literally, there is a glaring mistake every other page. For a major publishing house, WoC, this is unforgivable. For two authors who have been in the business for over 20 years, this is unforgivable.Not to mention that Weis and Hickman have lost the \\"essence\\" of each of their characters. Raistlin and the crew are just cardboard cutouts of their former selves.It's an easy read, and it does have its moments, so if you miss the world of Krynn, I suppose you could do worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book! BAD E-Publication!","review":"This is a great first book, however words are mis-spelled, in the wrong order, or just don't make sense. It is hard to read when you have to consistantly try to figure out the authors intent.With that said, I found the story and characters well writen and enjoyable. Kindle or the publisher should lower the cost or fix the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead villains, beloved heroes and a lost hammer. What's not to like?","review":"This book is an excellent addition to the Dragonlance Saga. It's nearly seamless with the other books, Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night, and could theoretically be read in between them with no continuity problems to the reader. However, there are lots of hints to the Legends trilogy (Fistandantilus, The Abyss, Dougan Redhammer) that those who have already read these series can appreciate the little drop ins. It's always good to see the Companions at work again, though, as always, Raistlin, Flint and Tasselhoff steal the show. The other characters are there, but mostly in a minor role, especially Laurana, Goldmoon and Elistan. Though with a title of \\"Dwarven Depths\\", it's no wonder that Flint takes center stage.All in all, a great book and I can't wait to see the next in a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic and enjoyable","review":"It was nice to read about the old crew in a new writing.

There is a reason those missing gaps, as they are called, are only mentioned upon in the novel and never gone over in detail. That's because there isn't anything more to tell us. To go back and try to micro manage a story to death doesn't leave anything to our imagination. After a while it just becomes a paycheck for the people writing these stories and it loses it creative appeal. Be content with the original Chronicles and Legends. There really isn't anything more to the story.

Lilo is delightful in the lead and the wonderful score is nicely sung. The orchestrations are not as lush as those for the vastly mediocre film but none the less serve the score well. The soundtrack has the added advantage of Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jordan, some interpolated Porter songs, and lush orchestrations and performances. On the down side it had the miscast Shirley Maclaine and Frank Sinatra. Either the cast album or the soundtrack make for fine listening however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find Out How to Sink Your Sub!","review":"You probably think this book is about submarine right?

This album has a ton of tracks on it, mostly what I call \\"shenanigans\\" (non-songs, i.e. joking around) and live sets. I wouldn't say this has high production value or deep lyrics. But, it's the most fun I've ever had in an album.Dave Koval has a great voice and can fit well with any style of music. You may have heard of their altar ego, \\"Sassafrass Tunic Featuring Fred T.

You can listen to it side-by-side with the original (try The Look of Love Bacharach box set) and the modern production on the track is overwhelmingly bad. The music sounds like bad Billy Ocean.I've Always Loved You is contemporary, and I think Are You Sincere might be too, as it doesn't sound like 1969. Finally, Your Old 45s is newer as well.The rest seem to be (as far as I can tell without originals to compare to) from the 60s and 70s, so that's good.

It has a similar concept to \\"Numerical Recipes\\" by Press, et. al. but covers less ground, and at a more elementary level. Contrary to another reviewer, it does give plenty of examples at an elementary level, which I find quite helpful. That is an advantage sometimes if you don't need to wade through all the heavy artillery in \\"Numerical Recipes\\". Algorithms are given as pseudocode, and Fortran code which are easily transcribed into any language, such as VBA. I have owned this since 1980 and this is one of the more heavily worn references on my bookshelf. If you just need to quickly understand and code an algorithm, this is a great book to have handy.

The picture quality is fine for an old movie(from 1973). The DVD contains two parts(His/Her).The Divorce His part contains numerous flashback scenes from the husband's viewpoint. Before a flashback, Burton's character goes into a zone, then the flashback begins. I found the flashbacks to be disruptive, like someone cutting into a conversation.Divorce Hers(just like His) contains plenty of long, drawn-out(and overly dramatic) conversations. Liz Taylor's character spends plenty of time 'yelping' about her troubles.I came in with an open-mind and tried to enjoy this movie, but I got bored pretty quick. Everyone has their own opinion; I still think Liz Taylor looks beautiful in this movie(in an older sort of way). That was the only somewhat enjoyable part of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Deceptive Marketing Rebate Practice from Edge Corp","review":"I recently bought an Edge Tech Corp DiskGo flash drive and have been satisfied with its performance so far.UNFORTUNATELY, the company itself leaves much to be desired.

They make no allowance for holidays (as happened to me over xmas & new years) and personal vacations. Discussions with Edge Corp's main marketing & sales manager fell on deaf ears, and messages to their VP were unreturned.Only buy this product if you can meet their restrictive, if not onerous rebate rules.

It kind of chants and gets stuck in my head afterwards, but I guess it's pretty calming. Small price to pay for relief of back pain though!I really hate working out.

This is a very gentle practice that just about anyone should be able to do. I think it would be particularly good for the third trimester.

So to summarize the DVD is all eye candy but no a**kicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Perspective of Many","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman offers great insight into the perspective often expressed by Central and South American leaders in regard to U.S. economic imperialism. The author does use unnamed sources that are unverifiable, and at times creates fictional scenes (as the book says, some conversations did not exactly happen, but were pieced together to reveal what the author learned), but these scenes do effectively illustrate his points, as long as the reader keeps their nature in mind. In any case, I recommend the book because it covers some lesser-known recent history and shows how U.S. corporations can use their power to establish themselves in third world countries, often at the expense of local citizens. However, I warn against using the book as the only source of information on the issues discussed because there are many other perspectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking.","review":"I enjoyed the way the author tied details of modern history to the events of his life.

The search for resourses, riches and control drives the economic hit man to do his work. If he fails to make the deals the jackyls move in followed by the Marines. One way or the other the US elite get what they want. Amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me want to read more about USA from the outside","review":"I read this book based on its rating. It definately is one of the top best-sellers because it made me think about how the US is viewed from the outside. It jump-started my desire to read more about the US Economy and learn how our management of global resources (which in turn fuels our addictive purchasing habits) affects other views of the US.The book discusses a lot of the history of oil resources and how the US made arrangements to acquire this oil. It also alerts the reader to the value of oil and the crux is plays not only on our country, but other emerging countries.I gave it 5 stars because it gave me new insight into arguments when discussing global resources and debates about terrorism. Although it gave me a bad taste of the USA after reading it, I begin to realize that without control of resources, I might not have this opportunity to enter this opinion from the USA into Amazon. Thus, I'll stay neutral and continue more reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I had much higher expectations about getting an inside view, but Perkins superfically goes over a historical record that is all too well known.

He makes inferences, allusions and assumptions, but he failed to show enough evidence or connectivity to convince one that investing in power plants, roads, ports, etc is a net negative for developing countries. Sure, the world is connected, financed and full of agendas -- lets not throw out the economic baby with caveat-emptor bathwater. Or, as we say in emerging markets, \\"the only thing worse than being exploited by the developed world is NOT being exploited\\". Perkin's \\"guilt\\" wears a bit thin as he fully believes he's sinful, but accepts the paychecks for 30 years before finally letting go and coming clean.

The book is written in a very thin manner, nearly devoid of detail and color - more of a rough screen play than a true memoir. Nearly every other page had some leaden anecdote or other experience that did not ring true. The author's NSA \\"recruitment\\" and his \\"Dinner With Andre\\" education by an older female co-worker into a supposed Economic Hit Man (EHM) was quite unbelievable and literally incredible. If nothing else, the story doesn't make sense on face value. the NSA is an electronic intelligence gathering agency. The CIA or even the DIA would have been more believable sources of EHM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"Perkins is so far out there in imagined fiction, the reader has a hard time believing even the tiny bits that may otherwise be believable. His whole tone is bogus. Recent news shatters every part of his book, with the G8 forgiving third world debt. And, one has a hard time looking at the US today, under assault in all regards--industries, debt, jobless growth, stagnation in standard of living and so on, and being able to digest this kind of \\"America is an evil empire\\" nonsense. We are the brightest cultural light on the planet. But, we all know \\"empires\\" and great cultures first fall from within. Perkins is leading the charge. He should be deported."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honesty appears to be a problem","review":"I gave up reading this after a brief start. The man just isn't honest. The \\"recollected\\" conversations with his \\"trainer/seducer\\" that occured 35 years ago so stretched credibility that it just didn't seem worth the time. And to blame his being suckered into what he now considers his very unethical life because his dad wouldn't let him date the girls in his town is just laughable. Certainly, those who are strongly oriented to seeing everything the US does in foreign policy as evil empire building intended only to serve the industrial military complex, will be tempted to accept everything written here as gospel truth.

I won't argue that the World Bank and the IMF need overhauls, however, Perkins says \\"our underlying objective is to burden the (foreign) country with debts it couldn't repay\\". and the intent of electrical projects all over the world is to benefit a few of the wealthy and \\"widen the gap between the rich and the poor\\". HUH? This guy is nuts. I suppose he also thinks the objective of the TVA was to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. I can assure Perkins that the intent of private sector lenders is to get their money back with interest and the intent of the rating agencies is to analyse and critic objectively the work of feasibility studies. Maybe he just worked for a bad apple. He admitted that he was a bad apple. Now he is trying to capitalize on it. A shame.

Yep, for sure, Perkins made it all up! Well, at least the important parts. I know that for a fact because I'm also an economic consultant who has worked in the field for more years than Perkins and has never encountered any of bizarre, but entertaining, goings-on he alleges.Readers should not be taken in by John Perkins claim to be an Economic Hit Man. Such a being does not exist except in his over-active imagination. As for the man himself, I'm still undecided if he's a certifiable New Age nutcase or a cynical charlatan, or maybe both. But in any event, he would be well advised to stick to writing about his specialties of shamanism and dream traveling and leave the economics and politics of development to those who know more about the field than his preposterous conspiracy theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egomaniacal Nonsense","review":"This book proves Mr. Perkins either needs therapy or should have been a Liberal Arts Major in college. His guilt at being a businessman is personal to him in his quest to invent capitalist conspiracies at every turn. Che and Castro would have been proud.

I also don't deny the very real historical facts covered in places such as Latin America and Indonesia. But to call this piece of work \\"history\\" is a farce.The picture Perkins of himself seems part Bourne, part Bond. It is fanciful, generalized, and darkly romantic. It lacks the unmistakable flavor of truth.In his Q & A that follows the novel, he responds to whether or not he fears for his life since he divulged so much information. To which he replies (and to paraphrase), his death would lead to more copies of his book being sold, thus more publicity about the evil empire seeking to crush the little people of this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was pretty excited when I started this book but I had to make myself finish it.

Then bashes Reagan, Bush Sr., Bush Jr. and conveniently skips over 8 years of Clinton.His leftist agenda and conspiracy theory type story is interesting, but credibility is damaged by his obvious and thinly vailed liberal views.Chances are if you are liberal you will love the book and if you are more conservative you will not."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Empire - Get Educated!","review":"Length:: 5:08 MinsThis book is a real eye opener about what is happening around the world.

It's the story of economic injustice, environmental disaster and tragic warfare.Critics, however, cast Perkins' credibility into question. If your sociopolitical outlook falls to the left of the political spectrum, you'll find that Perkins' story corroborates a lot of your beliefs about America's economic empire and the new world order. If your outlook falls to the right, you'll likely call b.s.In either case, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an interesting tale that's quick and enjoyable to read. Readers with a background in political economy will find it especially interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarrassingly poor treatment of an important topic","review":"I wish I read the reviews before purchasing this book.

It also makes clear sense of international trade agreements, and how US policy makers have used World Bank loans to ensure compliance with US foreign policy objectives. Even for someone like myself, who has an interest and reads widely in contemporary politics, the book revealed depths of cynicism in our government's policies that i was unaware of.My only caveat is that it is difficult to fully sympathize with the author -- i wanted to like him, but he keeps repeating that he knew what he was doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Economics, Not Politics, Lots of Feelings","review":"This book is supposedly about an interesting topic - the economic interactions of developing nations and industrialized ones, but the topic has been written about better and in more detail elsewhere. The author admits to not having ever regarded himself as an economist, so it is not surprising that he fails to actually talk about economics, but he does not really even talk much about international politics, or any sort of factual events in any depth; he simply rehashes the fact that American corporations work with politicians to unfairly take advantage of developing nations. The book is about him more than anything else, specifically his personal feelings about the events of his own life.If you want to read an unpoetic exposition of the feelings of a not particularly gifted writer, this is the book for you. If you want to read about corporate imperialism, international economics, or politics look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"still a selfish egocentric prick","review":"I first heard John at Powell's in Portland several months ago and saw him on Democracy now.

It starts good, and gets worse as it goes, but luckily it is an easy read so I didn;t waste too much time.

Otherwise, donate your time and energy to a good cause.The premise fits well with my overall view: no conspiracy but the belief system and social constructs of Americans, especially powerful and influential people, allow us to exploit the world and remain blissfully unaware of the suffering we create and/or exacerbate. However, the book doesn't stand up to critical reading: facts at key points are missing, many incidents are too cliché, dialogue is too smooth and trite, the author claims too much prescience and understanding during his younger years, it all fits so neatly together and has none of those nasty contradictory facts that real events generate as a matter of course.

Well, in fact Arnulfo Arias was freely elected and overthrown 11 days into his presidency by the military (yes, Torrijos did not particpate, he overthrew his comrades a while later). The saga spiraled down all the way down to Noriega.

But the author is late. He should have come out many years earlier. The damage is done and new tactics are in the air. He is a has-been, and should be safe now. But many people suffered by his hand. He is making great money, I'm sure now. Plus he also has a cultic intrest-astral travel books that sound even scarier than his previous involvment. His book can lead to a loss of patriotism and lack of faith in gov't and people as happened in Russia during Glasnost and the Yelstin era. What good are confessions to the church, make them to the priest and go after the sins. Maybe he is doing that now, and definately I believe his life story.

John Perkins goes a long way towards explaining the reasons for this widely held dislike. This book should encourage readers to look carefully at, and read between the lines when our news media and others, present us mere mortals with arguments in support of political, corporate or religious aggression, espoused by the priviledged few, especially if they happen to be American. A very good book which should become compulsary reading for all secondary school children throughout the world.

The author's frequent bouts with guilt feel gratuitous (enough with the mea culpas; we get it already), but the fragmented tales of empire building draw the reader in. Perkins' lack of substance regarding several key issues, including those whom he calls jackals, creates deserved skepticism. By contrast, his first-hand experiences in the exclusive game of international shadow politics is sometimes revelatory (yet ultimately much like what many of us already guessed but never had the proof). Conspiracy theorists will read this book with Biblical reverence while the rest of us should simply admire it for what it is: a fascinating, if flawed, personal confession from a cog in an immense, ethereal machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This book has been out since 2004.

Thus, the reality is probably far worse than the text.This book has received many undeserved negative review on Amazon. Having personally spoken out against a corporation as evil as those described by Perkins, I find the personal attacks upon him convincing evidence that he speaks the truth, for if these corporate devils are apt at anything, it is sending their brainless minions to discredit those who speak the truth to power.Buy this book.

With the benefits of an economic expose of the United States dealings and malipulation of third world countries. I recomend this book for someone who wants the knowledge of a political expose with the intrigue and story line of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Serving Drivel","review":"Perkins was an economic hit man, acting as a consultant who helped strong arm less developed countries into being saddled with debt they would be unable to pay. This strategy enriches American companies, and makes indebted countries obligated to serve US interests. In doing so, poor people become more impoverished, sensitive ecosystems are destroyed, and future generations suffer.All the while Perkins created inflated economic forecasts to justify irresponsible lending by the World Bank and other financial behemoths, he claims to have felt guilty. Guilty all the way to his bank...To assuage his guilt, he tries to equate how the general population benefits from lower prices based upon the work he has done, making us all his moral equivalent.[...]Perkins has a story to tell. His constant whining about his feelings, while getting richer and taking bribes throughout many decades, sickens me.He should tell his story, and let his actions speak for his feelings.

Stories of the author's experiences in South America will give you some satisfaction. Sadly, truth is not always as interesting as fiction - there is no MASTER PLOT uncovered in this book.Also, the writing was a little \\"inelegant?\\" at times - could have been tightened-up a bit.But, unless you're intimately interested in this subject, this book should do nicely - just enough to keep you on your toes about the global economy and all the \\"good\\" it brings to third world economies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions of a Fake","review":"The author has a decent writing style and tells a good tale, but I think his perception of his role in world events is over-inflated. His secret meetings with NSA and that Agency's supposed obsession with recruiting him is simply ludicrous. That portion alone pegs this dude as a secret agent wannabe. Nice try."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"I just finished this book. It was terrible. I was expecting some juicy personal insight into some vast conspiracy I was unaware of, but instead it's a boring diatribe by a new age junkie who thinks he is a corporate Jesus Christ. Be ready for a rambling lecture of his conspiracy theories, much of which are conjecture and unproven. You would expect a \\"confession\\" to mean a personal view on the events he talks about as in HE WAS THERE, but no - this book feels like it was written by my yoga instructor.

I guess this did lead to his divorce...so sad.Oh and then he saw some poor people and something inside said, mommy...Anyway John, you're the one making millions here and I'm just writing a review...and not getting paid.

A must read for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Fiction!","review":"It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is scum","review":"In spite of all the moralizing, the whining, and the handwringing, he just keeps doing it. . . and doing it . . . and doing it . . . for the money! The historical record is really valuable, though disgusting, and I actually recommend reading it for that purpose. But the gorge rises in your throat about the human being. I'd encountered John Perkins in his persona as \\"shuar shaman,\\" actually once attended an all-day seminar of his in the nineties, and wondered where he got the money to live that life style. Well, now we know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For History look elsewhere, for a sound, engaging critique read it.","review":"John Perkins was interviewed by Leonard Lopate on WNYC Radio in New York. You can listen to the interview and make your own decision about John's book.http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/11082004Note: Although many other books have been written about how U.S. aid policy has been used as a means of manipulating foreign countries, the fact remains that John Perkin's book is from an insiders perspective. It exposes the truth behind how corporate greed has hijacked U.S. Foreign Policy. You can find many more books on the facts and history but for a sound, engaging critique read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be interesting, but....","review":"They may have trained him to become an Economic Hit Man, but obviously book writing was not part of the training course. The way chapters are organized does not make a lot of sense. He starts talking about Iraq, and a couple of paragraphs later, the story switches to Latin America.He tries to paint himself as a good guy by providing his regrets here and there, but he just keeps doing it. Overall, I also sensed that there are some degrees of exaggerations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Much Better","review":"When I saw this book at the book store, I just had to buy it because not only did it look incredibly interesting, but the cover looked pretty darn neat.After the first few chapters, a few things became apparant. Not only was the book very vague, but John Perkins keeps referring to his moral tug of war. Which was so incredibly repetitive, that it just made me want to return the book and find something else to read. But I kept with the book to only realize that the dialogue was very poorly written and unrealistic. I then realized that his job as an \\"economic hit man\\" was no where near as interesting as the blurb on the back of the book leads the reader to beleive.This book could have been a masterpiece given the subject at hand. But the writing and amateur story telling leave this book a confusing mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulist?","review":"I read this book until I just couldn't take it anymore. I'd heard someone describe the book and was anxious to get the inside scoop on how the world bank and other international lenders are screwing poor countries, but this book became less and less believable the more I read it. It doesn't feel like an honest account, it reads like fiction, posing as non-fiction. It's either the result of a horrible writer who can't get past his ego to tell what really happened, or it's a con, or disinformation. I feel cheated that I spent money on this book.Oh, and on the possibility that it is a truthful account, John Perkins is an unconscionable a**h*le trying to squeeze a little more profit out of his career of bad deeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make money......","review":".....first, Perkins claims to have conned nations into plunging themselves into monster-debt scenarios, second, Perkins feels awful about it whilst touring the Amazon, third, Perkins writes a book, telling us how bad he was.If there ever has been a shallow, basic (if not simplistic) and hair-raising account of how the American corporate world conquers the rest of the globe - this is it.To trump it all: admitting to having made good money when acting as an EHM, Perkins now seeks to capitalize on his confessions. An utter waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Contrite","review":"I have no doubt that much, but not all, of what Perkins describes in this book actually took place and his telling can be interesting at times. What really clued me in to the fact that he is capable of stretching the truth were his descriptions of Ground Zero after 9/11. I lived at the corner of Liberty and West Side Highway on 9/11 and can say, based on my own experience, that this part of the book is pure fiction. Perkins wants the reader to feel his pain and guilt for having been an EHM but I never got the feeling he was being genuine. He kept going back for second helpings. He rambles while trying to be descriptive and the result is page after page of quite boring reading. This is an OK book to buy if you can find it used and cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I am strongly recommended for this book and the vendor is great book for all of us to understand who we really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt made up","review":"Just finished the book and have to say the author's stories seemed very contrived. While many historical facts are presented like the Iraq War or the Control of Panama Canal, the author's stories of meeting \\"local people\\" seem made up and don't provide any useful evidence to the reader beyond attempting to help the author's own conspiracy agenda. I was hoping for a lot more from this book, but it fails in so many ways, and believe this guy is in the same category as James Frey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent inside story","review":"This is an excellent inside story that has been cleverly hidden for years by the US administration. Unfortunately, the same scenario is at large even now."},{"rating":"1","title":"True or not, just not a very well written/interesting book","review":"Whether or not you accept the premise of this book, its unfortunately not very well written. The author repeatedly states his premise (corporations are putting countries into debt to make them beholden to the US and build an empire) with only very scattershot details. Considering the title of the book, I really expected some \\"confessions\\" that would make for a more interesting read.I heard about this book on the Randi Rhodes show on Air America, so no doubt I fit in the target audience for the book. I just want to be honest and say you don't really need to read this book. You can pretty much get everything you need to know from the back cover. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"While it does contain a few interesting bits here and there (mainly in the first half of the book) this book fails to live up to the buzz surrounding it. There were few actual \\"insider\\" details (or details of any kind, in fact) and the author's voice grated on my nerves -- very self-serving. I suppose those interested in U.S. foreign and overseas development policy during the Cold War and post-Cold War era will find it worth reading, but getting through it is something of a chore. It took all my will power to plow through the last quarter of the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in rationalization","review":"Author's unique position as an economic/development consultant enables him to provide a view of globalization that questions many conventional theories about benefits of international trade and its positive effects on citizens of poor nations. However this book was, by author's own admission, written over many years and a few failed attempts. Unfortunately it shows.It's frustrating that many revelations about exploitation of world's poor that could be much better understood by providing good data and statistics, that the author should be in a great position to gather, is missing.Confession can be a means to admit and accept ones failings. This book does not allow the reader to sympathize with the author simply because it is overly littered with rationalizations for why, in spite of all the opportunities for atonement, author continued on a career he always believed was hurting millions of people around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and Utter Drek","review":"This has got to be the sorriest book I have ever read. John Perkins spends most of his time in the book lamenting the part he feels compelled to play and expects us to sympathize with him when he final gets the intestinal fortitude necessary to do something about it? He made his money regardless. My biggest regret is that he will continue to be enriched by the book itself. Last, I found myself questioning the premise of the book in the first place which claims that EHM's exist as a new/special entity. It's not like we ever needed the NSA or any other intelligence agency to establish a corporatocracy, it was bound to happen on it's own. My 2 cents? Save your money, you will learn nothing new, only listen to the ramblings of some born again globalist. We all know the problem anyway. Better to concentrate on finding a solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Perkins is an anti-Israel bigot","review":"I read his book which has many excellent ideas on how to make this world a better place. Unfortunately, that world that he envisions is a wold with out Israel. I just heard him tell an audience on c-span \\"why did we (the US)put the Jews in the Middle East in the middle of all of those Arabs.\\" He is clearly part of this new radical left-wing anti-Israel anti-Jewish bigots. I am very sorry that I bought his book. I highly recommend that anybody who believes that Israel has a right to exist not to put money into the coffers of this bigot. What I heard him say on c-span to this Israeli women demonstrates what an indecent human being John Perkins really is. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hypocritical essence of the American dream??!!!","review":"Is it just me or isn't this guy the hypocritical essence of the American dream??!!!

I kept reading hoping for one concrete fact about how his work affected the world, but got so bored listening to his guilt ridden rants and female relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have confessed on the internet and supplied it for free","review":"If Perkins really feels remorse and regret he should have made a fact-based report and posted it online for free on the Internet. It seems he is pulling yet another scam by selling a story that no one should buy. Moreover, he should seek forgiveness by donating the millions to the poor people in the developing countries, which he received while operating as an EHM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you think, but not exactly what he wants you to think","review":"Narcissistic? Yes. Short on details and big on vague generalities? Yes. Outright lies? [Shrug] This book probably has enough truth to hook some otherwise intelligent readers and enough misleading information to make reading it almost useless. However, if you are of the there's-got-to-be-a-lot-of-bad-people-taking-advantage-of-all-us-common-folks persuasion, then this is the book for you. It does a good job of separating the credulous from the critical reader. It also does a good job of boring most of us with Perkins' shallow naval-gazing and contrived self-flagellation. If you read it, try to remember what a truly well-documented and supported work actually looks like. And, for heavens sake, make the contrast. BTW, on a personal level, I'm most affronted by his blatant lies concerning SIL and the (mostly) wonderful people that devote their lives to making the world better for so many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but better to listen to Audio Book","review":"THe book is very wordy BUT there are bits of gold sprinkled throughout. I recommend listening to the audiobook rather than waste your eyes trying to read it. There tends to be alot of breezy chit chat about his experiences that are unrelated to the context of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Self-Absorbed","review":"I'm not quite sure what Perkins is trying to do here. For liberals who read extensively, there's really nothing new. We already know that \\"economic development\\" is a raw deal foisted upon money-poor countries. We've known that for years. And it's a fairly commonplace observation that debt-servicing and import replacement are scams desgined to keep the rich finance institutions on top forever.But Perkins writes as if he is the first guy to actually break the silence and bring these startling revelations to the world. It just doesn't wash. I'm sure he's telling the truth about most things, and I would imagine that some of the dialogue is a bit artificial. But it really doesn't matter much. It just reads like a novelistic foreground account, written for folks who find reading background macro-material too stale.I would say don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remembrances of John Nash and A Beautiful Mind?","review":"Has anyone else made the connection of this memoir to John Nash's A Beautiful Mind? You'll recall that in that movie John Nash is visited by secret intelligence agents, works on secret intelligence projects.... and you know the end of that story. It was all in his mind.I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it as light history and travel reminiscences. The critique of U.S. foreign policy rings true, particularly in countries we've invaded for commercial gain.As to the alleged official goal of U.S. policy to bankrupt other countries, that is a long stretch; not that there aren't kernels of truth, but on the whole, the thesis and the James Bond intrigue is unconvincing. The author's own megalomania/depression/angst gets tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"confessions of a boring sychophant","review":"I gave this worthless book to a friend so that he would have something to use as kindling in his fireplace. I cannot comprehend all of the adulatory reviews. Mr. Perkins advances our understanding of the gangsters out to destroy us not one iota.Readers and researchers would be much better served to purchase the books of the last great American patriot Eustace Mullins instead (Secrets of the Federal Reserve & The World Order).Mr. Mullins is a researcher without peer, and lays bare the nature and history of the true gangsters who are out to destroy us, fiscally and otherwise...."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth...","review":"This is the most awe-inspiring, and provocative book that I've ever read. I've found myself between a couple pages thinking \\"how could they do that? Why?\\" This has further heightened my desire to research into the corporation, money, and the manipulation that our \\"system\\" relies on every day. Well worth the while. I've started reading his sequel, and it has exceeded my expectations with more info and more interviews and quotes from the hundreds of people that have come forth. Man, just buy it, borrow it, steal it... what ever you have to do to soak in the information that John has to offer. (Try not to steal it...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. At times that entire concept seems far-fetched, not in the fact that this couldn't happen, because it most likely does. But, the fact the Perkins offers almost no credible evidence to back him up, and claims that the company was very secrative about their work. You would think that through all his years with all the guilt he claims to have, he could easily have come up with some sort of paper trail to support his story.Perkins has a very detatched perspective in that he claims to feel bad about what he has done, and claims to have felt that way while doing it (also claims to have gone out of his way to learn about what the people of the countries he was out to destroy economically were all about) yet continues anyway. It seems that he now feels that all is o.k. because he wrote a book about his misdeeds to expose the system, 30 years later, that he claims to have had a major roll in creating."},{"rating":"2","title":"One side of the story.","review":"I'm not going to waste time re-writing what everyone else had to say. Every story has two sides, and I read this as more/less an autobiography - which is what it's intended to be! I didn't read it as an authoritive history book, as it looks like most other people have.This is one side of the story. There are others, but this one is the personal story of Perkins, which happens to be quite an interesting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opener","review":"If you want to understand \\"why they hate us\\" and the real reasons behind the US foreign policies, read this book.It's very well written, I just wish the author gave more details sometimes. It's shocking, provocative, and makes a great case against US capitalism as a model of society."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be surprised how interesting this book is!","review":"If you are interested in understanding how international politics and business go hand in hand through dirty deals, and read interesting real-life stories which proves the points and shows how history is made, then this is the book for you. Those who write that this book lacks credibility because it has few or \\"vague\\" facts are obviously just trying to smear it for personal political reasons. This book can easily be compared and ranked with other factual and interesting books like The best democracy money can buy, No Logo, Stupid White Men, Fast Food Nation, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Magazine Feature Stretched to Fill a Book","review":"Perkins provides precious little detail in his work as an \\"Economic Hit Man.\\" First, the book is about making other countries dependent on foreign debt. This is not news and being the economist who creates the lofty projections does not a hit man make. There is none of the cloak-and-dagger intrigue that you might expect.Second, Perkins never discusses what he actually did. In nearly 300 pages he simply says he \\"cooked the books.\\" This gloss deadens a book that might have had some real meat. Indeed, an account of 1970s and 80s Jakarta is really neat and vivid, but that can be accomplished in 5,000 - 10,000 words. Where is an explanation of the assessment process, a comparison of reality vs. his projects, etc.?At best, this is a \\"tell-some\\" book, with a lot of lofty conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Disappointing","review":"Perkins does a pretty good job of starting off this chillingly exciting topic before the story quickly erodes into a repetitive onslaught of bragging. For me, the stories were not believable. Read Gary Webb if you want a true account of the business of War. Save your money and time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought I would learn a lot of interesting \\"insider's\\" information in this book and frankly I'm wondering if the author has ever been an economic hitman as he pretends he was, because all he is describing can be found in other mainstream books and medias. So if you want to learn the hidden mechanisms of economic colonisation you'de better choose another source!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty dealings of the corporate government","review":"I always love a book that is not only informative but is engaging. This book has both of these qualities. If you want to be enlightened as to the tactics that have made the US and those massive corporations what they are, Perkins will most definitely open your eyes.Well worth the read, dirty tricks for the 'white collar world' exposed. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to know truth and get their head out of the sand and stop being an ostrich. If this book doesn't make you mentally sick, you're probably beyond help anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fly","review":"The author claims we built infrastructure for countries who couldn't/didn't pay us for them. Doesn't sound like a great idea to me. I don't doubt that there are social and environmental problems associated with oil production and these should be addressed, but this book does not really make sense. Would the world be better off without globalization? How would backwards countries ever get started on the road to a modern state? Remember along with some negatives, a modern state means health care, education etc. The author suggests that corporations should have as their major goal helping poor countries rather than profits. Bet they wouldn't be major corporations very long with that attitude and by the way, What would the stockholders think? Bottom line, the author doesn't make his case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really makes you think...","review":"This book was amazing. It really make you think about how corrupt the US really is and how it will go to any legnths to get money and power. It made me feel guilty to be apart of this counrty but at the same time it gave me knowledge and information that i couldn't have found anywhere else. It was not only well written but it also has suspense and tragedy just like a good novel should. It was easy to read and Perkins describe all of the statistical and economic steps that might confuse readers and steer them away from a political book. I felt that every page was important and couldn't keep my eyes off it. I would recomend this book to everyone, and especially to those who need an economical and political awakening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money!","review":"If you want to read a book that glorifies tin pot dictators and excuses terrorism this is the book for you. This book has little real economic content and Author has little real understanding of capitalism or modern economics. The Author has an agenda of socialism and anti-Americanism that is easily apparent from the start of the book. If you are looking for an Anti-American rant that blames America and capitalism for all the worlds environmental and economic problems you found the right book. The book consists of rant after rant against capitalism, repeats previously discredited conspiracy theories as fact and appears to be nothing but a cry by the Author for you to feel sorry for him. Don't waste your money or your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"This exposes globalization for what it is - a system set up to backrupt and steal the resources of third world counties. It been going on for hundreds of years - it continues to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too-late lamentations of a willingly seduced con man","review":"The negative reviews have covered the reasons why this book fails. First, Perkins is no economist. His 'hit man' work had nothing to do with economics; it had to do with his own personal greed and ambition. Second, he happily allowed himself to be seduced by Claudine, money, perks, and exotic locales. Third, he had no scruples. Bad enough that he knew little practical economics, he was more than happy to make up numbers to please his bosses and maintain his lifestyle. He knew what he was doing was wrong almost from the start. Fourth, even hit man who confess deserve to be punished. It is hard to simply say \\"I'm sorry\\" and ask to be considered a whistleblower.The overall feel of the book is some sick parody of economic aid efforts or, worse, a tragic version of Austin Powers, Man of Mystery. If the results were not so sad, one could almost laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns the stomach - - - against the bogus author","review":"Not much worth saying that hasn't already been well said by this book's detractors who have accurately reviewed it here. If you want to read it, go ahead. You will likely fall in one of two categories--good people who know how to think for themselves and believe in what this country stands for and people who regurgitate a nasty, anti-American agenda without forethought or logic.Just look a couple of reviews below. If you are the latter, then you probably believe that this book must be true because so many people here say that it is bogus. How utterly inane is that? Really, that kind of thinking is so grotesquely irrational as to defy any further comment. Same with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda.","review":"What a fraud. I'm an open minded person, but this is over the line. It wreaks of progressive talking points and the actual story is a complete fabrication (PERIOD!). This is a liberal's pipe dream of an \\"evil capitalist's\\" tell-all.

The arguments and accounts put forward by Perkins are incredible or, incredulous. He is obviously no \\"spy\\" and works for no US government agency. His characters around the world are only regurgitating his own monotone voice. How did his editors let this slip past the review? The book is just kind of repulsive. Jesus appears before him?Perkins is just another greedy consultant tied in with world financing institutions. His retrospective does not reconcile with the historical facts or conventional realities. The US government and its businessmen may do lots of things that are directly and indirectly assailable as unethical. But, his thesis in Confessions is ridiculous even to persons such as me with biases to believe him."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRITTEN BY A COMPLETE EGOMANIAC","review":"This book is less about historical accuracy than it is about John Perkins' ego. I'm angry that I spent my hard-earned cash on this \\"People Magazine\\" of an expose. I am sickened that he lifted the Iran portion of his \\"story\\" straight from Stephen Kinzer...(he did credit Kinzer, but regardless, this story had already been told, and told well). I'd just finished reading \\"All the Shah's Men,\\" which evoked such memorable images of Kermit Roosevelt, the Iranian nationalist leader Mohammed Mossadegh, Reza Shah and the 1953 coup, and I didn't appreciate Perkins simply re-telling it, using all of Kinzer's energetic & descriptive writing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.If you're searching for factual books on contemporary or historical events, go to the men and women who have stellar reputations. This guy is a wimp, an exaggerator, probably a liar, and an egomaniac with an inferiority complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant and riveting tale, fact or fiction.","review":"Many reviewers seem to believe this story is too fantastic to be true. I think they are deluding themselves and many should consider that their criticisms would be more appropriately directed toward themselves. I think people use the fictional narrative style of the book to dismiss it as false.Regardless of whether this story is fact, fiction or some of both, it is no less relevant, riveting and realistic. I saw no reason at all to doubt the story and found it disturbingly believable.

The book felt more like a way the author could purge himself of his past sins than writing an informative book about the \\"Economic Hitman's\\" role in changing the history of the world over the past 30-40 years. There are a few bright spots of really great insight and information which is why I gave the book two stars, but for the most part, the book is one long apologize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read - - - not worth the critique","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. Astonishingly bogus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher Integrity? work of fact and fiction","review":"My first inkling this was mixing fact and fiction was when the author claims to have aced his grades at a snooty prep school, won an academic scholarship to college, but then couldnt place Ecuador in South America? Anyway, this guy weaves a tale of US conspiracy involving getting countries hooked Aid money all to the benefit of big corporations and the US. His liberal slant and political agenda ruin an interesting subject, and in my eyes destroy any credibility by mixing BS with actual fact. His mentor is a mysterious woman who is using his NSA profile to seduce him into becoming and Economic Hit Man, oh and Indonesian puppetiers knew of the American Conspiracy to conquer the muslim world as far back as 1971?? A must read for liberals and conspiracy theorists. The publisher should probably be ashamed, but I digress."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Perkins: Fraud","review":"To All:Do not buy this book. John Perkins is a complete fraud. The book is rubbish. The USG and the big banks do enough dirty work. We don't need Walter Mitty's inventing such nonsense. Worked for the National Security Agency, did you? Sure. I suppose the CIA was too old hat for you. For the information of everybody out there, the NSA is the electronic intellgience and code-breaking arm of the U.S. intelligence community. Geeks with earphones and computer nerds. Important work, but the NSA has nothing at all to do with the kinds of things Perkins describes. Want to know what Perkins is? He is a typical gringo goofball who drifted down to Latin America (in this case, Ecuador) and picked up some half-baked nonsense from some leftist books. You find these lost souls all over the place in South America, Central America, and Mexico. He then got the bright idea of inventing his life of darring-do and selling it. Whew! Let this hairball ride on out of town."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Military-Industrial Complex Is Alive and Well, But This Book Isn't.","review":"A few pages of important and discomfiting facts about our criminal national policies (greed and treachery) upholstered at great length in painfully turgid prose evoking words like egotistical, fatuous, pretentious, verbose, pompous, self-indugent, and illiterate. Seldom have there been so many first-person-singular pronouns in such an uninteresting volume. Could no one have edited this book, preferably down to a magazine article?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation and Self-Grandizing","review":"I was only a few chapters into this book when the BS became real apparent. This guy is full of himself and spreading lots of misinformation with no evidence. I worked for the US Government. The US Government is too incompetent to be responsible for the conspiratorial and other things he gives it responsibility for. He loses all credibility with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Ego, Little value","review":"The guy certainly loves himself. Overall I think it is of questionable judgment to place this book in the non-fiction category. The editor could have done everyone a favor and removed all this guys self-aggrandizement and made the book much shorter and more enjoyable to read. If this is even remotely true it is covered up by this guys ego so regardless of where the story goes the reader is turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only got to Chapter 2 and I'm not inclined to continue","review":"Right off the bat I didn't like this book that I was hoping to enjoy. I wanted substantive information and details, instead Perkins regurgitates things such as EHM and Jackals and \\"corpatocracy\\" with no facts. It is clear right away that he received no training in economics. Like others have said he comes off as egotistical, which I wouldn't mind if he had reason to be, he doesn't. When he made the statement that we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq because our EHM's and Jackals failed in those countries I just wanted to put the book down, it's just false information. Good thing I got this from the library, this book doesn't deserve a profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time will tell.","review":"First of all, I am always suspicious of tell-all books that coincide with current political issues, so I wonder about the author's motivations - is he really coming clean, or grinding an axe?That said, I found the book an easy read, especially for someone who has been keeping up on current events. The author makes some pretty serious claims that, if substantiated by independent sources, could prove newsworthy.Specifically, the author's main story is one of conspiracy and intrigue that reach to the top levels of both government and industry. He claims to have been a loan agent whose task was to mortgage the future of third world nations in order to make them more pliable to US interests. Yes, pretty spectacular stuff - if true.Time will tell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, but the masses will love it","review":"I found this book to be utterly disappointing. As many have written before me, it wasn't credulous, it lacked any real insight, and it got progressively more boring as it went on.Having said that, I'm not surprised that it is a bestseller. People who have a hard time discerning truth and fantasy, particularly economically challenged people looking to back up anti-capitalistic sentiments with \\"reason\\" rather than just emotion, will enjoy the read, however spurious the reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic Hit man","review":"Really interesting book.. you really owe it to yourself to read it. The author definitly get's a bit on the soap-box side, but overall the facts, and conclusions drawn from them are interesting and valuable lessons. Quite honestly after reading this, it will probably change the way I interprete the local news from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Con Job by a Professional Con Man","review":"John Perkins is a self-confessed professional liar. He enjoyed a long and lucrative career doing little but producing cooked economic numbers to justify pillaging the resources of developing countries. Now he has a best-selling book that isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I guess he figures if you're going to be a con man, might as well be a successful one.I don't for a second buy any of the fake angst and bouts of conscience that he supposedly suffers along the way. If Mr. Perkins really hated what he was doing, a very simple solution was always available -- change jobs.I found the sections of the book particuluarly odious when he brags about his ability to become friendly with the 'locals', knowing full well the devastating effects that his bogus economic forecasts would produce for them and their offspring for generations.My recommendation -- don't be conned into buying this book. Get it from your local library, if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of serious consideration","review":"The only revelations in this book are of the author's inflated ego, absent moral compass, and simplistic view of global governance and decision making. In an attempt to justify his own professional misdeeds (which apparently brought him substantial personal wealth), he has written a book that places himself at the virtual centre of a global conspiracy. Unfortunately, Mr. Perkins makes no serious attempt to offer any substance to back his world view. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Someone from within speaks the truth!!!","review":"This books is a great look at exactly how the U.S. economic emperialism has been at work during the 70's and 80's. The truth as is expected is very disturbing. The author is really trying to expose the system of the World Bank for what it is and really tries to shake the people who benefit from this awake and get them to open there eyes and pull off the blinders to recognize the truth about how the American Government and Corporations work so digustingly together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra, Extra . . . Hit Man's Lies Snuffed Out by Truth","review":"OK, imagine reading this book about our nation's supposed wrongdoings across the globe, primarily hearing about misuse and abuse of debt vehicles to lesser developed countries as a means to entrap and enslave their leaders as American yes-men. Well, imagine further setting the book down for a moment and un-muting CNN just as George W. Bush and Tony Blair are telling the world of their intentions to forgive all third world debt.Um, come again?I see that the reviewer before me has noted the very same. And, I thought I was breaking the latest news.It seems this development has shattered even my best effort to believe these tall tales. You had me there for a moment, John. Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mr. Perkins:","review":"Normally, I'd be eager to read a book such as your\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" and today Inearly bought it.

Pissed about it.","review":"My econ prof required our class to read this book. This is not about economics. This is not about the NSA or CIA or any intelligence services manipulating the third world. This is not about spies and clandestine affairs around the globe. This is a book slamming America. I am outraged that a book like this even gets published. I am appalled that a teacher would actually believe there is anything worth reading in this. I am just generally pissed off that I was forced to read such a negative, awfully un-American book. It's a joke. Perkins is a joke. My class is a joke. That's what's wrong with the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening","review":"I am so happy I read this book. It has really evolved my perception of current events, and the way we look at history and the global economy. As an Economics major I've always been taught capitalist endeavors and globalization were GREAT for the world economy.. Learning a different perspective has been so refreshing! I wish they made students read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly, worst book ever to be read","review":"Read a Couple of the one star reviews and you will get it. I guess this guy sent it to the right publisher and they killed some trees for it. Anyway its basically this guys middle school spy fantasy mixed with his own personally slanted view of global economics that he turned into a book his second year of grad school. Pretty Bad...But on the positive end he probably got some great royalties checks from it (which he should give directly to whoever did the cover art, which is great, and probably why most people purchased this junk - why i did.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"None of this is new to me. The machinations behind global empire have been exposed by Greg Palast in his wonderful book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy. What makes this book different is that it reads like a spell binding and absorbing spy novel. Mr. Perkins takes us on a wild ride and succeeds in masterfully connecting the dots. The origins of terrorism become more clear. The reasons for the abject poverty in developing countries can be seen as a direct result of greed at the very highest levels--not only in the corporate world, but in our own government as well. It would be easy to feel cynical after reading this book, but Perkins redeems himself throughout by constantly questioning his mission. He has subsequently done much to give back to those who suffered under the system that spawned him and other EHM. Visiting his website and learning how we as individuals can help alleviate the inequities in the world gives me a renewed sense of hope. Well done Mr. Perkins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read, Good Book, Regardless of Politics","review":"I have recommended this book to a lot of people, and loaned my copy out; not because it is the best written or most informative about the subject (IMF, World Bank, globalism, etc.), but because it is a quick read, interesting story, and gives a nice intro into the subject. It gives somewhat of a personal view into the sitations, and is so easy of a read, that its great for someone looking into the subject that has incited so much debate across the earth. But if you are well-educated about the subject, this book will be of no interest to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous twit","review":"What an incredible pompous twit. I wanted to strangle this guy, just from his writing style. Its as if he saved the world by writing this (really, really poorly written) book.The story is interesting. I have little doubt that a lot of it is true, but MY GOD, this guy cannot write at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Piece of Worthless Propaganda","review":"Ug. Where should I begin? This book was a HUGE waste of time. First of all, I found Mr. Perkins' discussion of his own internal moral conflict as self-righteous and BORING.Second of all, Mr. Perkins is no economist and as such, his denouncement of free trade and over-simplified views on US monetary policy should be treated as trash. I feel sorry for people who read this, do not think beyond the surface and take all Mr. Perkins says as fact. For real economic analysis, I'd suggest reading something else.Finally, as far as Mr. Perkins \\"shocking\\" conspiracy theories... unless you've been living under a rock, you will have read these all before in Vanity Fair and/or in the New York Times. Do not waste your money on this book -- it is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self aggrandizement hiding as an expose","review":"When I saw this book at an airport bookstore I was thrilled. Finally, I thought, a book worth reading in this pulp fiction emporium. I would have been better off buying some of the pulp fiction.The author, by himself, molded the direction of world politics until he saw the light of the evil he was committing. This book was supposed to enlighten us on what one will do to go after the bucks. I must admit, I did get the answer to that question. Write a piece of trash and market it as an expose of the exploits of capitalism. Oh, excuse me, this book was an exploit of capitalism snaring the wary reader who wanted to learn something about the clandistine activities of big business. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ AND PITY OTHERS WHO GOT SNARED. I even got upset enough to send the author a well crafted critique. Guess what - I never got an answer, guess there was no profit in doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-righteous mumbo jumbo. Nothing of significance","review":"This book should be used for toilet paper. It shares nothing that the general public does not know. The author really hasn't repented despite feeling guilty about different things he has been involved it. There is no such thing as an EHM, only a sexy name given to themselves. There job is only to inflate things and paint a rosy picture. I cannot believe that huge companies belive that their false and rosy economic forecasts is the truth. It is asinine to think that the government s of the third world countries blindly buy into this just for thier own corrupt purposes. So what if these EHM did not do it. Someone else from other countries will do it. I think you just got hit by an EHM to buy this book or else?????? the jackals will come. It is only a woe is me book. Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmm...what happened in June","review":"Looking at all the negative reviews that all of a sudden started happening in June, it is pretty obvious somebody is running scared or concerned. For all the open minded people; read first and then judge afterwards...This book has opened my eyes to the inner workings of Halliburton, Bechtel and the big oil companies influences...The author does cite enough references at the end of the book to check on the sources of his information. As to whether he was a egotistical in his younger years and devoid of doing the right thing; yes he was...So what, none of us were mature enough in our 20's and 30's either..But what he has to say now is still very invaluable eventhough it might be born of guilt.His solution is simply the conservation of our resources and is not asking for anything more. So, what are you afraid of from this book. The truth or that the you may not get my money?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting!","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book - very interesting although in some places I would have liked a bit more detail.It's a great overview of how world events influenced by economics have come to pass. If your knowledge of how world events have occured is spotty, then this is a great read.John Perkins should write a novel based on this in the nature of the Da Vinci code to really annoy the bleaters here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Bogus book","review":"This is the type of book where the guy claims to be a \\"James Bond\\" type character but his sense of morality made him quit it even though he was making \\"tons of money\\".An example of the \\"conspiracies\\" he claims happen throughout the world are when the United States sends Flour to Haiti to feed the starving people, this \\"author\\" would claim that the real reason we sent flour was to destroy their rice industry and make them dependent on American Wheat growers!If you believe in totally unbelievable and easily disaproved conspiracies running the world, this is your book. Before you buy this book take a look at his other book titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keen Insight Into U.S. Policy","review":"Just finished reading -- and it was a good read. I don't often read these kinds of books but it was really helpful in sorting out the U.S. and the World Bank's agendas in underdeveloped countries.I appreciated the angst of the author but it wore pretty thin by the final third of the book. Completely expect to see this on the big screen very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and daring","review":"Perkins is no great thinker, but his book is extremely interesting and not only that: Its truthfull to the bone. He pretty much confirms what American statesman Lyndon LaRouche and others have been saying for 40 years. The phenomonen of the economic hitmen has been around for centuries, and exists today more than ever. Their greatest deceit is that the public doesn't know about them, because if they did, they wouldn't accept them. Their looting of 3rd world countries only benefit the big corporations, and not the population of the Western World in general (which would be no excuse either).A brave and honest book, that puts a face on some of the real \\"bad guys\\" of Western Civilization (George Schultz, Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Bush Family)."},{"rating":"2","title":"you never read the news the same again","review":"so, this is how the world works. My favorite quote: \\"there are no loyalties, think roylaties ...\\" for sure applies. If you like to complain about \\"foreign US aid\\", you might want to read how that aid in fact stimulates our economy. How do they do that? An excellent, thought provoking read that reveals one of the most critical hidden agendas of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit me and put me out of my misery","review":"It was a good story, possibly worthy of an Atlantic or Vanity Fair printing, but to make a whole book of it was a great stretch. The last half of the book was interminable; I only finished the book because I started it.Perhaps had this book been ghost-written it would have been more tolerable. But once the novelty of the story wears off (about halfway through the book) the amateurish writing style becomes grating. This is nothing new. I've read books by several successful businessmen who thought they were authors, and they just don't have it. Give me Fitzgerald or Dostoyevsky anyday. I am not a good writer, but I recognize one when I see one, and John Perkins is not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend this book","review":"Should have been titled \\"Confessions of an Conspiracy Theorist\\" as it appears to be a totally anti-American hit piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is delusional","review":"The kindest thing I can say about this book is that the author made up the title & the foreward to make it sound exciting so people would buy the book. That's part of the reason I did. That, and the fact that he talked his way into being scheduled to give a speech at the Wharton School of Business when I was there (which was mysteriously cancelled at the last minute....)The author states that the US has undermined governments and propped up dictators where it thinks it has been in its citizens best long-term interests to do so. Oh wow - really?He then goes on to say that consultants sometimes say what their clients want to hear. That's too shocking!These two \\"revelations\\" are somehow combined into a scheme whereby the US governments gets the IMF etc to bankrupt countries so it can extend its empire. Examples quoted where this happened are Columbia, Ecuador, Iran.... Anyone see a problem with this theory?"},{"rating":"1","title":"fiction written badly","review":"I found this work lacks any credibility. Usually a biographical work contains detail that makes for a story . This book does not and fails miserably as a story or as non-fiction . I would venture that it was written by a conspiracy theorist with a james bond complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of this Book is BS, But if true, SO WHAT?","review":"Seriously, the New York Slimes said this book is BS, the New York Commie times who jump on anything anti-American, and the Washington Compost too, los of holes, lots of BS, but my main thing is, what if it's not? Do I care? Answer, NO!So we upped the debt of countries where political influence was needed, GREAT. Glad to see the gov't is doing something to keep the world safe, because guess what? If Iran continued to do business with the USSR and they got their oil instead of us, we would have been screwed in the Cold War, we got the job done, this is chess it's not checkers.Most people who read this book already have it in their heads that the US is an evil empire out to control the world and this feeds that, this tells them what they want to hear, throw in some figures, some percentages, and BOOM instant \\"facts\\" and people use them to convince others of foolishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Impressed as I Hoped","review":"I was hoping for more than the tale of Super E-Man who falls into the job.

If you are going to read fiction - at least read good fiction. The book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it until the very end.","review":"Poorly written and poorly reasoned, I didn't get it until the very end, when I realized that Mr. Perkins is appalled that the world is run by evil, one might even say sinful, men. Obviously anti-Christian, Mr. Perkins rejects the doctrine of total depravity and chooses to believe that the mostly good, environmentally sensitive population of the earth is oppressed by a complex conspiracy run by a few evil--mostly republican--men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Eye-Opening","review":"A unique perspective on US foreign policy. I just couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake and boring","review":"The author wants to have it both ways - his actions are those of a \\"hit man,\\" yet his moral principles, if he is to be believedd, would entitle him to sainthood. Phoney, self-righteous, with no credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving Confessions","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man--the title is provocative, but that's about it. The 277 pages or so of the new, revised edition are excessive when Perkins could have told his story in less than half that. He spends most of the book hinting at scandal, but gives few real details. I will give him credit for stating the relationship between the economic aid distributed by World Bank and the IMF to the \\"Third World\\" and how their politics keeps these countries impoverished (something that should come to no surprise to anyone in this day and age). However, this book is nothing more than a self-serving \\"tell-all\\" by Perkins who repeatedly says he knows he's doing wrong but decides to stay in for the money, until he has enough to get out. The book is repetitive, too obsessed with his repressed sex life, and definitely not worth buying. It's one of the worst books I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Out Good","review":"Book starts out pretty good. It was hard to put down, but then the author seemed to be more interested in blaming his complicit behaviors on a number of things. It felt like the reader was being used as a conscience clearing mechanism for the author.I admit that I didn't finish the book. I got half-way through it, but it just became so repetitive. Much vagueness in the book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moneymaker hitman","review":"Reading this book and understanding what the author did in Panama and Ecuador is enough to warrant it a 5 star rating. His actions, for the most part, reflect the actions of our goverment when 'moving into' other countries and developing financial lending and payback schemes. Is it wrong for the U.S. to do that? Everyone is entitlaed to their opinion. If we could be fairer and allow the infringed upon countries a bigger peice of the financial pie would generate a more honest working relationship and would garnish a more positive outlook upon us. However, this is the tough path. its rare that corporations will go in and want to hire local managament people at good wages when Americance can be shipped in from here to oversee the process. Some really tricky stuff discussed in this book. Worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too important to not read","review":"Don't be distracted by the Rovian Corporate Party that wishes to divert you from the truth! This book is not Mark Twain but it doesn't need to be. It is a rare look at the inner workings of the power brokers doing their evil work. This book is so rare that anyone with any passion for their fellow human would find it fascinating. Of course those who need to pile millions upon their millions will find it a threat to their own corporate centered domination of the world.

The writing style made it impossible to continue listening after the third CD. Sentences were short, declarative and subjective. I really, really wanted this book to fulfill the potential promised, but the author sounded so immature, naive and obsessesed with women and self promotion that it was impossible to take him seriously. Self involved, superficial fluff about his personal life very little about the potentially fascinating world promised on the cover, I just couldn't keep listening.

However, now it is presented as a personal reflection on a participants life. It feels like fiction and it probably is. In short, he is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich and continuously feels guilty about it, but still confinues this for decades.Why? He is a victim himself. As a youngster he was profiled by the NSA and they exploit their knowlegde of his weaknesses, to make him do these bad things!Some of his weaknesses are poor writing skills, too much fantasy, and a large ego that needs a boring life to be made interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total fabrication","review":"I spent most of my working career overseas on behalf of the U.S. Gov't.There is no such thing as an economic hitman, or any job resembling what Perkins claims he did.This is a total fabrication and Perkins is a con man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm of the typical \\"conspiracy theorist\\" bent. I like books like John K. Cooley's Unholy Wars and I like Noam Chomsky's Understanding Power. Having stated my bias, I was really disappointed in this book. Instead of stating facts, Perkins seems to put in his ideological view every other sentence. A few chapters are good, but a lot starts sounding downright corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unconvincing book I ever read.","review":"Besides the fact that Perkins writes like a child...and a dumb one at that. The only stories that hold up to even the most simplistic criticism are the ones he obviously borrowed from writers like Vidal. Anyone buying into this piece of garbage does so simply because they wanted to before they ever even picked up the book. I actually fell into to this category but by page 50 I was laughing by 130 I returned the book to my local library. Please don't waste your time. I find it hard to believe that a man who writes so poorly and spins such apocryphal yarns would ever be in the positions he claims to have been in in the first place. Another hour of my life wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe him. But why should you or me pay him?","review":"Having grown up in a different country, I heard lot of stories like this before. May be the terminology like EHM is new but nothing else. The content may be new to the general American public. But why is this guy writing this book now? May be he is out of Cash. Dont give him your money. This guy made his living with one of the worst possible jobs in the world, and now want to extort your money by confessing that. Naa.. not falling for that. I didnt buy it, didnt read it. Let him give all the money he make from this book to charity and then I will buy it. Isn't that a good approach folks? Let him die with guilt and he is not the one who deserve any attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too populist to be trusted","review":"What could have been an important book turns out to be populist and untrustworthy due to trying to \\"appeal\\" to a wider audience, I suppose. Instead of all the sex allusions, the proselytizing and romanticizing I would have appreciated the true dry facts by themselves. The subject matter is too serious to be given that sort of treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject Matter, Poorly Written","review":"I couldn't make it through this book.While many of the historical details are fascinating, the writing in this book is appalling. It's a clumsy first-person rumination on how power corrupted a man and how he came to self-realization too late. The personal insights are repetitive and dull. This could have been a great book in the hands of a competent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repressions of An Arrogant Boy Man","review":"If you believe this book is about secret agents and spies and power politics around the world, think again. This book is all about the repressions and regressions of a disturbed man child who does the most peculiar gymnastics from childhood events to adulthood daydreams. Self-importance and some anti-capitalist agenda are the only themes of this book. John Perkins should look in the mirror and say, \\"I am a big boy now. I like me and people do, too. John will be a good boy today and tomorrow. And, he is sorry for being a bad, bad boy up until now.\\"That would be more medicinal and helpful than this nonsense of a book. Nothing here instructive. Nothing here quite believable. Nothing here entertaining. Plenty of negative stuff and America bashing if that's your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flights of fantasy detract from anything worthwhile","review":"If you want a sober, credible, and unforgiving insider critique of the doings of organizations like the IMF and World Bank, get Joseph Stiglitz's \\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\" instead of this bizarre little book. Stiglitz was the World Bank's chief economist so he knows how policy is shaped, and how it fails, at the highest levels. Perkins was just a consultant, one among hundreds, who get paid under contracts funded by organizations like the World Bank, USAID, etc. Somehow Perkins has suffered horrific delusions of grandeur, thinking that he was a principal agent in the downfall of a number of governments, and his cloak-and-dagger stuff is just too much. He was but a foot soldier in the consultancy army, stationed in faraway exotic places--a bit too long for his own good, it appears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaken NOT stirred!","review":"A strange book indeed. Aside from the amazing feats Perkins accomplishes with such mediocre intellectual capital, one should also be impressed by the flower child in him who endured for so long the role of an international pirate extraordinaire. One can also feel a Bond complex behid all this. There is a surreal feel to the whole book not to mention some really bad writing.Of course Corporate America aims to enrich its coffers first and above all. Is anyone really surprised by this revelation?The grand scheme of US generals of capitalism and \\"deep state\\" to control and conquer the World is blown up to impossible proportions. If only these people had displayed a fraction of these skills in managing their corporations and our wars.Unfortunately many of the events and tragic fates of various leaders of countries who tried to resist the US hegomonic policies are closer to truth than fiction. In fact, much of this is printed in your newspaper everyday in gory detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly written, but still terribly important book","review":"given the importance of the subject matter presented in this book, it is highly disappointing that it is written with such poppy sensationalism, in a style that immediately makes the author and his story less credible. in a time when so many of the united states' interests abroad are tangled up in natural resources and huge loans to developing countries, it is critical to understand how our country is manipulating some of the poorest nations in the world to serve its own interests. if you can wade through the amateurish storytelling, what emerges is an interesting, not entirely surprising account of just how this happens. again, important, but just so poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, overly and naively ideological","review":"I was expecting to become better informed on serious international events. I read the critiques, took a shot at the introduction. I'm usually a fairly good judge on books.This book is an exception to the rule. Very poorly constructed for fiction. Very implausible for non-fiction.If Perkins had just told of a life transacting falsely and confessed his role among others and within a larger framework of geopolitical intentions, this may be been a more informative and enjoyable read. This is not at all what Perkins does. The majority of this book is an extreme leftist, quasi Marxist, wholly anti-American tirade. If Michael Moore and Dick Cheney are your idea of idealogues on opposing extremes, Perkins would by comparison become the extremist further to the left still and make them both appear middle-of-the-road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man","review":"This book should be a textbook for all American high schools.

(Can you read?), but the definitive version of this musical","review":"The original Broadway cast album of ZORBA is far superior to the revival with Anthony Quinn. First of all, everyone in this production can actually SING. The orchestrations sound much more Greek than the Quinn revival. John Cunningham and Lorraine Serrabian give more exciting vocal performances and Maria Karnilova is wonderfully touching as the aging Boubilina. Bernardia sounds like he is living life to the fullest as Zorba, while Mr. Quinn sounds like he is collecting a paycheck. I saw this production in NY many years ago and it was one of the most exciting musical I have yet to experience. What a shame that this recording is so rare. Please reissue it soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Score, Amazing Recording","review":"While no recording can match the magic in the theatre of this wonderful but neglected show, this comes close. Hershel Bernardi is far superior to Anthony Quinn in the revival recording. Maria Karnilova is wonderfully endearing and Lorraine Sarabian is hauntingly beautiful. While most of the music is superior, \\"The Crow\\" stands out to me as what great music in a musical theatre production is capable of doing in stirring emotion. I also laud the orchestrations by Don Walker.No, this isn't the film score by Manos Hadjidakis, but after listening to his musical \\"Ilya, Darling\\" I'm glad it isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Musical","review":"Zorba is a wonderful musical. It is just a matter of time before it receives the proper recognition. There are two recordings available. The 1968 original cast recording, and the 1983 revival with Anthony Quinn. I prefer the original for two reasons. First, Kander and Ebb wrote this for Herschel Bernardi. Bernardi played Tevye in over 700 performances of Fiddler on the Roof. Quinn is known as Zorba, but Bernardi is better. Second, Zorba is a dark musical and the 1983 revival tried to take some of the edge off. For example, the opening line was changed from \\"Life is what you do, while you're waiting to die\\" to \\"Life is what you do until the moment you die\\". You won't go wrong with either version, but the 1968 Zorba is a gem"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Movie Soundtrack","review":"The album was disappointing as I expected Mikis Theodorakis' music quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did REBIRTH OF MOTHRA 2 have to be so bad?","review":"Well basiclly this is Mothra the giant moth\`s first appearence.

The only problem is the packaging, each film is in a single DVD disc which is great considering some film collection has 4 movies in a single disc (dual layered), the problem is all three discs are stacked one on top of each other, with no dividing panel, if you take good care of your dvd disc, this should not pose as a problem... happy viewing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"I had high expectations for this collection, and while it mostly met them -- bringing out three rare Toho flicks that used to be seen maybe once a year on some weekday afternoon -- when I compare it to the other Toho film series releases currently available (the Godzilla collection from Classic Media and the Tokyo Shock non-Godzilla tokusatsu flicks) it comes up short.The discs are stacked right atop each other with nothing between them, and they are very bare-bones offerings: the original films with English subtitles and the Anmerican-International releases. It is good to see just how the original films differed from the afternoon TV versions I saw, but the former two series of releases included trailers, documentaries, and some very entertaining commentaries by Toho/Godzilla fans of considerable knowledge.

The beats alone are good, and the originals are good, but together, it just sounds recycled, like a forced release thrown together to make a few bucks. There's nothing going on in this EP. Its boring, to say the least. The only reason I've even given it 2 stars is because I think any Cypress Hill is tolerable. Its not so bad you can't listen to it ever, but its bad enough to end up at the bottom of your cd collection. Stick with the originals, they're much better.

When it arrived to my office, I immediately plugged it in to charge it so it would be ready to use when I got home. Once home, I plugged it in and it looked great in my living room. I then took it off its cradle and tried to make my first phone call. There was so much static that I could barely hear the dial tone even while standing right next to the base station. Because this is a DECT phone, there wasn't a way to switch channels as in other cordless phones. I tried relocating the base station to the opposite side of the house and encountered the same problem. I've since returned the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice crisp James Bond short stories!","review":"I have always enjoyed short stories, and when the short stories are James Bond short stories authored by Ian Fleming, what's not to like? Here, there is very little not to like; these James Bond stories (well, one of them is really not a James Bond story, but it's OK) move along quickly and crisply, and feature Fleming's trademark spare, lean style of prose.In my opinion these stories give the reader some idea what the workings of the British Secret Service might be like, and some insight into the character of James Bond, one of the more ambiguous characters in literature. I happen to really like all of the James Bond stories, and I think that Fleming deserves more credit than he gets by critics of literature. James Bond is one of the great figures in action literature, and if the James Bond movies make him into a cartoonish character, that is not true of the novels and stories that Fleming authored. These are great stories.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry?","review":"Five great short stories from the second-master of espionage fiction (behind one Mr. LeCarre).

For some the only similarity is the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody did it better than Fleming","review":"All of Fleming's Bond novels, and most of his short stories, are such a relief to read in today's relativist, anti-patriotic, multi-cultural, male-bashing or emasculating culture.

There are exercises in each chapter I have covered so far which have little to do with the material in the chapter. I have also found material which is introduced with little or no continuity. The language is rigid, and the flow of thought is not linear. Overall, it makes the learning experience less efficient, and more frustrating; it increases the load on the student, who is forced to make the connections himself, instead of presenting them in the text, as appropriate, or introducing them via exercises which connect with the current chapter material.The good part is that there are books out there which, in my personal opinion, and using my understand-o-meter, are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on probability for all but mathematicians...","review":"This book is probably not rigorous enough for a serious mathematics student in probability/statistics, although I am basing this partly on the fact that I (EE Ph.D.) can read and understand this book whereas I can hardly get through a page in a book like Mathematical Statistics by Wilks without extensive background reading. Ghahramani's book has many interesting examples, such as Polya's problems on estimating the number of misprints in a book when two proofreaders each catch a certain (differing) number of mistakes (estimating an unknown frequency). It is quite readable. My only real criticism, and this is not unique to Ghahramani's book, is that \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\" i.e. it is lacking in figures - e.g. if you are going to talk about the central limit theorem, it would be more easily grasped to students to show how the sums of some non-normal distributions quickly approach a normal through a figure or two.

There is a space maybe two inches deep in that compartment--not enough space for anything but the book. There is plenty of space for a laptop in the other compartment, which is designed for it, but if you insert the laptop in the sleeve that comes with the case, there wouldn't be any room for anything else in there.

One of the main reasons to listen to this compact disc is for Barbara Cook's singing capabilities as old maid librarian Marian. Pert Kelton plays her mother. Marian thinks she's better than most of the people in her small Iowa town because she reads French literature but manages to fall in love with the music salesman. Apart from Barbara Cook, I didn't care about the rest of the story. I felt the songs were typical of the musical genre and sometimes annoying but I do feel that it's worth seeing once if not at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic robert preston","review":"though not for everyone, if you enjoy a classic Broadway musical, and a thoroughly classic Broadway performer, then this Original Cast Recording of Robert Preston singing The Music Man can hardly disappoint.

A lot of useful information.One gripe would be that some of the theory later in the book shifts to standard musical notation, straying away from tablature. Since I use tab and much of the other content includes tab, this was a bit disappointing. However, this did not shift my overall enjoyment of the book.If you are looking for a great reference on scales, modes and modal relationships, this is worth a read. (There is more content than scales and modes, but those are what my prime interests in this particular book were)"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book will is a killjoy","review":"This is the worst guitar book I've ever seen. It looks great, because it's full of pictures. However, it's more of a consice encyclopedia than a tutorial. It presents concepts in the most confusing way ever! After studying guitar music theory for two years, I still can't stand to read this book, including the topics that I know well. If you want to learn a good way to think about music theory for guitar, especially if you are a beginner, I suggest you get something else. I suggest books by Wilbur Savidge and Fretboard logic series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, and straight to the point","review":"I never got to read the original Complete Guitarist, which was out of print when I got around to buying this book, but let me say this book is very good. The original, from what I have heard, was more richly illustrated than this book is, but The New Complete Guitarist still keeps the meat and bones of the original. It starts from a complete beginners standpoint (how to hold the guitar), through to advanced scale and chord structures, all the way to how to maintain your guitar. I have had other books on guitar playing, but this one cuts straight to the nitty-gritty. It's basic chords are indispensable for a beginner and the sprinkling of music theory really lets you understand the chords you are playing, instead of tedious memorization. I would recommend this book to anybody who owns a guitar and would like to push themselves further. This book will grow with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't murder music","review":"This is a solid album from Sizzla.

The guy that said this album is murder music is clearly ignoring songs like \\"LIFE IS\\" that says \\"Life is for us to live...\\" and many other positive tunes. Yeah, Sizzla has some controversial views but I think people should try not to say what someone can and can't say...Anyways, the African Children version has another amazing song called \\"Keep in Touch\\" which this album doesn't have, among a few others...if possible, get that one in addition to this...putting them both together makes it an even better album (20 songs!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder Music","review":"If you like music that advocates homophobic murder, this one is for you!

It has a few great photos, such as the cover photo, but mostly the photos are pretty dull and repetitive and don't really say anything about Cuba. The text, mostly by a Cuban writer, is boring waffle with very few facts and historical data. Where are the interesting anecdotes about Ernest Hemingway, or even Fidel Castro and other famous characters and their cars? The wonderful little pocket-size book on Cuban cars by Cristina Garcia is much more interesting.

Jane's an amazing soprano saxophonist and she has some ...trumpet sound beside her...amazing piano lines played by locals including a 17 year old kid from Santiago! It's unbelievable!

This book is mildly funny and entertaining, but not particularly original or exciting. It doesn't help that the TV actress character isn't the least bit sympathetic. The dialogues between Spenser-Susan and Spenser-Hawk are pretty much the same old stuff Parker has written many times before.There's little in this novel you won't find in other, better Spenser books.

Spenser and Susan are so superior to the rest of the human race we should all be ashamed. They are witty, they are sensitive, they are honest, they are loving, they are perfect. As a natural offshoot of this they are tiresome, they are snide, they are racist, they are class-driven in their outlook and tastes. They are, frankly, very creepy.

In fact it didn't - I skipped to the last 20 pages just to get it over with. The characters are boring, the plot was straight from so-so has been TV show, descriptions of Boston and surrounding areas not needed and actually took up half the writing.Why do readers like these books, I will never pick up or waste my time again - but I guess I am happy to have finally stopped wondering what it would be like to read one.

That's something you don't see that much on tv anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually painful","review":"I personally feel that Steve Martin is hugely over-rated and hasn't done anything worth seeing since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (he was carried by John Candy in that one) That being said...I guess all \\"family oriented\\" movies must suck now by definition.

What I thought was really lame was that Sarah went from a tomboy to a little Lorraine, and just after her mother got done telling her to be herself and that she is beautiful the way she is she rewards her for putting makeup on to impress a boy. This implies that she wasn't beautiful before, and on top of it she said it was Sarah's \\"first date\\", which I thought was ridiculous!

There is a flaw with the cable however. For almost [money] you would expect a better connector from the cable to the PS2 system. The monster cable connector is not quite a tight enough fit which causes it to make a bad contact. The symptoms you might get are flickering on the screen and slight loss in sound or sound quality before the connection is lost without warning while playing. Not only is this annoying but it is also frustrating when you hit a tense spot in a game and then have to pause it to correct the problem. I would have expected a lot more for my money! I should mention that my PS2 is ALWAYS stationary and is not moving at all when the connection is lost. This situation while aggrivating, is not all that bad but I would recommend a different cable for anyone who has all of their A/V equipment jammed in a cabinet and cannot get to the connectors easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"High dollar product","review":"This s-video cable is definetly a step up from the composite RCA cables that were supplied with the ps2.

For some reason, the Pb Pr connectors weren't working. Apparently, the reason they weren't working was because my television wasn't compatible with Pb Pr, only with Cb Cr. So, just a warning.

My 9 year old made a few dozen attempts at getting those tiny pins lined up perfectly (which is almost impossible for the little guy).

Some people maybe haven't figured it out yet because they don't use a Digital Decoder, but all they are hearing is Stereo sound. Im pretty upset because I sent my Digital Decoder back to Klipsch thinking that was the problem, but it was actually the cable. By the way the customer service at Klipsch is simply the best, they produced high quality equipment, not like over at monster cable. So beware!

I can tell you that I have always experience a dramatic improvement in quality when I have switched from the cabling that came with a particular system to a Monster Cable (the last couple of years, I just buy the Monster Cable to start with). HOWEVER, this cable makes the very foolish assumption that I plan on using the audio in my TV to play the soundtrack of my games. The cable only allows the audio connectors to be about 3 inches from the video. This really surprises me, because I would expect that most of us who are willing to spend forty bucks on a cable probably already have a home theater receiver and would therefore prefer no to use the 67 speakers that come in most TV's.

Monster makes very poor quality cabling as far as durability goes.I used quite a few monster products when initially wiring my home theater and had several of them fall apart on me or fail to function.Picture quality is ok but nothing spectacular.My recommendation is to just use the Sony cables.They are cheaper,you will hardly notice a difference in quality and they will not be an annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Audio?

I've tried the composite A/V (which comes with the PS2) and barrowed a friend's S-video cable to compare the three and the component video cables blew them out of the water (this is a 56\\" HD wide screen so the clarity is very noticable). We later tried the component video on the same friend's TV (36\\" Sony Wega), which was not HD compatible, but did not see much of a difference on that TV. So if you have an HDTV, the picture clarity will truely be impressive, especially Gran Turismo 3 and DVD videos. If you only have a regular TV with component, composite, and S-video inputs, don't waste your money because you won't see much of a difference from the composite or S-video connections.

These people want to destroy our faith in God and replace it with their worship of Mother Earth. This book stinks of the dream of Gorbachev. Who is still very much a Communist.

Were those authors not crossing certain lines in order to demonstrate the idiocy of society, and/or the government?Baker does just that with Checkpoint. He takes a conversation between two people, each of whom are displeased with the Bush Administration yet presents them with opposing solutions to the Bush problem. Either way Nicholson vents about his problems with the U.S. government in an extremely mature manner, through the channel of writing. This is an interesting dialogue, which I dare say will become famous satirical literature in the years to come. So, get your copy now and read it and reread it. For it involves all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"This position is unmanned","review":"When reading all the praise of Nicholson Baker's prose, on the dust jacket, and his ability to use the English language to create a satirical edge, I expected something more substantial. Apparently, this is case of reputation leading the book. There is nothing funny (except the Bush seeking Bullets), nor ironic in the text, and satire is checked in at another hotel. One cannot feel any emotional impact the ravings of Jay, as he plots to kill the bush baby in the White House. (Although, I suspect that if Shrub could read, the book just might make him catatonic.) This really is not a novel, but a one-act play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favors tirade over Baker's usual thoughtful examinations","review":"Like _Vox_, this novel is merely a dialogue between two people. One who wants to assassinate Dubya and one who wants to talk him out of it. The references to current events indicate to me that this was written quickly; it shows. This is the worst novel I have read by Baker: the dialogue is sloppy and the probing of individual reasoning is lacking. While I think there are some truly fantastic and thought-provoking points (some that will anger the left and the right alike) made in this book, I feel they suffer by being mouthed by a lunatic. Less a novel than an author's reaction to a president who he abhors, _Checkpoint_, like Fahrenheit 9/11_, brings up intriguing points but allows passionate sensationalism to override careful reasoning. I fear it fails as both a novel and political criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catharsis","review":"Okay, so it's not The Fermata, but it sure has been cathartic for me these past two days (after the elction).

Worse the dialogue, especially early on in the book, rings artificial. I kept thinking, \\"no one talks like that.\\" Baker's great talent, in my opinion, lies in his ability to take the mundane and render it fascinating. This book is quite different from others I have read by him, and it truly falls short of his immense abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Checkpoint","review":"I loved it!

Even if you hate Bush, you wont like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Checkpoint: A Review","review":"The book is about two characters: Jay and Ben. Most reviews state that the book is composed entirely of dialogue, which is true technically. But dialogue suggests an equal exchange of ideas, and really Ben's contributions serve mainly as a foil for Jay's extended anti-Bush harangue. I suppose the theme Baker's going for is that violence only begets more violence-not the most original idea, and one that's not even very well fleshed out in these 115 pages. When you take the unusual approach of building your novel entirely of spoken exchanges (really it's more like a play without stage directions), you'd better be skilled at allowing your characters to reveal themselves through their dialogue, and Baker barely even tries. There's little here besides a dense barrage of disorganized political factoids. The effect is like reading a drunken Op-Ed piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Sondheim's Assassins instead","review":"Reminded me that not every Bush opponent is a good writer or even a good person.

Two people discuss assassination of the president as the culmination of feelings of helplessness, and of shame in having a former drunk as head of the country.

I thought an \\"environmental thriller\\" would be a little different and a bit interresting but I was mistaken. The actors even look and sound bored with the storyline as well as their roles. I have seen films by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and have found them enjoyable...until this one...So a cop wants to help an environmentalist save a toxic tree. He must fend off evil land developers who want to destroy the tree. However, he ends up becoming obsessed with the tree and looses his job over the tree. Normally, obsession would be a little twisted but again this is rather boring.The only thrill I got out of this movie was when the end credits rolled.

The alox scales were anodized red and the cut liner is brass, not aluminum. Over the years the red has worn off except in the checkering grooves and where it is protected by the awl. The blade takes a good edge and holds it well. Maintenance with a few strokes on a professional steel is all it usually takes to keep it sharp enough to win the occasional bar bet. All of the tools have seen extensive use and show little wear save minor scuffing. Despite the years of use, the joints are tight. A little oil from time to time helps flush out any pocket grit which would cause excess wear.I can recommend wholeheartedly the Victorinox Pioneer, with the caveat that only years of use will tell if the current production knives are as good as those of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful recording of absolutely terrible music","review":"Well-performed and beautifully recorded performances of absolutely sixth rate music.

It was like popping a handfull of sponges and dry chalk into my mouth. Chewing on a bunch of these will instantly dry out your mouth and the resulting texture/mouthfeel is uncomfortable and well... unpleasant.As another reviewer suggested, these might work well as a salad topping to add extra crunchiness assuming you like crunchy salads.

I use the one handed feature all the time: my left hand will be occupied holding something, but my right can easily grab the knife and open the blade. Having serrations makes cutting twine, threads, and rope much easier.One warning though: at almost 4.5\\" this knife is fairly large; larger than most pocket knives.

The blade is sharp enough and big enough to filet a High Sierra trout and the quick one hand opening might be handy in the event of a bear encounter... ha! NOT! But I feel more secure knowing I can open it quickly. The tool that it is missing that I really miss is the corkscrew! How could they do away with it in this model. If it had the corkscrew, then I would carry it in town and everywhere but without the corkscrew, I take one of my other SA knives that also has the same lockblade but also has the corkscrew when I feel I might be in the need for that tool. I'm not a big wine drinker, but I do like being prepared.Still for the wilderness whether a day hike or the John Muir Trail, this is an excellent knife to have and the Amazon sale price makes it a bargain to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the 111mm series","review":"I carry this model on a daily basis,It is slim for its length andis a well thought out knife. As an intresting note of endorsementthe German Army adopted a version of this knife in 2003 for issue to all German Army troops...the only things they had Victorinox change was to put military green handle scales with the german federal eagle, and drop the tooth pick /tweesers.There have been times I needed the tweesers, and its very handy to have them.They work well I might add.I find it best carried in a compact nylon/velcro victorinox belt sheath rather than a pocket.

The serrated main blade will saw through some very tough material, the wood saw is one of the better ones placed on any brand of knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice knife","review":"overall this is another excellent swiss army knife. the blade is extremely sharp straight out of the box, and the longer blade is definitely a plus. my only complaints are that the blade is kind of hard to open with one hand, and is moderately difficult to close with the built in locking mechanism. but for an outdoors, all purpose knife, it definitely does the trick. for the price i cant think of a better substitute"},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves this unique design","review":"My husband and I both really like Swiss Army Knives, so we may be a bit biased.

It's an important book, as she was an important writer. She was also a pioneer, daring to bring lesbian characters to mainstream fiction. She risked a lot to do that and lost some of her support. As such, she is worthy of continuing popularity, but her fiction probably won't appeal to a wide audience because of its old-fasioned style.

You would think that if Fein is going to place these accessories on the market, they would make the pads so that they don't fall off after five minutes, it's embarrassing because Fein is supposed to be a high quality tool company made in Germany.

And the version of People as performed here is astonishing, so much yearning and emotion in it, I think the best version of the song. Plus the show has a great score. The film soundtrack is terrific as well, Barbra's voice is a little better on it. Even though two of the scores best songs were dropped for the film, you can almost understand why.

The supporting singers, particularly Kay Medford and Jean Stapleton, are none too shabby in their (usually humorous) contributions, though Sydney Chaplin, (Charlie's son) is uncomfortably nasal in singing the role of Babs/Fanny Brice's husband. But, of course, this recording of the 1964 Broadway musical would be nothing were it not for Barbra.

The soundtrack is good but, it's not the \\"live\\" feeling one gets from listening to a Broadway recording. While the music, lyrics and all the performers are, of course, outstanding, it is the brilliance of the young Ms. Streisand that makes this album indispensable to any lover or collector of the genre. Don't misunderstand; I'm not by any means discreditng the maturity and, shall we say, dramatic orchestrations that exist in her recordings of today; she's still number one. It's just that it is so beautifully refreshing to hear that young, unembellished vocalist's rendition of a great Broadway score.

This is what Broadway in the 60s sounded like. The album is vividly theatrical, and the remastering lets us hear the full dynamic range. CAREFUL! Be sure you get this release on Broadway Angel.

It was an impressive show, highlighted by rousing versions of Vampyre and Downpressor Man. The cd provides a more subtle experience but still captures the passion of this vocal genius.

I was wrong big-time. I have heard all the songs and also some that were out-takes and the whole reggae thing works for O'Connor. Sly and Robbie add a new dimension to the music and O'Connor's voice is as smooth and more so than Bob Marley. Marley being the reggae reference for most Americans paints an almost iconoclastic image in most people's mind. How can you stand up to a legend. Well, pretty good. Marley no longer owns the genre.

This is a beautiful tribute with Sinead's stamp. Her voice shines on each song so I won't break each one down and spoil it. I saw Sinead live at Lilith Fair quite a few years back (summer outdoor venue)and her performance started while a friend and I were in a long line for food.

Thankfully, it's not overdone, and features consistently sublime production triumphs, especially with regard to the tracking of the vocals. This got under my skin (in the best sense) almost instantly. Impressively, but not surprisingly, Sinead (unlike so many modern female singers) knows when to keep some of her vocal acrobatics out of the way. She plays to the source material while remaining true to herself. High points are the hypnotic VAMPIRES, DOOR PEEP and HE PRAYED. My only gripe? I feel she chose a few songs that really aren't suited to her range or choice of delivery (especially CURLY LOCKS.) Her whispery delivery caused me to strain to listen. This approach seemed odd given the right-from-the-get-go vocal punch and conviction of the originals or other versions. Oh, well, that's minor.

We now have Vol. X, &lt ; Italian Orchestral Music> 74321 72374-2). All the pieces that fill these two discs were recorded at Carnegie Hall 1949-53 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, making for a better sonic ambiance than that afforded by the notorious studio at NBC that Toscanini seemed to prefer. The first CD gives us the three \\" The Fountains of Rome, \\" and \\" Roman Holidays. \\" The Donizetti and Verdi, two pieces by Catalani, and Ponchielli's \\"Dance of the Hours.\\" Detractors of the Maestro will of course find inflexibility of beat here and there; I find only thrilling music thrillingly played.

Differences are CG and high degree of comic sense in Slither vs. animatronics and teenage angle in N o t C.In case you haven't seen Night of the Creeps both it and Slither are about people being transformed or possessed by slithery worms that enter the host through the mouth. In Slivers (They Came from Within) they enter by the earliest convenient orifice. All three are well done and have their own particular charm.Slither benefits from a terrific performance by Michael Rooker and ample support from notably, Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks and Gregg Henry. It's very funny, very gooey, well scored and there's a great song over closing credits. Coulda used a little nudity but no other real complaints.

However that really is damning with faint praise. This film is very formulaic, no surprises, cliched, and I imagine was a straight-to-DVD release. Unless you're a mega-Nathan Fillion fan who must see everything he's ever been in, you should skip it.

The characters have no personality, the whle thing is one dimensional and the comical bits are so uncomical it is ust stupid and misplaced.

I can honestly say it was one of the most entertaining films I saw Spring '06. Sorry Superman. Slither was hilarious, but at the same time creepy. Its one of those guilty pleasure types of films. I found the mix of comedy and horror refreshing. Slither may not be groundbreaking but it is a rarity: a horror-comedy that does both its genre-parents proud. You just have to take it for what it is. Guilty pleasure entertainment. I just happened to go see Slither at the box office on a whim one Saturday night, and found myself loving this film. It was a hidden classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect horror story ... you heard me right!","review":"Most horror movies are hokey.This movie was spot on.I couldn't find one thing I didn't like about it.That's hard to do.The acting was superb.The plot progression was believable.The effects were realistic.There was lots of humor.The casting was proper.The cast & crew did an awesome job!Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story by J.

It's actually funny but also has some really twisted moments. The plot was pretty original too. I love the idea of the employee killing off her bosses.

None other than Lord Robilar, the flamboyant villain from Gygax's campaign mentioned in T1-4. The veteran PCs (very high level!) must plunge into the wilds of the Bright Desert, facing desert centaurs, manscorpions, and far worse as they grimly bring Rary (a level 24 arch-mage) to justice. Their reward? Sad answers to tragic questions, and far more revealed that will prepare them for the next epic adventure... a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Construction worker's dinner bucket","review":"Great cooler for a construction worker's dinner bucket.

Installation can be tricky - very important to get the bolt plate straight, level and parallel with playing surface. This can be difficult to accomplish with quick set concrete but spend the time at this stage as the rest of the installtion is very dependent on it. Once the concrete was dry, setting up the pole, frame and backboard were pretty easy, but you will need a helper. The instruction were pretty good.

I started to freeze to death when I discovered ice cold air was coming in under the dash.

The plotline is simple: Frank Belson's new wife has gone missing and he asks Spenser to help find her. During his investigation, Spenser discovers that Belson's wife has quite a number of skeletons in the closet.This novel is relatively predictable, but it's a fun read because of Parker's remarkable level of skill with language and dialogue. THIN AIR is relatively original because Hawk isn't in it, and also because Spenser has an interesting new Latino sidekick.

(Jeer within a cheer: Just once, pretty please, I would like to see some female character have a nefarious past that has nothing to do with selling her body.

The included summary list of objections alone is extremely useful. The summary of the Federal Rules gives the foundation for getting a view of the whole picure and allows for quick refreshers, while the gloss on the objections not only reinforces ones understanding of the rules, as well as helping in getting comfortable with getting ready to make the objections at trial.

They definitely do run large so order down. Once my baby actually fit the shoes I realized that her heel doesn't fit all the way down in the shoe so they fall off so easily. Since I had kept them large and waited for her to fit in them I could not return--they have never been worn. I'm actually surprised that no one else has had this problem. I am so bummed but I do love the look. It is like the stitching in the back prevents her heel sliding down all the way. It is very frustrating and I'm considering another pair with no stitching on the back but I'm afraid all Minnetonka moccassins could be ill fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Large!","review":"Very cute for my little boy! He was in a 5.5 when we bought these. after reading the reviews that they were made large I purchased a 5 which were still too big. So I kept them and ordered a 4 in another style that fit! It's crazy how much bigger the 5 is than the 4! But he has yet to wear them and is now in a 6. They will probably fit him now (for a little while at least.)

It is only a system of thought, experimentation, and peer review which allows us to theorize and then act upon reasonable assumptions. Zealotry in science definitely must be scorned, but the actions of a few do not invalidate the process.In my opinion, those claiming natural selection is a fraud are ignorant of the science behind genetic mutation and reproductive statistical perpetuance, lack the required mental abilities to understand it, or are extremely biased by erroneous preconceived notions.

Ogden Nash had a real ear for language, I tell you. The story flows along at a nice, bouncy, evocative pace, and the illustrations complement it nicely.A few reviewers have commented that they find the non-dragon characters mean-spirited - they \\"tickle Custard unmerciful\\", \\"rudely call him Percival\\", and after the danger is past and gone (gotta love a book where a dragon eats a pirate!) they declare that THEY were really braver than Custard after all!I see the point, though I see their teasing as more familial than mean-spirited.

The pictures are delightful also. I felt a little let down by the author's ending because I expected the dragon to rise above his fears. However, I used the story as an opportunity to discuss with my child how she thought the story should finish. Together we wrote in a new ending line and are happy with the result. It probably turned out better with her getting involved in the story this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Ogden Nash","review":"LOVE this book.

You see a tiny bit of Brent in this book from book #1 not really any of his wife Crystal.

The remainder of the book essentially details General Stuart's exploits on and off the battlefield.You certainly get the impression that he was a dashing figure, but unfortunatley the author does not delve deeper into the man as much as I would have preferred. You get a sense for him as a Confederate soldier who cared very much about his duty, but not why he cared so much.I gave it four stars because it is a good read, and for the perspectives provided of many of the eastern battles and the cavalry's part in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly written contribution to Civil War studies.","review":"No front line general of the Confedracy was so dashing in conduct or so well thought of by his troops as the calvary commander Jeb Stuart.

We are taken from his childhood to his training at West Point, from his service on the Western frontier to his decision to stand with Virginia with the outbreak of hostilities between the Union and the Confederacy, through his many daring raids and battles to his final, fatal clash at Yellow Tavern. Jeb Stuart: The Last Cavalier is a superbly written and much appreciated contribution to the growing library of Civil War studies and biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davis' bio of General Stuart is still the best!","review":"Burke Davis gives readers often-overlooked insights into the early life and career of the famous cavalier, including his courtship of his wife (whose father was a Union general) and his motivation to fight for Virginia. The Stuart-Cooke family is an excellent example of the bitter division of loved ones during the War, with Stuart and his brother-in-law choosing to fight for the Confederacy while his father-in-law continued to serve the Union.

The upbeat \\"Sleep When I'm Dead\\" really is a lot of fun the first few times you hear it. \\"In These Arms\\" is also a catchy pop tune that you'll get sick of in no time. \\"Bed of Roses\\" is a decent power ballad with a pretty awesome Sambora solo in the middle of it.

I really thought that my bikes were going to bounce out of the back or roll off of the side, since the rack they were attached to wasn't really secured to anything. When I'd stop my truck, and get out to look in the back, the bikes would all be slumped over on their sides, hanging on for dear life. Plus the rectangular aluminum rod that the mounts were attached to would spin in any direction they felt like, meaning that the fork mounts would spin with it.

I have very much enjoyed the yoga classes at my gym, but they are only once per week, so I was looking for something I could do at home. The instructor is a nurse and well versed on how the poses actually strengthen the body and increase health. This video was more what I would call \\"new age\\" or \\"spiritual\\" - I definitely should have researched the style before purchasing, as other reviewers have recommended.I also did not think this would be a very good video for beginners even if this is the style of yoga that you are looking for.

In between are invigorating, energetic, exercises that will get you breathing deep and feeling more alive then you have in a long time!I love the playful feel of these interesting exercises. There are spinal warmups which work their way up the spine and are very effective at priming the engine and opening the chakras.

The end result is a stronger back and spine, and alot more energy and confidence.A great product, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner Level welcome","review":"This video is done well in my opinion.

Well, I tried to keep up & I was beginning to get dizzy. I can't understand how this breathing can be beneficial. I always thought that in yoga, breathing was supposed be slow & deep.Overall I found the video to be a bit bizarre. I'm not into the spiritual part of this dvd either, with all the chanting but I guess that's my fault for not doing enough research on kundalini yoga. Some people may enjoy it but I prefer a yoga dvd without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Experience for this Beginner","review":"I never saw myself doing yoga but I read an article about this type of yoga and it sparked something in me which piqued my curiosity. Everyone seemed to think that Kundalini Yoga is doable for anyone but it doesn't focus on difficult poses, but also features movement exercises which anyone can do. So, taking advantage of the sale on Amazon, I bought this one and I'm thrilled with the results. Just the fact that it keeps me coming back for more is a revelation. Kundalini Yoga combines postures, movement, stretching, breathing, and mental focus, in a way that leaves me energized but also relaxed. If you're exercise resistant, like me, but know you need to do something positive or yourself, then look no further than this!"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e9eaeccd"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/49.md","filePath":"glossary/49.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/49.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
