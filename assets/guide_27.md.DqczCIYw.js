This is one of my favorites for sure.

They're really long, so they keep me occupied for a long time. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6th book in the series","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all the books in this series. Have been surprised by all the twists and turns that take place. Haven't been able to pre-guess the direction that the author is headed. Can't wait for the next book, next week. Have already tried to figure out what will happen in that one but each book has had a lot of surprises. So guess I will just have to wait. Breath of Snow and Ashes was definitelty an \\"edge of your seat\\" book all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let it end...","review":"Ms. Gabaldon simply cannot let Jamie and Claire age and fade away. When I read any of the Outlander books I forget where I am and have to blink a few times when I have to put the book down.The Jamie and Claire love story continues to captivate and far surpasses the scenes with Bree & Roger. At least Bree has become more tolerable and Roger is an interesting guy who has earned Jamie's respect...no small feat. I love the historical detail and the intelligence with which the author tells the story. After the last book I will just start to read the series over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edit, Edit,Edit","review":"I have read all the books in this series and greatly enjoyed the first four. I was not going to read this book after the fifth book, \\"Fiery Cross\\", because I was so disappointed with it. I read a few reviews on line and elsewhere that promised conclusions and explanations so I relented and bought this last book. The series did conclude and there were explanations but 900+ pages of endless side stories was annoying at the very least. I wouldn't even attempt to read the other novel Ms. Gabaldon has written (Lord Grey and the Private Matter)because I have been so put off by this one. I have one word of suggestion for the author--EDIT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the characters, hate the editors","review":"I've been reading the Outlander series non stop for over a month. I have noticed that the continuity has been changing over the series. It started as tiny changes between books, but has slowly degraded into continuity errors within the same book! I loved the last five books, but felt that this book was a real let down. The book read as though it was three books combined into one, and certain plot points seemed thrown in to add length to the novel. As much as I have enjoyed reading about Jamie and Claire, I have to give this series up. This was too poorly planned a sequel for me to try and muscle through the next. The book also contained multiple typos (words with letters dropped, sentences without subject verb agreement, etc) that really detracted from the experience. While I appreciated the journey and the changes in Jamie and Claire, the poor editing job on this book made me realize that the magic is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep me up at night","review":"I confess to being in love with Jamie Fraser in the early books. In fact, I read them so many times that the pages are curled. \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" hasn't drawn me in like the others. I'm at page 151 and the plot alternates between Claire performing medical heroics, flashbacks to earlier story threads,tiny hints of the coming revolution, bedroom scenes, medical heroics, flashbacks, bedroom scenes. So far, six bedroom encounters in 151 pages, and I'm longing for REAL action. I'm not motivated to finish the story, but will probably keep slogging through, hoping it will pick up the pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIsappointing","review":"An admission first - I am still on page 700 or so, and it's taken me two weeks to get this far, far more time than had taken me for ALL of the first five books.The problems with this book are myriad: most had been mentioned before - the lack of story development; the emphasis on brutal, physical injury, ofttimes in excruciating detail (I had to skip four pages at one point); a startling lack of humour.Mostly, I am appalled by the destruction of the joy and love between her characters by Ms Gabaldon, who seemed intent to prove her mastery of her historical facts at the expense of the humanity of her characters.I cannot recommend it except to MS Gabaldons's die-hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions are Answered!","review":"If you've been waiting for certain things to be resolved . . . well, you're in luck. It was with a great deal of satisfaction that I finished this book (at 2:30 this morning), because I finally had answers to a lot of the things I'd been wondering about.Unlike Fiery Cross, this book is much faster moving, with no long descriptions of diaper-changing. Brianna and Roger seem to have found their places at Fraser's Ridge . . . Brianna is much more likeable, much more mature, and a lot less whiny. And, of course, Claire and Jamie are featured very prominently . . . it's still their series. There's action, adventure, abduction, illness, war, and of course, sex.A book more in the tradition of Voyager and Drums of Autumn . . . I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have read the other books in the series and was NOT disappointed with this one. The characters are so enthralling and the story line exciting, that its hard to put it down. I have to admitt, I was a little daunted by the size of this one, but I have enjoyed every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful book quality","review":"No issue with the story - but this particular edition is tiny - which makes it almost square. It's so thick that the paperback binding is bound to break before you're halfway through ... and the text is so small as to be almost unreadable. Don't waste your money - get a bigger / hardback version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fablous Series!!!!!!","review":"This is book 5 in a series of 6 Diana Gabaldon books. It is a wonderful Love story, with historical value taking place in the middle to late 18th century. I would highly recommend all 6 books. It starts with Voyager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scots Delight Also","review":"If you have any Scots blood running through your veins, you will enjoy this series of historical fiction. There is a good deal of steamy sex in the books (I could have done without-but I guess that is what makes it a romance novel...) I liked them because of the history and the mystery!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"This is my favorite book of the series, at least so far. This book is packed with action. I usually prefer the parts of Gabaldon's books that focus on the family relationships and character development, but I loved the action scenes in this book. There are kidnappings, rapes, murders, thefts and of course battles and events leading up to the Revolutionary War. There is time travel.The book includes lots of Claire and Jamie sex as well as Roger and Brianna sex as usual, but it also has premarital sex, extramarital sex and incest.Roger and Brianna's characters become more fully developed and more interesting.I enjoyed the intertwining of history with the lives of the characters more than in previous books. Maybe that is because there were many events that I remember learning about in American history classes.I found it hard to put this book down. It almost caused me to miss an appointment yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Cheated????? Agree with these previous reviewers.","review":"I have never written a review before and I considered Diana my favorite author. I talked her up to everyone--refused to read other books because nothing compared to hers. I waited for this book--ordered it 6 months ahead. What happened? Instead of hardly waiting to pick this book up, I have a hard time JUST picking it up. I am almost halfway through and had to call my friend to see if she had similar reactions. She did. This book does not \\"make us care\\" like the previous ones. We both reread the others, but this one. It's true, I can't get interested in anyone except Claire and Jaime. Brianna I can't even picture and don't want to. I feel bad even writing this as I always have looked forward to the day I could meet Diana and praise her and tell her how she had spiced up my life. Don't know what else to say---just really disappointed. Wish I wasn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Snow and Ashes","review":"This is the last book in the series - everyone was as good as or better than the first, and that is saying a LOT. The sequel is coming out in September and I can hardly wait to get my hands on it! Diana Gabaldon is a fantastic story teller and I thoroughly love reading her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I eagerly picked up the 6th (and I thought final?) book in the Outlander series only to be woefully disappointed. I just didn't get it. The storyline was disjointed and unbelievable. As others have mentioned, seriously, how much rape, murder, and sex can we have? How many times do Jaime and Claire have to come close to death? And having come to love Jaime and Claire, I got so tired of their constant trials and problems. Can we give them just a little break? Roger and Brianna could have been a great storyline, but the author never really gave them any flesh or bones. I could never understand why they stayed, or their motivations. The end was rushed and unsatisifing. I read through 6 books and felt lost and abandoned at the end. There was no real tie up, no sense of conclusion. I was left with more questions and an unsettled feeling. Such a disappointment. I don't see how anyone could give this book a decent review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blissful Escape","review":"So much has already been said, it's hard to know what to add. Everyone's personal experience with a book is different. Our opinions can be shaped by so many different factors. For me, this book was an escape when I desperately needed one. No long sob story is needed: I spent my summer traveling back and forth to the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. I have something called a brain AVM, and we had to figure out what to do about it. I had lots of tests, some of them...uncomfortable. Whenever I could read A Breath of Snow and Ashes, I escaped from all the stress and worry. Words cannot express how much I enjoyed this book, and how much I cherish this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE are her editors???","review":"Her first book, Outlander, was fast-paced and full of detail without the awful, wordy, boring descriptions of every single feeling in this latest installment. Outlander was very tight and very good. My friends and I have described The Fiery Cross as an expensive doorstop, and this one isn't much better. I am betting thousands and thousands of words could be cut from this boring story and it would again be tight and a real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed!","review":"Jamie and Claire are my all time favorite fictional couple, but I have to say that they were lost in this book. The book was tedious and long-winded, not to mention the fact that there were far too many predictable scenes where someone had to save someone from someone else. Quite frankly, I was bored and skipped most of the book, reading only the very beginning and the end. I've never done that with any other Diana Gabaldon book. What a supreme disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the saga continues","review":"the continuing saga of thee Frazers goes on.

It held the interest of my 3rd grade level son but my 4 year old son struggled to sit through it as there are many words per page. The author does a great job of including all aspects of Leonardo's life. The one issue I have is the assertion that he was not a religious man. In other books we read that he viewed science as understanding the God who had created nature. To him, God was the First Mover of all, \`\`the Light of all things'' who designed all things. I know we can't know for certain, but I just skipped over that part.

This book is sluggish and poorly written. The parts don't fit and it's disconnected. I stuggled through about 40 pages and then put it on the discard shelf. The author dwells in minutia...\\"I stood up...from the chair...put on my slipper....put on the other slipper...straightened my sock...fixed the other sock...\\" Arrrrggghhhh!

They weigh just over 5 lbs. per speaker.I am actually ordering another set for my center channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of stands for surround speakers","review":"I love these stands. They are perfect for your surround speakers. They came with multiple brackets to connect different speaker brands.

And after reading several reviews that these stands were designed pretty sturdy with some weight to be able to hold bigger sized speakers. Even though the recommended weight was 10lbs, I'd thought to take a chance and well they worked out great!The install was simple and it comes with several different attachments to be able to hook up any size speaker. I had to use 2 different ones to be able to hold the speaker, I've had no issues with it, the base is pretty wide and heavy that the speaker doesn't tip over if I get it a nudge. I have the height set at 5 ft which is around 2 feet above seating position, IMO that's a perfect height for the surrounds.Overall the look of the stand looks nice and professional looking. I uploaded some pics so take a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand, needs more understanding... ;)","review":"I bought these a few years ago and have been VERY happy with them. They are quite well built and I love that they are bent at the top to focus on your target. My only complaint is that at full extension the base is a little too small and they are easily tipped over by pets and children. I am manufacturing a secondary base to attach them to. It would have been nice if there were slide-out 'tip bars' or something to expand the base when needed. I have also noticed that the base tends to somehow unscrew itself over time and must be tightened every few months. Still - these are far more useful and visually appealing than any other speaker stands that I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon sent open box item","review":"Amazon sent me a returned item with half the parts missing.

It appears to be a price of $55 for a single stand because nowhere in the description does it mention pair or show a picture of a pair. But the manufacturer sells a pair for $89 and Best Buy sells a pair for $79 (at the store if they stock them which they appear not to). So with the above price I would pay $110 for two?? Even with shipping comparisons, it's a puzzle. Where's the deal?Otherwise Amazon or their substores needs to do a better job for the description of many of the products I find online.

From one satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speaker stands. Will cover most needs. (used with Onkyo HT-S5400)","review":"These are great stands. Very sturdy construction, heavy/durable base, metal & rubber spikes provided to suit your floor type, straight & bent mounting bars and 6 different mounting systems for different speaker types are also included. At the end of the setup, there will be a lot of unused parts (and you'll somehow realize that you had to pay for these as well)FYI, The first set I got was defective. The locking mechanism (the weakest part of the stand) was broken on one and missing on the other. It is made of hard plastic which is still considerably durable, but won't last as long as the metal stand. These would last a very long time.Amazon quickly replaced the defective item, confirming that the first one was a lemon. I am very happy with my HTS setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finish leaves a little to be desired","review":"These are more good than bad.Good:You have the option of either a straight or bent post. They are very solidly built stands. The floor spikes make them more stable on a carpeted floor. The wide range of adapters make this a truly universal stand capable of holding a wide variety of speakers.Bad:My stands came with several spots where the black finish had chipped off. I need to put some touch up paint on them now because it just isn't worth the hassle to return them. The speaker wire isn't completely hidden. It goes into the bottom of the post, not the bottom of the base. It isn't a big deal but you still have to run the wire over the base instead of under it. The stands I got were somewhat \\"preassembled\\" with the straight post versus the bent post. It was a real pain to undo this and re-assemble with the bent post. Finally, the carpet spikes could be longer for thicker carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for BOSE 161","review":"I like the construction, it has a rhino liner type coating. The instructions were terrible but not impossible. The 2 straight rods were placed inside the 2 base rods and there were very difficult to remove. Rating out of 5 putting this together, a 2! But, don't let that discourage you. It comes with many adapters for different types of speaker. I'm using Bose 161s and never thought I would find stands suitable for these speakers. Overall, I love them and was happy to avoid putting holes in the walls. I really like how the speakers look and sound using the 2 angled rods. I also like the channeling for speaker wire, although it is odd that there is a groove where it looks like you can run wire under the base but the wire comes out about 3 inches above the base.

I agree with most others. One side heats better than the other. After first few uses items stopped sticking. I did like it for creating the filling for breakfast burritoes, you know hashbrown potatoes,sausage,bacon,eggs and cheese wrapped in tortillas. But now everything sticks it has heat marks from where the element is and the teflon has worn off. I bought this when it first came out and only paid $20 for it so I guess I got my moneys worth. But when you have 4 children waiting on their pancakes you can't have some cooked others stuck and falling apart. I am currently looking for a new griddle hope I find one worthy enough to stand up to the demands that I put on my cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless","review":"I've had this for a while. I bought it for the removable griddle. I've not had anything break and the non-stick seems about normal for inexpensive pots and pans.However, the heating function is absolutely worthless. This is a design flaw and seriously effects cooking.I set my unit at 300 and used a digital thermometer to measure the temperature. It fluctuated from 224 to 269 a difference of 45*!!It cycles between high and low. Once it reaches the high temp, it turns off and starts cooling. While it is cooling, turning the temperature up has no effect.This leads to undercooked pancakes in one batch, and overcooked, scorched pancakes the next time.I've written to the company, but am not expecting any response. What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Although we haven't had trouble with the non-stick surface, the comments about it not heating evenly are right on for us as well. You never know when the heat will finally kick in even when you have it adjusted to the highest setting. We use it exclusively for pancakes and some days the pancakes are extremely light and other days they are darker -- this is true using the same high heat setting each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost gave me a stroke","review":"I've never yelled at a cooking appliance before (especially in front of my children) but when I had 8 pancakes stuck to this grill with 2 hungry toddlers crying in the background for breakfast I really went nuts. I destroyed a spatula trying to scrape them off! What kind of surface does that? I seriously couldn't get them off even with water!! I CAN NOT BELIEVE RIVAL WOULD SELL SUCH A PIECE OF JUNK & I WILL NEVER BUY A RIVAL PRODUCT AGAINI asked for a grill for X-mas & someone got me this junk.

Everything stuck, including meats, pancakes, and eggs. We don't have the box anymore, and I could try to return it, but we just threw the thing out instead. To clean the surface we had to use a plastic scraper, which actually wore out. Rival claims the surface is dishwasher safe, but we had to scrape the surface after washing. Lousy, lousy, lousy. We'd give it 0 stars if that were an option. A great gift for someone you hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything stuck to the cooking surface","review":"After three or four uses I finally gave up on this griddle and threw it away.

Do not waste your money on this frustrating, useless appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this item somewhere else. Everything stuck, it didn't clean in the dishwasher, the finish bubbled up after 1 washing, and the button to remove the griddle plate broke after the first use. I've liked other Rival products, but this one is really just poorly made and does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A PIECE OF [...]!","review":"I don't understand all the reviewers that complain of food sticking to the surface, because I had the opposite problem. The manual says to cook hamburgers at 350 degrees. Yeah right! I had the thing cranked up and preheated for about 20 minutes to 400 degrees (highest temp), and when I put six burgers on the grill they immediately began shedding all their juices, and merely stewing in them, because the plate obviously wasn't hot enough.I just bought this at Target tonight and I'm planning on returning it first thing in the morning. Funny thing, as I was walking out of the store, I thought to myself, \\"I'd better keep this receipt handy in case this thing doesn't work right.\\" It's too bad, because the removable and washable grill plate was a good idea. Just another sad commentary on the poor quality of currently mass-produced household appliances. Boy am I pissed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless griddle","review":"Horrible griddle.

I'm currently going to do some research on a new grill before buying a new one you can bet that it won't be a Rival product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I got this griddle to make pancakes for the kids (figured with that much room they could help out) and all I can say is what a waste! The griddle doesn't heat properly so they never really cooked and the parts that did cook took forever (and this was on the highest setting leaving the pancakes on for well over 15 minutes - they can out a very light tan). Everything stuck to the plate and it was impossible to flip. Not worth the money or the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have had this item right at 6 months. I use it on weekends when we have a Sunday breakfast and that it not every single Sunday...It is not as \\"non stick\\" as they say it is. It scratches easily and the \\"non stick\\" surface wears thin quickly. I know how to use and care for teflon surfaces, I am a mom of 30 years and this aint my first rodeo...Lastly, it heats unevenly, the left side gets hotter than the right side and just in spots at that. I am now trying to contact the company trying to get e replacement griddle for it and I have no options to contact them except to call, I prefer e-mail but that is not an option this huge corporation offers. You would think I could simply e-mail customer service, but not with these guys.Seriously disappointed... this was not a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good to report about the Rival GR225 griddle","review":"I bought this one on a whim on sale at a local store (not Amazon). I figured, how different can electric griddles be in the $30-$40 range? I was replacing a Presto foldup model I had for a few years that worked well, but was difficult to keep clean. Well, as it turns out, there is quite a bit of difference in griddles in this range. I can't vouch for a single feature on this model. The cooking surface is very poor grade teflon that has some sticking when it is brand new (properly prepared, of course). The thermostat is dreadful. Nowhere on the cooking surface reached the stated 400 degrees. Pancakes took forever to cook over the low temp resulting in pancakes that were dry. Luckily, I can still return this griddle after a week of trying to give it a good test. I'll consider a Presto again as my previous one worked fine, but never a Rival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Speakers @ a Great Price","review":"Installed in my 02 Civic by Best Buy , who do all my car audio installations and do a great job.

So when her sister was born last year, we got the baby this Elmo doll. It too is a great hit, and it has become the baby's best friend. It's soft and snuggly, plus she loves sucking on its hard eyes. Elmo's a little less baggy than the Cookie Monster, but still plenty soft and cuddly. (I haven't needed to wash Elmo yet, but the Cookie Monster has seen the washing machine and dryer several times over his 3 years and has held up well These are very sturdy toys.)That's 2 for 2.

I was looking for a basic Elmo for her and found this one on Amazon. After seeing all the good reviews, I decided to buy this one for her. It is really soft and high quality. It is the perfect size for a small child. My daughter can easily grab this Elmo and literally drag him on her adventures.

I see that Amazon has posted a warning \\"Not for children under 3\\", however, this item comes with a tag that states Ages 0 and up. And I linked to the Amazon site from the Gund site, so they are advertising it for children under three. In any case, while the plush is cute, its really for children who are past he putting everything in their mouth phase. And someone needs to decide the age appropriateness on this one....Gund is saying all ages, Amazon is not.

Though the original elements were in pretty bad shape, Fox has managed to restore much of the luster of the original camera negative.

Through the deft use of narrative shift, weaving her way back and forth through time, Robinson takes us on a journey of the human spirit seeking redemption and healing.This novel brings one to the brink of despair and back again, tantilizing us with hope while scouring cultural politics with the broken language and narrative take expresing the marginalization of the Haislan People. The magic of Elvis, Sasquatch, and Language makes this a novel of intensely bewildering power. Quite reminiscent of Beloved and Ceremony, Robinson leaves the reader haunted and gasping at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Babies","review":"I bought the product for my daughter for Christmas.

Now, I have to return the item and wait for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 3 year old wasn't interested in this doll at all","review":"I was about to have my second child when I purchased the Midge doll, the Alan and Ryan dolls, and this one for my 3 year old. I thought it would be good for her to be able to control a family and do some role play with them in regard to having a new baby. She was totally interested in Midge (not so much the pregnant belly, but the hair). Midge has knockout hair. Alan and Ryan were used as escorts for the Kelly and Barbie dolls my daughter already had. But, this baby doctor doll wasn't even noticed. It's been 4 months. Still, she doesn't play with it. Maybe it's just a matter of overkill. She was bombarded with dolls just before her baby sister arrived. Just thought I'd share our experience. Best wishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if...","review":"..they made this one better. This Barbie's arm snapped off at the elbow the day it was purchased as daddy attempted to kick it out of his way so he would not step on it and break it. I thought that most of it was his doing so I was disappointed but kept the doll. Now less than two months later when my daughter was putting the doll away in her toy box the other arm also snapped off at the elbow. Between all three daughters we have over 25 Barbies in the house and this is the only one that has ever broken in this matter. All of the other Barbie's that have broken have been due to tug of wars. I would only recommend this doll for older children that can take special care of the doll and have a special storage place for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I am deeply disappointed to see the gratuitous use of bottles for feeding babies.

It is just beautiful and more than nice enough for inside as well as outside. I have it in my livingroom. What is especially nice about this is that it is not a hair magnet if you have pets. It is nice looking and the colors and pattern are clear and bright. This carpet is especially easy to clean, usually just needing either a broom or a vacuum (I would not use a sweeper with a beater bar - just a vacuum) and it's clean. It is also very easy to spot-clean with just a damp cloth - say to clean up a particular dog's paw-prints after walking through mud. Easy peasy. This carpet can also simply be taken outside and hosed off if it gets really dirty. This carpet would also be perfect for anyone who is house training a puppy since it is to easy to clean and since it is synthetic and non-porus it does not hold odors like a regular cloth or wool carpet would. I can highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"best guide book for DRIVING tour of yellowstone & vacinity","review":"...just returned from driving trip to yellowstone/tetons/jackson hole....having bought 5 different guide books from Amazon.com to insure a trip that covered everything and missed nothing... I feel it is important to let potential driving travelers to yellowstone know how valuable this book is. Of all the books I purchased, this is the only book I used as we traveled the park by car. I used it daily as we went from one location to the next. I kept saying to myself as we toured the park using this book, that I wanted to thank the author and let the public know how valuable this book was. In fact. I saw this book for sale in the national park visitor centers. Get yours before you arrive to ensure a knowlegeable trip. Thanks, susan,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book, and there is an updated version available","review":"Amazon is not so great about removing older versions of books and this is one example - if you are going to buy it, get the 2006 version. Now, about the 1999 version....I will agree that it is helpful for driving through the park, but it's only good if you are traveling in the direction she has written it in. For example, if you are traveling a particular leg from north to south but she has written the guide traveling south to north, it is really difficult to follow. The book Yellowstone Treasures by Janet Chapple is written with mile markers regardless of which direction you are traveling in, so I recommend it over this one. Chapple's book is also more comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference and take along guide","review":"I purchased many books as a reference for our first trip to Yellowstone, this is the one book I decided to take with us and we used it everyday, the information given was interesting and easy to follow.

It has also prepared me for what to look for.As a \\"map lover\\" I like the detailed maps of different sections of the park even more. But . . . I have two complaints: 1) Her maps do not include everything she describes. To me, that is the purpose of a zoomed in map of one section of the park! 2) In her written description she talks way too much about the fire of 1988! But overall I have found the book helpful in my preparation for a visit to both parks and plan to carry it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Sweat Panic","review":"Butler's way of writing reminds me of my grandmother and our trip to Yellowstone.

First the ear \\"hook\\" piece broke off. Then the 2.5mm jack broke while in a plug - I'm only glad it was in an adapter and not my phone at the time or it would have ruined the phone.I bought another one and it works fine. Hopefully that broken 2.5mm jack was a one-time thing. Otherwise the sound quality and fit are great.

I was e-mailed by the costumer service rep, offering me a free Bluetooth headset. I thought they were doing a great job at this point, and I was excited to be able to resolve the problem. I sent them an e-mail back saying that although I would love a free Bluetooth headset I would prefer the product that I was looking for. I wanted an ear piece for a walkie talkie that had a wrap around holder instead of just an ear-bud. Not only did they basically ignore my e-mail, but they sent me an e-mail about a month later asking if my issue was resolved. I sent an e-mail back telling them that they obviously did not read my e-mail. I attached the e-mail and asked them to please read it. That was a week ago, and I have not heard anything back.

Unfortunately, no one could hear me on it.As far as in the ear comfort goes, I thought it was going to be better than the under the lobe support. I normally talk for hours in the evening and I was getting a little bothered by the original one. Unfortunately, this was less comfortable, and I felt like I was getting an earache after a few days of using it. I tried to use the over the ear support but the little connector snapped the first time I tried to connect it. (And yes, I was trying to be careful.)

Also, there was no over the ear piece, which the picture clearly shows the headset having a plastic piece that goes over your ear's cartilage.The quality of the ear piece I also received was absolutely horrible.

The artwork is beautiful, in the Waldorf style, but the language was not as beautiful by far. The story is nothing like those rich tales Elsa Beskow wrote. Instead the story is simple - one after another the animals try to wake Winter until finally he awakens to the ladybug's whisper. Lots of build-up and then I felt let down by the language of his awakening and the abrupt end to the story. Simple stories can be good, they can be great - but this author used lots of language, which was at times awkward, to share the simple tale. Wordy and not compelling.By the way, the first animal to try to waken Winter is a group of snakes. They writhe on top of Winter's sleeping body to try to waken him.

Being an admirer of Condoleeza Rice, I was really looking forward to reading her life story. However the book reads more like a very very long and protracted resume rather than a story about someone's life. I think I expected to learn more about Dr Rice the person, rather than all the political accomplishments. For me, (and perhaps many others who like biographies/ autobiographies) reading stories about people, how they think, how they approach life, their dreams, their joys and sorrows and of course their accomplishments has always been inspirational. One gets the sense however, that the author of this book does not really know Dr Rice and writes about her \\"from a distance\\" per say.

One of the main weaknesses of this book is that the author never interviewed her. Condolezza has been very careful not to say anything on race by concentrating only on foreign affairs she thinks she has removed herself from the national scene which is imposssible in D.C. It is also notworthy that her major promotions have come from the Conservatives from her time at Stamford, the Hoover Institute and the Bushs who are using her very effectively against any progressive politicians.

I literally thought at first that Trout and his band had recorded this themselves home-made. It makes my stereo sound like a transistor radio--some songs don't even sound like they were recorded in stereo! No bass--and too much blasted high end! (his guitar tone has too much of that tinny high end on some of his other albums, too.)

At just about every page, I had to stop and say \\"Well, our cats are not like that\\" or \\"that doesn't sound right\\". My 7 year old son even agreed. The author insinuates things about cats that frankly are just not true, such as they are antisocial and do not vocalize unless they are demanding something from you. I own three cats and am under no false belief that my cats worship me. However, the implied opposite notions implied in this book I do not believe are true either.

The show can be easily broken down into two varieties: the montages of the funniest skits you remember from the past 25 years and the other boring intro stuff in between. You'll get some chuckles from Tom Hanks' \\"impromptu\\" questions from the audience (including Christopher Walken) and seeing demi-god David Bowie banter with Jerry Seinfeld, but the gems of the show were the clips from Saturday Night Live and the tributes to the comediens who passed away over the years. Sometimes I put the DVD on and choose the tribute to the first five years chapter, or something that will get me a quick laugh without having to listen to Sarah Michelle Gellar. This DVD is great for someone who likes only what they can imitate from SNL and thinks stars doing half-a** jobs at improvs is funny.

The write-ups on this book make it sound like it's about students when they didn't even enter the picture until page 54 and only in a perfunctory interaction (and that was the only interaction through page 78). What this book really seems to be about is a boring, solitary bachelor who dwells far too much on his own thoughts (annoying attempts at deep thinking and quasi-intellectualism that end up being nothing but annoying). I could not force myself to finish this book. I figure if it had anything to say, it should have started saying it before a quarter through the book. This was just tedious. I read hordes of books, particularly for young adults (as an English teacher) and I would never recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and garrulous writing style.","review":"I picked up the book because of the reviews and acclaims on the cover and the interesting beginning to the novel. After the first page however, it turns out to be a very badly written piece of work. I gave up by around page 50.

It had sounded interesting, but I discovered that the blurb on the back cover was not even entirely accurate. There's nothing useful here. It's a dreadfully insipid piece of writing. The translator must be an Englishman, as the book contains words and phrases one would hear from someone from England and not someone from the United States. This can lead to confusion if you're unfamiliar with them. There's not much reason to read this one. Certainly, I will not recommend it at all.

It's too upright and has no infant insert. My baby's head AND upper body just flops forward. Not only does this posture look unhealthy and uncomfortable for him but also I can't imagine that position would be safe in an accident. In addition, the seat is so so big and heavy that I envy people with the smaller car seats, whom get to lug their babies around in them. I refuse to detach it from the car, it's just too hard to carry around, and I'm a relatively strong woman. Also, the handle and adjustments are hard to reach and use. I wish that I could return the item! One would think that such an expensive name brand would be a safe bet as a purchase. Guess not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy.","review":"I purchased the Primo Viaggio Carseat and Pliko 3 stroller. Although I have received many compliments on how this travel system looks, I am really disappointed with the car seat. First of all, it is really HEAVY! With my 4 month old baby being in the 90% percentile, I have given up on even attempting to use it as an infant carrier. The material is also very HOT! I try dressing my baby in the lightest clothes possible, but she starts crying after 10 minutes in the car. When I pick her up, her back is all wet from sweating. Finally, the seat doesn't recline and the pillows on the sides of the head area do not provide adequate support for newborns. I tried using another head support pillow instead, but the ones that come with the car seat do not detach and don't leave enough room for anything else. The only thing you can do is roll up a receiving blanket to prop the baby's head up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even thonk about it!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I spent a total of $ 700 between the stroller A3 and the car seat.

My girlfriend back then was very surprised that I bought an album of an unknown Brazilian artist without having listened to the songs on the album. I had heard one track of the album on the radio and that was enough to be sure that I would not be disappointed. Also the names of some of the finest LA studio musicians was a second argument to be confident about my purchase (this is not always true).

It does have very small details to color.The cars are exceptionally well drawn, as are the interesting backgrounds, of buildings, landscapes and bricked walls.The cars are gorgeous. It begins with a 1914 Stutz Bearcat and concludes with a 1997 Dodge Viper.I enjoyed coloring this book immensely, as well as coloring the backgrounds of buildings. Some of the pictures have a person in them, and I liked that. Only a couple of the pictures show a car being driven, which was okay with me.I have done some of Mr. LaFontaine's coloring books previously and always enjoyed them. They are very high quality illustrations.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys coloring, and especially to anyone who is into sports cars. There is also a paragraph of information on each page about the car. There are 44 pages total, so it is a generous coloring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SANUS SYSTEMS HF1S Tall Satellite Speaker Stands","review":"These stands are awesome, and are made with top-quality material. I use them at their upper-most position with satellite speakers that are only about 10 lbs. The only thing I notice is that with the stands fully extended, they tend to lose their vetical position slighty. This can be compensated for by placing a shim of wood or cardboard under the base of the stand. Other than that, I would recommend them to anyone. The price and quality cannot be beat, and believe me, I checked evereywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Don't even waste your time. The sound was so quiet, it was unbelievable.

But a book this long should not have the same sentence structure on every single page. The prologue is promising, but the rest of the book maintains exactly the same style of questions, incomplete sentences, and sentences beginning in prepositions. I got so bored with the repetition that I couldn't get past the first chapter. The style is pretentious and overly simplistic at the same time. Maybe if you like Oates you'll like this book; if you're not sure, I'd advise at least reading a bit of it before you buy it. Then, if you can imagine enjoying that style of prose for 531 pages, more power to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Classic Tales","review":"Originally Arabic, these classic Tales are Adventurous and Enchanting. All Magic and monsters, Alladdin is my all time favourite and all kids love to listen too. The Magic Lamp is amazing and if we all had it, the Genie would be oh so kind to favour us to fulfil our wish to spread peace on Earth! Alibaba and the Forty Thieves is an adventure tale and the cave spell that in the end,Ali Baba becomes rich! Sinbad the Sailor takes on a voyage to sea and these beautiful stories simply makes you soar your kids imagination and love to explore the dreamy world of wonderful classic tales. A must for a Children's Library and sure pick, any time, anywhere - Only I guess I'd liked the hard bound edition of Classic Adventures of Fabbri Publishing Ltd., spain. For kids, Paper back editions are good and can pass by for reads.

My son played with it for a few days, but I have to keep putting the track back togetherand that makes him lose interest in the toy. I wish I read the reviews for this before I bought it, because I wouldnever have spent the money on this.

It looks great in the box but getting the pieces to stay together is next to impossible.In fact my son threw all the pieces back in the box this morning and wants to return it to the store for another track. I'm afraid to buy another 'take along track' but he has a huge collection of the take along trains and I dont believe they are compatible with other tracks.Anyway, not worth the $40. We will be returning this tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money.Parts are cheaply made and product falls apart with normal play.","review":"This toy was a waste of money and provided nothing but frustration for my six year old son as it fell apart every time he played with it.

I'm seriously close to breaking out the soldering iron!! My son loves the trains and the tracks, but they barely stay together on the floor, much less suspended by flimsy plastic. Great toy for hardwood floors, very careful kids, and a lot of superglue. Other than that...you might wanna skip this one and get some of the other Thomas train sets that are a little more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks apart too easily","review":"My 2.5 yr old loves this toy. Unfortunately, I absolutely hate it since it requires me to rebuild it every few minutes. Nothing stays connected and it's all held together so precariously, if you so much as sneeze on it, it falls apart. The worst part is the domino effect, one part of the track falls apart and then the rest follow and so instead of a simple connection fix, it turns into a complete rebuild of the incline. My tot doesn't play with it roughly and just rolls his trains on it and it still falls apart. It's more frustrating than fun. Don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but, deeply shoddy construction","review":"I just got finished assembling this for my nephew and I'm looking at him play with it. He seems to like playing with it, but his play is interrupted with an \\"oh no! Broken!\\" every 4 or 5 minutes. the track pieces don't stick together well, the angled pieces barely fit in the trusses. The curved landing track from the tall descent is badly molded that it hardly functions to both turn a corner and change angle at the same time. The walls that attach to retain the engines as they curve at high speeds are questionably attached to the track. When using the walls, the track loses any sort of reversability and the curved pieces that attach to the tall tower don't stick well. It's basically barely standing up and will need constant reattachment and attention.It is a fun idea. Nephew likes taking the trains down the chutes, and the sounds are okay, but it needs a fair amount of rework before I'd recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart everytime!!","review":"my 4 yr old loves toy roller coaters and loves thomas what a graet combo well, he was so excited to receive this as a present but his excitment didnt last long he couldnt really play with it the trains fall off ,the track comes apart and falls down everytime he goes around the track just once. i would not recommed it is alot of money for a toy that is junk i expected alot more so did my son!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"My daughter and I saw this and just knew that her son and my grandson, who is almost 4, would LOVE it. He adores Thomas and trains. First of all, the gray track that goes from top to bottom will come apart even if Ethan is using the yellow swirly side. Also, what is the short level gray track at the base at the bottom of the swirly side that leads to the gray circle in the middle - we can't figure out what it's for and there appears to be a very short track next to that. Maybe it's there so someone can purchase extra track. If that's the case it would improve this and maybe the set we purchased has that section of track is weak or defective. Lastly, as far as this review we were both slightly confused as to the rating of this toy's educational value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headache in a box","review":"The writers above are right. I am technically capable and enjoy putting together children's toys, but this is just junk.

It was a pain to put together, which I do not even figure into my rating. The worst part is that it falls apart constantly. You barely touch it and it falls apart! The cardboard background falls apart! We are returning the item in hopes of finding something that is not a total gimmick. Great looking on the box but beware, it is a total joke. The company who manufactured this item knew good and well it was a hunk of junk when they shipped it out to stores.

By the time a kid could match the tiny part-numbers to the instructions and enjoy putting it together (since all pieces look the same), he/she'd be too old for the toy.

My son loves it!","review":"I had bought my 18 month old son the wooden track set from Ikea and the tracks were always coming apart which frustrated him so much I'd just have to put the whole set away. My sister bought this for him for Christmas (on a good sale for around $25), and at first I was skeptical because it says it's not compatible with the wooden sets, but the way it snaps together is much better for my son. It hasn't come apart at all, even when he walks across the tracks. Even though the tracks don't fit with the wooden set, the trains from the wooden set work on this track (but not vice-versa), as do his hotwheel cars. He has so much fun sending all of his cars and trains down the spiral.

Even putting it together made me want to scream. The tracks fall apart with the littlest nudge. They have clamps that are suppose to make them stay together, but those fall off all the time.

It just is not made very well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The track won't stay together.

They do not hold up. The fun house falls over, it's completely pointless. If you try to make the trains go down the spiral they fly off the track onto the floor. This was my first take along thomas set and I was extremely disappointed. However, my friend assures me they are not all this way. I certainly hope not.

'never should have let u go' and 'unconditional love' are the best songs. the fast ones are kinda weak, but these guys should have stayed together. im sad that the lead singer thought he was all that and bounced, but i still really enjoy the songs on this album to this day baby! when u hear the songs u will smile and get your happy fluid! buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average but Catchy","review":"Hi-Five had some jams such as I Like The Way,She's Playing Hard To Get,&I Just Can't Handly it.alot of that was Attribute to New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley.who Wrote&Produced those Jams.Hi-Five was a Average Group at best but had some Jams.But N-Sync,Backstreet Boys,98 Degrees,and those other Jokes Should Listen to How doing Real New Jack.cuz on just the above Mentioned Songs Alone these Wack Boy Bands Have Nothing to Match but their Shade."},{"rating":"2","title":"great old school R & B flavor","review":"This album takes you back.

That first crush, the first kiss, everything so sweet about being a young teen. Hi-five was the essence of that time. I was about twelve when the kissing game premiered. My sister and brother and I recorded the videos, danced to the songs and went delirious when the sprite commercial premiered. I will admit that they are not quite Boyz2Men; but backstreet boyz and their clones can't hold a candle. This is music! I had to buy the greatest hits twice because the disc keeps getting stolen, with hits like, \\"unconditional love\\" and \\"never should've let you go\\", I can understand why.

My opinion is that two stars and the title \\"Not quite there\\" grant too much favor to this book. The writings in this book are disappointing and dangerously deceptive. The author generously paints true statements, good statements and Scriptures that seem to apply onto an underlying and antithetical theme.The author quotes Martin Luther, \\"Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other. My conscience is captive to the Word of God.\\"Because \\"authorities\\" includes authors of books and because this book is missing plain reason and convincing Scripture, I plan to trash this book. Literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality and Power!!!","review":"Pretty good quality and seems sturdy. The fan is not that loud considering how much air it blows. I used it in the summer to pull in air from outside at night to cool off my place. I get tired of leaving the doors open all night. This fan works great. I wish I would have gotten one with a stand, but that is about another $100. The three speeds are reallly three speeds which is nice. The powedercoating is nice, the screws holding the fan cover are tight and flush. It's all metal and does not look like it would break like with some plastic fans. Plus I like metal and get tired of plastic. It looks nice and worth the money I spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fan","review":"This fan seems to be well made. It is heavy for it's size and seems well put together. I couldn't find the country of manufacture on the packaging, though i thought i read somewhere that it is U.S. made. I hope so, the Lakewood fans I used to buy are all made in China now and are junk.

(I have tile floors) it's a descent fan, but not worth $95.00.. maybe the $50 to $60 range.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really Blows!","review":"I've had this fan for over six months now and I'm satisfied with its operation. I use it every night as white noise and to circulate air. I will probably be buying another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made But Too Loud","review":"This fan is very well made and is comparable to my 25 year old Patton fan. It moves plenty of air. However, it is much louder than the Patton even on the slowest setting. In my opinion, this fan would be better if the velocity were reduced. I would send the 18 inch model back, except that the restocking charges and shipping are too high. The 20 inch Air King, although still somewhat loud in comparison to the Patton, is considerably quieter than the 18 inch model. I would definitely recommend getting the 20 inch model over the 18 inch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad stock","review":"I recently purchased this item from Amazon and had to return it the following day. I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the fan. First thing I noticed when I opened the box was the rust on the front grill of the fan. I didn't bother taking the fan out of the box. Amazon was willing to have it returned free of charge with no questions asked, hence the 2 stars.One thing I noticed on the box was an old tracking sticker. I have a pretty strong gut feel that this item was recently returned to amazon and was sent to me afterward.For those planning to get this product, try ordering from another seller, probably Kentec."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattle King","review":"After recieving this fan and turning it on,much to my disappointment, the fan shook so much that the grill would rattle on medium and high speeds.In fact the unit was trying to \\"walk\\" off the table from the excessive vibration. Obviously I had a defective unit. When I contacted the amazon.com vendor,(KENTEC)they quickly issued me a refund and paid for the return shipping of the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Out of the Box, Fan Blades Not Attached!","review":"I ordered this fan because I wanted a quality high-velocity fan. I was tired of the Chinese-made junk that is sold at local stores. The fan arrived today. It was packed with material such as used brown-paper grocery sacks and used black plastic garbage bags--as if someone had packed it up in a garage somewhere. I took it out of the box and was astonished to find that the fan blades were not attached to the motor shaft. LOL. So much for American quality! The seller, Kentec offered to send a replacement by UPS Second-day air at their expense. They also sent me a UPS authorized return label, so I did not have to pay for return shipping. So Kentec has good customer service. The replacement fan works just fine. But my opinion would be that Air King has some quality control problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not kosher","review":"Looks nice, but it is not kosher for Hanukkah.

Well actually a remote for their HTPC. With the Mplus software that comes installed on the newer Air panels (http://www.mplusint.com/) you can do quiet a bit with this thing.Might also be handy for the kitchen looking up recipes and stuff. Then again I GUESS you could just print it!This device isn't for my mom it isn't for my friend who casually uses a PC. This device is for me who has several PC's and an extensive HTPC setup.

I didn't even get past the first chapter of the book and I wanted to throw it out the window. Her advice to put a newborn baby on a strict schedule is cruel and unusual...for sleep, feedings, etc. I understand the need for babies to sometimes \\"cry it out\\", but at least wait until the baby is older! Babies wants are their needs! Needless to say, I will not even waste my time watching the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Dr. Denmark!","review":"This book is a must have for all new moms. When we had our first baby, we tried to do it the \\"modern\\" way just like our pediatrician said...feeding every 2 hours, waking her up all through the night - we were all miserable and she was still not gaining weight fast enough. By the time she was 3 weeks old, we were willing to try anything. A friend told me about Dr. Denmark so I bought this book and tried her schedule. By the 3rd day she was sleeping all night(8 hours), started gaining weight faster than she had before, and was just a happier baby. She has slept through the night eversince. She has now been sleeping 13 hours since she was 4 months old. Dr. Denmark is the longest practicing pediatrician in America, so I believe she has some pretty credible things to say and we should listen. I think that anyone who has something negative to say about Dr. Denmark or this book has not tried it with their own baby. Thank you Dr. Denmark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Advice!","review":"I have the 2001 version and the advice goes against common recommendation from the AAP, such as:1.) Putting baby on back vs stomach. This book says to put on stomach.2.) Says no one (not even children) need milk after 7 months of age. Crazy!3.) Says to start feeding solids at 3 months. Obesity anyone?4.) Not to feed your NEWBORN baby between 10 pm - 6 am. Most newborns need to be fed every 2-3 hours...period.Those are just a few of the \\"gems\\" that I found in this book. Please, pleaes, don't do what this book says. It is not good for your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I have spoken to an RN Nurse Instructor about this book when it arrived in my library and she was very concerned about the incorrect advice and information in this book. Dr. Denmark constantly advises to give aspirin. It is not recommended to give aspirin in the other medical literature for viral illnesses in children. Dr. Denmark also says to give an enema for a stomach ache and this is dangerous. This book also has a comment about how a parent has learned to diagnose and treat her own children, but diagnosing should always be left up to a medical doctor after examining the child. In doubt with any illness in children, ALWAYS seek the safest actions to take to correct any problems. Your child's life or wellbeing is not worth the risk of a bad decision based on this book's advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst and most dangerous childcare book I've ever read!","review":"This book is outrageous! It's full of dangerous recommendations such as putting babies to sleep on their stomachs, administering aspirin despite it's association with Reye's Syndrome, treating stomach upset or fever with enemas, and giving meat to 3 month old infants. The schedule she suggests for newborns is cruel - putting the baby down at 10 pm and letting it cry until 6 am. She notes that constant itching from a urinary tract infection can lead to masturbation.

Most of the things she says to do in this book are dangerous for children and should not be followed by anyone. I'm a teacher and these things scare me.

She was sleeping through the night from 5 days old! AMAZING!! After she turned 3 months old, we ended up going with a more strict \\"Babywise\\" schedule (for various reasons) and the transition was very smooth. We are so glad we slept our baby on her tummy from day 1 also! Her head is perfectly shaped and she has amazing head control and arm and back strength!

And despite how young she was, this album is quite good. The best songs from the album were some of the singles released which were Back And Forth (Went to #1) and At Your Best which is just a beautiful song. Aaliyah is singing from her heart and I just can't stop listening to the song. Sure it's no \\"One In A Million\\" or \\"Aaliyah\\" but it's still a good album.

After all, these are Djavan's melodies and lyrics. He also had a hand in most arrangements, and his wonderful sensitive voice is present throughout. What is missing is the urgency, the spark, the joy of his earlier albums and also the artistry that would appear twenty years afterwards with the outstanding album Milagreiro. In comparison, Luz is too relaxed, although I still very much like it. The album ends well but far too briefly with Minha Irma, a faster, propulsive 2-minutes. The album stems from 1982 and has that 80's feeling. It was recorded and mixed in Los Angeles. This edition is Japanese, and I face liner notes in both Japanese and Portuguese, which is somewhat amusing considering the first track, his popular tune, Samurai."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every dog","review":"I have had a lot of luck with Nature's Miracle products, so when our lab retriever puppy started chewing our kitchen cabinets, I bought their Best Behavior Training Aid in hopes of making our cabinets less appealing to our dog.

I wanted a longer lens to give me more reach when shooting distant shots of wildlife. I take this camera hiking, so I wanted a lens that was fairly light. This 40-150 lens was just the ticket. In stores in my area, I would have paid at least twice what I paid through Amazon, so the price was very good. Delivery took awhile because of the Christmas rush. I ordered it before Christmas and got it a little after New Year's, with normal delivery. I have not had time to extensively test it, but I found the lens was lightweight for its focal length, focused resonably quickly, and took sharp pictures at full telephoto. I was pleased that the lens was the same diameter as my 14-42 zoom, so I could use the same filters. So far, so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Kit Lens","review":"This is a cheaply made kit lens that does not deserve the Olympus Zuiko name. It's marked \\"made in China\\" and has a plastic bayonet mount. Results might be acceptable for simple snapshot photography, but I found that at maximum zoom (150mm) I could not obtain consistently sharp focus, regardless of camera settings (auto/manual focus, high and low ISO, max and min f-stop, etc.) Believe this is due to physical motion, as I could easily move the end of the lens (it extends significantly as you zoom). My intended use was airshow photography, so failing to focus at infinity basically made the lens useless to me, and I returned both it and the camera (Olympus e520) for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for money.","review":"I got the 40-150mm zoom to go with my E-520. While the depth of field is not as shallow and has less bokeh than I'd like, overall it's a very good lens. Compact, quick focusing, and very sharp. It would be nice to have a lower aperture, but that's not a realistic hope. Great bargain for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We love our lens, but if you have an Olympus pl-1, you will need the adaptor as the lens does not come with it.We have taken some amazing pictures with the lens and the quality is top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware of this reseller","review":"I ordered this item in error and found out that Portable Guy charges a 10% restocking fee.

I have an 8mp E series and with this lens, I still get better pics from my E series than I do with my new 14mp \\"pocket\\" camera. For the shots that count, this lens is my favorite. Sharp edges, true colors, and nearly fool-proof to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus lens small size, light weight, but most important sharp images.","review":"I purchased this lens to use on my E-520 and I was surpised at the compactness of this lens. I took photos at a circus and a wedding so far and I am impressed with the sharpness of the images. It could easily be carried as a prime lens for travel, especially if you are outdoors. It does hesitate some on focusing in very low light situations. Overall what a deal for great Olympus optics at $100 from Amazon. It is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I usually like both Argerich and Dutoit, but EMI has not done either of them justice, and to me, Argerich sounds less involved than in other recordings. The real drawback, though, is the sound. Decca provided Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony with clear, open sound that made their recordings enjoyable. To me, EMI's sound here is indistinct, bordering on muddy at times. Orchestral detail is lost, and on a couple of occasions the piano just disappears behind the orchestra. I bought this recording expecting something special, but was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire and ice","review":"Argerich plays with all her customary passion and flying fingers. But what I dislike about this recording is the fact that Dutoit's realization of the orchestral parts is rather dull. If you want to hear the true glory of these works, get the Perahia/Mehta CD (Sony). Perahia is every bit Argerich's equal while being more tasteful (IMHO), and Mehta's conducting is both powerful and vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrectly advertised parts","review":"The product description clearly states that there are two 6 foot cables in the box.

There is another cd, \\"puzzle of hearts\\" which has this same selection, but a few of the songs are in english, but I think english is a language for business, not for music.

If you hold up a piece of single ply toilet paper, that's what there sheets look like. They're thin. This means that over time, maybe the course of 6 months to a year of washing and sleeping, they're going to look and feel like screens. They're soft, they're just not durable, and won't be soft for very long.

However I couldn't put it down. Ms. Wiggin's use of turn of phrase and metaphor remind me so much of Mark Twain. I'm in awe of their common talent for making it possible to see a concept in a new light by merely a precise juxtaposition of words.

My mother bought this book for me when I was about seven years old. Back then, I thought it was rather boring and hard to get into. Fifteen years later, I picked it up again, and my first impression remains the same. The author spends a great deal of time telling you how unusual, engaging, and unique her heroine is, but throughout the book, Rebecca's actions never back up the author's assessment. I felt this book was dry and flat. Who wants to read a book in which the climax revolves around children selling soap?I found it all too similar to L.M.

Some songs come off as Tina Turnerish (which ain't a bad thing, really) however she loses her soul in many of these recordings. Like I say, when Millie or the executives try to sell her to the masses, she looses something very good about her personal style. I respect this set of songs but true to the butt kicking realizm of Millie J., there are other better and more entertaining (highly entertaining) collections to listen to. The Jive period was not my favorite anyway but again, it does have its merits. This is Millie on a Sunday when all I want is Friday Night with the Saturday break up thang!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravishing Music","review":"This work is the culmination of a lifetime of musical experimentation and fervent religous devotion. It contains a remarkable amount of absolutely ravishing music. The soloists, chorus, and orchestral work in this recording are absolutely first rate. As an effort to communicate the emotional experience of mysticism and religous fervor, this work will probably never be surpassed. It is certainly Wagnerian in the sense that a powerful musical language to used to convey meanings that cannot be expressed in simple verbal or logical terms. As a listening experience, Saint Francois is one of the pinnacles of 20th century music. Whether or not it works as well on stage is another question. I suspect its length and relatively static action will work against it. Because of the huge demands for the large orchestra and chorus, unusual instruments, and difficult solo parts, it certainly won't be performed often. This only makes this superb recording all the more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but check out Fischer-Dieskau in the earlier set.","review":"Beautiful, but check out Fischer-Dieskau in the earlier abbreviated festival performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I'm disappointed with this book.

Robert Taylor, with his matinee idol looks is simply there for decoration.THe DVD itself has an o.k. transfer but it could have been better. Warners needs to do a better job with remastering theirfilms.

We got to know Beauty a little better. And this book made us feel less sorry for the 'slaves' and understand them better. I suppose you can say that in this book, you really understood the mindset of the slaves and what drives them.This series is not for everyone. It's basically just a sexual fantasy. I say fantasy because most of it was unrealistic. It would be impossible for everyone to be beautiful (both slaves and masters) in real life, and if everyone had unprotected sex there would be diseases, pregnancies etc.But I would recommend this series to people who want to broaden their perspective on sex.

This book is very strong erotic. I would say way stronger than 50 Shades of Gray. If you're comfortable reading a BDSM book with three ways, lesbian and gay sex scenes then this is the book for you.

Maybe \\"Beauty's Release\\" will be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Book of the Series, Perhaps the Best","review":"This book, Beauty's Punishment, is (in my humble) the most shocking and the most engrossing of the series, for in this book, Beauty is punished for defying her masters by being sent away from the castle to the village, as a work slave as well as a sexual slave. It is here. in the village, where Princess Beauty is made to work in a tavern, here where the her masters are raw in their brutality and punishments, neither refined nor theatrical as the Lords and Ladies of the castle had been, that Beauty really comes into her own. The writing is both shocking and poetic......this is pornography made prettier than romance. It is also my favorite book of the series.

Aside from the change in venue, nothing really changed in the plot. More spankings & whippings but no extreme brutality which would cause a person's death. That's strange! Aside from Beauty & Tristan's willful stubborness to locate a stronger master, nothing much has been dealt with on the psychological level. Seems like the entire story was moulded on Beauty's turning into a whore (pardon the word) & a nympho whilst I could not determine if Tristan is a gay.Just like its predecessor, this book is such a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Good read, excellent story!

I've been wanting to try Anne Rice for some time and while others may enjoy it, it was just not for me. FARRRR too much spanking, seriously every page someone is getting spanked. bleh.That's $26 and a week of my time I'll never get back. I'm not even finishing the series...I stopped after book 2, can't believe I even went on after the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naughty!","review":"Well, it's bondge at the Rice house... if you enjoyed Exit to Eden, the movie notwithstanding (yech!), or Belinda, you'll enjoy this (the second in a triad of Sleeping Beauty with a twist... in Anne Rice's world, a kiss just isn't going to do it... you take it from there!). *grin* So go into it with an open mind, and read it alone... the blushing will give you away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG_","review":"Horrible. Good for those that think that these books are sexy, erotic- but damn personally I found them disturbing and disgusting. Really sex slavery is just not my thing, I guess. But if you do not mind boys turned into horses, and girls turned into sex dolls taken on by the entire military unit- then by all means. enjoy.If you are into \\"sex slavery\\" then try out Sweet Persuasion by Maya Banks.

Keeps you on your feet wanting to get to know Beauty better. Her desires are yours, as well as her pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as disappointing as the first.","review":"After reading the first book, I felt compelled to read the second only in hopes that Ms. Rice would develop her storyline. Although she does share the pschology behind the slave master relationship it is still a neverending spanking marathon. Book two was as dull as book one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Anne Rice's standards","review":"This book has little plot or character evolution. It's repetitive, dull and not the least bit sexy, even though that's just about all of the subject matter. If you're looking for the same thrill and fun of Fifty Shades . . . this book is definitely not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middlesex","review":"I agree with the reader who similarly made the error of starting in the middle. I've spoken to another who started at the beginning and with, so far, superior results. If you attempt to read this book before the first, you aren't really indoctrinated into the fantasy nature of the work, and hence try to interpret it in a real-world mindset. I kept wondering about the economics of feeding all these slaves - what on earth were the villagers getting out of it all, why didn't they just put the slaves to work in garment factories, blah blah blah --- completely missing the point. If you are going to read this book, do yourself the favour of reading the prequel first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, dear Lord.","review":"I read all three of these books, partially out of train-wreck syndrome and partially because I was working as a tow-truck dispatcher and was bored (the other dispatcher got them from the library and passed them on to me, because I read fast.) They were so un-exciting I felt no shame at all reading them at work.But this one, out of the three, was the absolute worst. I can sum up the reason in two words (SPOILER ALERT, and no, those are not the two words): THE CAT.Oh, God, the cat. Whether or not the concept of bestiality squicks you, the practical concerns of a cat licking a sensitive area? OW. Take a look at a close-up picture of a cat's tongue - go ahead, I'll wait. See? That there's nature's Velcro, man, and not the soft fuzzy side of the Velcro, either, either. But apparently in Anne Rice world, that doesn't hurt at all.I'd long suspected that Anne Rice was, in fact, two sandwiches short of a picnic, but that confirmed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I only read this book because it was recommended if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey. Unfortunately it isn't anything like it. It is cruel and disturbing. It lacks characters that draw you in. Fifty Shades is ultimately a love story and has characters that you want to stay with and finally see happy. This series eventually gets there but its just not worth the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Book. Ever","review":"I bought all three books in this series after reading the positive reviews. The ones that said they didn't like it listed reasons for not liking it that I knew wouldn't bother me. So, let me say from the beginning that I had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM with the sexually explicit content in this book series. My negative review has nothing to do with questionable content. This negative review stems from the fact that this book is in no way good. I know that there are MANY huge fans of this author. After TRYING to read her other books, I should have definitely known that I would not like these books because I detest her writing style. Now, I am left with three e-books that you couldn't pay me to read. If you have read her other books and didn't like them, don't even contemplate buying these. The feeling of detachment from humanity seems to carry through all her books, while other authors can maintain that and still write an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I may have liked this better is I hadnt just read the first one, and felt that this was just a rehashing with a minor change in scenery...

You won't find blended, sweetened, bleached vocals here. Pegg's voice is throaty, mellow but with edge, mature and commanding. It dives deep, and then swims up to the surface, leaving a trail of bubbles along the way. Here a rasp, there a soaring soprano note; here a groaning whisper, there a ringing belted melody. From the haunting \\"In the Rain,\\" breathy and slow, to the disco diva kick-in-the-butt \\"Blame it on the Moon,\\" Pegg's interpretations of Michael Tester's music grab you and hold you. Mixed with exotic instruments (beside's Pegg's voice), and spiced with emotion, South for the Winter is baked up fresh and warm. Take a big bite, and savor it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent music and a voice you have to hear!!!!!","review":"Peggy Winter has a gift that should be heard throughout the world.

The only issue I did have with it is the on off switch. It is easy to accidentally turn it on while it is in your tool bags, which of course runs the battery down. Overall it is a pretty good tool for the price though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Level","review":"Very nice level and the laser is a nice touch. I wouldn't spend a ton of money on it as in the end it is a torpedo level but it is a nice little tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it...","review":"I bought this originally to do cabinet installation and it didnt work out as planned. It has too small of a footprint (it's too short) and gets out of level by the smallest of irregularities on any given surface. Well specifically kitchen cabinets. I ended up going home to grab my 6 foot level.Another nitpick with it is the switch. You rotate the switch to turn it on and rotate it to turn it back off. It will easily turn itself back in if jostled inside a tool bag.However our dog just loves chasing the laser beam around the house so I'll probably keep this toy, hence the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Everybody is right, the on/off switch is terrible. Laser is somewhat accurate. Level rather heavy to keep in tool pouch. Basically a torpedo level with a playtoy for a laser. If you need a good, accurate laser, stick with the PLS series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Useful Pre-Marital Counseling Tool","review":"As a pastor I have used this in premarital counseling for over 25 years.

The material is sound biblically and combines both instruction and a workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazzer's Heaven","review":"This is another great Joe Diorio book. He breaks 'Giant Steps' down into manageable bits to digest. Lot's of ideas presented,(both linear and chordal), including rhythmic variations. If you go through this honestly you can't help but get better. I think Joe is the master of the 'cool motif' meaning that his licks are memorable and can be taken out of context even to other genres like rock. In this case 'Giant Steps' has repeating chordal clusters two whole steps removed in general and the astute guitarist will get 20 to 30 excellent riffs for each chordal structure. It seems like alot of work for just one tune but it's very justified. It's even in tab which is shocking ! Joe puts alot of himself into these books and his mental energies when it comes to licks and harmonic ideas seem boundless ! If you buy this try the triplet lead pass,(I think it's #5). That solo alone is worth the price of admission but as in all J.D. books it's just the tip of the iceberg !"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"this nothing but a copy of the nova pbs program that was produced for the sole purpose og \\"proving the single bullett theory\\" the program also serves an injustice to the dallas dr's by taking ther opinions out of context by editing making them look like bumbling idiots. not one word was said about nova in the product offer or the liner notes on the package. shame on all of you,keep up the good work on the on-going cover-up.gitjoe45@aol.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Potpourri","review":"An interesting mix of stories spanning many years of Bradbury's life.

Don struggled not only with the cultures (that he loved) in Africa, but American mission bureaucrats trying to keep up with their rules from offices in New York. There are fascinating insights about how to take Christ to primitive cultures, about not protecting yourself, and how to deal with witchcraft and broken vehicles. This is the best missionary biography that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"Bo read this book. It made him sorry that Congressman Leo Ryan isn't still alive because I would let him take me for a walk. I think my Mom and Dad would have liked him too. Ms. Layton's book seems to be full of excuses and rationalizations. She spends far too many pages trying to justify leaving her dying mother behind and excusing her assassin of a brother.In closing, Bo bought the book thinking he was going to read an honest story of a Jonestown survivor, the missing money and the missing boat. But instead, Bo is left pawing his head, more confused then he was when he started the book. I give this one...One paw way down!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A facinating and elucidating story. I get it now!","review":"This is one of those books that all adults should read and pass on to thier loved ones. Its a warning to parents and an important story for young adults.

Soon thereafter I realized how similar our lives were and how secrets within families can hurt the innocent recipients. I was moved beyond laughter into dismay and then tears as the authors story unwound. Beautifully executed memoir of courage and love. In many ways a poignant love story between a mother and daughter and the daughter's later wish to protect her little girl's future...

It is a story that should be read by everyone. It explains in beautiful detail the people who believed and how they were deceived.

This is a you-are-there epic that portrays the horror and heroism of someone who believed in a utopia, fought for her leader, then saw her mother and friends perish in the outback jungles of Guyana South America. That Layton survived is the stuff of great novels. However, this is a true life thriller that'll keep you up late at night with it's thunderous drama and snippets of sweet innocent delight. Hopefully, one day Seducitve Poison will be required reading for theolgians, politicians and therapists. No one will ever understand until they have experienced this intensely honest and personal account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving voice about a difficult subject","review":"Imagine being successful at writing this story...

A MUST read!","review":"I read this book after hearing about it in an article recently, given the anniversary of the horrible events in Guyana. It's a compelling story, well-told and I truly could not put it down. I read it in 2 days.I felt so sorry for Debbie Layton, her family and all the others who were fooled into joining Jones' so-called church. I was very young when the events in Jonestown occurred, and I learned a lot of things from this book that I never knew (socialism/communism link, government complacency, etc). Before reading Layton's account, I admit I was skeptical. How could any reasonable person fall into a cult? But after reading this, I can feel the desperation of Layton when she was recruited. She was very young, vulnerable and insecure. She was the perfect target for Jones. I think that anyone with an interest in psychology, cults, religion or true-crime would thoroughly enjoy Layton's account. I hope the people who escaped Jonestown have found peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Book","review":"The author has done a great job writing this book, choising to write down her memories, admitting her faults, she has done justice to all the victims and relatives of the ones who died and, at the same time, of the ones who survived the Guyana tragedy, she's been brave but at the same time she's reminded us how dangerous are so called gurus, some of which unfortunately still exsist, so thank you for this book, thank you from the bottom of our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miraculous escape story and compelling memoir","review":"While listening to Marty Mosscoanne on WHYY I was surprised to find myself interested in this story.

There is an important message that she carries and we the public would be better served being able to hear it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"History made exhilarating","review":"I have never read anything like this before. I am researching a paper on hysteria and cults and this is the only book that made it visceral. The web site for this book (of the same name) has a wealth of information for those who want to read more about it. The government sites, NPR which Layton 'appeared' with Noah Adams and lots more. My professor touts this book as the only non fiction work which begins to explain cult life from \\"the inside out\\". It reads like a Steven King thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Book Groups","review":"Our book group fell in love with Seductive Poison.

What I thought the author did best was describe the process by which she fell for the cult, described the mind frame in Jonestown that allowed the horrific tragedy to happen, but most of all how she got out, in time. She left her mother behind. The book was chilling and compelling and I feel important for anyone interested in how cults work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, telling and harrowing","review":"Ms Layton's memoir is extremely well written; has a great flow and maintained my interest throughout. It was not only a fascinating story but a revealing historical document. It is a must read for everyone.

From my point of view this is a worthy story and quite educational for people of all ages and every walk of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I found this book while traveling through Spain. I wanted to write a note here and say to the author that I wish I could tell her in person how proud I am of her.

It took Layton a great deal of courage to come forward with this eloquent, honest and humbling account of her years with the crazed Jim Jones. What I had believed to be a bunch of suicidal nuts in the jungle has been redefined for me by the authors enlightening tale. As much as I love Tom Clancey, this book took the prize in the 'suspense and thrillers' genre.I hope she plans to write another book about her adventures on the trading floor to her decision to tell her daughter the truth. A great deal of change had to have happened during that time and I as her reader would like to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memoir of life behind another type of Iron Curtain...","review":"...that is compelling and poignant as it is exceptionally honest. Layton conveys her story with succinct accuracy and memory of her feelings and thoughts as she experienced years of submission to malevolent cult leader Jim Jones \\"Father\\", as many in the People's Temple called him. She not only describes the wiles and deceptions of Jones with horrifying clarity, but she also describes, with frank self-criticism, the tainted relationships she forged with some of the members in the cult (some of whom she betrayed regrefully, in order to escape). Her painful account of her forsaking her mother, Lisa, in the dashed hopes that she would later have saved her (Lisa died days before the mass suicide occurred in mid-November '78) is fresh as a new stab wound, undoubtedly for Layton as it is for her readers on the page. The acute emotion Layton draws from her experiences is, as a whole, readily felt and not easily forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Life Mystery and Thriller","review":"Great weekend reading.

I've read expose's that were completely self serving and autobiographies that were mostly fiction. Seducitve Poison, however is different. It is told with absolute honesty. Deborah's story enblazens itself into ones memory. She made awful mistakes! Her teenage rebellious cries for help fell on partially deaf ears then landed her in English boarding school. There she was unwittingly prepped for the arms of satan. This is a chilling story. Thank the Lord that GOD stepped in and gave her the wisdom to escape and tell all. Her website is quite informative.

She is unique in her searing honesty about Jonestown: the corruption, the dishonesty, the violence and the consequences that all varieties of \\"blind faith\\" lead to. Her courage in telling this story so nakedly holds all of us who think this could only happen to others to account. We know we are all susceptible to persuasion from charismatic, utopian-promising leaders, but we refuse to believe it. And yet the sooner we recognize it, the sooner we can develop the psychological ballast we all need to think critically, stand against things we know are wrong, and trust our own inner compass instead of the prescriptions so many leaders would have us follow. Layton's powerful prose directly confronts our seemingly infinite capactiy for self-deception, and the horrible consequences that result from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"A powerful, vivid and explosive story. Why didn't the government listen to Deborah when she escaped from Jonestown and begged the US State Department for help? Is this another example of the ineptitude of our government?

A CNBC television interview during the Ugandan incident with Deborah Layton was spell-binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Hot Hot, an incredible read","review":"within an hour of starting this book I was heatedly into the story; by the time deborah finds herself a prisoner in Jonestown and a pawn for Jim Jones I was sweating; while she premeditates her escape and the desperate consequences it will have on the mother she must leave behind I was soaked.

The bain of Sam's existence is Dale Hinshaw, a fundamentalist who is always vigilant in his search for the religious shortcomings of others, especially Sam. There is also Fern, another judgmental parishioner, Opal Majors, \\"a notorious hypochondriac, and Bea Majors who plays the organ loudly and off key. These and other interesting characters make for major headaches for Sam. Towards the end of the book, Sam reaches a crisis of conscience when he realizes that he has been pacifying these people in their pettiness instead of standing up for what he really believes. When he tries to assert himself, his job is threatened. Gulley handles all of these plot twists and characters with a light touch and there are lots of chuckles in these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Goes On: A Harmony Novel","review":"I, too, would like a refund. I, too, feel duped. I so thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 Harmony books that I bought the rest of them without knowing that the happy little benign series had turned into a liberal soapbox for the author. Interesting how Pastor Sam, who is supposed to be so broad-minded and free-thinking, has such a narrow, bigoted view of conservative Christians. And why Mr. Gulley has chosen to risk alienating such a large sector of Christians (who typically enjoy buying family-oriented books) I can't imagine. Apparently he doesn't need our money (I'm sorry he got any of mine at all!). Therefore, being the narrow-minded kook that Mr. Gulley has estimated me to be, I will advise conservative Christians to stay away from this Harmony book; you won't come away happy - unless you enjoy being bashed by yet another \\"enlightened\\" liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had never bought this!","review":"I too enjoyed the first two novels, only to be sadly disappointed by this one. Unfortunately, I purchased the rest of the series based on the first novel and now wish I could return them for a refund. I was under the impression that books such as this were to be read to be enjoyed, not as an outlet for the author's personal political opinions. I don't care what his personal political preference is, that is his choice. However, that is precisely the point - it is HIS opinion and I do not care to read about it in a book that I purchased for the purpose of entertainment! It also bothers me when those, such as Mr. Gulley, claim to be \\"open-minded\\" and \\"free-thinking\\", yet never miss an opportunity to stereotype all conservative Republicans as overzealous \\"kooks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund?","review":"I, like many others, enjoyed reading the earlier books in the \\"Home to Harmony\\" series. In fact, I bought the whole set after reading the first one. But after reading \\"Life Goes On\\" I feel like I've been duped. It is obvious that the ridiculous caricature of Dale Hinshaw represents the author's own narrow view of conservative Christians, of which I am one. I will not continue to repeat what has already been detailed in the other negative reviews this book has gotten, but I am in total agreement with them.I felt betrayed as a loyal reader of his novels. Gulley's true colors are finally being displayed in lights, and I for one am now off the Gulley bandwagon. Fortunately, there are plenty of other excellent Christian fiction writers out there: T. Davis Bunn, Jan Karon, Ted Dekker, Frank Peretti, Robert Whitlow, Beverly Lewis, Judith Pella, Ray Blackston, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiritual Journey Continues---","review":"Philip Gulley is not only a great story teller, he is a resource for spiritual enlightenment. There is a \\"lesson(s)\\" in every chapter! Readers will see themselves in the characters because all of Gulley's \\"people\\" are human--open/closed minded, loving/hateful, confused/focused, assertive/passive; Pastor Sam realizes that he has not been honest with himself--haven't we all been there at one time or another? The fourth novel about the little imaginary town in Indiana called Harmony and its parade of characters is a wonderful read. .The book lifts up the \\"human condition\\" and helps us understand that our pains, sorrows, joys, frustrations, and loves all have value in shaping who we are and what we are becoming. Every page is spiced with Gulley's humor that warms one's heart and brings laughter and chuckles to the reader. The last two pages of the book is full of love. . .God's love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Good Reading or a Political Novel?","review":"I bought this book because I felt that the story was good and I liked reading about this pastor and his church of hard to get along with parishioners. I have worked at a church before and know what goes on in the day to day world of churches. I felt that the politicizing that went on and equalling a true Christian with being a liberal thinker, and that conservatives were narrow minded and like Dale Hinshaw was a slap in the face. There are those of us who are conservative and believe in the Grace of our Lord and do not judge everyone they meet. We all sin and in the Lord's eyes our sins our equal. I would like to say I won't share this book, but then I would be considered just like the characters in the book who read the book but were narrow minded. I want everyone to read this and see how this writer has made this more a political book cutting down Conservative Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another humorous book by Phil Gulley","review":"Phil Gulley is a Quaker minister who is known for his humor. The book, Life Goes On, really portrays that humor. It is always so fun to read about the eccentric characters from Harmony, Indiana and their adventures. In this book, we read about Dale catching his car on fire, Dale's wife oversalting Dale's food, and the Sausage Queen getting impeached. The book was balanced by serious moments, such as Dale's wife leaving him (and Sam cooking and doing Dale's laundry), about Sam questioning the Virgin Birth and the fallout from that, and Sam just wishing that his congregation would be more like Jesus among all the pettiness and nit-picking.This was a very fun book to read. I can't wait to read more of Dale's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inept and Worthless","review":"Ryken is an English teacher.

The title should read: Choosing a Bible: Why You Should Avoid Dynamic EquivalenceThe book is a quick read and very repetetive. I recommend it only so far as you are already familiar with the subject matter and want to add fuel to your own fire in agreeing with the author that word-for-word translations are the only way to go. If so, the author provides several examples illustrating this point fairly well.The author is very passionate about asserting a very narrow view... if you are actually looking for guidance on choosing a bible, I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING ORIGINAL HERE","review":"I bought this CD while visiting the USA on the recommendation of a good friend who knew my love for all things guitar and SRV. This is like SRV at the age of 8 with an ordinary singer. The songs are predictable and nothing special, you can almost hear the tracks that inspired each of these compositions. His playing is OK but also nothing special. He stays so close in tone and styling to SRV that buying this CD seems totaly superfluous when you could buy SRV's CD's instead. Whoever the reviewer is that called this the best BLUES CD of the 90's, must have absolutelynothing to compere this to. This wouldn't make the top 1000 BLUES CD's of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIGHTY FINE PICKIN'","review":"I love this CD. Sure, at times he does sound like Stevie Ray but labeling him an SRV clone is the easy way out. There's some mighty fine guitar pickin' goin' on here. Great Strat sound throughout. Listen to the funky guitar work on Big-legged Woman, so sweet! Other standouts for me are C-Butt Rock, Letter To My Girlfriend and the super My Way Down. Just super guitar pickin'.

Duarte, a fellow Texan, is obviously a disciple of the late, great guitarist. In fact, Duarte dedicates the nearly ten-minute instrumental \\"Shiloh\\" to Stevie and his brother Jimmie. But while Duarte may have been influenced by the Vaughan brothers, he is no imitator. Duarte's guitar playing is both fiery and inspired. His vocals are serviceable, but it's his guitar playing that brings me back to this album time and again. I caught him live a couple years ago and his performance was dazzling. This is an impressive debut. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"check out this man's guitar tone","review":"I think you almost have to be a guitarist to really appreciate Chris Duarte. For me his tone alone is worth 4 stars. He gets the most exquisite Stratocaster tones I've ever heard on any recording, period. (Hey if anyone out there knows what kind of pickups he uses, let me know. I know about his effects, amps, etc, just no info on pups.) Even SRV wasn't this tone-sculptured. Aubrey Freed used to be my hero in this dept; now it's Duarte.I like the songs on this CD, too, fairly good composition. I would give the CD five stars if it showed just a tad more originality, both compositionally and stylistically. But man, that tone -- I've played strats for 30 years and couldn't be more envious."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Spirit Experince","review":"Sons of AAAAA I and a friend bought this record which by the way is totally cccccoool andAawwwwsome!!!!

It is also the most traditional blues sound he's done in about 20 years, not counting the duo cd's with Junior Wells. The Saturday Night Live Band keeps right in step on all 9 tracks with some good driving rhythum. There are some roof raising slow numbers like \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" and \\"My Time After Awhile\\" where you really hear Buddy actually playing the blues like the old days at Chess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Real Deal\\" turns out to be the \\"Fake Deal\\"","review":"This cd was a big disappointment to all true Buddy Guy fans. Anyone who has ever seen Buddy live on a great night knows that his guitar playing is so intense and raw that no guitar player today (except maybe Santana or Jimmy Page) can match him. This cd sounds overproduced and the guitar playing is kept to a minimum....and brass and horns backing Buddy..come on! Real fans owe it to themselves to track down and purchase the import cd \\"Six String Frenzy\\" which is the only cd to accurately capture Buddy at his crazed and frenzied guitar playing best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the recorded selection I expected","review":"This album surfaced on Amazon as a result of my web search for a marimba recording of \\"Japanese Woodcuts\\".

Don't take my word for it though; I have no idea how powerful a fan needs to be to cool the bottom part. It's not that loud too. Also, to the guy who says there is no usb thing I must say.... what? Mine came with it and I was actually hoping for a wall charger because it's redundant to cool the 360 when you're just making it do more work. The batteries though are awesome. For the fan strength, maybe a light breeze is all you need to cool it, what do I know. Great product though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"The stand itself works well enough. My major complaint with this product is...Every website that sells it (including Mad Catz's website) says that this fan/stand powers through the Xbox 360's rear USB port. This is an out-right LIE! Not only does it not come with a USB cable, it doesn't even have any place to plug in a USB cable. Instead it comes with an AC adaptor that must be plugged into a standard wall outlet to provide power. I give it 2 stars since my main reason for purchasing was for the ability to power it from the console and it DOES NOT do that.- Josh"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Search Of Stones","review":"In Search Of Stones, in my opinion, does not measure up to previous books by Dr. M. Scott Peck. His choice of using megaliths as metaphors for revealing his human frailty is clever but not prophetic. He concludes that civilization has removed the mystery from some megalithic sites and casually brushes off stone formations that leave him feeling empty. One wonders if the man or the megalith is at fault. If a site, such as Clava Cairns, does not cause an epiphany, or at least a sense of spritual feeling, he theorizes that the orginal constructors lacked creativity. Perhaps it is he who lacks the understanding of a deeper spirituality that withdraws when he approaches. When Dr. Peck explains away the sin of adultry as being his need to connect with God, I do not wonder that some sacred places cause him to feel empty.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not 'advanced'...","review":"This book, like many of Telesco's earlier books, gives a good overview of many useful subjects.

This result is a surprisingly tame read, with very little sex, and not all that much insight. Some will dislike the author's acceptance of such activities, while realists understand the futility of letting moralists enforce puritanicalism on a society where consenting adults are supposedly free. Those looking for a voyeristic read will be disappointed and are advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and unsatisfying","review":"The book consists of interviews with people working in different areas of the sex industry. The problem is the author's agenda clearly stands out- normalizing such work and subtly criticizing any negative views of the work or workers. She also is rather superficial in the interviews. She does not really delve into their pasts and the reader is left wondering if a significant number of the interviewees had dysfunctional backgrounds. She would have us wholeheartedly embrace such work as legitimate and useful, and as just another job choice for those with lesser means but she does not present the costs (to the person, his/her family, society, etc.) of engaging in these morally questionable lines of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"never recieved","review":"I ordered these at least 3 times and always recieved the giant grape clusters.

By turns majestic and athletic in its pacing, this my favorite Third. The disc is worth the opening bars of the final movement alone: there is a drama here in Argerich's playing that is conspicuously absent from most other performances. Brilliant.The Scherzo No. 3 is similarly outstanding, as are the Mazurkas. Alas, the Polonaise in A-flat is lacking in the same flair and command as the Sonata, which is a disappointment.The definitive Sonata No. 3, worth the attention of any music lover. (Top notch sonics from a 40+ year old recording also make the recording a gem.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staggering virtuosity","review":"These Chopin recordings of Martha Argerich from 1965 are an example of staggering virtuosity of the highest order. She is one of the few pianists I've heard that could rival Michelangeli for technical ability(though both could be erractic at times, with the Italian being the more so of the two.) This cd is one of the crowning achievements of Argerich's career. It is, indeed, a shame that it took so long for these performances to be made available to the public. Given that they were made at Abbey Road in 1965, one wonders if the powers that be didn't want to embarass some other well known residents of that venerable recording studio in those days. While the quartet from Liverpool could produce some great pop songs, none of them, or just about anyone else from any other genre of music, could produce musicianship of the caliber that Martha Argerich displays here. Another must have in any classical cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, I love this","review":"I don't know Chopin; couldn't pick him out of a line-up.

Great rendition of the Sonata."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniably the best, incomporable, no one compares","review":"Chopin himself would have gone into ecstasy listening to Martha Argerich play his music.

I suppose this sort of thing is necessary, but why not tune into Radio 1 for a few cheap pop songs, instead of enduring the depressing experience of Argerich demolishing Chopin's sublime 3rd sonata, or perhaps you prefer her desecration of the scherzo...it's your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this briefcase!","review":"I thought I was buying a leather briefcase, but this one is plastic.

Unfortunately it only made the one trip. The next week, on another 400+ mi car ride, the inverter started beeping constantly and then went into shutdown mode, I'm assuming because it was drawing too much power and was overheating. At 90 Watts, the power output matched the power draw from the Mac PowerBook, but didn't have enough umph to spare.

It has a fan in it that makes a whirring noise but its no big deal. If you are drawing a lot of power it has a high pitched tone (which usually will stop if you turn on the car...i.e. there's more power generated). It works great and keeps my laptop always charged. The part that plugs into the lighter has the cord on it so you can put it in tight spots unlike some other products. I've had 2 of them now and the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because they do tend to break after a year or so. I just keep replacing them...definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 volts?","review":"i only get about 100 volts out of it at a full 12 volt charge. with engine running. not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norman was singing both parts around this time","review":"I am right now listening to a mono pirate recording of a live recording of Verdi's Requiem from 1982 (Norman, Baltsa, Barreras, Nesterenko, and Muti driving the Dies Irae way too fast) with Miss Norman singing the soprano part and doing a damn fine job. Baltsa in her prime takes the mezzo and the two of them together are a slice of heaven. Norman handles the highest notes beautifully, some of it is undersupported fakery, but she makes a virtue of necessity by finessing them gently and they come out quite lovely. Her usual scrupulous attention to text, and the high note climaxes are right on the money. It's quite remarkable, and you have to wonder how many other ladies have had both the soprano and mezzo parts in their rep at the same time.Wouldn't it have been a fascinating experiment to have a studio recording of Norman singing both parts in the same performance? Like a classical Connie Francis record."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold, lifeless, passionless","review":"Despite what other reviewers have said, I know this score very well indeed and I find practically everything about this recording incredibly offensive. The voices are bleaty like sheep and there are many times they don't hit the notes the score says they should hit. The music is blurry when it should be crisp and clear. Yes, it has Terfel, but he, along with all the other vocalists,doesn't make me believe the character. There are better recordings of this piece. JEG should've stayed away from this piece... It should be full of fun, joy - it should move you. Instead, I was just bored and angry. Not an accurate reading of the score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stravinsky with wit and soul","review":"I've just finished listening to this wonderful recording and I can't recommend it too highly. Bostridge, Terfel, von Otter, York are all splendid, and Gardiner keeps things moving smartly along, while easing up when called for in those moments of pathos, especially the scene in Bedlam. Sound is great. Monteverdi Choir is terrific in the crowd scenes. This recording bids fare to replace Stravinsky's own stereo edition as the best of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Top 5 Favorites","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on Christian growth. I have probably read it over the years,when I'm feeling spiritually dry, over 50 times. Ryrie is such a clear Bible teacher. I often find Dr.Ryrie looks at all the teaching on the subject and he often shows exceptions to general assumptions, such as in lordship salvation. This book is very balanced, as the title shows, but also strongly promotes personal holiness. There is great emphasis for the believer to dedicate his life to the Lord (Rom.12:1,2). It also looks at practical issues in sanctification and how we can glorify God in our every day life.

I admit it took me a while to get used to the style. It wasn't really the lack of punctuation that got to me, it was more the lengthy sentences, which by the time you finish them leave you somewhere entirely different than you started. I also was a little put off by the presence of the narrator/writer's voice. I kept feeling like he (the omniscient narrator) was sort of intruding on my reading experience and telling me how to feel. Aside from those issues, I got through the book and yet felt disappointed. The notion of finding a double and what that would mean to your identity was really not explored as it could have been. This is a fascinating concept, but I felt as though Saramago got too hung up in building the story based on action rather than introspection and meditations on self, which is really what I wanted from the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gave me a headache, literally.","review":"This book gave me a headache, literally.The wording is not beautiful or clever.

Val Kilmer must either owe a favor, need the money or someone has something on him (ie: videotape, pictures?). Or all three. Not only was the plot weak and the acting mediocre, the story was too convoluted. Even the pseudo-love scene looked contrived! Val, Val, what are you doing?! Remember THE DOORS? I guess a free trip to go film in Europe is cool and all but c'mon, where has the substance gone? Low budget is good, weak stories are bad. Maybe the script read really well but the final product is a complete failure. Hopefully he got cozy with the lead actress, total babe!

Pass the popcorn!!!!!!! :-):-):-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Mistaken Identity Film","review":"Double Identity, also known as Fake Identity, is yet another dull addition to a string of straight to video movies by Val Kilmer. The film takes elements from North By Northwest, a mistaken identity film by Alfred Hitchcock. It's equal parts smooth British spies, expressionless Eastern Europeans, and cutthroat diamond merchants.Val Kilmer is uninspiring as a hapless American doctor in Bulgaria that ultimately travels to Prague to evade his assailants. The movie's cover is misleading, as it portrays Kilmer as something of a spy or action hero. Helping him along the way is the lovely secret agent played by Polish actress Izabella Miko (Athena in Clash of the Titans).The direction and cinematography are both decent, but the acting and writing both are sub-par. The film lacks an original story, and just isn't suspenseful. I wouldn't suggest even renting this movie, as it will only remind you of how hard Kilmer has fallen off since the 80's and 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful.","review":"Think of this movie as 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back again. The whole movie is spun around a tale of mistaken identity. Val's character miraculously and seamlessly goes from being a family physician to a secret agent he has been mistaken for. Instantly Val knows how to disarm somebody with his bare hands, shoot a gun with perfect accuracy, and talk himself out of any situation.In a nutshell: the script is dreadful, the plot is absurd, the budget is a shoestring, and the acting flounders. You'd be better off with a 007 movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"Where to start... The movie centers around a case of mistaken identity. A very out of shape (and quite possible intoxicated) Val Kilmer plays the lead, a doctor mistaken for a spy. Miraculously Kilmer somehow becomes Jason Borne in the process. There are double and triple agents involved, none of which are properly introduced. The viewer has no idea who is working for who (and not in a good way). The plot lacks any sense of direction and the acting is simply terrible. Set in 1992, all the characters use cell phones and drive cars from the mid 2000s. It is impossible to follow and the viewer has literally no idea what is happening throughout the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie even out of a RedBox. Instead, save yourself a dollar and 90 minutes of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double the Confusion","review":"This film absolutely had no direction - almost as if it was made up as it went along. The viewer is then stuck trying to follow a plot which then all of a sudden changes for no reason. I agree with the other two reviews - horrible film and Val Kilmer adds nothing to it. This film was just as bad as The Ministers which starred John Leguizamo - and that film was one of the worst in recent history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I've always liked Val Kilmer's work and thought \\"any movie he's in must be good.\\" Well, good grief, this flick sucked big time. It was impossible to recognized a plot line and even fizzled at the end. Unfortunately, I bought this movie and now wish I had only wasted my money renting it. Sorry, Val!

Such a shame as up until that point it had been a joy to read--the story, twists, and romance wove a sensual spell and using the Natchez, Mississippi area (which is spellbinding in itself) was a pleasant change from the normal London crowd. The characters, both good and evil (and there was one whose evil knew no shame,) had been so vividly brought to life and the descriptions of the post civil war struggles were enlightening and not biased toward either side.

At only 115 pages, double-spaced, and a mere 20,000 words, the entire book is about the length of a chapter in most other books in its category. Author Bruce Pandolfini includes just enough chess lore to keep the book relevant to chess, but not so much as to overwhelm a chess-averse reader. He writes concisely, as a chess player plays, with a great deal of concentration and quick, quiet decisions expressed in single sentences. The book offers several fine aphorisms, the sort you will remember long after you have put it down. But it's not the kind of book you will want to put down. Fortunately, we are glad to note, it is small enough to fit into a purse or computer bag along with everything else you carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every review must have a purpose","review":"The book does not give you positions to go along with the telling you \\"THE PURPOSE\\".

He had Sam Rivers on tenor saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano, Bobby Hutcherson on vibraphone, Ron Carter/Gary Peacock/Richard Davis on bass.

It's a shameless embrace of impulsive living, embodied in the stylized way this book is written, and which was eventually Kerouac's undoing.Is he fleecing the lowlifes he socializes with by writing down their stories? Is he glorifying, and capitalizing on, disfunction? It's difficult to answer those questions, but a more meaningful or entertaining book would preclude their asking.Capote said of Jack Kerouac that he was \\"typing, not writing.\\" That may have been unfair, but reading the Subterraneans, I felt I knew where he was coming from.

His sound is always heavy and well in tune with his fellow musicians. On this CD there's a pretty good group. Art Pepper plays very inspired sax and the legendary trumpeter Art Farmer switches to flugelhorn .This accents his lyrical talents and the magic is apparent on \\"Downwind\\" and\\"My Funny Valentine\\", a horn/piano duet with Hampton Hawes. I've been getting into bebop recently from the 70s and I see that there was more than fusion going down because this album does'nt sound like a session of vets from the 50s (though it is), it's forever modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!

Then, two strings broke so I replaced them all with Markley's so at least he'll be able to strum on it without being injured. This really IS just a toy, at least the description doesn't lie.

This album is outstanding top to bottom, although Krs' lack of a rhythmnic voice is still something that keeps me from listening to his albums constantly. There is no need for singing obviously but his gruff jutting style puts him in the category (for me of course) of artists who i have to be in a certain mood to listen to. Chilling slightly edgy music though remains his strength, and tracks like De Automatic and Wannabemceez make this a testament to the greatest time period in hip hop, the early 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"KRS went hard!?","review":"ok . this kinda' threw me off a bit compared to his 'younger' albums . it was a MUCH MUCH harder sound and lyrics were harder . wasn't quite sure whats goin on? anyway , i realized i grew out of this phase of life and spiritually there were alot of things i couldn't get with .but,oh well thats life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest KRS ONE album ever!","review":"One of the best hip-hop albums EVER!! From the moment you hear the crushing battle-song \\"MC's Act Like They Don't Know\\", to the powerful track \\"Ah-Yeah\\" to the deep metaphorical \\"Hold\\", this is KRS' supreme statement and you can really feel that he knows and understands his own lyrical/musical power. I started to get so tired in 2004 of the club rap, sex-oriented shallow rap, and lament now the art-form itself as it seemed to have crumbled... where is Public Enemy? Grandmaster Flash? KRS? Poor Righteous Teachers? The art form has been so co-opted by the media that they destroyed it in it's higher forms.

Nice glow, always work, classic looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays on, but does not turn off","review":"I really like these for at night, in-fact a few times I've woken up thinking the morning sun was coming up. The only problem I have is all of them do not want to turn off, instead they dim during the day. I think this has to do with where a room is based on where the sun is. I believe a room needs full sun light for them to turn off. In that case it would only be from 10AM-11AM for the room it's in."},{"rating":"2","title":"works for my needs","review":"I bought this light to use in my bedroom all night so I can still see my baby who sleeps with us. I was just leaving the desk lamp on before I got this light but now he's big enough that I don't need that much light. I plug this in near the floor and while it is a little bright I prop a pillow near it (not touching) to block some of the light. It leaves the perfect amount of light for us to sleep but for me to see to feed and check on the baby in the night. It never seems to go out even in the daytime - maybe our room doesn't get bright enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decently Bright Nite Lite","review":"I wanted to illuminate some nighttime dark areas. I gave this a 4 star rating, since it does a pretty good job. However, I prefer another night light that I ordered at the same time as this one.

That's my opinion and experience. Hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays on constantly, not exactly white light","review":"If you don't have this night light directly by an exterior window or in a room with bright lights (like a bathroom), it will probably stay on continuously.

Replaced a small incandescent nite light in my kitchen with this one. The old one actually put out a little more light than I needed - to be able to do things like navigate to/from , get a drink of water, etc. without turning on the overhead lights. This new LED barely lights up an area about 1 ft around the light itself. Totally useless for anything - can't believe they actually are still marketing this unbelievably poor excuse for a light. Would give it a zero if that were possible. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither worked","review":"Unfortunately neither of these nightlights worked. One flickered, the other was on all the time. Neither of the motion detectors seemed to work. I moved between various outlets and they did the same thing no matter where they were plugged in.

Big mistake. If you are looking for a nightlight to replace any of the bulb variety you might be using now, forget about these. You will be greatly disappointed in comparison! These nightlights have a large bezel giving the impression they'll emit enough light, however the LED bulb is about 1/5 the height of the bezel and barely lights it's own cover, let alone a few inches around it.

Rather than fit a higher capacity fuse, I decided to run a 14 gauge fused wire directly from the positive battery terminal to the relay provided with the Wolo. The wiring directions were useless and incorrect. Switching to a Radio Shack relay that included a wiring diagram worked on the first try. I'm very pleased with the sound of the horn. Air horns typically create a fairly high current draw, so it's not surprising that the one-star reviewer reported problems; he could have avoided his problems by using a relay.

It is compact enough to fit well, and loud enough for its size.Those who want a louder or lower pitch horn will have to look at a larger, more expensive horn.However, since they have outsourced their production to China, the quality and reliability have gone down the toilet. The last one I bought was a terrible disappointment, both in quality of construction, sound and longevity.The chrome plated model is a joke, now. Mine turned green in a couple months in a damp environment. I ride to work, so it sits out in the weather in the parking lot.Too bad. I really like my earlier Italian ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good volume in a nice, compact unit","review":"Installed this in a new Chevy Van. The van only came with a single, 2 wire horn which made replacement simple. I went the route of splicing new female wire connectors into the factory wiring and preserving the factory horn connector. For those not up for this challenge, simply cut the factory connector off and crimp on weather resistant female wire connectors. I had high expectations for a loud truck-like sound. No question that it is loud...far louder than the wimpy stock horn. It is not the deep, booming blast you get with multi trumpet air horns.

Although not the horn of an eighteen wheeler it is still a great improvement over the factory crap. The directions were good even though the print was microscopic.

It is not fixable. We were unable to reach Samsung by any means to have them rectify the problem; we could only return it, which we will as soon as our next one arrives. We are very disappointed, although the picture quality is excellent and it's probably a great TV, but this is a manufacturing defect that spoils the TV's good qualities. And Samsung's unavailability only compounds the problem. Next TV: not a Samsung!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't plan on watching any wide-screen movies","review":"I was so excited to receive this TV. Samsung has always been a good brand for me so I assumed this TV would be no different. Sadly, when I began to view a wide-screen formatted dvd, I noticed that the black bars that run across the top and bottom of the screen were misaligned--they tilted down towards the right. First I thought it was me, perhaps I was too tired from a long day and my eyes were playing tricks on me, but then I asked my friends to take a look and sure enough, they all agreed it was misaligned. My hope is that Amazon will take care of the refund and the shipping costs back to them, as a defective product should not be sold to trusting customers (I now see that another purchaser reported the same issue). Why isn't this product being pulled? Furthermore, why has the price gone up another 10 dollars from when I bought it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wha?","review":"I just got this TV today and am surprised to hear that some people have had problems with the widescreen alignment as I have found this product to be a very excellent TV with great picture quality and features. I haven't noticed any of the problems listed by the other reviewers thus far, and I just finished watching the extended version of my Fellowship of the Ring dvd, which is widescreen. The picture was perfectly aligned and fantastically clear. The colors really stand out much more than on my 10 year old previous television and far surpassing any TV I've ever owned. The zoom feature also allows for a bigger picture on widescreen format movies. I would definitely return this TV if I'd noticed any alignment problem, but as it is I'm very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Anthrax and SOD, Speak English or Die rarely leaves my CD player so perhaps I had high expectations for this new cd. I was sadly disappointed to listen to \\"Bigger than the Devil.\\" There is hardly any well defined guitar rifs to jam as it was set in the predecessor cd. Tt seems all they wanted to do is see exactly how far they could go satanically with a lot of guitar noise. The 1st album, the lyrics are just hilarious and the rifs just simply rock. Sadly, this cd remains in its jewel case as a dust collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...You Can Keep A Nickle In Your Car!\\"","review":"When the almighty S.O.D released \\"Bigger Than The Devil\\", the metal universe was in messed up.

Then, seemingly, out of nowhere, the almighty S.O.D returned and released a very worthy follow up to the immortal \\"Speak English Or Die!\\"No, this isn't your dad's S.O.D. It's a much more heavier version. Scott's guitar playing is a little more slower, more sludge like. Bily sounds like homicidal maniac on this record. Charlie's performance is very good ( I mean, it is Charlie Benante, after all), along with Danny's (though not as illustrious as last time.) Scott & Charlie haven't really played this heavy in Anthrax, except on \\"We've Come For You All\\", current Anthrax studio album.My favorite song's on here are \\"Bigger Than The Devil\\", \\"The Crackhead Song\\", and \\"Charlie Don't Cheat.\\"In short buy with confidence"},{"rating":"2","title":"they haven't lost anything over the past 14 years","review":"if you liked Speak English Or Die, you will probably dig this album. yeah, there are some subtle differences. the guitar sound isn't the same classic 80's thrash metal tone that made Scott Ian's rhythm playing famous. it's a little more sludgy. also, Billy Milano's vocals are a little meaner sounding with a lower, throaty growl compared to the S.E.O.D. album. but overall, the S.O.D. spirit is still there. the songs are still great, they're still heavy, funny, and offensive. probably one of the best metal albums of 1999. you may or not agree, but it has to be at least the best album on Nuclear Blast records that came out in '99."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.O.D., baby","review":"It's definitely not as good as Speak English or Die, but then, what is? Bigger than the Devil is still an above average metal album. The songs could be faster and more anthemic, but again, how do you follow Speak English or Die?

Many of my reviews have commented about how the action is getting more and more involved in every book but this one really had the action to drive the story along and keep you reading. I felt like all of the story lines in this book really just exploded with excitement and tension. I didn't really notice anything in specific that took away from this book beyond the normal issue that I have with the prologue repeating what the end of the last book said.All in all, I think this book really pulls the reader into the story and drags them forward in a way that all of the other books should have done so I'm giving it a higher rating than the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"He did what?","review":"This ninth book in the best-selling Left Behind comes out with drama rising suspense as Trib Force members wrestle with the idea of taking the mark of the Beast vs. having the seal of God. Carpathia, as the Antichrist, continues to bask in the adoration of Earth's followers, even as he leads them to their certain death. Dr. Rosenweig shoulders the responsibility of leading Trib Force followers, even as some question his leadership. Chaim debates with the Beast, as the Antichrist takes his throne into what was the temple of God in Jerusalem. In complete defiance, the Antichrist attempts to sacrifice a pig in the holy temple, but doesn't get the job done. Even the kids get in on the action of defying Carpathia and of glorifying the One True God. The book closes with the Trib Force core again wrestling, this time with the safety of their own people, and of where safe houses are located.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desecration","review":"Without a doubt this has to be the worst written book in the series.

With the passing away of a few more members of the \\"Trib Force\\" things are really getting down to the wire... the next book should prove to be either a very emotional book or a extremely joyful book that makes one feel a glorious feeling inside, when they say \\"I won't be left behind!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Scriptural Accuracy!!!","review":"As a Christian who has studied end time prophecy for about sixteen years, I am IMPRESSED with the authors' knowledge of Biblical prophecy.

The characters continue to hold my interest as this saga unfolds. Can't wait for the next installment!I don't expect unbelievers to fully appreciate this book.

I found it to be a very faced paced book, with very little repetitiveness. I think for those people who may not have a good take on the Book of Revelation, these books may be just what the Dr. ordered to get them to start reading the bible. I really enjoyed Desecration, although I thought it a little gruesome, but hey, I guess thats what its all about !

I'm certain the authors didn't intend on this becoming fluff reading at the beginning, but it sure is now. I wonder how they feel considering that it seems they've seriously reduced themselves and compromised their witness to this point of greed, laziness, and mediocrity. The book is fun -- no great literature, but it's the spirit behind the book that kinda disturbs me; yes, they're still a vehicle for Christ's message, however, it seems to be just an afterthought now. I hope I'm wrong about these guys and their motives, but it seems to me that they've lost their spiritual credibility.

As usual, I was going to wait for the paperback, but then I said \\"Why not\\".It seems they're reading the reviews here. There was less emphasis on the pre-saved testimony of the characters (for an expalanation read my previous review, listed in the first book's listing). They've created a little more room for development, although I do not know whether or not they will use that room. I will point out, though, that the characters have developed from book one to book whatever, but they develop slowly, in regard to whatever situation.This is the second of the books which I was able to read in one sitting, if that's saying something. At least there is more that can go on now. For plot reasons, now they merely need to cover more than a couple of days per book again, then the plot could really move quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"a vast improvement over the previous books","review":"Although the characters remain poorly written, this book is fast paced and packed with breathtaking action from beginning to end.

We'll have to wait at least 8 months to find out what happens next. My suggestion until then? Go back to the beginning and read 1-9, just to keep your memory fresh.

Tim and Jerry have stopped trying and are just mailing it in. They're on a beach somewhere counting their money. I wonder if they really believe the story they are writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This book is incredibly boring and really has no point. It has an extreme lack of characterization and the plot is so messy. It skips around from person to person and is written in such a way that you have no idea who is saying what and who isn't. This had the potential to be a good book, but it was written way below its level and seems to be more of an indignity on Christianity than a helpful force. It's more likely to make people fear God than bring them to Him. It kind of does the opposite of what it seems to be there for. So, I'd recommend to stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last book","review":"This will be the last book in this series I will read. The writing is bland. I agree with the one reviewer that these books are becoming painful to read. The character development is minimal and the plots are simplistic and boring.I think the authors are doing a discredit to a great idea by dragging it out way too long. The authors cover in an entire book what a good writer could accomplish in a couple of chapters. It is not like the characters/plot are compelling enough to keep the reader engaged.I will be looking into other apocalyptic fiction and abandoning these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE WITH CHRIST CLONE","review":"Allow me to be blunt. LEFT BEHIND is not even in the same league with the books of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY! The LEFT BEHIND series jabbers on endlessly about paper-thin characters (I know that's over used, but rarely has it been more appropriate) and barely deals with the events of prophecy. The Antichrist in these books is so unconvincing it's pathetic. The entire story of Desecration is built around the antichrist doing things he simply would not and will not do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble","review":"This is pure profit-motive writing. They should be ashamed of themselves. First off, they could save a few trees if only they would go to regular margins and spacings. Seriously, there is not 200 pages of text here.Why should there be? It only covers 4 days. When they said they would write about the rapture, I had no idea they were going to cover it minute by minute.It is so dishpan dull, I am actually forcing myself to read it. I am actually rooting against the characters because it is so sloow.The Christ Clone Trilogy is markedly superior.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated by the short period covered and left hanging.","review":"Please bear with me while I explain why I give this book such a low rating. I have read the entire series including this book. Don't get me wrong, the books are a quick and enjoyable read. I started the series in the summer of 2001 when there were only 8 books. I finished all 8 in about 6 weeks. But I am frustrated that at this point there may be 15 books to complete the series if they cover the small amount of time this one does. Also, without describing the ending of this book, it leaves you hanging in the middle of an episode. I am hooked and ready for the next book, but it will not be out until next year. My recommendation is to NOT purchase this book now. Wait until the entire series is completed and then buy which books you have not read all at once. That way you will have the entire story and can read it until completion and not be frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last of this series that I'll read","review":"After all the hype about this series I finally relented to read the latest installment. What a mistake! I went in with low expectations but was still disappointed. I at least expected some high action end-of-the-world biblical stuff, but what was there was just silly paper-thin interpretations of prophecy which displayed absolutely no imagination. What I did find was endless talk about uninteresting characters and the plan of salvation. The Antichrist in this series is a buffoon! For good apocalyptic fiction I recommend Stephen King's THE STAND or James BeauSeigneur's CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY."},{"rating":"1","title":"More awful stuff","review":"This series is like a horrible accident. You don't want to watch but you have to. The books keep getting worse and worse with little to no character development. The book is often offensive as it would seem that only white people will have the keys to the kingdom. Chloe's \\"little band of believers\\" in Chicago are so stereotypical that it is painful. Also notice that all the other blacks in the novel die(one I suspect was killed off to show what happens when you lust after a white woman). Other reviewers have already detailed how completely implausible the plot is. The book is also very poorly written. If you haven't started reading this series, don't. If you are caught up in it, stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind Series - Book 9 Desecration","review":"The ninth book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series \\"Desecration-AntiChrist Takes The Throne\\" is a continuation of the fine fiction writing of Dr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins. It deals directly and imaginatively with the difficult theme of eschatology without leaving the \\"heavy feeling\\" of pouring through another book written after extensive research on a difficult subject. Rayford, Chloe, Buck are representative personalities of people all over the world. What makes them different is how they deal with a crisis situation that has never been put upon mankind as of yet. This book is also good because, if you are not a \\"heavy\\" where the Bible is concerned, it can spark some very lively discussions. Maybe, hopefully turning some to the source book. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One flew over the cookoos nest","review":"Jesus said the resurrection is on the last day, not before the tribulation. The rapture occurs before the tribulation, not the resurrection. The made in the shade escape is against the gospel of Christ. The saints who are persecuted in Revelation and Daniel are the saints that remain, not natural Jews who are not converted. Jesus taught his disciples to pray to be accounted worthy to escape the tribulation, not to take it for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renews my faith in the Left Behind series!","review":"The last two books in the series started to give me the feeling that maybe the dinamic duo were starting to lose their touch. We saw signs of old plot techniques brought back into the forefront, and it seemed as if the originality of the series was starting to go south. However, with Desecration, Jenkins and LaHaye reply with a superbly planned and written book. The opening chapter is enough to hold your interest for the entire book, and we are finally shown the better side of many of the main characters. And FINALLY! A sense of realism! No more instant replacements for Trib Force members who are killed!Be prepared to be shocked and have your breath taken away. If you thought the ending to the last book was a surprise, wait until you read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Finish","review":"The Left Behind series started out with such promise. I rated the first book a 5 and I am afraid the last book will be a 1. The drawn out story lines and repetition from previous books, which is not necessary due to the loyalty of the readers, has taken the excitement out of the story. Lahaye and Jenkins have apparently succumed to the power of the Anti-Christ and decided making as much money as possible on this series is more important than tell the story.The Anti-Christ appears to have gotten dumber and less powerfull in every book. Why can he control the thoughts of people, but not read them? Reasonability has left the story line and the reader is left laughing instead of being amazed or inspired.I am looking forward to a break in the series. Maybe I will forget how bad it has gotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desecration- Anti-Christ takes the throne","review":"This is a wonderful book. When you read it,u realize that this is a time period that is yet to come. You realize how good God is, and how much you can trust him. It was really good, and it's a book that you just do not want to put down. As you read it, it keeps you on the verge of your seat, and just when you think the soultuion or resolve is coming, it switches to yet another character. (You have to read the book to understand.)I think the whole series is incredible. At the end, well I won't spoil it, but the last words you here are from Carpathia, and you just can't wait to see what God will do for the Jews next. But I turned the page, and it ends with Revelations 12:12. I'm not satisified yet, as soon as the new book comes out, in Summer 2002, you can count me to be one of the first to read. Incredible series! Jerry B. Jenkins, and Tim LaHaye know how to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming soon from Lahaye & Jenkins...","review":"Coming soon from Lahaye & Jenkins...Silence: The Seventh Seal Is Opened (Left Behind #583)Summary: The heroes of the first 582 Left Behind books return to sit on their fannies and wait for the half-hour of silence in Heaven to pass (Rev. 8:1), only to realize with growing dread that the authors that control their existence will not let them ever reach Paradise so long as there's money to be made writing stupid books."},{"rating":"2","title":"another excellent addition!!!","review":"Desecration was another wonderful addition to the Left Behind series!!!!Eventhough I can hardly believe it, but was an even faster read than all the others. I really enjoyed it...up to the last page, of course, because it will kill me for the next 10 months wondering what's gonna happen next!!Jenkins and LaHaye are truly amazing---in writing -- and in helping bring people to Christ through these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Once again, the authors of this book have given us thought provoking fiction. Not only do I find the ideas and concepts powerfully protrayed, but it is easy reading. The narative flows at a break neck speed that catches and holds the readers attention. As a result of the times that we live, this book allows for much self-reflection. Good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"How very sad","review":"The Left Behind series is an unfortunate symptom of hubris running amuck.Two questions for you Christians who believe that everyone except you are damned: Do you actually think if Jesus returned to earth, he'd damn everyone who didn't accept him as God's only son? Why do you insist on interpreting the Bible to say that -- when other, more Christ-like interpretations are possible?But when people like me say things like this you immediately go to Biblical judgment, don't you? It's easier to close your mind than open yourself to the message Jesus tried to spread: Patience, understanding, forgiveness, and tolerance.This series goes to show that fear and ignorance sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over YET?","review":"What started off as a promising series has turned into a ploy by the writers and publisher to make more money for themselves by dragging the story out. The writing has gotten very thin. I can't believe the reading level could be more than 8th grade. I can't even remember what grabbed my attention to these books. The story line now is so unrealistic I can't stand to read another one, which is too bad because I think there could be a message in the story - but it was lost long about the 4th book. This book takes place at the 3 1/2 year mark - but it seems like the last 3 or 4 have done the same. It is moving very s - l - o - w - l - y. At the rate they are going, it's going to take another 10 or so books to complete the tribulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer an advocate","review":"I'm fed up with the blatant attempt to milk the market for every dollar this story can wring. It's plain wrong to use a spiritual subject like this to reap gratuitous award, and I refuse to be exploited further. In the midst of all these books, I read a great novel recommended by the author Clive Cussler, which I will pass on to anyone interested in the topic of Judgment Day. The book is \\"The Last Day\\" by G. Kleier, and it is a very moving, scary, intelligent look at the World in the throes of a Second Coming. What you will like about this book is that it is ONE, completely contained story -- not a trick to stretch you and your wallet out over multiple books. And in reading it, you will find far more to think about and marvel over than any these other so-called \\"Judgment Day\\" novels, which may follow the Book of Revelation better, but lack \\"The Last Day's\\" spiritual power and surprises. I'm leaving \\"Left Behind\\" behind, and anyone who is tired of being duped should do the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desecration","review":"I agree with several other reviewers...boring!!I started the Left Behind series late and read the 1st 4 books in a week. They were interesting; I cared about the characters. Now it seems as if the author is burdened and JUST wants to finish the series. The writing is elementary. This 390 page book is actually about 200 pages if the print were smaller and the typeset filled the page!! I agree with another reviewer who said get the book from the library or borrow it. Don't waste your money. Does the author truely want to help believers?? Write a decent book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Bad writing","review":"Like many others I became totally fascinated and hooked into the series because it simplifies the prophecies of the end times in a storyteller fashion. However, about half way through the series I began to get annoyed with the sloppy writing, but continued on until I started reading Desecration. There is no excuse for educated people to write a book as poorly as this. I could not keep up with the pages and pages of unnecessary dialogue and finally just put it down. Well I know the outcome of the story anyway! The series is a great idea. I just wish the authors could have told the story in fewer books and with some sense of literary merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"could'nt get past the narration!","review":"It seemed like an intruiging enough book, and I'm sure I would enjoy reading it myself, but the narrator on this audio version is awful! It says he is some award winning narrator, but I can't imagine! He dramtically 'whispers' the last word of almost EVERY sentence! He sounds like William Shatner or something. Waay too much 'drama' in his voice to allow the listener to be pulled into the story. I couldn't get past his silly voice! I gave up after the first chapter. (no offense to the guy, sorry)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Reading","review":"This book as well as the rest of the series has been for me very enlightening. I've enjoyed all the books and sure, at times I've found them rather slow at first but they are well worth reading. I also feel that they are a great wittnessing tool.As for the NUT who wrote in a prior review of this series that GOD was a Baptist GOD, shame on you and may GOD have mercy on YOUR soul! I am a Baptist and never have I heard such a remark. The GOD that I worship does not dicriminate. My husband is Catholic and we share many things in common within our religions. The most important being that we both believe in Jesus Christ and what He sacrificed for us so that we might have eternal life.I have a piece of advice for you and that is what religion you are or what religion you claim to be is not going to matter to God in the least if you get to heaven. Religion is something we small minded, self-satisfying humans created and it will not get us into heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like they're not even trying anymore","review":"I have read every book in the series, and this, by far, was the worst of the bunch (I sensed it was going downhill with the previous book.) The authors seem to have forgotten how to tell a story, let alone make it interesting (Ghost Writers anyone?). The grammar and style are targeted for a very young audience, and because of this, the book belongs in the Young Adult section of your local bookstore. The plot is interesting for a few pages here and there, but overall, there are probably ten worthwhile pages. The filler between plot points comes across as if it was written between tee times at the local golf course. I rarely read a book I don't like, but I felt compelled to write about my experience. The book deserves less than two stars, but since the overall series is rewarding and interesting (and I will see it through the end,) I gave it a higher score..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great","review":"I think this series is the best series ever!I like the characters and the action in it,I tree is just awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Stop","review":"It is a good sequel to the rest of the preceding books.

My niece and sister got me into the audio tapes of the left behind series. I was so interested in what was going to happen next I could not wait for the audio on book 9, so I bought the book and could not put it down. I finished the book so fast I wanted more, so I started on the Kid's left behind series. I am now waiting patiently for the Kid's 19 & 20 and I am patiently waiting for The adult # 10. In closing I just want to say that I have read other reviews and I don't understand what type of people are writing these reviews, but I thank you for putting their opinion out there bad and good. Brenda waiting for the next one. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait till the next one","review":"I couldn't wait to read Desecration. I was just slightly disapoited in the ending. But I guess I'll be first in line for the next in the series. I can only hope they wont make us wait until halloween of next year.

Even knowing the truth it has opened my eyes even further. God Bless keep on writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Glad I Didn't Pay List Price!","review":"I've read all of the previous books in this series and eagerly await each new installment. But, the last several books have become boring, predictable, slow moving, and devoid of any real suspense. This one is the worst. You could easily skip it and save yourself some money! When you've finished you don't have any more insight into the characters than before you started. It seems as if Jenkins and LaHaye are just marking time until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Main Book - God's Word","review":"For those who think that the book is full of preachy mumbo jumbo, for your own sake, pray to God to reveal Himself to you as you read His Word, the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this one.","review":"I really tried to like it. But I didn't. I found it boring, cliche, predictable...not like some of the others in the series. I had to force myself to finish, though I must admit the second half was much better than the first. I am a Christian, and I think this series started out with a wonderful message. Now I think they're just cashing in. I'd be willing to wait for longer periods of time between books if they were better quality. These books are starting to read like Danielle Steel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series Thus Far","review":"Definitely the best of the series thus far. Book 9 takes the excellent plot and character growth from books 6 through 8 and expounds on them even further. Simply one of the best books in the series - the plot will leave you wanting to turn the pages even faster. Be forewarned, this particular book is very difficult to put down - and the character growth is phenomenal with some of the best \\"second-guessing\\" on G-d's Will by the characters as they encounter death, destruction and mayhem as never before. A real page-turner, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent as usual","review":"This series has just been wonderful to read and clarifies the Rapture as well as the ensuing battle. Although it is a fictious account I don't believe it could be more real. This particular book is filled with the scripture and with the \\"Word\\". They have left this reader thirsty for more becasue we leave the book with the Trib Force split up all going to serveral hot spots and extremely dangersous situations. I only hope we don't have to wait too long for the next book.This is a definite must read for all followers of the \\"Left Behind\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lover of the Left Behind series","review":"I thought this book was one of the best I think as the books go on they get better and better. I have read all the books in the series in less then 6 months and I can't put them down. I can't wait until the 10 book comes out until then I have to find other books to read. But I recomend this book to anyone who believes in God. The books shows I think how life is going to be and shows us that we should change or ways before Jesus does come back that way if you do believe in him with all your heart you do not have to worry about the comming of crist. I give this book two thumbs up just like all the rest of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Really enjoyed book nine of this series.I liked all the fast paced action. The book is hard to set down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It seems that either this book was either rushed or the authors just need to fill in the spaces. After reading all of the others and telling my friends about it I find my self embarrassed that I did so. Even the ending seemed like a weak attempt at (...) me back in for the sequel. I won't belive that the main reason this edition was written was for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"This is the most boring book of the series yet. All the characters say things they've already said in earlier books and do things they've already done. In addition, the authors seem to be getting more 'denominational' i.e. they are writing the characters in a more Pentecostal vein... 'words of the Lord' and such. This will most likely be the last book of this series that I purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a cop-out","review":"I enjoyed the first books of this series and was impressed by how well the story progressed. Great literature? No! But at least they were interesting and tried to have a message.This book is by far the worst of the series, and may turn me off on the rest of the series altogether. It feels like the authors are selling out to try and accommodate a bigger audience. It has a low-budget, movie-of-the-week feel. They authors keep trying to throw one big event after another without giving us a chance to know and care about the characters. The characters are just action figures and have lost all trace of the personalities we bought into in the earlier books.And the ending was a ridiculous insertion of a TV season-finale cliffhanger, trying to rope the audience into tuning in for the next installment. If the authors were still as focused on their message instead of their ranking on the best seller list, they wouldn't have to resort to such tricks in the ninth book of a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"series going down hill fast","review":"This book shows that the love of money exceeds the desire to publish a quality book. The series takes a definite nose dive as this book preaches more than it acts. It is about time for this series to end. The authors continue to try to stretch the series out now quite openly showing that the time frame create in the first book no longer is relevant. Pregnancy takes a few short months, a few books back. Baby grows to talking in less than a month. It is worse in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"They should have finished the series when they said they were going to in the 7th book. I was so disappointed when they started to drag the books out."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 more books left..","review":"I recieved this book as a gift the day it came out. I didn't start reading it until months later. two days ago in fact.. and I have 70 pages left, so you may think this review immature. Frankly, I find this series boring, and each book a re-hash of the same plot over and over.. someone in the Force is killed, and new characters are introduced, while Carpathia advances in the stages of biblical prophesy. Theologically, and realistically, this series is so unbelievable. Honestly, When I read this, I can't imagine HOW, especially when talking about the community and their gullibility, and the acts of Carpathia. The writing style seems poor and descriptions are shallow. I am tired of this series, yet of course will finish it.. but not necessarily by my own will. I have read from MANY that the Christ Clone Trilogy is far better theologically, militaristically, politically, and technologically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've never reviewed a book on Amazon, but since I've enthusiastically read every store in this series I just had to add my two cents. The first six books were read in one or two sittings, at the detriment of my daily activities. Books 7 and 8 were read in 3-4 sittings, and this book was read over the span of a week or so. I hope the trend is reversed with the next book. Desecration wasn't very gripping and only spanned a few days. Carpathia is now a comic book character. The lack of sophistication and subtlety with his character development is very disappointing.I'm hopeful the authors will resist pressure to put out the next book in six months if it continues to diminish the quality of the writing, plot and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Deserves a Black Hole Rating","review":"I'm very disappointed that Amazon does not offer a black hole rating just south of the 1 star rating. I could not finish Desecration, finding it exceedingly less interesting than reading a telephone book or getting hit by a car. I would rather have an angry dentist give me a root canal without anesthetic than finish reading Desecration. If this is the highpoint of what Christians are currently capable of in terms of art then I'm afraid we deserve another round or two of the Spanish Inquisition, followed up by the ten plagues of Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desecration - Huge Fan becomes Disappointed","review":"Number 9 - \\"Desecration\\" was disappointing. I am a huge Left Behind fan and preordered this book back in July. I devour the books in about a day, but I was very disappointed in this book. Simply, this book lacked substance and I think the authors are trying to stretch the series too thin. In a nutshell, the front cover and the back cover say it all.I will give the next book a try and hopefully it will refuel my interest - if not, I am done."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-15 plastic scale model","review":"The X-15 is one of the best experimental aircraft in the aviation history.

I'm also in love with Broken Wings. And the truly new material is awesome! Clay has definitely come a long way since the release of his first CD, Measure of a Man.

It's a bland collection of power ballads from the '80s with 4 original pop-lite songs.You can tell that Clay loves glory notes since there's plenty of them to be had on this CD. I personally don't like the breathiness and lack of emotion in his voice but he is a capable singer.The uninspired arrangements (ie. Without You) and moments of hoakiness (the spoken word inserted on Broken Wings) made me long to hear superior versions by the original artists instead.

Had there been a name for the runner up on American Idol there are only two choices Clay Achin' or American MIDOL because there is too much pain associated with listening to this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Window Into His Heart","review":"Having seen Clay Aiken twice in concert, I knew I would want this album as soon as it was released. I expected something wonderful, but what surprised me is how personal the selections seem--it's as if Clay has opened a window into his heart for us. This album is both refreshing & poignant, & just like the previous ones, I'll be buying extras for gifts. Thank you, Clay, for sharing--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enjoy and nevermind the BS, er, RS...","review":"Clay's voice has never sounded better especially on \\"Because You Loved Me.\\" I've bought copies as gifts, too. I hope \\"A Thousand Different Ways\\" does well-- despite RCA's bungled marketing and commercial radio's virtual boycott-- Clay deserves a wider audience.Like many others, I'm disappointed that there isn't more original content on this release. But nevermind Rolling Stone's snarky review: it has no content and seems like a cheap shot (not to mention that it's the \\"in\\" thing lately to slam CA.) RS used to be a reputable music mag but no one could accuse them of having an open mind regarding Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed to replace CD stuck in car player","review":"Sorry, not a favorite of mine after hearing it on loan from our library. Sadly the car cd player broke and it was ruined as the mechanics tried to get it out. Not to fear, found nicely priced replacement on Amazon site. Thanks Amazon, but No Thanks Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATDW- WOW","review":"This album is getting a 5+ from me!! It not only showcases Clay's beautiful,pure voice but the arrangements with the musical background is marvelous. I cannot choose a favorite because each song is special and Clay sings them like you have heard them for the first time! This album is a classic and one that Clay should be very, very proud of!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Different Ways","review":"I really enjoyed this cd and hope the wait for the next one is not as long..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holey moley!","review":"I love this CD!!!! I think Clay's voice shows a maturity and a smoothness that was not as apparent on MOAM. I think he brings a freshness to each of the cover songs and sings them with emotion and attention to each nuance!!! Lonely No More is awesome!!! Broken Wings...ethereal. Here You Come Again - Dolly Parton should be proud Clay Aiken is singing her song!!!Beautifully crafted CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a concept!","review":"Here's an album by a young man who knows where his talent lies! No hip-hop, no unintelligible words, no foul language. It is a pure voice whose range is better than almost anyone on the music scene today. The songs, although mostly covers, are beautifully arranged, and his voice shines through in all its glory! In most cases, his versions are better than the originals. Perhaps it was a mistake to have so many covers on his sophomore album in that it may not sell as well as his first CD, but I believe this is one that will continue to sell as more and more people realize just how beautiful it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort from a guy with a great voice","review":"I loved Clay's first CD, so I didn't hesitate to buy this one as soon as it came out. I held back in saying anything about it, figuring it would take time to grow on me, but it still hasn't happened. This CD is amazingly dull. Even the songs I do like (\\"A Thousand Days\\" and \\"Everytime You Go Away\\") never rise above pleasant. I'm more than willing to give the man another chance in a couple years when he decides to come out with a new CD, but until then I will remain a disappointed Clay Aiken fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be five stars but wont let me change AWESOME CD","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting this cd. His voice is beautiful and I constantly have a smile on my face while listening to him. It gives me chills. There is just no one out that there has the same effect on me. I truly hope to hear some of these songs on the radio. The new songs are great especially \\"A Thousand Days\\". There is also a song co-written by Clay that is not on this cd but you can download called \\"Lover All Alone\\". Clay not only has the singing down but it sounds as if he is a great songwriter as well. I am hoping the next cd will be all new songs possibly all written or co-written by him. That would make it even more special. He is an amazing vocalist, entertainer and does so much for children with special needs such as autism and does a great job as a Unisef ambassador. Thank you Clay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldies not always Goldies","review":"I love Clay and his voice. I have to say that this album was not for me. I like a lot of the Golden Oldies, but not the group chosen for this album. I was around when they came out the first time. I didn't like most of them then and my opinion has not changed. The new songs that were on album were nothing special, somewhat bland and boring.That boy can sing. He deserves to have some good songs written just for him.I will be waiting to see what his next album is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover album? Bad idea.","review":"I love Clay Aiken's voice - it's just beautiful. However, I do NOT love these songs! I couldn't stand most of them the first time around and am baffled why anyone thinks we need to hear them again. These are just such lame songs to cover.I'm still a fan, but not of this album. Next time out, I'd like an album of originals. And could we make it a little upbeat, please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically Superb!","review":"Once again...Clay Aiken has done it. I was anticipating an album of originals, so with that said...that is the only REAL disappointing part of this album. Growing up with most of these cover songs, (many of which may have been done before), Clay Aiken adds his spin on these songs. He is soo technically clean, and has such wonderful range. I must say that I still love the original versions of these cover songs better. But being a Clay Aiken fan, I still support this album. His voice is undeniable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"I ended up giving this CD away. As hard as I tried, I just couldn't get into it. This album is terrible! Clay can do so much better than this. He should have left these great songs to the originators. Sorry Clay... you didn't even come close to doing them justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, boring renditions","review":"Let me start by saying I love Clay Aiken's voice and I could listen to him sing just about anything. I really enjoyed his first CD and was looking forward to the release of this one. As a child of the 80s all of the songs on this one are familiar to me. I was a little disappointed that, with the exception of Broken Wings, the arrangements are pretty boring. The songs sound just like the originals. I was hoping for more updating with a Clay twist. I really wish he'd come out with another project with more original songs featured. Clay's got enough talent that he doesn't need to be rehashing other people's hits. He can make his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three years for this?","review":"Three years have passed since the debut from Clay. What a great CD that was. It was the followed by an album of Christmas tunes. Very nice, but not something I like hearing in August. Finally! A new album from Clay. But what the heck, it's all covers! You're kidding right? THREE years and we get a pile of cover tunes? Come on Clay. You're a big talent, don't be wasting it churning out remolded cover tunes. You have done well with them, but I know all the tunes and won't be playing them over and over. You need an album of originals, with maybe a cover tune thrown it. Talent =10, Originality=5.I can see it now, November 2009 and Clay's next album will be a greatest hits collection of all the covers from this, covers from the Christmas album, and maybe one or two originals from the debut album. Honestly I like Clay alot, but he won't last long making people wait three years and still not do anything orginal. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Clay has become a Vegas lounge act","review":"With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career. While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original. As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason. Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Revamp of Previous Releases","review":"ALL of these revamps (covers) are new and FRESH. Clay's voice brings out the best, and his originality creates a fresh approach to each and every song. Clay is a perfectionist, and he brings the best forth to make something \\"old\\" brand new. He's #1 in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everybody!","review":"I was excited to get my hands on Clay's new cd. What a showcase for his beautiful voice. And while covers may be a strange choice for a sophmore CD he does these proud in addition to delivering 4 brand new songs, one of which he had a hand in writing. I think he's been able to give the older songs a brand new flavor and the new songs round out a terrific variety of songs that have appeal for all ages. Hundreds reviewed this CD as 4.8 stars out of 5: http://www.buzzillions.com/prd-345117-clay-aiken-a-thousand-different-ways-reviews/"},{"rating":"2","title":"different strokes for different folks","review":"It has been a joy following Clay Aiken's career. He has inspired many folks of all ages. A good role model is hard to find in the music industry these days which makes Clay a breath of fresh air to many. We will love him, support him and care for him because of who he is, not just what he does. It is an imperfect World and if Clay sings some songs that not everybody likes, so be it - you can not please everyone and Clay isn't trying to. He loves to sing, and if it works for him - that is good - if it doesn't - then it just doesn't - and that is good for Clay too. It is his Faith that has his fans so completely devoted."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Still Has the Idol Voice","review":"Three years after coming in 2nd in American Idol... Clay can still singlike an angel....Love his voice...and his general entertaining attitude.Hope he keeps singing for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Different Ways","review":"\\"A Thousand Different Ways\\" is one of the best albums ever. It is professionally done so as Clay Aiken voice is front and center. Clay Aiken has a voice like no other. He can actually sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think the CD is fantastic....","review":"Then you need, NEED to see this man live!! He sings several songs from his A Thousand Different Ways CD and he sounds absolutely fabulous singing them live. As Sara Collins mentions below he breathes new life into these selection, but in person, on stage, he launches them into a different dimension entirely. I Want To Know What Love Is and Open Arms are just the tip of the iceberg of these covers sounding like you are hearing them for the first time. If you haven't seen Clay Aiken live and in person, I strongly encourage you to check if he's coming to your home town and buy a ticket fast!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful music!","review":"Each track has its own individuality. The unifying factor is Clay's amazing voice - crystal clear high notes and warm, rich lower register. It's so wonderful to hear such beautiful music- hopefully some of these cuts will make it onto the radio. Don't forget to download this CD from iTunes and get another bonus track - Lover All Alone, which is worth buying all by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I just couldn't be more delighted with Clay's new CD. The \\"covers\\" are so creative in the arrangements and perfect for Clay's wonderful voice. With the first CD, I felt like it was a kid with a great voice just showing it off. With this effort, he shows he's not just a kid with a great voice, but truly a SINGER. Bravo,Clay. Please don't keep us waiting so long for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clay I have been waiting for!","review":"I always knew Clay could do it but the first album was a disappointment. In this one you HEAR Clay not just the music. He is so smooth and sexy (can a grandmother of 11 say that), Who the heck cares if he is straight or not he is great just as he is. Hang in there Clay. Be yourself and if people really care for you and your voice they will always be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Classic Love Songs","review":"Just got this CD and absolutely love it. Clay Aiken makes all the covers his own. Many new arrangements which add a whole new dimension to each song. There are also some wonderful new songs. My personal favorites are Lonely No More co-written by Clay Aiken and These Open Arms written by Jon BonJovi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Journey","review":"Well done, Clay and team. You have breathed new life into these classics and given us some nice originals as well. This album does, indeed, take one on a musical journey, one that must be completed with each listening. The voice, the arrangements, the instrumentation are all first class and the Celtic sounds are particularly lovely. It is a great album to kick back to. Don't plan on getting much else done because you will be drawn into the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MAN with the Incredible Voice","review":"Clay Aiken has an absolutely amazing voice. Not thrilled that there are so many covers but Clive Davis and RCA are responsible for that decision but Clay has made masterpieces of all the remakes. 'Broken Wings' is by far the best cover and much better then the original version. 'Lonely No More' is the best of the originals. This CD must be added to everyone's collections. It is great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cover song album","review":"Clay's new album, A Thousand Different Ways, is covers of 80s pop songs. It has much, much better production than his first CD, Measure Of A Man. I love the new arrangements of the cover songs. There are four original songs included on the album as well. Of the newer songs, my favorites are: Lonely No More, These Open Arms, and Everything I Have.Tag: American Idol"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Clay has matured!","review":"This latest CD of Clay's is the best yet, and I have them all! His voice has become much richer, showing how he has matured. My favorite is selection #5, \\"Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word\\", but each of the songs is as good or better than the original! Keep them coming, Clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT album!!!","review":"This is a great album. It has a fresh, new sound for some truly great love songs. I love Clay Aiken's voice...it is pure, and it is real SINGING. The background is delightfully unique. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER","review":"I was very much a fan of Clay's when he appeared on \\"American Idol\\"; however, I found this cd to be totally boring from beginning to end. Clay exhibits absolutely no feeling in any of the songs on this cd, and this cd should be entitled \\"A Thousand Different Ways To Cure Insomnia\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"Well, it's Clay, so the vocals are outstanding, of course. But I didn't realize before I purchased it that the majority of these songs were remakes. And, sadly, most of them are remakes of songs I grew tired of long ago and no longer care to listen to, no matter who's singing them. The quality is good, so if you like these songs, you will enjoy Clay's renditions. So, I guess while I am not ready to sell my copy on ebay, I was disappointed by this one and would recommend his first CD over this one by leaps and bounds. Unless, of course, you are under the age of say, 25, and have never heard these songs before . . . then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man with the golden voice","review":"The range, purity, and emotion of Clay's voice is unbelievable and instantly recognizable. Every song on this album is wonderfully done, the music is reinvented and awesome, and of course, Clay's voice shines through. This album is all love songs and he pours his soul into singing them and actually engulfs himself in the music. Also, 'Lonely No More', a song he co-wrote, is one of my favorite songs and has a wonderful meaning to it. This is an album that everyone will at least find one song they love on it (if not, all) :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not his best.","review":"I enjoyed Clay's renditions of these well known songs but I am sure that I would have enjoyed an album of original songs by Clay better. Good but not worth a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken Does It Again !","review":"A thousand Different Ways is a very good covers cd by Clay Aiken ! Particular favorites are Right Here Waiting,and Without You. Fans will love this. I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen more than once before you decide.","review":"I feel that sometimes critics listen to one or two songs and then pass judgement on a whole CD. This album of covers and new songs showcase Clay's flawless voice and breathes new life into some of the greatest love songs from the past. I believe that you will enjoy hearing the updated arrangements of old favorites as well as the four new songs. Give this album a chance. It will soon be one of your favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"The \\"twist\\" on the covers are so surprising. Aiken took a bold chance totally making these covers \\"his\\". I love this CD because you can actually hear the beautiful words because the instramentals are an excellent compliment without being evasive. The original songs are to be remembered. Thanks son, I'm enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Surprise","review":"I wasn't really sure about this CD until I heard the songs streaming online. I have to say what a pleasant surprise I had when I heard them. I really like most of them, and I love several. Here You Come Again is a great treat. Everything I Have is also a favorite, and I read that Clay says he wanted an Art Garfunkel sound to this song. I'm a fan of Artie's. I think Clay did a great job. Broken Wings is really unique, and I love the way the poem ends with the title of the CD. Finally, Clay is given credit as a songwriter with Lonely No More. When the snow begins to fall and the fire is lit, I'll be having my glass of wine and listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's \\"A Thousand Different Ways\\" is Fantastic","review":"Clay Aiken's new CD transcends the sense of sound. It is beautiful, sensitive and melodic. These are the qualities that describe Clay.It is a welcome relief from the noise and panic sound of Hip Hop, and Rock.If people listen to Clay's kind of music, perhaps a more serene, romantic and balanced world will prevail.God Bless Clay and his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!","review":"I am a HUGE Clay Aiken fan, but I am very sad to say this album is a flop! I was very disappointed with it. It does not compare to his first album or his Christmas albums. It's a medley of other artist's songs done in such a sappy way, i could no longer listen to it. This album stinks in A Thousand Different Ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible piece of garbage","review":"I have to admit that I've been a fan of Clay Aiken since American Idol 2. I have his debut cd and christmas cd and both were pretty good, though the first cd was in my humble opinion as overproduced as most pop cd's are. BUt this one is something I cannot fthom or comprehend. How can Clay have come up with something so bad and trashy after waiting for 3 years...and who was this producer who came up with such a pathetic album... the voice sounds so butchered and doesn't sound like a man at all. it looks like it was one big karaoke show and this one was not even the best singer of the bunch. Poor CLay AIken sounded like he was just breezing through this without any soul put into it and I am so disgusted at this album that it ended right in the trash bin... I only hope that with his talent that he has showed in the past he can still recover from this huge fiasco and come up with a respectable cd the next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO IS THIS???","review":"As a huge clay fan and a self described \\"Claymate\\" I'm going to be honest about this and not just give Clay 5 stars because I'm a fan. This is not good. The Clay we all fell in love with on Idol is not on this album. Where is the heart and the soul we heard in \\"Solitaire\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\", even \\"Measure of a Man\\"? This album is more cheesy background drowning out Clay. Not to mention, what's with the breathy, soft voice??? Where's the powerhouse notes? I for one, am soooooo disappointed! Clay, you're selling out to exactly what you didn't want to be....an overly produced, overly marketed \\"pop\\" album. You were better than this...I hope you haven't lost it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crap","review":"I am flabergasted at the number of people who are giving this cd 4 and 5 stars. My question is \\"how much did they pay you\\"?Come on- this cd is terrible. If Mr Clay keeps this up he will have plenty of time to perform oldies at weddings and birthday parties.In my opinion this spells the end for Mr Clay. His next stop will be the Las Vegas bone yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dreadful !","review":"A million songs to choose from and Clay Aiken thinks that people want to hear his cover of Dolly Parton's Here You Come Again? Huh? I've seen some serious mis-steps in my time but this new CD by Clay Aiken really takes the cake. He claims that he's been on some anti-anxiety medications....well, he should have gotten off those medications before choosing his songs for this horrible collection. Thumbs way DOWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, seriously, how about a REAL album from Clay???","review":"A Christmas Album, now a Cover Album, yet his last REAL release was in 2003!! It's a good way for an artist to stay in the spotlight when they don't have enough inspiration to write original material, but for Clay, that's not a problem, since he doesn't write ANY of his own songs. How on Earth can someone go 3 1/2 years with no original material, when you don't even write your own music?!?Onto this cover album.... all I can say is, \\"WOW!\\". It was probably the worst collection of covers I have ever heard in my life. He absolutely BUTCHERS some extremely classic songs. This, coming from a guy who actually likes Clay's voice, and his debut album. Imagine what the haters would say!I mean, get real, Clay. This was an abomination, and so is the fact that back to back albums of yours aren't original material, which is a REAL album. What artist puts out a cover album when they're supposedly in their prime?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Beautiful CD","review":"If you don't have this CD in your collection yet, run, don't walk, to your nearest retailer. Clay sings four new songs, including my favorite, Lonely No More, and uses his remarkable voice and unique style to remix some classic oldies. My fav here is \\"Here You Come Again\\" the Dolly Partain 80's hit. Clay did her proud with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Clay!","review":"I listen to ATDW's daily. I love it more each time I hear Clay's gorgeous melodic voice. What a wonderful Christmas present for that special person in your life, that you want to impress. Buy this lovely Cd and you won't be sorry. Thank you Clay for a beautiful album of love songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing voice, amazing man","review":"Clay Aiken's 3rd Album is an amazing combination of old songs, made new again by the angelic voice of this talented man. After listening to the album numerous times, I have to say that I am in awe of CLay's melodic and hauntingly beautifu voice that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride, right to the end. Saying \\"Thanks, Clay\\" is such an understatement....but, Thanks, Clay, I love the album so much.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Suspect 1","review":"Beautiful performances by all involved and thrilling to watch.

At 35 he is comfortable in his skin, reassured in his vision of America and not afraid to tell the world about it. Compare this to \\"Born To Run\\" and you can see the evolution. He's tackled every conceivable issue here: friendships - \\"No Surrender\\"; realtionships - \\"Bobby Jean\\"; aging - \\"Glory Days\\"; and family - \\"My Hometown.\\" Even the misunderstood title cut (you should really listen to it, Ronnie) cries out to be taken seriously. He is a popster in the mold of Michael Jackson, but with the spirit of every poet from Dylan on out who came before him. Easily his best effort and among the best of all time! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Study of Lost Youth (Freedom on a Plate)","review":"That's what this album is really about. From the disillusionment of the title track through the melancholy rememberings of My Hometown, that all this albut is about.Springsteen takes us on an exuberant ride through wild youth, the invincibility of the young, and finally the nostalgia of youth. This is a record about finally growing up. It's telling that he was 35 at the time.Mind you, this is not a sad record. Many of the songs are remarkably exuberant and enlightening, and the EStreet Band rocks and rolls in true anthemic fashion. Musically, this is arena rock writ large. Huge, melodic, brilliant.You can't walk away from this album empty-minded. True Americana, and more patriotic than anything that is happening in our compromised freedom these days.This is Freedom on a Plate. Listen to it.

For some reason the sound was not good and we had a hard time understanding the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce is one Patriotic Fellow","review":"This album makes Bruce Springsteen the symbol of the hard workin' American. The title track, in my opinion a patriotic anthem (even though some disagree, discusses a Vietnam war veteran who gets in trouble, gets drafted, and heads to fight the Vietcong. The song discusses the heartache and agony of war, but shows a proud Vet (thanks vets!) coming home from the war and shows the determination he has to make it in the USA. That's the patriotism. \\"Glory Days\\" is the best Bruce song ever, the guitar work and the entire E Street Band is rockin' through the whole thing. Hometown is great too. Everything's good about it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's...Arena Rock Man!!!","review":"The E Streeters sound as lame as a Bon Jovi cover band (folks, that's not a compliment). With this release, Bruce goes from scruffy Poet Laureate of the blue collar underdogs to heavy rotation MTV hottie. Sad. The \\"Live 1975-85\\" set is an even worse sell out. Guess the guy's Golden Age was \\"Wild, Innocent\\" to \\"Nebraska\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition","review":"I recently heard the song \\"I'm Goin' Down\\" on the radio and did something I've always been meaning to do. I counted the number of times Bruce Springsteen sings the word \\"down.\\" Quite honestly I lost count at 70 - this in a pop songs not much longer than 3:00. Gee, how profound, how moving, HOW REPETITIVE.Others have complained at how repetitious the title song to this album is. They are right. But lets us not spare \\"I'm Goin' Down\\" from the same scrutiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits in the U.S.A.","review":"I won't say this is his best album, but it's easily his most popular and best selling. Many a casual fan has probably gotten either this album or his \\"Greatest Hits\\". To be honest, I'd almost take this one first. Besides the SEVEN hits from it, including \\"Dancing In The Dark\\", \\"Glory Days\\", \\"My Hometown\\", and the title track, every non-hit is great as well. I love the songs \\"Working On A Highway\\", \\"I'm Going Down\\", and the excellent minor hit \\"I'm On Fire\\". This album is just impossible not to like. I guess that's why I have it on cassette, cd, and vinyl. It'll go great with your \\"Tom Petty\\" and \\"Mellencamp\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...One of my Favorite","review":"This wonderful album is one of the best of the 80s.

For a while, I tried to pretend that I liked it, but it just didn't work. \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" has to be one of worst songs ever written - it ranks up there with \\"Feelings.\\" Some of the other songs are ok in a John Cougar Mellencamp sort of way, I suppose, but even these seem like dumbed-down versions of material from \\"The River.\\" I bet that most people who hate Springsteen (and I know quite a few) base their opinion on this album alone, and I don't really blame them. It's a shame, though, because much of his early work is really good: I suggest checking out \\"Greetings from Asbury Park,\\" \\"The Wild, The Innocent, and E Street Shuffle\\" or \\"Born to Run\\" if you want to know what the fuss about Springsteen is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"positive feedback","review":"This item of Bruce Springstein brings back good memorys.

People these days stereotype Springsteen by this album by saying it is too corny. IT IS NOT. It has something for everyone. Even the lead song is not what it seems. Everything has a hidden meaning. That is why it is the BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born to Run, Born in the U.S.A.","review":"The definitive 80s album from the Boss. Born in the USA is a satirical song talking about Vietnam. Reagan blithely used it as a campaign song. Cover Me , he was covered before, right? Darlington County is the lowkey. Working on the Highway is rock n roll. Downbound Train, I'm on Fire, No Surrender, Bobby Jean, I'm Goin' Down, Dancing in the Dark,My Hometown. All in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irony and Mockery are not the Same","review":"Bruce Springsteen had spent the ten years previous to \\"Born in the USA\\" proving that he had a head on his shoulders; on \\"Born in the USA\\", he proved that he had a sense of irony and humor as well as his notorious sense of drama. The title track was co-opted by Reagan in one of the lowest moments of an extremely low presidency. It was vastly misread all over the map--liberals called it patriotic jingoism, conservatives called it anti-US propaganda. It was, of course, neither, but the story of one Viet Nam Vet who gets lost in the shuffle after the war. The anthemic chorus is highly ironic, indeed, but it's not mocking anybody: It's just angry. This is angry music, for all of its big beat and hooky melody; it's not the comedown that some of his fans thought it was, but truly intelligent rock music as had not been made since the days of Dylan and the Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 10 greatest albums ever...","review":"If I hear one more person suggest that \\"Born in the USA\\" is a \\"patriotic\\" song a la Reagan, I'm going to tear my own thumb off...this album makes some people uneasy I think because it simultaneously has tremendous lyrics and insight into the American way of life, yet also SOUNDS so damn good! A lot of the people who even like Springsteen but don't like this are people who're suspicious of any music that sounds good; it makes \`em feel guilty, like they're not suffering enough. This is a brilliant album, and for those who don't get the irony of one of pop music's bleakest lyrics being placed over a stirring anthemic tune can stick to the obvious \\"sincerity\\" and earnestness of, oh, I don't know...Joan Baez, maybe? John Denver?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"This cd was packaged well, in great condition and arrived quickly at my home. Classic songs by the boss....you cant go wrong! Thanks again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly commercial. It has a couple of gems, though.","review":"This is by far the worst Springsteen I've heard. In fact, this was the first Springsteen I ever heard, and I hated the name until someone got me listening to his seventies stuff. The whole album's commercial pop. \\"Glory Days\\" ranks among the worst compositions by Bruce, and even though \\"U.S.A.\\" has great lyrics, if you lived through the hype of this album in the 80s, the song really turns your stomach. \\"I'm on Fire\\" and \\"My Hometown\\" make the album. If you really want this one, your'e better off purchasing the cassette and not the CD. This one don't quite make it to a Worthy CD status. Your'e better off, in the 80s at least, with getting \\"Tunnel of Love\\". Now THAT is an album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Past due for remastering","review":"This album needs to be remastered. I'd also like to add that if & when they ever get around to it they need to put as a bonus track \\"Pink Cadillac\\" since it was the b-side to \\"Dancing In the Dark\\" and gained it's own claim to fame on Radio & in Clubs. You can't find the song anywhere, not on the Greatest hits or the Essential Collection...what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't aged well.","review":"I liked this went it first came out, but after all these years it really hasn't aged well to me. The production is too slick and popish. His overall sound doesn't do much of anything for me anymore. A legendary performer whose music will always be stuck in this era."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Everything about him and his music sucks. He has no talent at all. Just retire already the older you get the worst you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah... it's garbage","review":"Alton music is right on! I talked to a music professor, showed him the analysis and made him listen to \\"bored in the USA'. The dudes right!... it IS the same thing over and over. As for the subject matter bein' about somebody dying in A war?... well it don't sound like no sad song to me. Besides, if you think lyrics are meaningfull in pop music you probably like Bob Dylan. Prosody, which has to do with how music and lyrics go together; Springsteen ain't got it. His BAND,... now THEY WERE COOL!, and are the only reason anybody ever noticed him in the first place. Anyway, if you want meaningfull lyrics or want simple heartfelt music listen to Irish music or Gentle Giant. Simple is one thing, retarded pandering to the American public is another. Bruce Springsteen is living proof of P.T. Barnum's quote, \\"Nobody ever went broke underestemating the intelligence of the American public.\\" Go get 'em Brucey!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit","review":"Perhaps the worst best-selling album ever, right down there with Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" or any drek that Styx, REO Speedwagon, Duran Duran, or Billy Joel cranked out. Springsteen essentially sings the same song over and over. Let's hear it for the little guy. Hackneyed and done a billion times better by Bob you know who. The title tune is Reagan gone amok (I know what you're going to say, but if Bruuuuce meant this to be a insightful song about bogus patriotism, it was lost on the general public), while \\"Dancing In the Dark\\" is simply horrible. I won't even touch \\"Glory Days\\" or \\"I'm On Fire.\\"This album made me stop listening to the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing In","review":"At this point, Bruce was just cashing in. It's just that simple. I defy you to prove me wrong. It has been nothing but crap since \\"Born in the USA\\". I am sorry.All of the previous releases are great. Masterworks even. But not \\"Born in the USA\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mockery, really.","review":"In 1984, at the high point of President Reagan's climactic confrontation with the Soviet Union, came out this album. I liked it, since it's full of memorable melodies, until I learned about Springsteen's draft dodging. Only then did I realize that the title song is a put-down. To the garbage it went."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Book/Workbook","review":"This is a ridiculous publication. The ink smells like a book that was produced in someone's basement with cheap, toxic ink. The photo on the front is different from that on the website.

I bought it but returned the book to Borders after a surprise check on Amazon.com on the reviews by so-called \\"readers\\" here. If you look at the review dates, all were dated around May-June 2002. If you're not convinced, click on each reviewer and most of them actually did only review (5 stars) for this book. Who knows, it could be a marketing tactics? I went over to check Barnes & Noble and it was exactly the same.. reviews were all done from May-June 2002 then full-stop. So I'm not saying anything, I did buy the book for 2 days, but I was not impressed. No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you become a good options trader? Practice","review":"I am a novice at options trading and have read a couple of other books dealing with basic options trading and found the practice portions of the book uniquely detailed and really helpful. Having gone throught the mechanics of options trades in other books, I can honestly say that this is the first one that really helped me cement the concepts into my head. Before this book, I was always confused about how to calculate the proper risk/reward potentials of different types of spreads. Saliba's book gives you that practice aplenty; its an aspect that other beginning options books seem to lack in my opinion. I respect Saliba's accomplishments and find his latest book a great resource as a beginning options trader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a winner...","review":"but, there are too many errors in the text.

Not recommended as an introduction to option trading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Place To Start","review":"This book is just what I needed. I've been interested in options trading for a long time, but never found anything that could make sense out of how it works. This book did it for me. This guy, Tony Saliba, obviously knows his stuff - he didn't get profiled in \\"Market Wizards\\" for nothing. He earned his stripes through hard work and a proven plan that will work for anyone willing to learn and apply his fundamentals.If you're interested in learning more about trading options, this is the place to start.

Not being Christian or ever intending to go down that path, I am studying the course for the content and intent rather than the specific philosophy. The question and answer format of this particular companion book has asked pretty much all the questions that I was coming up with as I went along, and others that Hadn't come up with, but i'm sure I would have eventually. Definitely worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Title","review":"Basically an overview of the miracle cult. It's ultimately absurd and completely contradictory at its core - claiming some form of pantheistic idealism, which is also at the same time solipsistic, though it denies simultaneously its fundamental solipsitsic principle throughout the entire work (not only does it deny its inherent solipsism, it relies on a non-solipsistic viewpoint to try and promote its views).Like other cults, it uses Christian terms but simply redefines them so that they have lost all inherent meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a DVD as listed in the product description","review":"The listing page for this item indicates it's a DVD but it is not!!It is a CD-ROM game.

The disc simply got better with everytime i listened to it. When i took it over to friends houses, they would instantly join me in the instant-fan category. Lyrics that speak blatantly, emotion without getting whiney, and energy that is almost unsurpassed make it as addictive and comforting as a morning cup of coffee. With most bands that sing about girls you get a lot of, \\"how could this have happened to ME\\". The impossibles take a much more mature route with their wailings by saying, much more honestly, \\"how could i have done this to myself\\". Between the energetic work of the guitars, to the dueling vocals, an album like this comes along very rarely. To be ranked with the likes of the pixies, man or astroman, weezer, or pink floyd for having taken an existing genre and pushing it beyond itself to new levels. The impossibles have made something actually deserving of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great cd","review":"I LOVE THIS CD SO MUCH.

A lot of guest rappers were brought in, but they don't help much. The only song that is above average is \\"Biological Didn't Bother\\", which is a love song to Shaq's stepfather. It's actually pretty touching, believe it or not. I didn't like this CD that much, but Shaq's fans are free to disagree with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaq-Fu?

Come on man, don't hate this multitalented gift. He can play ball, and he can rap too. The cameos make the cd even better. The beats are straight also. He doesn't curse, and doesn't look like a thug, so what? His beats are good, and lyrics are very worthy and from the heart, not a demographic in mind producer. The cd is straight. One of my favorite rap cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"This is another great album from the Bottle Rockets. This is really what rock and roll is meant to be. They know how to cut loose and have a good time at what they are doing. Long live the Bottle Rockets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply disappointing","review":"I've been a Bottle Rockets fan quite some time now and love their previous 3 albums (plus Leftovers). So I eagerly purchased Brand New Year. Now I want to want to know what happened and what went wrong?! Aside from perhaps 3 songs, they seem to have left behind all the subtleties that made them a real treasure, and decided to become Foghat. There was forboding when I picked up the cd itself--I was a bit confused by the album packaging as it looks more like the cover for a west coast punk band than the Bottle Rockets. I hope this album is merely a hiccup rather than an indicator of the decline of the Bottle Rockets as a vital band. If you're unfamiliar with the band, I would highly recommend any of their previous albums and avoidance of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with this last reviewer--skip this CD","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Bottle Rockets and the thing I love so much about their work is how it transcends \\"bar rock\\", or, rather, it recreates the feeling of \\"bar rock\\" without having to do yet another cover of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" or \\"Free Bird.\\" It's a reinvention of sorts, or, rather, the distillation of all the best parts into one new, interesting new whole. That combination of energy and brains and country and blues made the earlier CD's so cool and what made this new one a drag. I was glad I listened to this before I bought it so I could save some money. It's not up to par with \\"The Brooklyn Side\\" and \\"24 Hours\\" and I think that's a real shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle Rockets shoot fot the stars","review":"St. Louis roots rock band The Bottle Rockets are my latest favourite band with their CD brand New Year.They open shows for Govt. Mule and besides, how can you not love a band with a song called Oh My God the Bar's on Fire (Somebody Save the Beer) or a song about Nancy Sinatra, especially when it has a great harmonized guitar lead riff.Or for that matter, some of the best electric 12 string playing (Alone in Bad Company) since the Byrds flew high in the 60's.There is lots of tasty blues tinged playing tinged with a bit of pop punk like the catchy Gotta Get Up and even some country on the infinitely rewindable Love Like a Truck.And Let Me Know should have been a hit single when this CD was originally released in 1999. (It was rereleased in 2004 on a brand new record label.)Throughout there are singable choruses and hooks that grab you by the ears and won't let go for an hour.-- By Richard Amery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-Issue of a Good CD","review":"I've been aware of the Bottle Rockets ever since hearing $1000 dollar car on the Radio down in Sante Fe many years ago. They have the ability to cross country with rock to make a slice of Americana like few other bands. On this offering, they refer to parts of their vissual and audio past with songs like Nancy Sinatra and the Neil Young inspired Headed for the Ditch. The best songs, in my opinion on this CD are Love like a Truck and Sometimes Found. The order of the songs is not correct as listed here on Amazon. The Cd begins with a Acoustic version of Brand New Year and Ends with a Electric Version of the same song. Another nod to Neil Young perhaps in his putting together of Tonights the Night. All that being said this isn't their best work but it's better than most of the material being produced these days. Look for the Brooklyn Side for their Best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure unadulterated American rock and roll.","review":"I'm 43 years old now, and the music business has always mystified me. Why some bands make it and others don't. If anyone saw the recent MTV Video Awards, it's painfully obvious that popular music is at an all-time low. The Bottle Rockets latest release may sound like an anachronism to today's record buying public that don't know any better, but this album is a classic of down-home American rock and roll. Fusing bar-band chops, blues, and Creedence-style licks - this is one of those albums that I will play for my young kids years from now when they ask me to put on a REAL rock and roll album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic Overview","review":"The Inductor Handbook was a real disappointment. The information is a superficial overview of how to select inductors for basic applications. It might be suitable for a hobbyist or student but is not the caliber of information required by a modern technical professional. There is little information about the design of inductors and no information about computer modeling - crucial in today's environment.

Jenny Lind was an amazingly determined, self-disciplined, humble woman with an extraordinary voice and life. The peak of her career spanned the 1840's and 50's and criss-crossed the globe. Her early childhood is particularly poignant and that is where this book starts. Her difficulties in finding true friends and supporters were no different from those in the entertainment industry today. Child stars have a really tough time reaching a profitable adulthood without serious emotional problems. But Jenny had an inner strength and focus from a very young age and was able to withstand, overcome, and eventually flourish in her chosen profession. There are other, older youth biographies available. I have read only this one. It is quite thorough and naturally oriented in the female direction. Probably it's best readership will be found in grades 6/7-10/12."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book","review":"I am not an expert developer but I have a fair amount of experience building financial applications in Java and C++.

THIS WAS THE VIDEO TAPE THEY USED FOR THIS RELEASE. The funny thing is, that the transfer I made ( I happen to have the original video tape - in Beta, which was a better format picture quality-wise) looks better- which is sad. I fully expected (at least) a new transfer if not in 35mm (which, I'm sure is quite unobtainable- might not even exist any more in 35mm anyway) but an old 1977 video tape???? I have to quetion this. 5 had to give at least 1 star for people who might say \\"well, it's better than nothing.\\" Precisely. The film itself is a cute fluff with several good musical numbers. Highlight being Connee Boswell singing STORMY WEATHER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Stooges","review":"The enduring popularity of The Three Stooges is directly attributable to the 190 comedy shorts the team made for Columbia Pictures (1934-1959), particularly the 97 entries featuring Curly Howard as the third Stooge. While several of these classic comedies are available on DVD, a few non-Columbia Stooge curios have turned up, including this title.SWING PARADE OF 1946 is a low-budget musical produced by the lowly Monogram Pictures, starring Gale Storm and Phil Regan, with Moe, Larry and Curly providing comedy relief. Away from their home studio, the boys seem to be a little disoriented; worse yet, Curly is clearly in declining health (later that year he suffered a stroke that forced him to drop out of the act). Rabid Stooge fans may want to check this one out, although it's nowhere near the level of their best work. Casual viewers in search of the usual boisterous antics are advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis Jordan and 3 Stooges save the show","review":"Acting is poor and most of the music is nearly unbearably dull.

When compared to the other stooge full length movies that always featured Joe DeRita Swing parade really stands out. The absolute treat of Louis Jordans \\"dont you worry bout that mule\\" will get your feet and or fingers tapping or snapping for sure.

So put away the prozac, cancel all the appointments with your shrink, and step into a world where reality is fantasy and fantasy reality. Where Gods and dragons exist only if you beleive in them. Where death is personified and rides a magical steed named Binky and where the world is flat and rests upon the back of four giant elephants, who in turn ride upon the back of a giant turtle travelling through space. A wonderful series, that gets funnier and more intriguing with each new book. It is not strictly necessaarily to read them in sequence, however it does help. The Colour of Magic is the first book in the series, but not the best.

No problem!","review":"Terry Pratchett's first book is filled with humor, wit, and in-sewer-ants. Being the first book, it has an amazingly solid plotline and interesting characters. This wasn't the first Discworld book I read, though, and was surprised to find the Luggage was introduced in this first book. It has a humorous outlook on tourists, and with the introduction of insurance, Ankh-Morpork has quite a bit of remodeling to do. This Discworld book is as good as any other, following the escapades of the wiz(z)ard Rincewind and the tourist Twoflower.

The stock review is that it's what might happen if Douglas Adams had written fantasy. Except it's not very funny, and not very good.Might I have enjoyed this had I read it as a teenager? Maybe. But I'm not. It starts out only slightly dumb, but gets worse with every page. And the ending is just terrible.Boring, unfunny, and utterly pointless.

Written by a child for a child with absolutely no life experience. I read many books of many genres and this book is completely and utterly boring...Maybe he puts together some fancy little one liners and a couple of odd pairing of words. This is definitely not a timeless novel. Not a book I would recommend wasting your time on. Sadly my boyfriend recommended this book to me and I am quite disappointed at his lack of taste and style. My imagination needs a bit more colors than this. Anyone who can rave about this book has absolutely no clue about art or true writing. It is rigidly boring and a pretentious piece of writing.

I read it on a long distance flight. It is hilarious. I laughed a lot. Do I plan to read the next 19? Absolutely no way. I can't stand this much fun.

Unfortunately, this book was so obtuse, so difficult to understand, and so uninteresting that I feel no motivation to read other Discworld books to find out if I would like them better. I felt so stupid while reading this book because I just could not understand what was happening, and I didn't care enough to make it worth all the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Creative","review":"Pratchett's Discworld novels are incrediably diffrent and creative. These books are great little satires that will make you laugh outloud. I am reminded of Piers Anthony's Xanth novels, however, Pratchett's humor comes across as more mature than the bombardment of puns found in Anthony's books.

The plot was excellent, the characters witty and amusing, and the settings couldn't be better! This book is lacking in some areas, it would help if somethings were explained a little better, but is still excellent. I can enjoy it all the more because this book has Discworlds best chararcter, Rincewind. If you haven't read any of his ohter stuff this book will still be okay, but if you have read other stuff it makes the book more enjoyable. Buy this book today!~Rincewind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good...","review":"...as the later books in the series, but still a must read for any fantasy lover.

I just don't understand why they felt they needed to change it so much in the movie. Her story was told in a book called \\"The Little Woman\\".

Does that justify leaving out the Christian message?"},{"rating":"1","title":"bait and switch","review":"Wow, I was excited to see a movie about the life of Gladys Aylward after having read the book Gladys Aylward: the Little Woman. My wife and I proceeded to get sick to our stomachs the further we went into this mockery of a biography. They took a true story about a love relationship between miss Aylward and the Lord Jesus Christ and twisted it into a love afair with her and another character. Many of the miraculous events of Aylward's life were glossed over, ignored or just changed. The saddest part is that she was still alive when this movie was released. I guess I shouldn't have expected Hollywood to understand her life and I shouldn't be angry with them either, but it is quite frustrating.p.s. John 14:6"},{"rating":"2","title":"Break out the Kleenex...","review":"...for this manipulative, mawkish tear-jerker. The story feels superficial (you never get a feeling for Aylward's sense of spirituality, only the very ocassional bit of tacked-on religiosity), and it's all grossly sentimental. All those feel-good moments with singing kids and long hugs actually detract from the important message about selfless service by making self-sacrifice seem all too easy and romantic, even in the face of brutal Japanese invasion.The casting choices will try your suspsension of disbelief, to say the least: a Swede as an Englishwoman, a hulking German as a half-Dutch/half-Chinese colonel, and an Englishman as a Chinese mandarin. That said, this is still a fun film if you take it for what it is. It boasts an unusual story and exotic setting, and Bergman is as radiant as ever (even if she overacts in a couple scenes). Donat and Jurgens are uqually winning, in their own way.Hardly Bergman's best film, but certainly worth a watch if you're a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness","review":"Excellent classic movie!!

The movie followed the book very closely which is always good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great family movie, with a hint of romance and drama.","review":"Based on the true story of an Englishwoman in China during the middle of the 20th century, this film shows the resilence, courage, perseverance and faith with which one person faced physical, cultural and spiritual challenges. While not all parts are historically accurate, the film's climaxing journey is based on actual fact. A delight for Bergman fans and those interested in China or missionary endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inn of the Sixth Happiness = 6 stars","review":"This is a wonderful classic. My wife and I both remember seeing this movie as children but when we watched it together, it was as like we were seeing it for the first time. The story had us both in its gasped with the unfolding and the building of intensity as the main character, Gladys Aylward, plaid superbly by Ingrid Bergman, in her quest from an English parlor maid to a missionary in China during the prelude and beginning of the Japanese invasion of China during World War II. The acting, the cinematography and story were all captivating. The full screen version was wonderfully restored and played well on our DVD system. Truly a great classic, a wonderful, insightful story that brings tears, joy and wonder in its telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that will touch your heart","review":"I have watched this wonderful movie over and over for at least the last 20 years.

This is the kind of movie that you will remember for long afterward. Ingrid Bergman was an amazing actress, and to me this was her best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring film of determination, faith and courage","review":"Ingrid Bergman shines as Gladys Aylward, a British maid who yearns to be a missionary in China. When she finally gets there, it becomes apparent that God has ordained her for this special work. Curt Jergens plays a fictional love interest who brings the character of Gladys full-circle. This is an incredible story of an amazing woman who is determined to fulfill God's destiny to serve her fellow mankind.

It was horribly disappointing! No Jesus. Almost no God. And what God was there was not the inviting or wonderful or miracle-giving and loving God that Gladys lived for.

A woman with a dream and determination to do what she felt God had called her to do. A woman who worked unselfishly to help others and save many. She did not preach the Gospel she lived it and it was her life that made the difference.We can all learn from this example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawed but delightful epic","review":"The Inn of Sixth Happiness is too long and drags on ocassion but is still terrific movie making. Bergman won an Oscar for her previous film, Anastasia, but her performance in this film was much better. Her work in \\"Sixth Happiness\\" has as much breadth and vision as the spectacular Chinese scenery that fills the movie. The only sour note other than the length of the film is in Robert Donat's protrayal of a Mandarin. While he received kudos for his work in the role, it still is a bit disconcerting for the modern viewer to see a Westerner in a part that should have been played by an Asian. Unfortunately, such casting decisions were often made this way to utilize \\"star power\\" in those days. But that is a small quibble when compared with the rest of this fine presentation. Watching it is 2 1/2 hours well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every video library ! An inspiring tear-jerker !!","review":"One rainy afternoon I was channel surfing and came across this movie and fortunately for me it was very close to the beginning. I was so drawn into the story and captivated by Ingrid Bergman's performance that I forgot I was even watching television!! This is one of the most touching and moving stories I have ever seen and (I won't give this part of the movie away) when the Chinese gave \\"Gladys\\" a new name and what that translated to in English I thought I was going to go through a whole box of tissues right then and there. The storyline, scenery and acting are superb and the fact that it is based on a true story only makes it more inspiring. My cousin is 18 years old and wants to pursue a career in the mission field and I told her many times that she has to see this film. So I'm not only going to purchase one for MY video library but one for HER'S as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite","review":"I watched this movie when it first came out, a long time ago. I was thirteen years old and I went and saw that movie three times. That was a very intense story. Even at age thirteen when I couldn't understand everything that was going on I knew Gladys loved the character played by Kurt Jurgins, I loved him too! I was raised in Hawaii and marrying someone of another race was a big possibility for me. Even more than forty years later I can watch that movie and have a good cry. Enjoy it, movies back then left a lot to the imagination and that is the best way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inn of Sixth Happiness is an enjoyable family film","review":"This story is a treat. There are great scenes of the wilderness in China, heroism and dignity in poverty, perseverance in the face of impossible odds. The ugliness of conflict is portrayed with great poignancy showing the sadness and loss of war without the modern tendency to show gratuitous violence. The difficulty of cross-cultural missionary work is also portrayed. The Christian message was a bit underplayed but all in all it is a great family film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Moly break out the Kleenex","review":"This movie is awesome. I love alot of the old classics. But this one was especially good. I think the reason I like it the best is because it shows that women can do anything as long as they put their mind to it, and they don't mind doing a little work. I caught this movie about 10 years ago on a Sunday afternoon on PBS. It's definately worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing back good memories","review":"I bought this movie for my mom.

My two favorite tracks are Cano do Sal and the title track Travessia. There is a lot of emotion and feelings of hope in this album, which is very relevant considering that it was recorded during the period of the military dictatorship in Brazil. Many of his later albums would be heavily censored, but this one escaped to show Brazil and the world that Milton was here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Gives a good overview of abstract mathematics in a very well presented fashion. Gives an introduction and some practice applying first order logic, set theory, algebras, solutions to recurrence equations, and more. It really has nothing to do with computer science and makes no attempt to show anything about it, as any language is just a language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable as a Beginner's Learning Guide","review":"This is a bad book if you are not already familiar with the basic concepts of the material. The author was more interested in showing worked examples than explaining concepts, and the more difficult problems in the exercise sections do not have solutions in the back of the book, so even 'self-learning' is extremely hard.Unless you have a very good teacher, you will not benefit from the way the material is presented inside this book. 'Solutions' and 'examples' are presented 'as is' without explanations. One of my friends into math did mention it's not a bad reference guide for proofs, but he was as unimpressed with this book as a learning tool as I was. The level of rigor is very high, but the simple explanations to go with it are not present. I advise finding a good source on the subject instead of this unfriendly text, which has a target audience of math professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book.","review":"This book is very poorly written and lacks any kind of order in which to study the chapters. The explanations of theorums and formulas are just not enough. Another thing that I do not like about this is that the section problems want you to work out precise mathematical concepts that were not explained in the relevant section, thus making you have to re-read the section several times over, and even then it is still not enough. I have completed Calculus II and that textbook was nowhere near as difficult to understand than this one. If you want to get a general idea of what Discret Mathematics is or want to do self study, then get this book. But in my opinion, avoid this book at all cost. Pun intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you yearn for the quality Shadow releases of 1996-97....","review":"...they're back. The 13'th Sign, originally released on the Thin Air Label, is reminiscent of Coldcut circa 1994, when they were know as Hedfunk.

For interesting context, track 11.\\"rainbow\\" was included in Thievery Corporation's recent Dj-Kicks CD. Groove without Pretension."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accurate view of expatriate fatherhood","review":"Parks accurately and eloquently describes the challenges, frustrations, and joys of raising one's children in a foreign culture. Although this is may be too domestic a subject for those not currently challenged by parenthood themselves (as it would have been for me just two years ago), both expats living in Italy and those living elsewhere will be inspired by Parks' diplomacy and philosophy in negotiating his children's upbringing with the entire county, who see things differently.Ultimately, it is just such a study of the Italian household which gives a deeper picture of the Italian culture than any history book or political essay ever could.Parks narrates his portrait lovingly (I disgree with a previous reader's conclusion that Parks 'doesn't like Italians'), and page after page I found that Parks has the eloquence, humour, and grace to express what I had often observered here in my corner of Italy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and amusing view of Italians","review":"I saw many Italians in this book that I seem to know personally. Amusing and very insightful in the first half, the story line got bogged down towards the end and I found myself skipping pages. Difficult though it must be to categorize a whole nation it helped me understand the Italians I know a little better. Will now go out and buy Italian neighbours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Book to Put You To Sleep","review":"I have read several books in this genre, and this has to be one of the dullest books on the market that deals with life in Italy. I've lived in Italy on two occasions for short periods of time and can't help but wonder - if Mr Parks dislikes Italy so much, why is he still there? He certainly comes across as disliking Italy and Italians. This has none of the humor or whimsy of other similar books. Very disappointing. I should have know better since I also read \\"Italian Neighbors\\" and was unimpressed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Non-standard cables!","review":"It turns out that this doesn't work like normal KVM switches: it uses special non-standard adapter cables, which apparently aren't necessarily available on amazon.com, or if they are cost a lot. So you can't replace your existing 2-port KVM with this one, for example, and reuse the existing cables. And you may not even be able to use THIS KVM because you may not be able to find the cables you need. This KVM switch only comes with ONE cable to attach to your mouse, keyboard, and video; you have to buy at least two additional cables to make this KVM switch functional.So once you factor in the cost of the extra special-built cables you have to buy (assuming you can even find them), this KVM is VERY expensive. I'm returning mine. It would be nice if the item description bothered to mention the special cable type requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"KVM needs special cables","review":"As others have said, you cannot use any other cable. I attempted to use some cables we use for our servers that are of high quality. The video was fine, but would not take input from the Keyboard and mouse.Beware, you must buy their cables.This is a good device otherwise. Works very well. They really need to include cables when purchasing, at least some PS2 cables. They probably excluded cables to keep the price down and suck you in so then you have to go back and get more from them. The Tripp Lite USB cables aren't cheap either."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about Top Down","review":"If it aint the most funky bass bangin hip hop track around then what is. Who cares about the raps, when the bass line is this funky nothing else matters. Quite a good album from start to finish but track 8, funk with a capital bass. As usual the Ant Banks tracks are the choice cuts obviously starting with Top Down then Can I get a Bitch and Giving Up the funk respectively.

Although it has lots of \\"live\\" appearances, most of them are lip synched. There are a couple that are truly live and are worth watching. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of interviews. The narriator spoke on and on about how much of a phenomenon they are, he failed to discuss why they disbanded. But nonetheless, a necessary video for a true Stone Roses fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"captures band at its height","review":"Since someone asked here's what is on the video:Music promo videos (56 mins) of:Sally CinnamonElephant StoneMade of StoneShe Bangs The Drums(Song For My) Sugar Spun SisterStanding HereI Wanna Be AdoredWaterfallElizabeth My DearFools GoldOne LoveThe Roses live (58 mins) Aug. 12, 1988, at the Empress Ballroom, Blackpool, England:I Wanna Be AdoredElephant StoneWaterfall(Song For My) Sugar Spun SisterMade of StoneShe Bangs The DrumsWhere Angels PlayShoot You DownGoing DownMersey ParadiseI Am The ResurrectionYou can read the other reviews to get an overall feel of the video but, for me, the music videos were nothing special. The live stuff was good but certainly nowhere as good as seeing them live which I was able to do only twice in Tokyo. Mindblowing shows though esp. John Squire's guitar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I'm not sure why the other reviewers loved this book so much because I thought it was the worst book I have read in a long time. I hated this book, the main character was horrible and unsympathetic and I don't see how anyone could empathize or identify with her. The plot made no sense, it was confusing, completely unbelieveable, fantasy or not. There were a lot of loose ends that were not explained or tied up. The characters were undeveloped, flat and it was difficult to understand their motivations. Lastly, the plot half way through the book revolved around this mythic \\"entity\\" that was unexplainable, unbelievable, and frankly did not make the reader care one bit if it was found, understood or proven false. This novel is a complete waste of time...don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smarter than we knew?","review":"You have to read this book for yourself, as it's SO much more than you anticipate. Novak was years ahead of Dan Brown. As you read the book post-The Da Vinci Code, the Knights Templar references and one family's search for their own holy grail find new meaning as they collide with intriguing layers of mysteries and haunted women - both dead and alive.Novak is one smart author, and this is one heckuva smart book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cover.","review":"But don't judge the book by it. I loved the general storyline, but the author wasn't able to develop it much beyond the book jacket. Unfortunately, this novel's heroine is so holier-than-thou and small-minded that the reader has to be a Mother Theresa to sympathize or even tolerate her. Couldn't wait to put this one down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea...","review":"Novak does write well, however she's not much of a storyteller. Given the subject matter, one would expect some suspense, some thrills, some atmosphere. There is little to no character development, the characters themselves are static and emotionless, and one cannot develop empathy for any character. The novel was readable, but only because of the writer's skill with the language, not her ability to craft a story. While it could have developed into an intriguing tale of fear, deceit and revenge, it does not, and the ending seems more of an \\"easy out\\" than either a conclusion or a cliffhanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Loving ghost stories, I hoped this would be a great read. But I agree with other reviewers who were turned off by the heroine. And it was confusing and not so much a haunted house tale as a haunted person tale. Looking for a good ghost story? Seek out The Uninvited, Haunting of Hill House, Peregrine's Rest, The Woman in Black, Hell House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This book was a letdown. It shouldn't have been listed under ghost stories. Seemed like just a drama, and a boring one at that. I wanted to read about ghosts, not nasty-mouthed women and their problems. What a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not strong, either","review":"I enjoyed reading Karen Novak's debut novel, and I am interested in reading more of her work. That said, \\"Five Mile House\\" is a quick engaging read, but leaves much to be desired. The supernatural connection between the main character and the narrator never becomes clear, and the plot has way too many holes and is a bit too outlandish for easy acceptance. I don't want to beat this horse to death as there are already so many reviews, so let me just leave you my suggestion: check the book out at the library before you buy. It's likable, but not one I'd read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea was good so I gave it a star BUT...","review":"Leslie Stone goes around acting like she is smarter than everyone, judging people about their way of life, mothering, and everything else yet, she is a lousy mom, a lousy wife, a lousy detective and a lousy human being.She neglects her children, she leaves her 10yr old to take care of her 4yr old, she feels absolutely no remorse about her adultery and she is so rude to everyone!Maybe the writer was trying to portray a headstrong, sassy personality, but to me, it just didn't come across that way.I couldn't even sympathize with the trauma she was supposed to be going through.This was the first Leslie Stone book I have read, and I don't think I'll read anymore from the series. She was one of the most unappealing, unemotional and selfish character I have ever seen. Even when she was trying to act like a protective mom, or a righteous cop, It seemed unbelievable like she was faking/mimicking emotion. This woman seemed almost borderline psychotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"Five mile house, while a little slow getting started, was an increadible story. A true emotional roller coaster that won't soon be forgotten. Suspensful and brilliantly written, It will keep you on your toes until the very last words. The author put a great deal of thought into the creadibility of the story and makes it come alive. The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is becasue it was well into 1/3 of the book before I really became interested and wrapped up in the story. I would definitly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold my interest","review":"The blurb for this novel held my interest more than the book. Former cop, Leslie, recovering from a break down, moves with her husband and two young daughters to a cottage in the sleepy town of Wellington, while her husband Greg restores the old mansion with a tragic past that's haunted with mystery.What I liked: The writer has a pleasant style. The premise for the story was exciting.What I didn't like- Most of the characters were more stereotype than lacking depth or personality. The story structured in a way that bored me and I found myself skipping ahead. At 50% on my kindle app, I skimmed ahead to the end. I wouldn't have finished had I not wanted to read the next book, INNOCENCE.I think this writer has potential. Ghost stories aren't my favorite genre, so someone else might be more interested in the book.2.5 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book!","review":"A good quality read. Flows nicely with a few surprises. Would definitely recommend to my friends and others who like the paranormal."},{"rating":"1","title":"why after one cd?","review":"Give me a break.The band is terrible and it doesn't matter who's playing on it.John is a great singer but not here,not with those songs.Bruce can't play rock or metal he's a session guy and always will be.The two other guys well if you saw the band live it's far to be a driving machine the drummer is very very green and not very good and the bass player is washed-up.If you want a live album buy something else.Plus it's the same songs as the first and only cd so why ? Money ? Probably learned it from Kiss !"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"REJECTS\\" MAKE MONSTER ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Union could be considered the reject band. The main members Bruce Kulick and John Corabi were subjects to reunions (Motley Crue and Kiss reunited with original members). But the new Union album, Live In The Galaxy, shows \\"rejects\\" can make great music. Song's like; Love(I don't need),Old Man Wise,and Tangerine are amazing live. These songs fit with preunion work like Kiss tunes Jungle,and I Walk Alone featuring Kulick's only lead vocal as a kiss member in his 12 year history, Motley Crue tune Power To the Music, and Scream tune Man in the moon, make this album a wood-be smash hit if it had more advertising behind it. Overall I love this album and I will look forward to hearing the next Union album and all the other after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, great live release!!!!","review":"First there are no rules about when a band should release a Live disc and who cares if it's Union's 2nd release. (Look at Tesla's Five Man Accoustical Jam, critics hated it, their fans loved it and look what happened since. Every major Artist/Band releases a accoustic disc.) I loved this release, I like how both John and Bruce included songs from their past. John once again proves just how good he is on vocals and really kicks *ss on this one. I liked the song selection on this and really can't complain or whine. But I would only change two things on this release: 1.) Got the fans more into it and 2.) Put \\"Who Do You Think You Are in place of Surrender. I like what they did with the song, but that's one of Cheap Trick's signature songs and a untouchable as far as I concerned. Well worth it and one of my favorite live discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price, but only when used for a costume!","review":"Got it for Saint Patrick's Day. It was a nice addition to the costume, especially for the low price. I'm 6'2, so it was a little short for me. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowing Emotions","review":"I have never heard such a wonderful compilation of songs on one CD in my entire life. No matter what mood I'm in, I find a reason to listen to the CD. Songs such as \\"Damaged\\" and \\"Deliver Me\\" have the ability to take me to another place if I just close my eyes~they are that intense and emotional. Nelly Furtado's \\"Party\\" is great to listen to when I'm in a good mood. There isn't one song on the CD that I would consider bad, I love it. It's been my favorite CD for months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suwadee Bankok!","review":"The music describes perfectly my 3 years in Thailand.

It is very well ballanced and very relaxing while deep and dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokedown Palace","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing. I purchased it not knowing what to expect, with the exception of a few songs. I listened to it & thought it was absolutely awesome. The sounds have a very distinctive feel, and take you back to the beautiful lands from the film. I highly recommend it!! All of the songs on this cd are incredible. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD!","review":"There are a few songs I don't like, but I really like the rest!

However, what I received was cheap plastic stars with a sphere in the center. The points of the star are simply cheap red and white plastic and mine are bent.

The top point of the star was warped and fanned out. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Singing","review":"What a preview of excellent American music. A must for the young baritone. Nathan's voice is especially beautiful in the first piece \\"Shanandoah.\\" The Scheer pieces are really interesting and fun. \\"American Anthem\\" and \\"Lean Away\\" are beautiful pieces and great recital closers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful but unaffected","review":"As many have said, it's a beautiful voice, but I'm not a connoisseur of vocal instruments. What I do know and love is good singing. Gunn's readings are thoughtful but unaffected, and he's there to tell you something rather than to show off his throat. It's a well-constructed program and more than an hour's worth. As somebody said, if you've made it this far, stop looking, buy it and start listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy about this one","review":"I wasn't crazy about this one. I absolutely love \\"Just Before Sunrise\\", but this one is just annoying. He has an incredible baritone voice, but the piano accompaniment and the song selection . . .

It's incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old American Songs","review":"Fantastic compilation of Old American Songs!This album was recorded about a decade ago, today -Nathan Gunn is a well known and respected opera singer,a title he truly deserves.You might check out his other album -John Adams: Shaker Loops; The Wound-Dresser; Short Ride in a Fast Machine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little way too late","review":"You have to read through over 250 pages leading up to about 30 pages of what I was looking for in the first place: action and some suspense.You could just skip the first couple hundred pages and get right to the real story. Excellent book for the readers digest version without really missing anything.Also all the political discussions came across as so phony that it really hurt any sence of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good!","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Loved the characters, felt their frustration and excitement as the story progressed. Read it in one day and then read the follow on book, Cold Choices. I highly recommend both! And I just downloaded Exit Plan, which I think is the next book in the series. Can't wait to start it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze fest","review":"This was the most boring book I've read in recent memory. Don't let the title or the cover summary fool you. This book is not about some great submarine adventure. This book is about the career path, and day to day life of a Junior Naval Officer onboard a submarine. There is no contact with any enemy submarines until the last chapter or two. Even then, it was not very uneventful. Read if you need a sleeping pill. It worked for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Plodding","review":"The book plods along without a single instance of intrigue or interest for all but the last 30 pages. I kept waiting and waiting. Then the ending is so contrary to the way the characters were consistently portrayed, that it was just not very authenic."},{"rating":"2","title":"DiMercurio, your the man!","review":"As a reader of the complete series of DiMercurio book's, I could not wait to get my hands on a copy and I must say it did not dissapoint. I just could'nt put it down, in fact I read it in just two nights. I have reread it twice since then. I have always longed to be on a nuclear submarine and find Michael's books put you right on the deck. The plot was great and the book flowed nicely. All I have to say is Michael, keep them rolling out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst!","review":"I have read all of this author's work to date, this is by far the worst! I suppose if you'd never been aboard a submarine, and/or were a Women's Rights Advocate, or a techno geek you might like it, but...Within a few pages we are introduced to \\"power women\\", SEALS, Officers aboard submarines, etc., even carrier based air squadron commanders. The hero here, son of the previous hero, is Patch Jr., a midshipman at Annapolis. Within a few minutes of reporting aboard a submarine at New London, he is given the \\"con\\" (as in command of the ship) to get her underway by pulling a daredevil driving stunt...this would never, ever happen. Within a few days of being at sea, he is sleeping with the engineering officer (a great argument against women on submarines)...and the techno stuff gets so confusing eventually you simply want to give up trying to follow any of the concurrent plots.This one is a waste of time, effort and brain cells!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terminal Run takes readers deep!","review":"Terminal Run was an excellent read. I could not put it down. Mr.DiMercurio was at his usual top form.Cudos! I would have liked to see more people of color as I am one, and less techno mombo jumbo.That beening said this was well worth the seven bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subs & Sex","review":"I read TERMINAL RUN slowly and deliberately. What a treat. Every character was so real, the story line intriguing and the details vivid (you actually \\"rig for dive\\"). I fell in love with the new characters and ached for the trusted friends of the 'Pacino' books. Each chapter left me deeply involved and there were times I found myself laughing out loud or actually crying (all this in a sub book). DeMercurio actually shares 'the secret' ... the true lovers in the armed forces are Submariners not 'Fly Boys'. The sex is intense and leaves you aching for more.I enjoy reading and watching the submarine genre books and movies. Many people write and produce them but only a few do it right. DiMercurio is one of the Masters. The details of each dive, the attention to an actual cruise is amazing. I have never (outside of Disneyland) cruised in a sub however I feel as if I've been around the world underwater with Pacino and his crews. Thank you DiMercurio and keep on writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devilfish AGAIN?","review":"For the most part I have enjoyed this series by Michael Dimercurio.

When I sit on the sofa to watch TV (I am a short person) I have to raise my head all the time.My ranking according to my personal preference of the 17\\" 20\\" LCD TVs are as follows:1. Samsung LTN2.

It is probably the Rain Bird all together. My complaint is that to truly water your yard correctly you need to water your yard manually based on your yards needs. That way your grass grows stronger roots and can last through droughts. Because I water my yard manually I do not even use this product and it was a waste of my money. Every time the power goes out the Rain Bird would reset and I had to reprogram it. It is suppose to hold a charge and keep the settings. Yea right! The stupid thing would turn on when it was raining, middle of the night, the day. The Rain Bird sprinklers would turn on when ever it felt like it.

I only hope this doesn't become a film as someone suggests as there is no way on earth that the detail and feelings of pity, revulsion, happiness, sadness, etc. could ever be portrayed, especially if Hollywood has anything to do with it!!

Suskin however very fast disappoints you by making his character a unidimensional freak (check out his birth!) and for the rest of his book remains at ground zero of the premise that he supposedly intended, although through an outrageously overwrought prose that consumes lots of pages that bring nothing but yawns. What would have been truly magical is the convincing description of a world through smells and the way to make it real to normal smellers. That was something that was too much for Suskin who confuses a sense of magic with the license to lazily concoct turn of events that only the most gullible readers would swallow. The only good thing about this drivel? It was only US$12!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthetic Scent","review":"This book reeks (pun intended) of warped teenage sentimentality and middle-aged male perversion. It might appeal to a teen as provocatively profound and disturbing. (Hmm a Nirvana song is based on it.) It might appeal to those whose fetishes tend toward violence. For the rest of us, the story tries so hard to be bizzare in an artistic sort of way that it ends up being monotonous. Parts of the book really drag. The end is more comical than harrowing. The end is just too fantastical. The characters are like deaf mutes on sedatives. There is no reason to believe in, care for or justify the main character.You'd get red in the cheeks if you had to tell your Mother about this book you just read. She'd know immediately that the emperor has no clothes.The author tried to make literature but he ended up with a cartoon, granted a cartoon set in an interesting time and place (hence the 2 stars), but a color cartoon nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"A great book? It seems almost unreadable to me. Sure, the scent aspect was interesting - for about 20 pages. Despite putting in numerous hours attempting to make progress in it, I have have found nothing in the plot or characters of Perfume to devote any more time to it. There are so many interesting books out there; I did not find this to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's worse . . .?","review":"The flimsy, abusurdist plot?

I guess he hasn't read that many truly brilliant books. (We both agree on Henry Miller, though.) While the basic premise of this book is intriguing, the plot was heavy-handed and contrived. The gory details seemed to be over-exaggerated and superfluous in order to create an effect, and it ended becoming just a cartoonish, feeble, awkward mess.I'm not going to blame it on the translation, as two of my favorite writers are French and I devoured the English translations...if you want sensual, delicate, brilliant soul-satisfying reads by French writers, PLEASE read Honore Balzac's \\"Old Goriot\\" or Colette's \\"My Mother's House\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as everybody else says it is","review":"the freak'n book's got almost no damn dialoge.

He somehow has no scent of his own, and he thinks the best smell in the world is that of a pretty young virgin girl that he strangles to death when he is young. He travels from the streets of 17th century Paris to the isolation of the mountains, and kills over two dozen girls to capture their scent. It is an enthralling read, and while you hate Grenouille, you are fascinated by him. Plus, you learn more about scent and old fashioned perfume making techniques than you would ever otherwise care to. Kurt Cobian was inspired by this book to write the song Scentless Apprentice on the album In Utero (although you can't understand a word of the lyrics by listening to it). All in all, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the film","review":"I decided to purchase this book after seeing the film. The film left alot of questions unanswered. I was very satisfied when finishing the book. It often reads like a piece of classic literature, albeit one written for a teen. At times the modernity of the prose can break the ambience created for the setting, but while jarring at first, it becomes a non-issue as the book progresses. I highly recommend this book, especially if you were a fan of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, a page turner!","review":"The Perfume will take you back and submerge you into the 18th century with amazing ease.

A friend in France sent me a copy of it as a birthday present years ago, and I have read it several times since. The story, about a man who ultimately murders young virgins to obtain the perfect scent, may initially turn off some people. But the writing is so impeccable, the 18th century world so hauntingly evoked that you may find yourself, like me, totally engrossed after the first few pages. It is also a fascinating look into the manufacturing of perfume, how precious essential oils are extracted from plants.

I have no problem with surreal. I like scary and creepy and disturbing. This was merely pointless, at its best--it was profoundly sexist at its worst. Excruciatingly long descriptions of scent--page after page after page of them. All to prop up the most undeveloped protagonist (villain) I have ever encountered. And no review I have read thus far has even commented on the absolutely perverse mysogyny of the premise: that teenage virgin girls produce/exude the scent which will control and subdue all of humanity if they are killed and the scent can be captured. Suskind develops this atrocious idea without a trace of critique or irony whatsoever. This book was pretentious and the author's self-satisfaction was more overpowering than any civet or rose water could ever be. A disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cobain's favorite book","review":"Kurt Cobain once said in an interview that Perfume was his favorite book. It's easy to see why... Near the end, Grenouille's spilling of the secret scent triggers a mindless orgy of the awfulest proportions. However, the monster standing there could only feel hatred towards the beastly throng. There was nothing left to do but pour it on himself and get butchered. \\"Here we are now, entertain us?\\". By the way, it's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Very fascinating. This book is all discriptions and monologue so if you are into \\"things happening\\"-this is not a book for you. But it was great! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most extraordinary story ever told.","review":"Patrick Suskind writes beautifully; this is the best book ever written. Do yourself a favour, read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out as an interesting read, but fizzles...ZZZZ.","review":"I was enthralled with the premise of the book when I first started reading it, but once the novelty wore off, the story left me feeling flat. By the last third of the book, I ceased to have any interest in the main character's thoughts or experiences, and finished the book only for the sake of completing it as opposed to caring how the story ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, perhaps, but stellar","review":"Suskind's Perfume is an absolutely dazzling novel. The writing is of a caliber that one doesn't often find in modern literature. The subject matter seems strange - and had this book not been specifically recommended to me, I am not sure I would have read it. But I am so glad I did. The story of Grenouille's quest to create the perfect perfume is bewilderingly compelling. The sense of smell is among the most powerfully, and Suskind does an incredibly skillful job of describing and creating scents, even those you don't necessarily think much of in your day-to-day existence. The story is strange and bizarre, but I would recommend giving it a chance. It's one of the few novels I've ever bothered to re-read because it is so wonderfully engaging, disquieting, and engrossing. The writing is a work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"Perfume was recommended to me as the best book ever written. Quite frankly, although Perfume got off to an auspicious start and made me think about my olfactory senses (previously ignored), I couldn't wait for it to end. It's a horrible story and Suskind seemed fed up with it himself towards the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Reading despite Identity Crisis","review":"This is a haunting book. True...there aren't any characters that are easy to identify with, instead it is the pain that Grenouille felt from his hypersensitive sense of smell that kept me reading. Suskind's writing is so vivid and addicting that despite my antipathy for Grenouille I have sympathy for his plight. There are times when I thought I could smell the scents Suskind was describing in his book. The massive orgy towards the end of the book was a little much, but I think it helped demonstrate how powerful and inescapable scent is to people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age with a twist","review":"While this book starts out a little slowly, it definitely picks up the pace with a shocking climax at the end. Suskind explores themes of love, power, society's responsibility to the indiviual's self-worth, and the god-like qualities of the underman.Grenouille possesses a super-human sense of smell while lacking his own scent. He spends his entire life trying to capture the one scent that fills him with desire and figures out a way to use that scent to gain the love and power he has longed for his whole life. His journey of self-discovery does not lead to the fairy-tale ending of enlightenment, but to the realization that he is incapable of the one emotion he both scorns and desires--love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten stars!","review":"This has got to be the strangest and most wonderful book I've ever read. I was mesmerized both by its content and style, but I can see how a reader either loves or hates it. The book was recommended to me by a friend who is a scientist, and he changed his career and is now in the perfume-making business!! Well, I won't change my career, largely because I don't have one (I'm a writer!), but I'll read anything that'll flow from Suskind's pen or from his bottles of perfume!Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd, Wierd, Wierd!","review":"If you like something a litle 'different' and than this is for you.A little morbid towards the end....Really makes you smell everything after you read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative imagery - bizarre story","review":"This book was very bizarre. It was recommended by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over and I almost stopped reading before page 50. A soulless, scentless perfumer in 18th century France becomes a serial killer in order to extract the unique scents of his victims and create the ultimate perfume. The point of the book (if there is one at all) is that human beings are nothing more than easily manipulated animals, victims of our own instincts and physical desires, and that our arrogance of anthropological superiority is an illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay awake","review":"I was really excited to read this book when I first heard about it, as I thought that it was a very different and interesting concept. Unfortunately I found it hard to stay awake for more than two pages. I understand that when writing about the world of smell that a lot of description is necessary to give the reader an accurate sense of what the author is trying to portray, but this book goes on, sometimes for two pages, describing one smell or picture that could have been adequately summed up in one paragraph. I found myself skimming over pages until the author stopped with his excessive descriptions and finally started to move on with the story.There were some very interesting pieces, but overall I didn't enjoy this book all that much and was actually annoyed when I read the ending. If anything the ending makes you feel as though the book was a complete waste of time - in addition to a Very Odd chapter towards the end - just plain wierd and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exciting","review":"I don't know why everyone was so excited about this book. I read the German book and I finished it in one day - because I tried to figure out why it was said to be so good.I missed a character I could identify myself with - I did not care about any of the characters, so I found it really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"The Perfume was a huge hit among my circle of friends while I was in high school. It seemed everyone was reading it. I came across it quite late but I wouldn't have missed anything if I had never read it. It starts promisingly when the child without a smell is born in filth in 18th century Paris, but before the first half is finished, it becomes uninteresting and tedious. The author employs a narrative style, there is almost no dialogue and in my opinion it is more suited to a longish short story than to a novel. I am ok with the main character not being identifiable but I didn't find him interesting enough to be repulsed by him either. The middle parts of the book are nothing more than a way to fill the pages and the character development is poor. The end is totally meaningless and ridiculous. Maybe the problem with the book is that it is never beliveable, not even as a fantasy.I cannot comment on the language as I have read a Turkish translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I just don't get all the great reviews. The writing was good, but the story was lacking. The smells were better developed than the characters. Not only did the main character have no soul, but the book had no soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let Suskind waste your time","review":"I admit it. I was intrigued by the premise. In 18th century France, a madman with an incredible sense of smell seeks to create the perfect perfume. I have a lot of patience with madmen and an incredible tolerence for 18th century French anything. This novel abused both my patience and my tolerence. The story shambles from satire to thriller to historical fiction until it ultimately falls flat on its face and stays there for a good 200 pages. Do not read this novel if you can possibly avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does to your nose what Beethoven does to your ears","review":"I must have ordered this book on twenty separate occasions for very diverse people. That is because, quite simply, everyone should read this extraordinary novel. It illuminates vividly, brilliantly, so many things---things that will never be the same for this reader: empathy, pity, beauty, self-disgust, and fear among them, but most miraculously of all it teaches you, again, how to use your fifth sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally creepy - in a completely absorbing way . . .","review":"PERFUME reads like a grotesque fairy tale - but you can't put it down! If you have a taste for the bizarre AND a well-written novel, give it a try. But you've got to be able to stomach a little ickiness . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have; masterful storyteller; a wunderkind","review":"A fascinating story from a most unique and compelling perspective. Suskind's style is suspenful and depth-charged with threads of intoxication woven thickly. Some might find his style overworked or redundant but to me its more suspensful and greatly described as you're tremendously anxious to found out whats around the next corner. It might take some time to warm up to his translated language but once you do you will make it your own as the story is hauntingly original; a sheer masterpiece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fragrance of Language","review":"Beautifully written with a language that is fragrance at its best, translating olfactory sensations into the written word. Perhaps a bit overwrought and sometimes overdrawn, nevertheless ... the work is an accomplishment that defies narrative rules and a feast for all the senses."},{"rating":"2","title":"The smell of talent.","review":"What a great entry in the world of classic literature. Nowadays it is hard to write an original love story. Shakespeare did it all. However, there is more than love between man and woman. The Perfume is the proof. Patrick Suskind shows us the beatitude of or most unspoken fear: our smell. He created a man, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, whose nose drove him to obsession and murder. Forever he will be a monster in the eyes of the reader. I wonder. Is passion not only for the good?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The violence is thematic, not gratuitous","review":"A delicately brutal investigation into an abnormal mind, this bookwas surprisingly easy to read. There was a grotesque poetry in thecharacter.

The book is not such a fascinating story but the author deserves an award to have managed to describe sensations as the sense of smell...indescribable,inexplicable,extraordinary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suskind's Perfume trancends great literature! Awe inspiring!","review":"Reading Patrick Suskind's Perfume for the second time, I realized what a treasure I held in my hands. This book took writing to new hights. Never before did I ever connect to a story like I did to this one. The writing was so perfectly crafted and the story was so fascinating I just couldn't put it down. I was addicted to it, truly. Perfume is by far the best book I have ever read. It surpasses other novels in its sheer creative brilliance. I can't recommend it highly enough. NOT reading Perfume is a cardinal sin. Bravo to Suskind and I can't wait until I read his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMELL as metaphor for the SELF","review":"Perfume was a beautifully written book about an unusual man with an extraordinary sense of smell...but that wasn't all. Suskind gives some insight into the nature of humanity through scent. Are we born with a self or do we make it as we go along in life? Does Grenouille seek to find mere scents, or does he look for something more important? This is definitely a book for readers who seek the underlying meaning of the text, and hope to find different perspectives on the deeper meaning of life itself! Don't just read this book, engross yourself in it and read between the lines. If you do this, I promise you, this book will have all the profundity of Nieztche, or Hume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally well written, but exceptionally twisted!","review":"I had no idea that this novel was so well received when I chose to read it for a sociology class on deviance. Granted, the author did choose a very unique subject, the search for the ultimate \\"smell\\", and wrote in a very realistic and vivid way for his audience, but.... I thought the story line to be very tiresome midway through the novel, and the plot, frankly, disgusting. The ending was so unexpected, twisted, and out of the blue, that even the author seemed to be tired of the un-ending storyline. I did NOT like this book. I did not identify with any of the characters, nor did I discover any paticularly meaningful \\"hidden message about life\\" from its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Doo doo brown) Smells like teen spirit....","review":"Nothing happpens, and when it does it's completely banal. I should have smelled this one comin'. The nose knows and this one stinks. As a friend stated, \\"I can see how most of mainstream America i.e those who subscribe to People Magazine would love it.\\" Sure, Suskind adeptly evokes a time and place , and yes, the idea of a \\"hero\\" who rises to fame via the sense most taken for granted is quite novel, but these things do not an interesting story make. I read the first 50 pages and didn't care enough to find out what happens. And even when I was told, I was long past caring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"boring, no climax at all, a very weak ending, almost none dialogues, a ridiculous main character ( the murderer ), a wry style of writing. And people say this is good .. GO figure ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Purfume STINKS!","review":"Having seen the movie trailer I decided to read the book prior to seeing the movie. I could hardly wait to dive in, since it seemed like a unique idea and had so many good reviews. It wasn't long before I was disappointed. I felt that the characters were somewhat flat and I never felt any attachment to the main character. There were several areas of the book that were endlessly dry and painful to read. The ending had left me feeling like I had wasted my time. I'm not really sure what all the hype is about.Perfume received two stars instead of one, because it was interesting to read about the 18th century perfume industry.I actually chose this book for my book club and, unfortunately, the other members were equally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend","review":"I did not like this book. I thought the imagery was interesting but I did not enjoy the storyline and it was nothing like I expected.

A beautifully written, fantastic horror story. And highly evocative of smells. You can almost smell this book. Great for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well written","review":"I have to say that this was a frustrating read. There is no doubt that its well written, the narrative was great. It feels as if you're there, I could see what the writer was describing perfectly. The big letdown for me was the story. I read this book because a couple of friends of my decided to form a little book club and choose this as our first pick and I have 2 say that we all had a hard time finishing it. We thought that because it is a relatively short book it would take us 3, maybe 4 weeks to give us time to read calmly and meet in between to discuss the book so far but it took us longer. It kept making me sleepy everytime I would pick it up.The story just didn't do it for me. It felt kind of pointless and like I said, even though it was very well written, the subject just seemed like a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"capturing the smell of a young virgin, capturing the smell of a great success","review":"With his tremendous visual images,Suskind succeeded to bring the reader into the world of Jean Baptiste Grenouille. The images created by Suskind are so repulsive and consequently so effective. While I was reading the book, I'd experienced both detest and sympathy against Grenoille at the same time even though he was described as a beast. All these conflicting emotions are Human, All Too Human..."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable, educational","review":"Ah! Strong, unusual plot; imperfect main character; imaginative phrasing; and minutely drawn historical detail.

Especially recommended for serial murder enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique plot, crafted with excellence","review":"We couldn't understand the mixed reviews. This is simple the best murder mystery my wife and I have ever read.Everything from the openng page was totally unexpected. We stayed on edge throught the entire read. The ending was a total surpriseI've read too many books where the evidence hints are obvious enough for even a first-grader to pick up. This is NOT that kind of book. The butler didn't do it (or should I remenisce: \\"Mr Green, in the dining room with the candlestick for those who have a clue and remember ...)Don't read any of these reviews, even this one. Get the book. You will love it or you will hate it. One way or the other it will thoroughly entertain you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it reeks...","review":"Very quickly I will state that I was given this book by a professor at the University of West Florida and, having not heard anything about it, it sat on a shelf for five months. Then I decided to give it a chance out of boredom more than anything else...and suddenly found that I could not put it down.A contemporary classic. Rich imagery, captivating characters, a suspenseful storyline and flowing prose (the translation seems to be much better here than other German-English texts I have read - kudos to John E. Woods) make this a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morbid boring and graphic","review":"I read this book and didn't care for it at all. Certain parts of the book were depressing and morbid. All it talked about the scent of perfume and murders. The story was really weird and did not care for it at all. The writing was a bit confusing and boring. I'm just glad I bought the 1986 trade paperback edition at a supermarket used book drive for charity. I forced myself to finish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Drivel","review":"The novel has such a distasteful plot and the main character, but it could have redeemed itself somehow had it been well written. However, that is not the case here. There is a ton of information thrown in about odors and perfumes and I really get nothing from that; it looks to me that Suskind was just trying to make up for not being that good of a writer. Also, if an author sets off writing a historical novel, he is bound to create the color of the era and from numerous other novels we can see that the eighteenth-century France is nothing like what is described here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The nature of mankind","review":"The author looks at the mankind with eyes of a strange creature accidentally brought in our world. And what does he see? A disgusting, stinking trash, vile, foul, dregs, egoistic, greedy and vainglorious people. That is what we are from the point of author view and that is what this book is about.Besides all this is made uninterestingly and not very artistic either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre, and very boring","review":"It took me over two months to finish this book. Obviously some serious research went into the perfume-making part, but otherwise much of the historical and geographical detail is wrong. This would be nothing if it were a compelling read. It is not. The protagonist, Grenouille, is empty. I did not like him, love him, hate him, admire him, despise him, fear him. Quite an achievement for a serial killer to manage to be so bland. I did not feel sorry for his victims either.In fact, I did not feel anything for any of the characters. But maybe that was the author's point."},{"rating":"1","title":"William Floyd English Teacher, Bill Pike, Likes This Book","review":"Bill Pike is a complicated man and he likes this book very much.

This second time, I made it to the halfway point. Grenouille is a character so damaged, twisted, repulsive, and pathetic, that it would have been a great blessing had he died at birth. I would go so far as to classify him as sub-human. He certainly can be described as freakish. The other characters are not as dysfunctional, but there isn't an individual in this book that isn't thoroughly selfish. If you don't mind reading about psychological grotesquerie, Perfume is a well-written novel that could be intriguing. Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never knew that scent was so powerful","review":"This book is an excellent book, describing the life and ambition of a man who killed for a greater purpose. The black humour and the amazing details that the author describes really makes this a very readable book. In reading this, we are drawn into the mind of a murderer and also his ability to learn the art of perfumery for his own ultimate goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done period murder piece with a bizarre twist","review":"A quick read, it's more like a short story than a full length novel.But it's so quirky and different you won't be able to put it down.I haven't yet seen the movie, but I can imagine it being pretty interesting, I hope they do the period well.Smells. Stenches, and stinks are the stars of this story. I resisted more alliteration there.My only quibble with it is that the \\"action\\" of the book is glossed sort of rapidly. I feel like Suskind lost his momentum and squished the last half of the book into a much condensed version.PLUS for a murder mystery there are some very humorous and ironic patterns that form. I won't give them away, but I started to EXPECT certain happenstances for each character the murderer came into contact with.Still, it'll probably forever change the way you view perfumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless waste of time and paper","review":"This is a ridiculous book.

It does open your eyes (or nose!) to a sense that, I at least, don't pay too much attention to living in our sterile society and I did give my little nephew a big sniff when I saw him and realized that he does indeed smell like caramel BUT still not enough to recommend this book. It's just too dark (and I like dark) without a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This book is a waste of time, trees, paper and money, let's begin:The first part of the book is more or less regular, with that in mind and that the book has 400 pages or so and it could be written in less than 50 we will continue.The book goes out of the main story so many times that you really don't know which was that story, I would throw this book to the waste basket but this book wasn't mine so at least I didn't waste my money.The end of the book is just pathetic.P.S. I put two stars to this book because I know what is writing a book and just for writing it it has two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored stupid ,and irritated","review":"When a writer needs more than Queen Victoria's quantity of underlinings (italics) and exclamation marks per page in her diaries and letters I tend to lose interest. When the plot is so pathetically mediochre I generally put aside such a novel far before finishing it.This time I struggled to the end because someone I respect recommended it.I find it shocking that so many reviews of this novel here on Amazon have been positive. There is far more to literature than merely one-off impressions. And so much more than fuddled grammar.Suskind took an easy way out and gave us a pathetically inadequate half-baked ideaIf we need to discuss fiction then we need to study the masters, and suskind is far beyond their art."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS","review":"We are supposed to believe that this character has a remarkable sense of smell.

I read the book during the daily commute from Princeton to New York, during the ride in the train and subway.

I do not plan to read it again very soon. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh scent","review":"Perfume is a timelessly original novel, as imaginative as it is oddly romantic. This book's charm lies in its character: Grenouille, who was born not having a scent, yet his sense of smell is a thousandfold more intricate than the average person.Süskind describes 18th c. France with a sort of gory detail and grit while showing us how Grenouille lumbers through his miserable life working in a tannery and eventually a perfume shop, where his crafts are better suited as a scent creator. His ambitions go much further, however, and a far darker journey for this creature begins.Perfume is one of the most unique books I've ever read, not even considering its impactive ending. It is a delicious exploration of darkness and the human senses that is sure to entertain in its own twisted way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stylish Tale about a Serial Killer","review":"Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is the protagonist of this chilling story, but its focus is on scents - pleasant scents, exotic scents, commonplace scents, and awful scents. Grenouille is apparently a genetic error, born without a body odor but with a fantastic ability to sense and differentiate odors. He becomes a horror of a child that grows into a man without feelings. His sense of smell wins him a job as a perfumer. As his skill grows, he is overwhelmed with a desire to create the perfect perfume. He believes the scents he needs reside in young, virginal women, and he sets off on an orgy of killing to extract this scent from them. The author has a great sense of style. I could smell those odors. He also places us realistically in France, especially Paris, in the 1700's. This is a fascinating and frightening story."},{"rating":"2","title":"the sweet smell of insanity","review":"Truely one of the best novel's I have ever read.No novel to this date has ever come close.Such an odd twist turning your senses into a reason for lust and murder.And even tho the main character is truely a monster suskind ,gives him a soul.The story is amazing and will leave you sunken in the pages till the end.I also enjoy stephen king novel's and such other mind horror reads,but this by far has captured me in its little bottle ,a must read indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scents and insensibilites","review":"Weaving a tale using smell and fragrance, we are drawn into a world where appearances deceive and the only truth is in the scent of our soul.

I have never read a book before that celibrates the sense of smell like this book.

The way he used smell as the dominant sense is a breath of fresh air literally. Mesmerizing and ingenious story telling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos","review":"Let's not forget to note the accomplishment of the translator, John E.

He chose the best possible words to describe what the author wanted us to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful thriller that explores the richness of the sense of smell","review":"Patrick Suskind's, \\"Perfume,\\" is a beautifully written novel that richly brings to life the world of 19th century France primarily through the scents and aromas that permeated the cities, people and countryside of that time. At its core, \\"Perfume,\\" is a riveting character study that introduces as its main-character a villain every bit as imaginative and fleshed out in his sense of malice and purpose as Hannibal Lecter. The true beauty in this novel, however, is found in Suskind's detailed musings on his protagonist's extraordinary sense of smell and the way he interprets the world through such a gift.While \\"Perfume,\\" is an English translation of a German novel - the translation work is superb and fully conveys the depth of detail and colour that Suskind originally brought to life in his native tongue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Suskind!","review":"I will forever be in debt to the college professor who put this text on the reading list. A book that makes you think is one truly worth reading.

His obsession with scent brings the reader to a more heightened awareness of smells in their own world. A murderer who is olfactory obsessed is such a unique twist on western writing that it should be required for all those who study literature. Some have compared it to Goethe's Faust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reeks with talent","review":"Immerse yourself in the 18th century perfumery of this writer who really knows his subject.

Engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific","review":"Are you a fan of mystery? Perfume, by Patrick Suskind, is the book for you. The novel is an exposition of the search for identity, individuality, and self in relation to the world. Born onto a pile of fish guts from his ruthless mother, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille grew up to become a villainous murderer. His lack of scent had made him the outcast of the society but his strong will let him survive through hardship; from changing different wet nurses or having to eat one meal a day to catching a deadly disease that paralyzed him and left him with scars. One day, he was heading home, \\"the wind brought him something, a tiny, hardly noticeable something, a crumb, an atom of scent; no, even less than that...\\" it was a scent of a young virgin, which stuck in his heart...

I received it for Christmas 2002, and have used it a LOT. If you leave the batteries in, they seem to drain for some reason. The music quality is very good, and it's not too hard to use. I wasn't aware that you could play WMA files. I like sticking with good old mp3s.Like other people, I have been very unhappy with Musicmatch. The old software works fine. You can add or remove music and see what is in the player. Now you can add music, but you can only remove music or see what is loaded by clicking on the drive icon in windows. It's VERY irritating, and Musicmatch does not seem interested in resolving the problem. With Real and Itunes supporting various players, I will try another brand in the future. Right now my eye is on the Dell jukebox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span","review":"I got one for Christmas '02 and I bought one for my son for his birthday in January '03.

I was trying to download a song into the memory and the next thing I know it won't even register any songs. I got the Lyra for Christmas and broke in March; it took RCA customer service over a month and a half to respond to my complaint and after 2 months of waiting all I'm getting out of it is $$$ and stress.There are many other MP3 players on the market that are of much better quality and usage then the Lyra or any other RCA product.I highly suggest the iRiver DataPlay or something by SonicBlue.So unless you are in the mood for migranes don't even bother to listen to the RCA Lyra."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it totally dissatisfied","review":"I had the newer \\"Lyra\\" version of this product, but they're essentially the same.

The Lyra itself is okay... lightweight, decent sound... but the MusicMatch software is an abomination. The latest MusicMatch incarnation does NOT support the Lyra for downloaded music. The company claims to have a plug-in to allow users to play downloaded music on the Lyra, but the plug-in does not install. Without the plug-in, you can still copy the files you ripped from CD, but no new music.

Before buying rd1070 i bought the 64MB model from RCA Lyra because it had a rebate for it, that actually sounded really good and its alot smaller then the rd1070. I returned the product after questioning if 64MB + 128MB card i was going to buy was going to be enough music for me. I got this a week later because I did some searching and found the 1070. Its alot bigger in terms of size then the 64MB version and sounds alot worse. Sound transfer was the same as the 64MB version and I used the same songs, even the same headphones and the 1070 sounded horrendous. I tried redoing the proccess to see if it was just a bad transfer and was amazed that it wasnt the issue. Keep in mind I am no audio nut and cant tell the difference betweens highs and mids, and if I notice the problem you should notice it too.

It is not that, given that one must convert the files (with the cumpulsory, cumbersome, and generally annoying MusicMatch software) into .MPY files, the only format the unit will play. I could live with that if I could get over 30% of my MP3's to be recognized as writable.I'm returning mine tomorrow for an MP3 player that plays MP3's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time like I did","review":"Just spent 2+ hours with the RCA software. I can't believe how terrible the software is. Besides the poor ease of use everytime we tried to download songs, their software distorted the file like it had major skipping. If this were 1990 or so maybe I would have more patience here, but come on, something this bad shouldn't have made it to the shelf. I'm returning my daughter's player tomorrow.

Some people may choose to wash afterwards with a regular cleanser because it does leave a slightly greasy film but I like to sleep in it and let it really sink in. I probably will start cleansing after when summer comes around, but this is an excellent heavy moisturizer and it exfoliates beautifully and gently.

It can be very exfoliating, and lives some sort of oily film on my face while using it - but this seems just temporary, and my face feels very comfy afterwards (which isn't usually the case).

When I am introduced to a new author, I usually read a book they have written with a common story line to see what they do to make it different, fun, sexy and above all interesting. I felt for the heroine in the beginning, there was a great loss and a strong need to have justice, but after meeting the hero and learning about his past, in like chapter 2, I knew who was behind all of it, the years of torment, and the present masacre that brought the hero and heroine together, but the sex was great, when there was some.

The highlight for me was the inclusion of the Vocal version of the song 'Forsaken'. All I can is stutter, wow! The first short song of the EP is also great with a build up that any listener will expect something big to happen. And it does.

This harness will NOT fit and even if you somehow made it fit, it wouldn't work because the amp will not turn on. The third option is the widely known JBL upgrade.So if you are considering replacing the factory stereo in your Tundra make sure what you have first. If you have tweeters in your front doors, but no \\"JBL\\" identification on the stereo, then you have the factory amplifier option and this will not fit.You can buy an adapter (Tato for the JBL system) that will work on the non-JBL amplified system.

In this story, three innocent men are captured and accused of the death of a rancher. Although Henry Fonda, a drifter, tries to change the mind of the mob, everyone wants \\"justice\\". The lives of three men hang in the balance. Fonda, as usual, is excellent in his role of the man trying to convince the others, similar in a way to his role in 12 Angry Men. Dana Andrews, as one of the accused men, gives a heartfelt, unusually emotional performance. The movie is short (75 minutes), which means the action moves at a good pace, and the black and white photography adds to the starkness of the whole situation. This is a western that takes a sharp look at how mobs function, and it presents a lot of unfortunate truths."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best westerns I have ever seen","review":"I thought that this film was wonderful. The cinematography was phenomenal and very effective. Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn give impressive performances, while Henry Fonda proves (once again) why he is one of the greatest actors ever. The film makes a grave statement about the mentality and morality of an angry mob. The results of this anger, is disasterous and truly sad. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This western will get you thinking about justice","review":"As many have noted, the Ox-Bow incident is not your typical Western. It does not contain a lot of action, the scenery is pretty limited, and the cast is not that great, but it really will get you thinking about justice. Many other reviewers have described the plot, so I will not detail it here. Needless to say, the scenes that are most riveting are the ones where the men are trying to decide what to do with the supposed guilty men. The theme of this film is as relevant today, as it was when it was released. We so easily jump to our own conclusions that we sometimes get things wrong. In this case, the mistake is fatal.If you are looking for a pretty short film, based on a classic novel, that will get you thinking, then Ox-Bow incident is a good choice. I enjoyed and think you might as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ox-Bow","review":"Very good movie, with a good moral message. Henry Fonda is a great actor and shows nothing less in this movie.

This is one of a kind!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and predictable","review":"This movie starts with the married couple Jack Lemmon and Judy Holiday divorcing each other. The ending is very predictable. That would be okay, except the journey to the end is not much fun. Judy Holiday is just not an appealing actress. Kim Novak is not in the movie very much, and she comes across as a young bimbo. (She had much more depth in her role in Vertigo.) This movie is suppose to be a romantic comedy. There are flashbacks showing the couples courtship and these might be a little appealing with a different actress. Then there are scenes of Jack and Judy trying to learn to become swinging singles. Jack Lemmon's womanizing friend was very unappealing. It turned my stomach listening to his little speech on various ways to try to get a woman in bed. There isn't any humor, and the script is just boring. Call me bored. However, the picture was crystal clear.

It is not one of those deeply detailed scholarly works that drags on and on with details that you are not particularly interested in. Mr. Groom quickly lays out the facts of the matter. What he does best is make the historical figures in his book come alive for the reader. Andrew Jackson, no matter what his faults, truly loved the United States and was more than willing, almost eager, to risk his life for his country. And, at the battle of New Orleans, with the future of the United States at risk, a pirate/privateer named Jean Laffite took the side of Andy Jackson. The battle they fought together, alongside the people of New Orleans, is amazing.This briskly written book will tell you about some fantastic and tragically brave people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Very interesting and fantastic reading.

Near the end it trails off, but the first few sections are amazing. The last chapter is \\"Hamlet: The Graveyard\\" so it ends well. There's Monty Python, George Orwell, Samual Clemons, Robert Luis Stephanson, John Keats, and Freud. Also about a hundred others.

This book describes a variety of ambient vision issues that are unique to children on the autistic spectrum. The good news is that with proper diagnosis, these issues can be effectively treated and often resolved! The handwriting therapist gave my son a basic ambient vision test (which he failed), so he was then referred to a Behavioral/Developmental Optometrist (which is more specialized than a Family Optometrist). My son, with 20/20 focal vision, was diagnosed with convergence/divergence and tracking deficiencies. Vision therapy has made an amazing difference with his fine and gross-motor skills, handwriting, reading, and visual-motor skills which has affected his development in profound ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!!!","review":"I read this book and then jumped on a plane to see Dr. Kaplan.

This is the information that everyone who rides, regardless of discipline, needs to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"This book will work for riders at any level. The author presents essential, practical information in clear, understandable language. Some of this material is found in other books, but written in vague terms, or reserved for the advanced rider. The author compiles many ideas in one place, and gives the information concisely to the reader at all levels, so that incorrect habits can be corrected or prevented. The ideas are presented with case studies, visuals, and hands-on learning tools, not just as abstract theories. The book will be invaluable to the riding instructor as well, as it offers alternative ways to explain basic concepts to students with different learning styles. Whether you wish to add to an extensive library, or on a budget that restricts you to only a few books, this is one to have in your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for western riders","review":"I bought this book online based on customer reviews.

I came to him through Martin Amis's recommendation, thinking that any prose good enough for Martin would be good enough for me. I wasn't disappointed. 'Riding the Rap' is unashamedly light reading, what another reviewer rightly called a 'guilty pleasure', but on its own terms it is a really first-rate piece of craftsmanship. The characters are interesting -- they're all a little skewed; the dialogue outstanding; and there's a rich vein of humour, much of it quite broad, running through the book.

I'm afraid that I can't honestly continue the string of rave reviews. Every character in the novel was flat and few were likable.

Leonard has probably written some great books but it'll be a while before I go back to the bookstore to try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well paced and highly entertaining.","review":"This was my first Elmore novel, and it's made me eager to check out the rest. I'm a big fan of super-tough cops, and Raylon is right up there. Throw in a cast that's a little bit too ecclectic for the reader to take seriously, and you've got a book that you can't put down. My only problem was that we didn't really get to know anyone, they were all dynamic people, but I didn't think that most of them were three dimensional. And we didn't get enough of a look inside Raylon's mind. But the book goes so fast, any plot holes or gaffes are just brushed aside because the story is just that good. It's the most entertaining kidnapping and rescue you'll ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmore Leonard is the best, but better wth new characters.","review":"I love Elmore Leonard novels.

This story of little creatures who can't let themselves fall asleep out of fear of missing something will sound familiar to anyone who's tried to put a reluctant child to sleep.

I just started reading it again lately 4 years later with experience under my belt, it's awful now.I don't know why they call it practical, because I haven't learned much from this book that I have ever had to use in practice or in a conversation. It really covers a lot of old school communication details that the average controls engineer doesn't have to get into much anymore. Then the sections on HMI's and PLC's are written for liberal arts majors, meaning there isn't even close to enough detail to help the average controls engineer... or anybody for that matter.This book won't even give you a good overview of SCADA if you are an interested layman. Where there is detail, it is in topics that won't help you learn SCADA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"I liked the book. Very informative, especially if you are familiar with some aspects of control systems, but not necessarily SCADA systems. Some of the stuff was a little geared for engineer types, but most of it was geared for the technical types. I would have liked to have seen more on the PLC's and RTU's, but they at least reviewed them pretty well. A LOT of information on communication and network systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"scada and in it plc","review":"it is better than i expected - i thought at first you send inferior products but all is fun to snuggle in and have a great time - i love studying and reading science and engineering - oh computer and programming books"},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete","review":"After procuring a copy of this book, I discovered that it does not even reproduce Kuyper's lectures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book report","review":"Bought this book for a book report my granddaughter had to read.

The content is great and I love that it is clean enough that a young person can read it without worrying about bad language or innapropriate content. My one issue is the old fashioned writing when the characters speak. It is written how the people would speak(accents and limited vocabulary)...I'm sorry I can't explain it any other way.

Given that the author and the author's husband both have ministerial backgrounds, I found it interesting that one of the book's sub-plots included the first hired community pastor (\\"the highly trained Rev. Watson\\") being a mismatch for the congregation. The church committee members met with Watson and released him, excused him from the pulpit (chapter 38). This is a true-to-life incident that does happen from time to time. Of the three Oke books I have read, this is probably the more mundane. However, I do plan to see if I can locate the movie, and compare with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janette Oke's books","review":"Heartwarming stories about life among the plain people, full of good quality reading about family values."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adult Little House Continues","review":"I read 3 books by Janette Oke over the last 2 weeks. They are really easy, escape literature. If you liked Little House On the Prairie when you were growing up these are the adult versions. I discovered them via the movies. I really like to read the book before I see the movie and when I saw an advertisement about these movies I felt I should read the books. I have enjoyed them quite a bit. The chapters are short so I can get one in on breaks between my work around the house.Love's Enduring Promise is about Marty and Clem's family and how they are growing up. Not quite as exciting as book one but still a very good read.These are Christian Literature. One of the things I enjoyed the most about them is that they really seem to reflect how hard life was then. The work was endless and the tools were hard to come by. These people really did have to do for themselves and make do the best they could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"All who hope to create Quake 4 after reading this book will be disappointed: The game engine described, Jamagic, is rather old and not very powerful. It can be used only for very simple games and simulations. Additionally, the book delivers only a very cursory description of Jamagic. It can be recommended for someone who just starts working with Jamagic for whatever reason, and has no clue how to begin. Not recommended for people who are serious about creating games - there are better tools than Jamagic and better books than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"We were excited to find this pasta servers set since we have a big Italian Countryside set.

The non-stick feature really works! I had dropped some of the glaze on the perimeter of the pan and it baked on and turned black. It cleaned away with ease; in fact, washing the pan was a breeze. The pan set itself is somewhat heavy and feels very durable. I wish I had bought this sooner as my husband loves meat loaf but I haven't made it often due to the fat sitting in the pan. That problem has now been eliminated! I would not hesitate in purchasing this pan. This has been a pleasant experience. I am sure I will be using this pan for years to come. Happy Cooking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY","review":"A FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PAN SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT. I LOVE IT! IT IS BIG ENOUGH FOR A 2 LB.

I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT SOONER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Simply Amazing!","review":"I had one of those cheaper meatloaf pans from one of the catalogs. It worked until it rusted! So I knew the concept worked and that the meatloaf was wonderful, that I could feel good about serving it to my family and know that the fat was reduced. Well I tossed the rusty pan went online and started my search, I found this pan and it was at a department store, or so I thought! When I went there they didn't sell this pan in store but I was able to see the quality of the brand. So I went home and ordered it that day. Well the day it got here I made a meatloaf. What a difference! This pan drained more of the fat, the meatload didn't stick to the pan at all. If you are looking for a meatloaf pan, this is a good and solid pan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan is peeling","review":"Used this pan for a year and it was great.

It definitely delivers. Our meat loaves are now evenly browned, with excess drippings caught by the outer pan rather than soaking back in to the loaf. The added air circulation results in an even browning and a loaf that sticks together better. Leftovers are better in sandwiches than mushy loaves made in traditional pans. The pans are easily cleaned. All in all a great investment for our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video very poor","review":"Although this performance was many years ago and new production standards were not expected, this DVD was almost too poorly produced to watch on my HD system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her 1977 performance","review":"I'm a huge Ree-head.

Blah New Age mumbo-jumbo is bad enough, but combining it with GOLF is so suburban, it hurts.I gave this book two stars, though, because sadly enough, I could picture MT/CEO-types reading it and actually improving their golf games."},{"rating":"2","title":"I suppose you have to listen to it more than once","review":"Well, I guess it's time to admit that Switchblade Symphony may never be returning to the style that we came to love so much on \\"Serpentine Gallery\\". But, hell, that's the music industry for you...a band's sound can and is often encouraged to do a full rotation from CD to CD. At first, I didn't find this CD to be particularly impressive...it just didn't really 'catch' me or anything. But I gave it a chance before writing it off, because I still entrust some faith in these girls. Honestly, I'm glad I did. Tina really has the ability to tap into emotion. I think she utilized that skill very well on \\"Fear\\" and \\"Invitation\\". Her voice is most interesting; the way it swings back and forth from haunting and evocative to high-pitched and almost innocuous. Susan displays great skill, too, with the mixing and all. She's a very talented musician, as well. In all, I recommend this CD. It isn't mind-blowing, but it's certainly a nice way to spend forty minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming you almost to death","review":"Switchblade Symphony have to be one of the most enchanting bands that ever were. Tina's vocals are so gratifyingly childlike and gloom that her voice alone penetrates a listener. Very dub layered and thick bass beats and sounds envelope simple and atmosphereic melodies. Just dark enough to please the goth and fun and groovy enough to please a down-tempo electronica fan, SS have alot to give.The production work and overall sound quality could be much better and I hope this album gets remastered someday but for now its not so bad, just adjust your EQ a bit if you feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This cd is ok... but it is extremely weak. There are few good songs. I've noticed that they have grown more immature than better in their musical scope. This cd is a give or take, but I'd rather go sell it for some extra cash than keep it in a dusty pile of cd's I dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter garbage","review":"When a friend of mine told me I should listen to this group, telling me that, according to my tastes, I would love them, I decided I would take a listen. I have never felt so insulted in all my life. This was to me, Vengaboys gone goth! It sounds as ridiculous as that! The lyrics seem to have been written by a 10 year old, living a life of luxury and trying to pretend that her life is horrible. Completely unimaginative in all aspects. Pretentious and confused. I could try and listen to this album fifty times, standing on my head, under covers, with the vacuum on and it would still sound as bad. There is NOTHING to discover in this music, as there is nothing original about it. This critic does not only apply to this particular album but to the whole output from this group. This is teeny-bop goth music at it's worst. I can only feel ashamed for the poor artists daring to put music like this out on the market! You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"EEeeew!","review":"This CD sucks! Switchblade Symphony should've never gotten a sampler!!! The only hope is that like Xymox, Switchblades will pass this commercial \\"techno-pop\\" phase, fitted for a major lable, and return to their original goth sound, angry and creepy! As for the people saying that it doesn't matter what genre they are playing, well, they are still kind of signed to Cleopatra... When they are on COLUMBIA or David Geffen, or at least Nothing the charges will be dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened to this band???","review":"SS have a rather massive fanbase, that's why their efforts can't fail--people will buy their stuff even if they'll start playing something really weird. Well at least for a while. That's why I bought this CD. People said it so many times before me--Serpentine Gallery rocked my world, Bread and Jam was mediocre but still kind of hot on the heels of the great debute CD, Three Calamities is just annoying. My friend who likes old SS, borrowed it from me and returned it the next day after listening to the first 3 songs saying that it's too boring to endure...If you are into real gothic music, there's much better stuff out there, don't waste your time and money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More mainstream","review":"This is a beautiful album, but its sound is a lot more mainstream than Switchblade Symphony's previous two albums. I expect that for that reason it will appeal to a wider audience, but I do miss the darkness of Serpentine Gallery and the creepiness of Bread and Jam for Frances.As a note to new fans, Switchblade Symphony was an awesome band from San Francisco. They broke up in late 1999 and that was a sad time for their many fans. They were great live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This CD is pretty good if you're just getting into the whole Switchblade Symphony scene. Most of the songs are pretty good, although I usually don't listen to \\"Copycat.\\" Personally, I think the best songs are \\"Naked Birthday\\" and \\"Fear.\\" It's different from both of their previous works, Serpentine Gallery and Bread and Jam for Frances. It took me a little getting used to at the beginning, but now it's one of my favorite CDs to listen to. Overall, I think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality Bible!","review":"I am sorry to have to say anything negative about this Bible. First off let me say, the Tan Calfskin (and black one as well) cover is gorgeous.The problem is, everything else is poor quality. I had to return mine for a defective page inside of it. As it turns out, I understand that perhaps the whole run of new releases of this bible are defective. They have two-tone red and black calfskin covers, and the black calfskin as well. The pages on the inside are printed on the same paper as the $20.00 Bible! Also, the red lettering is badly mis-type set, almost double spaced. Some verses have no spacing at all, and overlap the preceding verses.There are also many blotches on the pages. (And I saw the same thing in DOZENS of these Bibles!)So, beware of this new release.

Real, raw hip hop that Erick Sermon produced, but Keith runs the show with some hot rhymes, flows, and beats/music to match with his voice. He can be crazy and funny at times, but it's his style that nobody touched. Many of the songs are funky. I actually like the original version of the title song instead of the version made for radio that interpolates the Isley Brothers' Between the Sheets. The original version is RAW, all beats and scratches, very hip-hop and allows Keith to rap freestyle over the beats! I hope that Keith gets past some minor setbacks to make another hot album because his rap style is definitely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Murray hits you with The Bom Bom Zee.","review":"Firstly, I have to admit I'm biased in my rating. This album really deserves 4 stars, but it has heavy sentimental value with me, so it gets a rare 5 stars.I have listened to this album over a hundred times and it never gets old. Erick Sermon (who produced the entire album, except track # 15, Escapism which was brilliantly produced by Redman)brought KM off the streets and turned him into a legend of his time. There is just something about the way E-double and Keith Murray (also Redman) collaborate on a track, something you very rarely see anymore.This is one of my favorite albums. It's also Keith's best work (unfortunately, he goes downhill from here).Bottom Line: Any fan of Keith Murray, Redman, Erick Sermon, EPMD and/or Def Squad, really needs to buy this album. 5 stars.

She tells the servent first arrive she 'you'll find out soon enough this place isn't always a happy home.'I also found that in the book it quotes Anne Robinson to saying 'that looks like a twitch' at Nicoles attempt to imitate Anne,but actually Nicole makes that comment about herself.The aurthors showed no compassion to writing this book and there only driving force seemed to be the money.I found this book mostly disatifying and was saddened because Nicole Kidman is my favourite actress,this book doesn't do her justice.so enless you are a complete fan don't even bother reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing recital","review":"This is Horowitz at his best.

So really theres not a comparison to Slayer at all if you ask me. LS formed when Thrash was going strong. There songs are awesome and wholesome. If your into Thrash/Speed Metal then this album has it all breakdowns, pounding drums, the twin guitar attack, and the talking vocals lol. This album is definately good.

Not the best plot ever but who cares right that's how all teen action films are these days, 'xXx' with Vin Diesel . In fact I want to say that Jason Statham is the British Vin Diesel across sea's. Although he may not be as built, his physique is definetly the same and he is for surely much quicker. Also just like Vin Diesel in xXx and/or The Fast and The Furious he is very smooth with cars and women.To get to the point if you like action and don't care if the movie doesn't completely make sense get this.

So the weak story and cheesey lines coupled with great fights and car chases are the reasons I really enjoy this one! When I'm in the mood to see a car chase and some hand to hand combat this has always been an enjoyable ride.A great transfer to HD. I liked this movie a lot when it came out - which should make my disdain for the others in the series more palpable. The action is crisp and clean, fewer blurs than the standard definition. The care chases are that much more exciting. If you've seen this and are a repeat watcher of the movie then this is a purchase you won't regret.A notable improvement from the standard definition version you've likely seen.

One sight of this and the global audience is yelling \\"it's a bomb!\\" But the coolest of the cool, one step ahead of everybody Transporter does not smell a rat. He obviously had not seen the old silver case ploy in 'Ronin'. But he shouldn't have to. \\"This film is fun\\" one of the film makers tells us in the special features. Yes, I love seeing two policemen murdered by the indirect actions of the dirtbag hero while carrying out their lawful duties. And the police chief just let's him off the hook?

The 15 minute car chase at the beginning was satisfactory, but still the best part of the movie. The rest of the material is predictable and childishly unrealistic.

It is truly a lot of fun. It provides one hell of an adrenaline rush. The star of the film, Jason Stratham, is sure to appear in more films to come after whooping some serious ass in this European fight fest. Watch out Vin Diesel; this dude is one tough ... Shu Chi, Taiwanese hottie and porn star, make this sweet eye candy on all levels. The cars are hot, the fights are sick, and the music (Stanley Clark) keeps you one the edge of your seat from the very first scene. If you like Luc Besson (he's the screenwriter) stuff, I highly recommend you check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Went to see this movie, and after the first 10 minutes, I was psyched. The opening scene gets you pumped and on the edge of your seat for a great car-action thriller. The music gets you into it, the noise, the driving stunts, etc...then....then...it flops into a boring, re-used plot, poorly set-up replay of any action movie involving a guy, a girl, kidnapping, rescue, and organized crime.This movie could've done better in many aspects. There was not a lot of action IMO beyond the first scene. A movie with several of those scenes would be worth watching even if the plot stunk, which this one did. The \\"love story\\" in this movie was horrible. It basically went from two people hating each other, to being civil, to suddenly falling in love. No transition what so-ever. The plot is just recycled, and the acting is flat at best. Sorry folks, but this just wasn't what I had expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Operator/ Sublime Panache !!!","review":"Amidst the world of Super Heros, Tough Guys, and Martial Artists comes a refreshingly different bad guy/ good guy character that is reminiscent of Paul Newman playing Cool Hand Luke. Just when I thought I was getting tired of action movies due to the predictable flow, and tired rehashed plotlines, I stumbled upon a webpage suggesting this movie as a contender for action flick of 2003. Since I had never even heard of the movie I was intrigued and when I saw it ( 3 times so far ) I was most pleasantly surprised and even mesmerized by a movie so subtle, and yet in your face from start to finish. My favorite scene is the improvised ballet performance on the metal bike pedal cleats in the oil slick battle. How someone could not feel the cinematic genius in this endeavor is beyond me. The Transporter is a \\" Diamond in the Rough \\" and the sleeper hit of 2003. Looking forward to \\"T2\\" if they decide to make one.

That, and a lot of cars and explosions. Not much to say.

I wish I had turned it off after the first pathetic 5 minutes.Below \\"B\\" grade acting, pathetic story line, and a sound track cut straight from an early 80s porn movie.The stunts and action was so choreographed that every punch or kick was filmed separately and then put together to try and form some sort of fight scene. It was more a comedy than an action movie as I was laughing at how bad it was.

The plot of the movie is good too so it's not action just for the sake of action.

So I decided to rent this. It's your typical PG-13 movie with lots of explosions. It's like some of the latter, bad Bond movies. Yet this movie even gets this special DVD. Why may I ask? It was lame, and the fight scenes were so unrealistic and over the top that they weren't even fun. On top of that, the fights weren't well made. And it's the action that should make or break a movie like this. And here, it clearly breaks it.Mediocre at best, don't \\"transport\\" this DVD home.And what a shame, co-written by the wonderful Luc Besson. This had me thinking: this guy's slipping. That's too bad.The acting is fair but more mediocre than good and the love story thrown in a la James Bond is random, pointless and stupid. I hate it when they do that for action movies.

The acting is okay, albeit nothing to shout from the rooftops. The plot is as thin as as a triscuit, and the score? Holy cheese whiz, the score.

That movie was at least good for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule #4 Don't open the DVD case....","review":"Transporter was recommended to me by a friend and I purchased it in a two-pack with Fight Club. My expectations were not high, but I was not prepared for the film that would unfold.As far as the action sequences and the cinematography go the film is fine, but as far as plot and dialogue go this is a major yawner.The opening car chase is great, but the film never really matches the thrills of its beginnings. I also think that Memento was an easier plot to follow.

I was engrossed thruout the flick, and rank it as almost as good as Jet Li, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Chuck Norris action classics. The \\"almost\\" is because the martial-arts sequences seemed somehow slightly sluggish, tho often commendably novel.The characters and plot (including some great car/van chases) were better than most of these classics, the dialog more real, and the French scenery a great plus. The bad guys were great scumbags, and got the upper hand often enough to keep the good/bad tension steadily absorbing. The intrepid female lead was an appealing and believable gamin for our stone-faced Hero to save repeatedly, and the (predictable) outcome of the drama was straightforward and satisfying.Kudos to all who brought us this addition to the Thriller / Action / Martial Arts genre - More more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action!!","review":"Loved the movie.

Jason looks like a real professional when he wears his black suits and drives his BMW 735. He's acting cool and I like it. However, things turn bad as soon as he opens the bag carrying ex-Taiwanese pornstar Shu Qi. I still don't have a clue why she is in the bag the first place. Isn't she the daughter of the evil ugly Chinese man? Her screaming is just too annoying and I must admit that her English is just as bad as me.The action is quite good except that it's over-done in some secens like in the bus."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for...","review":"I give 2 stars to this movie. One is for the acting I found not so bad and the second one is for the fight scenes I found quite creative. Now let me tell you that the story is bad with many and many impossibilities. It's dumb and you know it as soon as you watch the first 5 minutes in the movie. Jason Statham manages the whole thing not to look like an idiot and he succeeds. The French cop is a talented French actor and it helps too. This movie is the perfect example of the very bad script produced by good money. Thanks to Luc Besson.

This movie oozes with style.xXx deserves no comparison to this excellent action movie.Highly recommeneded to action fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action!","review":"I'm not usually a fan of many pure action films, so this one is particularly good.

I have since gone back to Penton and now use Rosetta Stone for more extensive learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Will Never Become Fluent Using This Product","review":"I think the 4 star reviews put a very positive spin on this product. The reason why it has no written script is because they don't want to highlight the fact that you will go through multiple 30 minute lessons to learn one full conversation. There is very little material here as things are constantly repeated. And it is not okay to pay this much money and be barely a beginner after all the time invested (90 lessons!). It's a great product - for $29.95. But it isn't for the serious french student who wants to, I don't know READ as well as speak french fluently. Get it from the library for free. I did thank God."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMD board died, can't get a replacement","review":"This was a great product when it worked. But my DMD board recently went out on it and the part is no longer available. SamsungParts.com said a \\"substitute\\" part was available for $[...], but it wouldn't make sense to put that much into old technology compared to what's out today for not much more.I'm posting this for those who may be looking at buying one of these used from someone. If you can get a great deal fine, but keep in mind that you may not be able to get parts for it. You can still get lamps, but some other parts are no longer available. Also keep in mind that the tuners built in are standard definition, not HD. You need an external HD source to get HD on this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Going Strong","review":"Ok as of 04/20/2011 I have had no problems with my TV.

With the 10% off coupon plus $200 sale the price went down to about $3450 (no tax in Delaware). Not bad at all! With much lower price than most plasma TV with similar size I can still buy accessories like monster DVI cable, HD DVD player and voltage stabilizer. Also fits in my van!The TV is being hooked to Comcast HDTV and to Samsung HDTV DVD player. The picture is awesome and excellent. White color really looks 99.99% white, thing that I believe cannot be reproduced by regular projection TV. Besides, this TV is much lighter than even my 32\\" Sony WEGA TV.So far so good. I don't have any complaint. I am even thinking to buy the larger one (61\\") to put in my bedroom. Oh btw, don't buy those accessories like monster cables, etc, in Best Buy, Circuit City, etc., they are more expensive. If you can wait, order thru amazon!Overall, this is a good investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture right out of the box","review":"I got this from Best-Buy in January. It is about 2 months and the picture quality is great. HD channels look even better. Most of the SD is acceptable. One thing that annoys me about this TV is, it takes about 20-30 seconds to fireup. But I can wait that much to see the great picture. If you buy this from Best-Buy, make sure you enroll in their rewardszone program. you will get about $130 worth of gift certificates for your purchase price through rewardszone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's old technology now","review":"I bought this in Jan 05 and was pretty happy--blown away by the HD picture quality, superior DVD quality using the component inputs, but as others have stated, disappointed by the mediocre to poor standard broadcast quality. Now that I'm smarter, I see that: a) there is no ATSC (digital) tuner so I can't increase my limited selection of Comcast HD channels by receiving HD broadcasts over the air, b) no HDMI input capability, so I can't use one of the newer upscaling DVD players on the market. I would not buy this product today at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few great songs make this one worth keeping.","review":"Elis Regina could use her voice to swing, sting, serenade, or just rasp. Her genuis isn't so much in her vocal quality, but in the inimitable way she approached the music. The first song on this album expresses her genuis perfectly, the rest of the album ranges in quality, many of the last songs are sappy and uninteresting. But if you believe that an album can be bought for one great song the title song makes this one worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Overrated Album","review":"I'm stunned that this album comes so favorably reviewed. Everything that initially attracts you to Elis Regina is absent on it. The compositions are all unmemorable and emanate pretentiousness (though, of course, I don't understand Portuguese), while the 70's jazz-rock band is noisy and dated in a way more embarrassing than quaint. Regina's voice is lost here. To put it plainly, there is nothing catchy, swinging or pretty on this album. I above all recommend above all \\"Aquarela do Brasil\\" and \\"Elis and Tom\\", then, after that, \\"The Art of Elis Regina.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I am confused","review":"I need someone to confirm to me that this order was cancelled.when I made this order I was told that the order is cancelled and my money credited back to my account.

I had them in time for the weekend, and that convinced me that I will definitely order from them again. I have the Gray, and I want at least three more colors. to match suits that I have. I had owned a pair several years ago, and loved them, but had been unable to find them in stores locally. They are sleek, slick, and add some serious flavor to the right suit or jeans.

The shoes are comfortable but I did have to return the first set to get a half size larger. The vendor paid for return shipping, so it was only a minor inconvenience but that's why they get four stars instead of five.

It includes also the great love songs like 'Tomorrow Today', 'Happiness Is Me And You' and the heart-achingly wistful song 'At The Very Mention Of Your Name' from the wonderfully crafted album 'In the Key of G.', and the latest hit song 'Taking a Chance on Love' which was used as a theme song for Japanese TV adverb. If you come to love these songs, you will surly buy his all albums and will be on an amazing journey of discoveries."},{"rating":"1","title":"few mistakes in 7th Ed., but no better for it ...","review":"I haven't noticed the mistakes the other reviewers have mentioned; perhaps they reviewed an earlier edition, or I haven't gotten far enough (through ch. 8). Anyway, the book is awful purely on account of the author's inability to make the concepts clear, and to use terminology precisely -- perhaps this fog is masking the errors. Fwiw, others in my class agree. Also, the index is uselessly short, so if you don't remember the meaning of some term defined in the text, you'll have to hunt for the imprecise definition page by page. In sum: unclear and difficult to use. Seek another alternative if at all possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a difficult book from which to teach yourself","review":"I'm a second year computer science student taking a course on probability, and this is the book we are using. Why, I don't know, because it's not a very good book. I'm not a note-taker, and have a difficult time paying attention in math classes, so I usually teach myself from the book. With a 3.6 GPA, I'd say it usually works. Not so with this book.This book lacks sufficient examples and the definitions and explanations of theorems are confusing. To its credit, it has odd answers in the back, but that's standard for math books. However, it lacks any answers to the review exercises at the end of each chapter, making the review exercises nearly worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"Don't buy this book if the class doesn't require it.

For those that do not know to run HDMI over CAT5 it requires 2 cable runs of CAT5 and a minimum of 1 of them has to be STP (shield twisted pair). Our runs go over 50 feet so it was perfect for us I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful Presentation of the Case for Reformed Worship","review":"Before I read this book, I had a limited knowledge of Reformed theology. For me, the book was valuable for two reasons. First, it was a succinct and persuasive presentation of some of the key tenants of Reformed theology. Secondly, it was an excellent critique of the present-day way we do \\"church.\\" While I didn't agree with every critique and alternative that was presented, each point was thoughtful and worthy of consideration. Any Christian that has participated in \\"church\\" has a sense that how do it is not quite right. This book gives an explanation of why that is and how we can change it. It is a welcome change to the program oriented, formulaic, and trendy methods used to popularize church.

Definitely next to the bible, Joyce's Me and My Big Mouth is the best book out there on out thought life and how what we say affect's how we live and function for our betterment or detriment. An execellent and easy read! I also recommend \\"The Great Exchange\\" Your thoughts for God's thoughts By Pastor Robb Thompson . This book is a great compliment to Joyce's because it addresses the source and blame for some of our most disturbing and misguided thoughts. I also recommend Joyce's \\"Reduce me to Love\\" book.

It helped me so much and gave me a lot to think about. I love Joyce's writing style. But what I appreciate most about Joyce Meyer is her grasp of Scripture, her transparency about her own struggles and her forthrightness. You can always count on Joyce to tell it like it is. This book humbled and convicted me over and over again. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with learning to control the tongue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true blessing and on time!","review":"This is a life changing book. It is not possible to read this book and be the same afterwards. It is taking me so long to finish the book because it is so deep and Joyce Meyers definitely has an divine annointing on her ministry. It was as if she was speaking to me directly and that it was wriiten for me. I truly believe that everything happens in God's timing and with a purpose and me reading this book at this point in my life could not have happened at a more perfect time. If I would've read it any sooner I would not have been mature enough to accept and absorb the messages and scriptures. If I read it in a few more years it may have been too late. I find myself studying this book as if it were a text book and it is to me. It's depth is almost overwhelming sometimes.

I think it would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one voice","review":"Asha, in telling her story, gives an audible voice to all families of inmates who, out of fear of retaliation on their loved ones, are forced to remain silent. I, as the wife of an inmate, applaud Asha for her courage in speaking the truth - giving the public another perspective of the wide ranging impact that incarceration has on couples and families. Unfortunately, not all couples are able to endure the prison experience. It is designed to discourage, fragment, isolate and humiliate couples in every area of their relationship. My hope is that everyone who reads this memoir is aware that Asha speaks for many of us who can only quietly whisper our own stories of pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, asha!!","review":"I was so moved by this book. It was if I wrote it myself. It was so validating to know that there is someone else out there who really knows what I feel. I think what stuck with me most was the line about couples being able to be together and taking that for granted...they don't know what a treasure it is to be able to hold hands and walk together. Thank you, asha for telling your story. I hope that when people read the book, it will move them to appreciate their relationships and to cherish them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will make you reasses how well you love.","review":"The first lines of The Prisoner's Wife state that the story is a love story. Bandele's lyrical style made reading the book like reading an epic poem about pain, abuse, love and healing. The author's honesty and candor made her story one easy to relate to - even if you haven't ever endured long distance love or the prison system. The Prisoner's Wife is the most loving piece of lietrature that I have ver read. It made me appreciate the proximity and ease of my own relationships that I so often take for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and thought-provoking.","review":"This book really blew me away. bandele's gift for language is as apparent here as it is in her earlier book of poems; her language is rich, evocative and beautiful. But what's really remarkable about this book is bandele's story: how she fell in love with Rashid, what it is like to be married to a prisoner, the impossibly difficult task of creating love and trust behind prison walls. As the book says, this is a love story -- but it's a love story unlike any other I've ever read. bandele makes the old slogan, \\"the personal is political,\\" come alive: now that I've read this memoir, I can't stop thinking about people in prison, what their lives are like, how they are dehumanized. This is worth reading again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This book was really boring. I kept waiting for the story to begin, and it never really got off the ground.

It is a love story, but does not romanticize the seperation that the prison industrial complex creates. I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can adversity lead to peace?","review":"I did not like Prisoner's Wife and I did not dislike the book. While it had no redeeming message for me, I cannot say that Ms. Bandele's experience is invalid because it is not my experience.As I read, I kept a sad feeling because she appeared to be defined by so many negative life circumstances (ie, sex abuse, drug abuse, abortion, prison experiences, etc.) I guess she wanted to let the reader know her love for Mr. Rasheed was her empowerment, but, I could not tell if she found peace at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it...","review":"The Prisoner's Wife: A Memoir is the first book that I have ever read that I can honestly say I hated. This is certainly not a book I would have chosen to read on my own - it was a book club choice and I had to suffer through it. I knew that I would not be a fan of the book's content, but I tried to keep an open mind. I felt that the author was so busy trying to paint a picture with her words that she actually forgot to tell us her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of garbage by a lost soul","review":"This book is a total piece of garbage. Mrs. Bandele tries way too hard to write beautifully and lyrically and, in some places, she does succeed. But her success is at the price of her honesty. I mean, she never really gets real. She never deals up front with the fact that this man who loves her so has murdered another human being. She never deals up front with the fact that it's easy to have the perfect love when the man is sitting in a cell and has no other women walking down the street, calling on the phone and talking to him about their poetry and their past. So what if their trailer visit was interrupted by a roll call? The person who her husband killed isn't getting laid. This book reads like a bad Lifetime cable movie of the week. Hey, maybe in a year or two, it'll probably even be one. Then, I suppose, all the hardship and all the indignity will have paid off for Mrs. Bandele but everyone who reads this trash will be left bankrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Real!","review":"As a wife of a lifer, I can so relate to this woman's story. I felt everything this woman was feeling because I felt it before.It was really unbelievable how almost everything she said and experienced was like a mirror image of my relationship with my husband. This type of life is not for everyone and Asha looked at her life and made the decision in what she felt was best. There are so many of us that are still with our husbands and learn to live with this under these circumstances. There are those that have been married for 20 years within the prison system. I've met quite a few of those couples. Since my husband is a lifer we always remain hopeful but we both realize that there is a chance that he may never come home, therefore I made my peace with that and will not leave my husband. This is a great book. She has touched on many issues that effect us and what we go through as wives of prisoners. Kudos to Asha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"I think that the book, The Prisoner's Wife, opens up the heart of any reader. In this book not only did asha find true love with someone else, but she also found true love within herself. The style of asha bandele and her poetic voice kept me turning the page to get to the end. Once I reached the end of the book I wanted to know more. Their love story was true and real there was no fantasy about it at all. What I loved the most about the book was what Rashid did for her as far as her mind and her spirit. I will be recommending this book to anyone who asks. asha bandele moved and provoked in me something that I did not expect to get from a book about a girl who marries a guy in prison. I actually was disappointed in myself for being judgemental before I even opened the book. From the first line, \\"this is a love story...\\" to the last, \\"see you in a minute\\" I was captivated and felt like I was falling in love along with asha. Her story is phenomenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed up writer...","review":"This book was nothing as I expected. I went in thinking that this was going to be a love story between a professional woman who worked at the prison, and happen to fall in love with a prisoner who was doing time for a small crime. Instead, it's a story about a writer, who had a messed up childhood, teenage years, and who currently has a screwed up adultlife. It was a story, to me, about a woman who is not happy with herself, and who has settled for anything, meaning, settling for someone doing major time for murder, and someone whom she may never get the opportunity to spend a \\"real\\" life with, outside of the prison walls. This book really was a waste of money, and I wouldn't recommend it at all. I just couldn't relate to the confused life of this Asha Bandele. Maybe she writes better magazine articles for Essence, but this book just wasn't cutting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept; terrible book","review":"After reading some many reviews on this book, I decided to rush out and buy it. Big mistake!! While I do feel that the author has great intentions and a good story to tell, she spends way too much time repeating the same things and never really gets to the \\"meat\\" of the story. I struggled through 60 pages and said \\"enough already\\". My advice? Save your money and just read the book excerpt from the June issue of Essence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart woman, foolish choice","review":"Asha Bandele writes in a beautiful, lyrical style that I fell in love with, however, I found her story to be one of \\"poor me\\": Poor me, my man's locked up, poor me I can't finish getting my freak on because the guards are at the door, poor me, I got pregnant and I'm broke. She did not once take responsibility for her choices, and talks over and over again about the fall out from her lack of judgement without ever examining WHY she lacks judgement or HOW she can make better choices. I wanted to pop her upside the head! I read the book to get insight as to how and why a woman would marry a convicted criminal while he was still behind bars, but I came away none the wiser. She has a beautiful voice, but it would be better served a more worthy story than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingley Beautiful","review":"This author has a story that needs to be told especially in a country where the amount on governmental spending on education and incarceration are running neck in neck. It was fascinating to hear about the world of those who love people incarcerated and the things they encounter in and outside of the prison walls. Asha has some wonderful lines that you read over and over again because she is gifted in writing in metaphors of her love, lust and living experiences in general. It's fascinating how a prisoner has assisted her in freeing herself from her ugly past. It's a gem of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRUTH WAS FINALLY TOLD","review":"THIS BOOK HAS NOT ONLY TOUCHED MY HEART ALSO MY WORLD.

My latest test of a good game: Walk up to a fuel tanker truck, place a ton of explosives on the side and detonate. If the truck doesn't move and there is not a scratch on it when you're finished, then you have a crappy game on your hands.

They were as shocked as I was. This recording in no way represented that unique classic light inventive jazz style of Andre Previn. Even the producer of the album agrees. On the printed album notes, he says,\\"His (Previn's) funky sound is definitely of the era, but all his own...\\" That era was 1958. There are 6 recordings in this album. Bands 1 and 6 have a tempo so fast, the melody is quickly devoured. Bands 2,3,4, and 5 are so SLOOOOOOOW, there is never a melody to begin with.If you want to hear Andre Previn at his best without his short-lived \\"funky sound\\" of 1958, pick up a copy of his \\"Old Friends\\" album.

Boring and not particularly engaging. This music has none of the flare or genius of a Vaughn Williams. It crescendos for no reason and becomes pale for the same unintelligible reason.

It is so well written, and translated for that matter. (I believe it was originally in french?) It is so romantic and when it's done you'll be so enthralled with the characters and the time period you'll want to reread it. Granted, it isn't the most terribly intellectual novel or thought-provoking, but it is to books what a well-done chick flick is to movies. When I finished this I passed it on to my sister (who knows nothing about history, nor cares) and it is now her favorite book.

That being said, I think this work was important because in it Derrida admits with qualification to Rorty's charges that he (Derrida) is sentimental and believes in happiness. This may come as a shock to some Derrideans. Those who use Derrida's writings and reception to shake and destroy are missing the responsibility issue in the debate.

There is not one bit of filler on this album, which remains an incredible listen nearly 40 years later. This album, more than any other album I ever bought, had the biggest influence of my life. Prior to this album, I had never been into pure blues. But, this album changed that forever, as I now have a personal music library filled with dozens and dozens of great blues albums. Backed by some great musicians, including guitarists, Ry Cooder and Jesse Ed Davis, this album never lets up, from the opening song \\"Leaving Truck\\" to the closing number \\"The Celebrated Walkin' Blues\\". This album changed my musical horizons and remains one of my most treasured albums.

I was so tired of the heroine's long, flowing, incredibly red hair, mentioned over and over again, that I would have gladly pulled it out by the handful.

I found Thief of Words light, refreshing, fun, sexy and surprising. I could care less if this is not haute literature. It is fun, down-to-earth and a charmer to read.

The whole CD sounded like something you'd listen to in a doctor's office while waiting for your name to be called. The only song I remotely liked was \\"Can't Help Falling In Love.\\" His performance just seems phoned-in, that's all.

Here is the passion, the warm, the true sentiments of the songs he murdered. Hearing \\"When I Fall In Love\\" sang by him and comparing it to the Nat King Cole version it almost a joke, the same goes with \\"And I Love Her\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\". It's a disgrace to those timeless and classic songs he have committed in this album. I almost vomit hearing he singing all these songs all in the same way as the Love Boat song. The original artist if they could should suit him for doing such a dishonor to these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic by Manilow","review":"Barry is amazing.

I hate it with an Aries passion, it's so atrocious. That one alone cost this a star. These remakes do not touch the originals which I love with the exception of that atrocious Dean Martin song.

First Rod Stewart, now Barry Manilow has decided to mangle some classic tunes. They are has been singers who couldn't buy a hit, but for some reason if they warble a bunch of popular tunes, people buy their music in droves. Probably the same idiots that voted for Bush.

Why can't they just go away?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do something original","review":"Barry, please create music again. Clive Davis you do not need. This is so below you.

The baker's dozen of classic '60s easy-listening favorites puts the \\"pop\\" back into \\"popular\\"---Manilow's takes bring verve and vigor to the tunes that add to their appeal rather than remind us of what once was.

He did not disappoint and comes across with a smooth and relaxing album. It is most listenable and carries one back to a time of greater innocence and music that had words that were easy to comprehend. The songs are smooth and one can hum along to the songs.

If you are new to the Damned and want a broad spectrum of there music I would suggest \\"Light at the End of the Tunnel\\". If you want old school punk I would suggest \\"Machine Gun Etiquette\\".

I will have to do some research at the local library to see how the final story ends, seeing as the last page in this volume is missing, but the vendor offered me a 25% discount or full refund when I discovered this situation - which I think was very fair on their part.

This book is a must read. The follow-up to this book, Have You Thought of Leonard Peltier Lately? is just as important, as is discusses the production of Prison Writings, and picks up where PW left off in 1999. Either book provides enlightening information into the life and times of Leonard Peltier and the struggles Native people continue to face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memoir that speaks through the spirit","review":"Leonard Peltier will probably die in prison, which is a sad statement on prejudice & stubborn political views. How Peltier keeps his spirit alive & nourished in prison makes him the winner in the hopeless tale of his time incarcerated. The death of the two FBI agents is horrible, but does not justify imprisoning an innocent man as a scapegoat for a whole movement.

Why should we exhault a murderer. How is it that everyone forgets that two FBI agents lost their lives? How is it that we forget that FBI agents do what they do to protect each of us every day? How is it that people want to applaud a man that is a murderer? I am appauled at him and those that think he should be freed. Just because his people were persecuted many years ago, does not mean that he is an innocent man. Do we release every black man that has murdered someone from prison because his ancestors were slaves? Many years ago, the white man did terrible things to indians.

Peltier writes of the contexts which shaped his life, the impulses to activism through AIM, and the horrific miscarriage of justice perpetrated upon him. And aside from that, there is a beautiful and very moving description of an inipi, i.e. sweat lodge ceremony, which comprises the last several pages of the book, a section which I recommend for anyone who wishes to understand the logistics and the importance of this ritual. PRISON WRITINGS is a memoir, a treatise *and* a profoundly important accounting of the cultural connections which remain firmly in place for Leonard Peltier. I recommend this book vigorously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maceo, Maceo, Maceo","review":"I was initially introduced to Maceo's musical genius by seeing himperform with Prince. Ever since then, I have become obsessed with the man and his music. Made by Maceo is full of funk and throughout the album, he adds delicious seasonings of jazz. As I described to co-worker, this album is like ear candy. This is one of those albums that you can put in your car, and let every track play without wanting to skip any songs.

His onstage presence is like nothing you've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprise","review":"I bought this DVD last week after seeing the show in Toronto. At first I was a little disappointed as the DVD was not featuring the performers from Toronto. However I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Beijing performance. It does take a bit of adjusting as I was not familiar with K. Philips, however I found both lead performers have unique styles and great voices. The performers not only sang, but I believed they were trying to 'act' out the scene and poured in a lot of emotions. Contrary to another review I read on this site, K. Philips did not come across arrogant but rather intriguing and delivered superbly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it a lot at the beginning","review":"The first time I watched the DVD, it was truly amazing. I really enjoyed watching all the numbers. There were tracks that I hadn't seen anywhere else (eg. Masquarade from Phantom); The other ALW classics were all very captivating and stirring. I was going to watch it over and over again. A funny thing though - the more I watched, the less I liked it. Being recorded live, there were lots of things that went wrong... missed notes, croaking voices, those awful costumes, etc. These mistakes actually started to annoy me. I also have Les Miserables and the ALW concert in Britain - and those performances were flawless. My advice - if you're going to buy this DVD, sit back and simply enjoy the performance... it really is very well done if you want to be entertained. But if you're a critic and looking for perfection - you'll probably tire of the show after watching 2 or 3 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Webber in Beijing","review":"This is a wonderful mix of Webber's great music from a variety of his hits in London, New York, Toronto and around the world performed at the Great Hall in Beijing, China with an outstanding cast of singers.

Other than Kris Phillips and Elaine Paige, the singers were truly mediocre and many sounded completely amateur. Maybe they are really dancers. I hope so for their sake.I guess that's what they could get for a performance in Beijing. Hopefully, but sadly, they couldn't do any better.

This is just some concert they did in China and it's not even a show, just some nerds singing songs is what I call it. Without a doubt, Webber is a cool cool dude, but this was horrible! The special features show the cast going on a hiking trip on the great wall of China. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO WITH ANDREW LLOYD WEBBEER??? And it's so bad, they had to throw in a free CD that sucks just as much as the DVD. if you see an Andrew Lloyd Webber show, make sure it has costumes, sets and that kind of stuff. Sure, the Chinese were probably impressed and it is probably exciting on stage, but it's boring on DVD!

That agent, played by Edmond O'Brien, gains Jarrett's trust and becomes a member of his gang.Cagney's portrayal of Jarrett is something to see. He's a cold-blooded killer. But he also suffers from serious headaches, which his mother relieves by caring for him.Jarrett's wife, played by blonde beauty Virginia Mayo, becomes involved with a member of his gang while Jarrett is in prison. Jarrett's revenge is brutal and final, as it is with anyone who gets in his way.The climax of this film and Cagney's final line, \\"Top of the world, Ma,\\" are a well-known part of Hollywood history.\\"White Heat\\" has become a classic of the gangster-film genre.

It shows that crime doesn't pay and that gangters were usually wired differently than other people. Sometimes they were mental cases like Cody Garrett was in this movie. He was a criminal that could kill as easily as eating, no conscience, no regret. Very realistic with psycho killers in these days. He should have one an oscar for this film. It shows how law enforcement befriends criminals to catch them. It is a classic film in under-cover work. Years ahead of it's time. Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm, lacking excitement","review":"This movie barely held my interest. It is simply not an exciting story, and that is why I can't give it more than two stars. A gangster film has to be exciting, and if it fails in that, it fails as a movie.Much is made, in all of the reviews and summaries, of Cagney's gangster being insanely dependent on his mother. That is not true. If they wanted to portray that on screen they would've had to do a much better job of it. What I see is a man whose mother means a lot to him, but I don't see an insanity there. If all you have to do to show insanity is show a man caring about his mom, then this succeeds. But you need to show more than that. There is no insanity involved in the screen relationship between Cagney and his mom in this film. He likes his mom. So what.I'm not interested in fireworks in movies. I'm not impressed by exploding gas tanks. Another big \\"so what\\".

Well,that's how I found it. It was probably my greatest film discovery in history. White Heat has it all. Story, direction and oh the cast! By the end you'll cheer for Cagney and boo Mayo his wife. I have 3 or 4 copies of this and the script. So,I gush when I talk about it.Memorable scenes that even the great John Wayne praised. It's just the last of the great gangster movies.

I wasn't waiting for a \\"good\\" ending because that's not always what makes a movie, or even a fairy tale ending. But when the end hit I was actually mad, strangely enough. I never get irritated from movies? but to have however many hours sucked out of my life only to be suckered in by good cinematography was really irritating.a 5 year old with a camera and some glue could have made a better movie...

The real Oldboy is a Japanese manga that is soldby Dark Horse Comics. The real Oldboy is Shinichi Goto not Oh Dae Su.The two are only real similar in title only. The movie is simply usingthe Old Boy name. If you want a story that is cheap thrills, shock and awe,stupid plot twists, one dimensional characters and pseudo artistic stylethen this movie is for you. However if you want a great plot, excellenticonic characters, a classic noir style, and one of the greatest cat andmouse chases in literature then read the manga of the same name.Shinichi Goto pummels Oh Dae Su"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$$","review":"Don't waste your money seeing this grotesque movie. I'm not a prude and I enjoy watching stylized violence in an action flick, where the story calls for it. However, this movie goes way over the line with incest and a very twisted act of revenge.

So much meaning is caught up in small phrases and most of those come right before scene changes... this is a movie that can be watched a couple of times!! Two notes... #1 the violence and some other scenes are probably a little too much for preteens or younger; #2 - You really should watch the deleted scenes.. there are a few that make the whole plot fall together... not sure I would of deleted the one of the antagonist talking to himself in the mirror.... when I saw that - the whole movie made much more sense.Still... very minor flaws... definitely a should see (without the kiddos :))Oh yeah... one of the fight scenes will end up being a classic.. very well done!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Boy is a great movie!","review":"My Korean girlfriend had told me about this movie, so I ordered it.

The closest thing it reminds me of is Angel Dust, a Japanese thriller with a similarly well-crafted feel and a similarly gripping and disturbing story. The visual style, fight choreography, suspense, and irony, as well as the exploration of memory, willpower, and responsibility kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the film. Oldboy is reminiscent of The Usual Suspects in the way it encourages the viewer to work to figure out what's going on. Highly engaging. Recommended. Note: Very violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Boy is great..","review":"sadly, i was introduced to this movie by a chinese friend of mine and he was outrageous that i didnt watch it as a korean.. and he was right for a change..The main reason i loved this movie is because the style of the director (Chanook Park) encaptures the audience through well-disciplined camera work unlike any other korean directors were able to do.. The film seems to have a natural flow to the storyline aided by smooth transitions and fitting music.. The acting, headed by Minshik Choi as Oh Daesu, was terrific..I was surprised to hear that \\"Old Boy\\" did not get as much hype in korea even though i believe it's one of the finest korean films to date.. Hopefully the 3rd installment of the trilogy will follow in the steps of \\"old boy\\" and not \\"sympathy for mr. vengeance\\"..Oh yea, don't let children watch it because the movie will scar them for life.. just like watching the \\"Chucky\\" series did for me.. :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charles Bronson film on mega steroids","review":"Almost all adjectives apply to some part of this vengeance film. Brutal, unbelievable, repulsive, bloody, tender, overly dramatic, sick, humorous, disgusting, fascinating, sexual, entertaining, tasteless, repugnant et.al. I am not very familiar with Korean culture and movies. No doubt they influence the style of acting etc. The acting at times seemed very hammy - somewhat like the old mustache pulling villains in a silent movie but with sound and cursing. At other times it was moving. I hear Spike Lee will do a remake of this story for release in America in 2013 with Josh Brolin in the lead. I will have to see it out of irresistable curiousity if nothing else. I can imagine that many in America will not welcome such a film after the Newtown tragedy - particularly if the bloodletting is anywhere near what it was in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously great movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. I am really glad to see the tartan Asia extreme movies coming to blu-ray. Some are great and some are terrible, but this is the best one.

Also look for the boxed set called the vengeance trilogy which contains this, plus 2 other movies from the same director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie about vengeance!","review":"This film is fantastic. It's full of mystery and kept my interest right up until the credits. It's about a man named Oh Dae-su, who lives with his wife and daughter. He is kidnapped and later wakes up to find himself in a private makeshift prison. Dae-su wonders what made someone hate him so much enough to imprison him without any reason. While imprisoned, Dae-su hears on the TV news that his wife was murdered. Dae-su swears to take revenge on the person who destroyed his happy life. Fifteen years later, he is released with a wallet filled with money and a mobile phone. An unknown man calls Dae-su and asks him to figure out why he was imprisoned. The story then unfolds into an incredible and shocking tale of revenge. This movie is an absolute must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"When you laugh the world laughs with you, when you weep you weep alone\\"","review":"Imagine being taken and thrown into solitary confinement for 15 years without any knowledge of what you had done to deserve this. You can imagine the pain,frustration and rage building over the years, especially when hearing that the wife you had was murdered during your confinement and you are blamed, not to mention the daughter you don't get to see for those long years. Then one day you are suddenly and unexplainably released and expected to solve this little mystery in 5 days. This is the story of Oh dae su. The violence is flinchingly real(especially the torture scenes), the cinematography and acting great, and the ending sick and disturbing. This is how I like my movies! Please do what you will to see this movie even if that involves going on a hammer wielding ass-kicking crusade to the nearest video store. My rating: 9.5/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic violence detracts from great acting","review":"It is a solid mystery with a stellar cast and excellent acting, but I just couldn't warm up to the underlying theme of visceral violence, self-mutilation, and, most disturbing of all, incest.

If not, this may leave bad taste in your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea...","review":"...I'd describe it as Tarantino meets Charlie Kaufman with a little David Lynch thrown in. We rented this because the woman who was on with Richard Roeper last week said it was good and my husband thought it was an action film - he likes Jet Li's movies and thought it was going to be something like that. NOT. I should have checked here first to read about it. Anyway, we didn't like it much. I did think the beginning was good and I was interested for a while, but it quickly started to bore me and, as another reviewer here said, the way the torture/violence is done is a little too real. I also thought the acting was amateurish and over the top. It just wasn't my thing. I thought the plot was kind of ridiculous after the reason for the 15-year imprisonment was revealed. Obviously we won't be taking any more of this lady's recommendations. The other film we rented on her recommendation was just as bad. Can't win them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow plot","review":"Shallow plot offering plenty of occasions for gratuitous graphic violence.

WELL YOU WILL HAVE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF. EVERY MOVE THIS MAN TAKES TO GET SOME ANSWERS IS ALREADY CALCUATED BY THIS PSYCHO WHO BELIEVES HE IS SEEKING REVENGE FOR THE DEATH OF HIS SISTER. THE LEAD ACTORS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. I DID WATCH THIS MOVIE TO THE END BUT I JUST DIDN'T CARE ANYMORE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO OUT THERE. HERE YOU WILL SEE REALITY BECOME UNREAL, UNREAL TURN INTO IMPOSSIBLE AND THE IMPOSSIBLE IS JUST UNBELIEVEABLE. THE MOVIES CONCEPT WAS GOOD BUT A LITTLE TO DEEP AND TO SLOW FOR ME. SORRY!

He lives only for the day of his escape, when he can find and destroy those responsible for his imprisonment. Then, after 15 long years, he is unceremoniously released. No explanation. No reason for the bizarre incarceration. So begins this man's quest to solve the greatest, darkest mystery of his life, and to get the answer to WHY any of it has happened. Also, WHO would do such a thing, going through so much trouble, expense, and planning in order to imprison one man? He WILL find out, but the answer just might be worse than anything he has yet endured. OLDBOY is far from any typical revenge story. It's a savage, bleak twist on the genre, like AUDITION was to the romantic comedy. As w/ AUDITION, it is best to know absolutely nothing about OLDBOY before viewing it.

You start to feel for the characters all of them at some point or another despite some of there motives. And the guessing and wondering keeps you glued in you want to know what is going on so bad. I loved this movie and am going to go purchase it asap. It's a shame that all of the good movies seem to be foreign films Hollywood is horrible all they produce is garbage I dread to see what they do to this film which I heard they are remaking.

And what a tragedy for anyone who hasn't yet seen this powerful film.If you're lucky enough to be free from any spoilers as I was: Old Boy is completely original (how many times can you honestly say that about a film?), independently creative, performed meticulously and is deliciously twisted.Top marks in every category that I can think of - and well worth the full purchase price. Don't even blink if a clean used copy is available - buy it.One important note: Absolutely do not get the dubbed version. So much emotion, so much power is felt thru the original Korean dialogue.A full five stars with no qualifiers.

Everything about this film is so bitterly sweet, from the colors to the soundtrack, the storytelling is the epitome of suspenseful and heart wrenching, and good lord, not to mention Oh Dae-Su's plea for forgiveness at the end, which makes any Pacino or Brando role look like chopped liver.i've seen this film 4 times now, and there are many more planned viewings, but every time i view this film it still floors me and leaves me choked up at parts.oh, and a quick **** you to Hollywood, this doesn't need to be remade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is how a collectors edition of a movie should be done.

It does not work with my dell laptop and the tech support folks are not helpful at all, they couldn't figure out why it's not working with my laptop (which I bought 6 months ago) trust me, I am a ph.d student in computer science, and I couldn't get it to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Academic Review","review":"While this story can get a bit bogged down, one of the interesting questions this book raises is how did a young white woman from a bigoted family in small town, Fresno, California in the 1940's, find herself part of one of the earliest groups willing to express civil rights philosophies? Why was she willing to endure ridicule and estrangement from family, friends and strangers to continue her life-long relationships with Richard Wright and other \\"negros\\" seeking to speak honestly about their \\"American\\" experience? Underlying all is the feeling that this is an incredibly intelligent and loving woman, who stubbornly refuses to give up her ideals in the face of hate and prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love YOU Mr. President","review":"So personal it does make one wonder if we should be reading these things....I'm sure Mrs. Reagan knows best. Thank you for sharing this beautiful collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of straightforward charm!","review":"This book is full of the straightforward charm for which Ronald Reagan was well known while in the Governor's mansion and the White House. From the sometimes mundane details of a loving couple's life to the touching glimpses of a great man's soul, this compilation of letters gives us a moving look at the man behind the public persona. Unlike the numerous biographies and quasi-biographies that recount Reagan's life and times, this work simply exudes the straightforward, confident and honest values that lay at the heart of the President's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Love Story","review":"Regardless of your political ideologies this book will warm your heart. It is an easy read, but one you will cherish, and always keep near your bedside. At a time when the divorce rate is so high, and many families are so miserable it's wonderful to look at a President who cherished his wife, and a wife who truly felt cherished. In a society where everything is sexualized, it's nice to stop and read about something with so much depth, intensity and commitment. Beautiful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Glimpse into the Private Life of Ronald Reagan","review":"What a warm, touching tribute to our late President from his wife! The letters lovingly saved by Nancy Reagan show us a portrait of a genuine, down-to-earth man. I just finished reading this book for the second time, (it's a very quick read), and I was reminded how much I enjoyed the book. Mr. Reagan's integrity, charm, and sense of humor are clearly evident in every letter and \\"doodle\\" in the book.More than half of the letters are from the period before Reagan entered politics. For several years, Reagan was the host of the General Electric Theatre and spent huge amounts of time travelling the country to promote the show. The letters from this period are particularly poignant.Thank you so much, Nancy Reagan, for sharing your treasures in this lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Couple","review":"I bought the Kindle version and at first had a shock with trying to read the scanned letters prevalent throughout the book. I then paged past the initial letters and found the words of Nancy Reagan with the letters typed for easier reading. I asked another buyer if they had the same reaction and they were like me trying to make out the letters with a magnifying glass. Guess we aren't the shiniest pennies in the world.Once I had that figured out, I read one of the most unbelievable books. It is absolutely amazing the depth of the Reagan's love and how the love was expressed over their entire married life. Syrupy at times but that isn't a bad thing. Most of my knowledge of the Reagan's life was from newspapers and television so I found the stories and letters warm and compelling. Forgetting about the politics of the Reagans, any reader should be impressed with their love for each other and inspired to do better in their own relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a love story","review":"I found this book to be so touching, does anyone feel that way any more.

I know many people will think this is love, because Ronnie and Nancy call it that again and again and again and again, but really there are better words for it: pathological dependence, adolescent longing, Hallmark Card sentimentality. For those who take Ronnie's clinging neediness at face value--there is no reason not to--they might reflect on what a venal, shallow, and mean-minded person Nancy Reagan is. Doesn't the quality of a man's love depend at least in part upon the worthiness of the object of that love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mommy Poop Pants","review":"What grown man would refer to his wife as \\"Mommy Poop Pants\\"? This is infantile stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything For A Buck!","review":"How typical this book is of the Reagans. During their term in the White House the Reagans made no secret of their love of money, and after Reagan's term of office was over he would go anywhere and appear before any group -- regardless of ideology -- so long as the paycheck was big enough. Since that recourse to riches is no longer possible, Mrs. Reagan exploits her ill husband by publishing his personal letters to her over the years. Why? The letters provide no new insight into Reagan's personality. It's been common knowledge for decades that Reagan was emotionally dependent upon Nancy. There's no reason for this book other than to cash in and make a quick buck.How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Shocking.","review":"Wow. I had no idea that Reagan wrote so childishly over and over and over again. His emotional maturity seemed to be stunted at 14. He seems to think that romance is love. Some pretty pathetic stuff here - \\"Nancy Poo Pants\\" ?People obsessed with him with love this, people who hate him will not even pick it up. It certainly will help, however, in the public relations camapign being waged to make people feel sentimental and sympathetic and replace that with reason and objectivity in assessing the genuine achievements of this good Chief Executive.I think that the real hero in all of this is Nancy Reagan. She is the one who had to carry the emotional and adult aspects of their entire existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and touching book, that brings back romance!","review":"This I must say is one of my favorite books. The letters that Mr. Reagan wrote to his wife are very loving and touching. It was so nice of Mrs. Reagan to share them with everyone. I'm sure they touched a lot of people and helped bring back romance. I'd give this ten stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle!","review":"What you get here areimages of handwritten letters. They are illegible and can not be made bigger.

If I could go back, I would vote for him. I think I am in love with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only we could all be loved this way","review":"I loved reading this book! Afterwards I gave it to my mom to read. The love between Nancy and Ronald will leave you breathless. As their lives move on Ronald always still writes to his love Nancy.

Acting is generally seen as a cooperative effort, but this collection of monologues proves that wrong. Usually funny and almost always far more insightful than anything in the movies, this work takes an often ignored route to exploring contemporary American culture. Some people may be offended by the vulgar nature of some of the monologues (such as Dirt, in which the only word in the first sentence that is not an obscenity is 'ya'), this very vulgarity is a reality of life that is necessary to accept in order to understand what Bogosian has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Powerful","review":"Bogosian has a knack for creating compelling characters. A common aspect to all of his characters is desperation. Whether it the paranoid desperation of the \\"Artist\\" who stopped making art because \\"they\\" would know what he was thinking to the quiet despertion of the homeless \\"Bottleman\\" who finds comfort in collecting bottles or cans (\\"Bottles or cans, it makes no difference\\") so that he can enjoy an egg salad sandwich to the despertion of the man who calls \\"Candy\\" for a good time.Right from the beginning, Bogosian (both in writing and as the lone actor in a one man show) pushes the envelope in establishing characters who live on the edges of society and who feel the pressure of desperation in their lives. For those of you who are interested, the movie \\"Talk Radio\\" has Bogosian exploring themes similar to those explored in \\"Sex, Drugs, ROck & Roll.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical ride","review":"Wonderfully amusing fun.

The local repair vendor had the TV for 3 weeks (they said it would take 5 days). They returned the TV in worse condition than they got it in; the problems were still there and they put a 5 inch rip in the screen.

But I found the Jukebox controls to be clunky and counterintuitive. There is no autodj function as found on MusicMatch. There is a surprising delay between playing one song and the next.

It is very hard to hear soft music, as the volume does not go up very high. Also, it is easy to hear the noises on the hard drive. The mP3 player is very bulky. One of the worst parts is that it doesn't work if it gets cold. Even in the summer, it might not work in intense air conditioning. The soft ware that comes with the jukebox is also hard to learn how to use. You have to pay more to upgrade it if you want any of the advanced features! I would maybe try the iPOD mini instead.

Justin does well, and Ray and Graeme both contribute a song apiece. Where this album really shines is in production: it simply has more punch than any other MB album. The only flaws are 1) the techno beats on 'English Sunset', 2) 'Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air) is a little corny (but very catchy), 3) The whole album is a little hard to sit through, 4) Graeme Edge sounds like he's eating peanut butter during the last track, 5) It is a little dated in it's millenium references.

There are a couple of good songs on it like English Sunset, Walking On Air, and Nothing Changes, but that's about it. John must have been asleep the whole time they were recording this. Either that or he just wasn't in to it. Even on some of Justin's tunes, he sounded half asleep or he just couldn't come up with anything to write about. Ray's 1:40 second contribution was a big disappointment after all these years of nothing contributed. In my opinion, the album is a waste of time. It is slow and boring.

Saw them perform many of the \\"Strange Times\\" pieces in concert at Jones Beach, July 22nd, and was thoroughly disappointed. While I admit the quality of the CD is excellent, the songs still lack the mystical voyage quality associated so lovingly with the group's work we've come to enjoy so much over the decades. I detected on the CD the inability at times to hit the high notes which was sadly very obvious in their live performance, also. They sound tired, and maybe after all these years of such great compositions and performances, they are. I am going to put \\"Strange Times\\" in the back of my collection and allow myself to stick with their best work from stranger times (no pun) - the 60's, 70's & 80's. They are still the greatest of groups, just this work is not one of their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average for a band capable of much more","review":"I've been a Moody Blues fan since 1974, and have seen them in concert numerous times. I must say however, the last two CDs were sub par. I played this CD twice since I got it 3 months ago, and it is now sitting in my CD rack collecting dust. The lyrics do not show much thought; there's nothing all that great about the music either. There isn't even one song that jumps out and grabs me on this CD. This appeared to be a \\"We're running out of money so let's make a recording\\" kind of thing. Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eight years is *so* worth the wait.","review":"I ran out and bought this CD yesterday. I have to say, it was worth the trip!! This album is the perfect way to come back after 8 years. All the songs are beautifully done and have perfect instrumentation. Justin is, as usual, amazing. John Lodge has some of his best work ever and his voice is *so* good, Ray Thomas isn't on it much but is wonderful when he is, and Edge has an outstanding new piece of poetry. Favorite songs: Haunted, Sooner or Later, Strange Times, My Little Lovely, The Swallow, and Nothing Changes. And, after a few more listens, I'm sure I'll have more. Wonderful, wonderful album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Times is a breath of fresh air for Moody Blues fans.","review":"As a long time fan of classic Moody Blues, I am floored by how much I this new installment. In fact, I think it's their best album since 'The Present'. Excellent sound quality that doesn't seem \\"over-produced\\" and fantastic songwriting were a couple of things that came to mind as I listened to it.This might sound strange, but the opening tune: 'English Sunset', invokes a feeling in me that is hard to describe. Kinda like something inside of me wants to yell: \\"YES! It's 1999, The MB's are back and sound phenomenal\\"!Ray Thomas' effort: \\"My Little lovely\\" perfectly combines new and old Moody Blues style songwriting in a classic way that only Ray can deliver.Srange Times is indeed a step forward for the Moody Blues and deserves a good listening to by any MB's fan or any fan of good music in general. -Frank"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I send it back?","review":"I've been a Moodies fan since the beginning.

However, that can't change my feelings on this latest offering titled \\"Strange Times.\\" There are only two good songs on this album, and one of those two - \\"Haunted\\" - is quickly forgettable. And any offerings from John Lodge that might have been passible were quickly killed by his weak vocals. (John, John...Thy name is vanity! Let Justin and Ray do your singing for you...PLEASE!)

But the boys came through for me this time. This is an excellent CD, deserving of the name Moody Blues. A few missteps by John, and a nice song by Ray that is much too short (couldn't you add a flute solo in there somewhere?). But lots of beautiful melodies, great vocals, and great guitar work, (is there any doubt Justin Hayward is the most underrated man in rock and roll history?). Like most of the classic Moodies albums this one gets better and better with each listen until in the end it playing it will be like visiting an old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody Blues greatest yet","review":"This is the greatest Moody Blues CD yet. The song \\"Words you Say\\" left me amazed at the beauty that they achieved in their music. All the songs on this CD were good and many were absolutely wonderful. The Moody Blues pour out there soul in their music and I felt priviledged to be able to partake in it. The best I can describe it is beautiful poetry set to music and overflowing with passion and that, I believe, is music at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Strange Times\\" Worth the Wait!!!!","review":"The Moody Blues new album \\"Strange Times\\" was worth the long wait by fans. This album is terrific!!! It is reminiscent and progressive at the same time. The music is clean, and the melodies have you hooked in no time. Justin Hayward again proves his prolific stamina as a singer and songwriter. John Lodge awes the listener with his lyrics and melodies. Also included are the eagerly awaited return of Ray Thomas (My Little Lovely) and Graeme Edge (Nothing Changes).

The only song I don't care for that much is \\"Sooner or later\\". It sounds a little \\"bubble gum\\" to me. Although John made up for it with his other songs on the album. I think that the instrumental arangements are excellent! For example, the orchestral arangements were beautiful. I'm still trying to figure out how much was real strings and how much was synths. I also think that The Moodies were much more creative on this one, maybe because they produced it themselves instead of having to listen to some record company tell them how to play, sing, and arange.I wore my cassette out and I'm going to buy the CD. Dave"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just Not On....","review":"Even as a long time fan, \\"Strange Times\\" is a major disappointment. Justin Hayward's contributions are okay but certainly nowhere near the quality exhibited in his recent solo work (View from the Hill). I listened to it the album twice but nothing truly remarkable.It was nice to see that Ray Thomas was allowed to make a contribution again. However, John Lodge's contributions largely detract from the album. I couldn't listen the whole way through any of his maudlin songs. I certainly agree with another Amazon review that John Lodge needs to leave the singing to Justin & Ray.If you're a fan, you'll probably buy it anyway. Otherwise, \\"Strange Times\\" is just not on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moodies never cease to amaze me.......","review":"Wow, they've done it again! I saw them in concert, and when they played \\"English Sunset\\" and \\"Haunted\\" for us, I just had to get the new CD. What a great surprise! They sound as fresh and young as ever, and I'm very proud to be one of their devoted fans. \\"All That Is Real Is You\\" is a reality check for the heart.

The exception is with THIS ONE, a collaborative piece where the Hayward/Lodge synergy seems to inspire them. THIS ONE should be a hit and could signal a legitimate new direction for the Moodies. Another respectable tune is MY LITTLE LOVELY by Ray Thomas. Why don't we hear more from this guy? Most of the rest of the album consists of sub par compositions, poor lyrics (John, what were you thinking?) and garage band guitar passages. And what a waste of an orchestra. Shame. Sorry guys. I know you are more capable than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The gods have betrayed me...","review":"What a nothing disc, incredible that I found not a single worthwhile track on this disc making me want to hang on to it. I'm afraid the The Moodies have seen their day as their past few releases have proved. Last really good Moodies disc? 72/Seventh Sojourn, in fact any 70's period disc is better than this new one. In my opinion, the Moodies suffered a huge blow when original keys player Mike Pinder left the band. They haven't been the same since although I admire them for slogging onward. Old fans- Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"perfect example of record company greed !!!!","review":"This clearly shows how greedy record companies place sales over good quality music. This album only had 2 good songs and failed by far in comparison to their much better albums such as Keys to the kingdom and Surlamur. OMD, No Doubt, Alan Parsons, and Christina Aguilara also have this same trouble. Except for Vitamin C, Dream, and Garbage your better off buying the singles instead. A few great songs usually no longer reflect on the quality of the entire album. All record companies should be forced to make at least 4 hit singles per artist before being allowed to make an entire album containing the same 4 songs(like in the 80's). That way they can't send out terrible albums based on only one or two hit songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Times/Strange CD","review":"Strange Times was very monotonous and I missed the jamming of \\"The Other Side Of Life,\\" the Moody's greatest CD.

Justin Hayward has become an excellant songwriter and interpreter of his songs. His guitar work is incredible and controlled. Don't expect any wild solos here. But if you like good music, you will love this record. There are songs of social commentary, environmental concerns, and love songs. These songs are real and done well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and understand, great to create wealth","review":"This is very easy to read.

It's not a straight Thrash album, but after ACT III why would you expect that? They manage to switch up styles very nicely and convincingly. There's a nod to punk, NWOBHM, thrash, some funkified metal, some hardcore. The singing is much better on this cd than any other DA release. There is a lot of energy coming through the music. It's nice to hear them switch up singers as well. Andy sings Spirit, Dennis sings Land of Blood, Rob sings Word to the Wise, and Mark does lead vocals on every other song. I would have given this cd 4 and 1/2 stars, but amazon won't let you. I would have given this cd 5 stars, but I feel ACT III has rights to that rating, this release is just below it. AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for thrash metal fans!!","review":"This is a comeback CD for the Bay Area thrashers Death Angel that is a total masterpiece.

The sound is different from traditional Death Angel of the past. It's not as thrashy as Ultra Violence. More along the lines of Act III, but still different.

The one advantage that this game has over M.O.H. is that you can play the story mode 2-Player co-operative. Which brings me to the third mode of play.Two player co-operative: WHAT WERE THE DESIGNERS OF THIS GAME THINKING WHEN THEY DECIEDED NO ONE WOULD WANT/NEED TO SAVE THEIR 2-PLAYER CO-OPERATIVE GAME!?!?!?! I played this with a friend for around 4 hours when we realized we couldn't save our game.

The struggles, the triumphs, the emotions, the meanings are all skillfully woven to create a soon-to-be American classic literary canon, depicting the Civil Rights Movement. Lewis, described as an American treasure, lives up to the title with his intimate details of the renown leaders of the movement and the not-so-well-known heroes, who fought tirelessly and courageously to end the social injustices of the segregated South. Twenty-first century textbook authors would be remiss, if not negligent, by not including the perspectives of Lewis' Walking with the Wind. Amazingly, Lewis remains humble, despite his successes. He is a role model, and more importantly, a 20th Century American hero. Walking with the Wind is a must-read for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Living Saint","review":"John Lewis has been called a \\"living saint\\", he definitely deserves the title but when reading his book Walking With the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement you discover that he is as mortal as you and me.Hard to believe he is the only living speaker from the 50 year ago event that showcased Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I have a dream speech\\". Lewis was the youngest of King's inner circle and got his training on the ground.What I enjoy in this book is that Lewis shares the ups and downs of his life. From breaking out from his Alabama rural roots to the pain of losing King and Robert Kennedy to an assassin's bullet are all spelled out in this memoir.He also chronicles his public service career and the many competing interest that pull and push at him, all the while staying true to himself and doing the right thing.An insightful book of a man that is part of America's history, this is perfect for anyone who wants to be inspired and given that push to pursue their own dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung Blows","review":"I'm on my 2nd Engine, and it is beginning to show signs of a pending failure (it takes 3 or 4 minutes to warm up and turn on).The Samsung Service dept stinks.

Try swinging at a 95 MPH fastball and you'll find that the ball is in the catcher's mit before you even start to swing. Turns out that these digital displays require more video processing time. So they decide to delay the audio to match. Unfortunately all video gamers must now suffer from this. Any game that requires quick reaction time like stopping a moving line at a certain point on a bar is impossible. It's really sad that something this serious is often overlooked. I took my xbox to a circuit city and tried it on all the digital displays. They all had the same poor result. I try it on a cheap $200 tube tv and it's perfect.

Each one just keeps getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oye! When can I get number 4?","review":"I am fifteen, and I have lost track of how many times I have read this book. Though I was an avid reader before, this book is enough to make me want to read into indecent hours of the night, even for the third, fourth...tenth time. Every time you read it, you pick up more little things about the plot and characters. At times it feels like Tolkien, and other times (well, a lot of times) it feels like Dahl, but most of all, Rowling has a style all her own that makes you want to read again and again and again and again...So, in case you haven't gotten the hint yet, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have not read it then GET IT NOW!","review":"When I was reading this book I could not take my eyes off the book!

It was the BEST book I ever read. I couldn't wait till the next came out, then it was awsome too. Then the third came out and It was great just like the first and second one.It's a very exciting book. Now that I'm in seventh grade, I am worried by the time the others comes out I won't have the time to read it. But I hopfully will be able to find some time. The Harry Potter series is what really got me to start reading. Before that I would rather watc T.V. or do something else but I have read a lot of books since the first. I can't wait till the fourth Harry Potter book comes out, but it will be worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best one yet!!!!","review":"This book is so wonderful. I am starting graduate school and a teacher, but I disregarded my homework and bedtime to finish it. Once you start reading, you just can't stop. Ms. Rowling is absolutely amazing. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Harry and company. I just wish I could be there too. Everyone, young and old, should read this book and the others too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This 3rd book in the series is as great at the first two!!","review":"This is truly a book that adults and children alike will fall in love with. There is no mistake that it is a book (and series) that will entertain you. I haven't read a \\"children's book\\" that was more enjoyable. I just couldn't put it down until I got to the end of the book to find out what happens - I stayed up all night to finish it! If you have an imagination, all the books in the series will win your heart! Absolutely the best find for kids of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was amazing!

I liked it because it was longer than the first two, but I think what was best about it, is that the ending went on for longer. You know how when you get to the last couple of chapter at the end of a book, it gets really exciting? Well the last six chapter are like this! The story was the best yet, it kept you thinking all the time, and just when you thought you had it all figured out... BANG! Everything would change! I stayed up 'till 3AM to finish it, and then I didn't fall asleep 'till 4 because I couldn't stop thinking about the incredible book I had just read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I absolutly loved the book. Normally I don't read a lot, but I just could not stop reading it. It is the best of the Harry Potter books so far!

I can't wait for the next Harry Potter books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They just get better!!!","review":"When I read the first Harry Potter book, I thought that books could get no better. Then I read the second one and It was better. I read the third one and it was better still. Each book has more excitment, mystery, and adventure than the one written before it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"My favorite Harry Potter, thus far, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" offers the reader a glimpse into Harry's past and the various human motivations that served to shape and mold present circumstances. JK Rowling succeeds on all levels with this book-superficially through the introduction of new aspects of the wizarding world; aesthetically through the satisfyingly mysterious and twist-laden plot; and emotionally through the revelation of an entirely new element of Harry's past, which of course bears serious implications on Harry's present and future. Two words: Chapter 16...This is one Harry Potter book that I am most looking forward to seeing as a movie... That way, the scenes that already succeed in evoking such powerful emotions by residing only in my imagination will be brought to newer heights onscreen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need a 6 star option","review":"These books are awesome!!!!!!

I hope there will be another one!","review":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was even better then the first two!! It had alot of mystery, and there were more characters. Just when you think you know who the bad guy is, it turns out to be someone else! After I finished it, I wanted to learn more about Hogwarts, Dumbledore, and Harry's parents. YOU HAVE TO READ IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Saga Continues","review":"The third book in the Harry Potter series is even better than the first two, in my opinion. It has more drama, suspense, humor, darkness, and mystery than the first two, and it's even longer than them... 435 pages {for the paperback edition, at least}. If you liked the first two books, then you should definately read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot better than year 4","review":"I feel in year four there was to much details in the middle of the book where year 3 was so much more fun and lively!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept dragging on","review":"I thought that this book was exciting at the beginning, but got boring as it progessed. I was very unsatisfied with the story, and the story didn't compare to the second Harry book. I thought that if J.K. Rowling could cut the book down a little bit, it would be much more enjoyable. If you want a short and exciting read, do not choose this book. But if you like stories that keep dragging on, by all means, read this book. That is why I gave this book two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good find but could have done better.","review":"Great book but the description on the condition of it was a bit off. This was supposed to be a gift and even though I knew it was a used book there was too much damage to the entire book. The description said it had minimal wear on the cover and edges but they failed to mention the huge water stains and water damage to the entire book. I ended up keeping this copy for myself and just buying a new one for the person I was gifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality so so","review":"This library copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has some quality issues. The sound kept fading in and out requiring the radio to be kept on its highest volume level. (Not a problem until you tried to change the tapes!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"The ideas just dont stop coming, do they?.Harry Potter #3 is as good as the first two if not better, with adventures from time traveling to werewolves and magical maps this book is amazingly captivating, it just won't let you put it down.Rowling keeps her books fresh also by puting in new characters every book(Note Sir Cadogan), and always giving you a reason to suspect everybody,but Rowlings' book's have one flaw, you finish them to quickly and have to wait to much time for the next, but I forgive her that.So if you have spare time read all Harry Potter books and if you don't I hope you can find some and enjoy the magical world of Hogwarts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Three","review":"I started reading the first book after my wife had suggested it. Since this time I have read all three and just concluded \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\". I enjoyed it more than either of the first two and I liked each one of them. It kept me interested from the opening chapter all the through to the final page. I have already ordered the fourth book for my son (that's what I tell everyone). I get lost in the characters and can picture Hogwarts and the going ons."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book yet","review":"Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban is certainly the best one yet. In this compelling story Harry becomes a third year, along with new classes and teachers, including the mysterious Lupin and the strange Trelawney. This time Harry learns of the treacherous Sirius Black, the powerful heir of Voldermont and traitor of his parents. Black has escaped from Wizard prison Azkaban and is now after Harry, so the evil Dementors have been set up around Hogwarts as guards against Sirius's unexpected threats. Now Harry, Hermione, and Ron, along with Lupin, set out on a venture for truth. An epic struggle where enemies become friends and Harry finds that the greatest weapon of all is the power of forgivness. I can't wait to read the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament, wich is supposed to come out some time in June or July."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Best of the Three!","review":"I think that this third Harry Potter book is the best of the three. At places it may seem a bit confusing, but is an awesome book to own and read over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban","review":"I like the book Harry Potter cause I like wizard cause have power. Harry is a powerful wizard and smart and quick at fling.Harry is a good but he has lots of problems and even Harry has learn all the things and he a good person."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I really love this book, but I got a little scared at the end. It's not something I would read right before I went to sleep. I think the author should write more than seven, 'cause they're really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic of Harry Potter","review":"This book is filled of magic, excitement and wonder! I'm eleven years old and the book was first recommended to me by my best of friends. That day I went to Barnes and Noble, purchased the book, sat down and read. And for the next five or six hours I read. I didn't even get up to eat or use the bathroom! That's how bewitching this book is. A few of my friends who haven't read the book call it 'stupid.' But I've really pressed it on them to read it, and after a while they give up, read the book, and tell me it was excellent. I myself should know because I've read each book in the series six times and I'm on my seventh while waiting for the fourth book! I totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4th grade class listened for hours.","review":"My 4th grade class could not get enough of Harry Potter. They choose Harry Potter over playing computer games during their free hour. I have read the entire series to them. It is amazing how much they retained! Even the more difficult words did not phase them.The only problem I have now is waiting for the next book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT BOOK IN THE HARRY POTTER SERIES","review":"The first Harry Potter Book was awesome. The second was amazing... but it just keeps getting better and better. This book has so many twist and turns, that its just amazing. I have read this book over 18 times and still plan to read it more. J. K. Rowling has a great sense of word style and her books flow so smoothly. This book is about Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At school he attends classes such as: Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Potions, Transfiguration, and all other sorts of magical classes. And once again something dangerous is happening around him. Who is this Sirius Black? and what does he want with Harry? Why is Scabbers so thin? Why is Crookshanks always chasing Scabbers? Who is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher anyways?This book is a must have for all ages. I am still patiently awaiting book number six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing....fantastic...um..hopeful","review":"This book is a fantastic book..i especially likedthe ending becoz it really makes you feel warm(IfYouHaventReadTheBookYou'llHaveNoIdeaWhatImSaying)that someone whom harry once thought was his worse enemy..turnedout to be someone he really cares about. The part when Black tells him he was the one that sent him the firebolt..was..surprising. This book is filled with tons of adventures.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Harry Potter book!","review":"This book is about Harry Potter and his third year in Gryffindor at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. At Hogwarts are some of his friends like Ron and heromine as well as enemies such as Draco Malfoy. If you are looking for an adventure, then this terrific tale should be bought right this instant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it over 300 pages?","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the 3rd book in the Harry Potter series. For me this book falls completely flat. It seems like a huge mosh of rantings which makes up the whole middle of the book. While the climax and ending takes only two chapters. This book did not need to be so long. I was even more disappointed because when I watched the third movie I found myself extremely confused and I was hoping I could follow the book more. I was wrong and the book was even less exciting. Needless to say this did not get me excited to read the next two books which are even longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was great.","review":"I found this book quite interiesing. With ron and harry and herminie. I read it just for fun. It was about serious black and how he ecackeped askeban prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"This book had my sons and I riveted night after night as I read it to them. Rowlings sets up quite a scenario and very vivid characters, the Dementors are especially frightening. Harry's situation with the Dursley's couldn't be more dreary. There's also his escape from them and the feeling of fear for the unknown odyssey that awaits him.And of course the real story of Sirius Black, who he is and why he's looking for Harry...The author is particularly masterful at creating a \\"series\\" of books that stands quite admirably on their own. Get this book read it and savor it and the other 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series...","review":"I think Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series. The book demonstrates friendship at its greatest, and not just between Harry and his friends, but between Lupin and the others. The end is the best part of the book. I really liked the mysteries in it, and how the ending was not at all what I expected it to be. I reccommend this book to anyone of any age. I can't wait until the fifth one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun listening","review":"Jim Dale has the ability to bring Harry Potter and characters to life. It is captivating. He is the best storyteller I've ever listened to and of course, he had such great material to read! I've got the whole set now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban","review":"This is a very adventurous book and Harry Potter figures out something he wishes he found out a long time ago.But somehow it interferes with his life and soon becomes harder for him. Now that he found this out, it changes part of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flows the best.","review":"Out of all the Harry Potter books this one flows the best. If you ahve just seen the film and not read the book I would suggest that you read this book. The history of certain situations is explained a lot better in this book than the film did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 'Dumbing' Down of a Beautiful Genre","review":"Its really depressing to see what acclaim books like these seem to get these days. Don't get me wrong, I've read to of them (I am the book reviewer for my school newspaper), but I find the characters to be shallow, and without redeeming qualities. There never is a driving need, or quest, the main character merely deals with events as they come. The villians are fake and utterly unbelieveable, and now that publishers are seeing how successful Harry Potter has become, they are demanding that more books are written in its image and thus depriving the world of well written fantasy books. The 'dumbing' down of a genre, from the 'dumbing' down of a society. And I'm not even going to remark upon the rampant commercialism associated with this book. Harry Potter toothbrushes and shower curtains? Oh please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this book for children under 12. Not adult material","review":"Don't be misled by this book being on the Times Best sellers. It should be on a children's best sellers list only. It is extremely childish and unrealistic. To compare this author with Tolkien, Louis Carroll, or any other author of that caliber is a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly plotted by comparison","review":"I thought the third book didn't stand up to the other two -- much more convoluted plotwise, and a bit contrived. The names were also a little too suggestive, and ruined the surprise"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is terrable!!!!!!!!","review":"I think they're going to far with this book. It's the worst plot I've ever heard of. I think anybody who likes this book is in third grade or lower! It's defenetly not worth the paper it's written on. Please, burn the book. And it's not worth $9.97!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst in the series!","review":"When J.K. Rowling wrote this one, she must have forgotten why her books became so popular in the first place.Something about this book just does not FEEL LIKE Harry Potter.Frankly, this book is boring. The new characters are blah-blah and annoying, and by the end you'll get really, really sick of hearing about Harry's parents. There is nothing new and exciting, except Aunt Marge blowing up in the second chapter. The Marauder's Map was ok as well, but not interesting enough to keep you glued to the page.Like the Order of the Phoenix, the excitement dies down quickly, although this one is much worse that the 5th book.Bottom line? Read this as a filler so you'll know what goes on in-between the 2nd and 4th books, but don't expect anything more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT THIS BOOK TO COUNT AS TWO!","review":"When Harry \\"accidentally\\" inflates his aunt, he gets sent away to the leaky caldron to meet with Mr. Fudge to discuss his mistake. When Hogwarts is having problems with the raving Serious Black, Harry is tracking him down for a different reason... revenge.My opinion is that this book is not great. I found it too long. I wish it would get to the point faster. I found it better than the fourth book.I would recomend this for boys, and for girls who like fantasy and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book important?","review":"I would just like to say that I do not see the point of reading this book. I loved the other three books (That means the Goblet of Fire is included). I think that this book could have been left out of the series. Yes, it did play the base for the fourth book. But I don't think it needed to take 435 pages. I am eagerly awaiting the Fifth book and the movie. I am hoping that both of those will be much better than the third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely NOT a Bad influence","review":"I must say that as a devout Christian I find sensoring this book ridiculous. Surely others of you must realize that there is more violence in the book of Genisis alone than in the three HP books combined! Please Read this book! Let your children read it! Heck, encourage people on the street to read it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant classic!","review":"This is arguably the best book in the Harry Potter series!The plot is so brilliantly put together, it had me guessing until the very end.Such a great piece of work.This book is my favorite in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOLEST BOOK EVER!","review":"This book is OUTSTANDING!

It's so exciting, I can't even stop turning pages. I can't wait to go to another chapter. This is the first Harry Potter book I've read, and it's the best! The book has such a twisty ending! It's so surprising too! I really can't believe that secret that has been going on for years, and Harry never knew it! Read this book to find out what that secret is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Readers beware","review":"I read this book for fun and i found it quite hard for my level of reading. Although through my parents explaining what the larger words have meant. I have found the book to be quite enjoyable through my reading experience. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J. K. Rowling. It is about a boy that lives with his aunt and uncle because his parents are dead. He gets in trouble and runs a away but was in grave danger because there was a escaped prisoner. Through his travels at school there are a number of threats and much confusion that Harry helps to solve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"This book reveals a little more to us readers, Harry Potter's family background, how his parents are killed by you-know-who. I think this book is just as exciting as the previous two books and as usual, there is always a twist at the end of the book which leaves the readers yearning for more and a new piece is fitted into yet another puzzle..... or is it?However, there is only one thing I don't quite enjoy in this book or the previous ones. That is, at the beginning of every book, the author seems to write a lot about how Harry is suffering with his uncle, aunt and his cousin and I find that quite boring to a certain extend. I guess, I can't wait for him to return to Hogwarts as that is where all the action begins. Anyway, it's just a small suggestion and I enjoy the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one she's written... by far!","review":"So much emotion, and great discoveries.

Then i started reading for hours and hours finding it hard to put the book down. Finally i realized i was in love with the book. It sucks you in gradually. Today i finished reading it. People called and said do you want to do something today and my response was no i'm reading! This book \\"puts a spell on you\\"! It's exciting and not predictable at all. You meet new characters, but still get a flavor of the old ones. And just like every other harry potter book you finish reading it satisfied and wanting more. That's why i rate the book 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"I used to make fun of my friends for ready the Harry Potter books, but then I read them (out of order) and this was the first one I read!

It is a cool book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5MILLION STAR BOOK","review":"Harry Potter books are the best books ever. I think everyone should read them. If you haven't read a Harry Potter book, what are you doing at your computer? Go read the Harry Potter series now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever for all ages","review":"J.K. Rowling certainly doesn't disappoint with this third Harry Potter book. It has everything I look for in a book: a wonderful story, terrific writing, imagination, and drama. Rowling tells the story in an amazing way without blood, gore, or violence. It makes me wish that Hogwarts was real, but the author writes so well that you can almost feel that it is real, even if it is only while you are reading. I can hardly wait to share this with all the students at our elementary school library, but I'm a 42 yr. old woman, so please don't hesitate to read this book no matter what your age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't believe how excellent this book was!","review":"I ordered this book early because I couldn't wait for Sep. 8th when it came out in the US.

Why does Snape hate Harry so much? What really happened to Harry's parents? And why do the Dementors only affect Harry? I confess, I am a grown adult who is completely hooked on the Harry Potter series and cannot wait for the fourth book to hit the shelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book, Harry Potter, is one of the best books I've ever","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read.

I've read the entire series so far, and anxiously await year 4. I've read several fantasy/scifi series in the past, many of which tend to lag as they progress and the author just wants to finish things up. That doesn't happen here (as of yet). The 3rd installment is still just as funny, exciting, and page-turningly addictive as the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH","review":"I am an eleven year old girl in sixth grade. I live in America. I LOVE THESE BOOKS!!!!!! They could not be improved in any way. They are perfect! The characters are described perfectly. The plots are purely brilliant. I don't care about what parents are saying in South Carolina and South Dakota. I have read each of the first three books four times already and am reading the third a fifth time. They are magnificent, wonderful, great and fun to read! They are simply brilliant! I am being Hermione Granger for Halloween. My friend is too. I know a girl in fifth grade who is being Harry!! Pretty amazing, eh. The only bad thing I have to say is how to pronounce Hermione. That's all I have to say.PS I honestly can't wait for them all to be out. I wish I could have a hint about the plot of the next ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful world of make believe-","review":"Picked up the lst book at Sams Store for my 9 year old niece who is reading on a 7th grade level had no idea it would intrique me her aunt/godmother. It did immediately went to the bookstore got the other 2 books and couldn't put them down, most assuredly to be the classic of our time-I am anxiously awaiting anymore sequels-I am also 46 years old. My sister works in a small school district in Texas in the library and provides much help to the youngsters picking material they can read, enjoy and test out for their reading program. I donated our books and she ordered the test for the students, I only hope they enjoy reading them as much as this old woman. I hope the controvercy I've been hearing is untrue-witchcraft indeed!!! Imagination is a wonderful and exciting thing to behold no matter what age we are. No book burnings please-or Alice in wonderland would have been long gone for sure!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wouldn't dream of giving it any less stars!","review":"This will most likly not be read but I'll give it a shot anyway. Harry is back at Hogwarts with his friends, but all the teachers want him to stay by them. Everyone is looking after him for the sopposed murderer is after Harry and everyone thinks he is there to kill Harry, Just like he killed an old time friend of Harry's parents. I would also like to say I have been looking at the other reviews and most of them I agree with but the ones who say it's just a fad and barly anyone really like it I completly disagree, I read it before anyone really heard of it and recommened it to a few of the kids at my school who read like me and they loved it, so it is not just a fad it's a book people like to read, But I understand that others have a right to there oppinion same as I have a right to mine just keep in mind that there are lots of kids who like Harry Potter for the way it's written and what it's about not for the fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT !","review":"this is 1 of my fave books.

It was hard to understand the plot and the charecters seemed so bland!! No one should actually buy this book. It isnt worth the 9.98!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK OF ONE OF THE WORST SERIES","review":"This book is the worst than the other two (also boring), andI've got plenty of reasons. At the beginning, the conflict is broughtup way too early, before Harry even went to Hogwarts, but even worse is that the conflict is not brought up until the very end of the story, where the characters happen to walk into a room where Black reveals himself. The worst fact is that Harry doesn't even put in ANY effort to solve the problem, which turn out to not be a problem anyway. J. K. Rowling puts in too much effort to surprise you, so much that the book is horrible. The only good thing about the series is checking your guessing skills. The Harry Potter books just keep on getting worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Example Of Fully PLaning Out A Book","review":"First of all I want to point out that I only rated this book a 1 because I knew it would probably catch most people's attention. Besides the fact that it was a little dark, this book was perfect. It takes you into another world of imagination, flying through the air. And also, J.K. Rowling laid out this book perfectly before writing it. She uses information plotted at the beginning in the resolution, which really shows how good of a writer she is. I fully recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"This book stinks. It deserves less than 1 star. How about -1000 stars? I own this book, and found it to be a big waste of money. I read it once, and couldn't read it again. For great reads, read \\"The Redwall series\\" by Brian Jaques, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" by C.S. Lewis, \\"My Father's Dragon\\" by Ruth Stiles Gannet, or the \\"Enchanted Forest series\\" by Patricia Wrede.

It was so horible I did not want to get past Chapter 5 But I suffered through it. The first 2 books were ok but this one you must be a die hard fan to read it, and I mean a real die hard. I really disliked the Sirius Black person. Plus it just was not that exciteing to me at least. But if you are about 10 it might seem a little better. If you want to read a truly good book with wizards in it read J.R.R.

The books always keep me on my toes. I love this book and I would recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"THis is a great book and i think everyone should get it. It is, in my opinion the best of the series. I disagree that this book is only for 9-12 year olds, this book is for ALL ages. I'll be looking forward to the movie for this (Steven Stelberg agreed to direct the movie for this book, unlike 1 & 2)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first two are better","review":"I don't want to give away any of the plot, because that would just ruin the fun of it. This would be a wonderful book had the two that preceded it not been so spectacular. I feel that this story fell short, and at the end I was left distrusting the author, finding her ending somewhat incredulous and illogical, even when thinking from a \\"magical\\" and \\"wizardry\\" point of view. I don't think Rowling developed the outcome as well, and she spent too much time adding in details that only muddled the comprehension of the outcome. Not to sound too critical though. This story will still make you not want to put the book down. But the ending may disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the four","review":"This third book is the best among the four Harry Potter books, but the other three are very, very good too. I like how the story doesn't force itself to unfold, it just does so naturally. So naturally, in fact, that I didn't see the ending coming at all (don't worry, I'm not giving anything away). I was surprised and delighted (and I'm 28 years old too!) to find that Harry's family is growing and he's becoming more of a teenager, too. Yes, that means love is in the air! And if you're looking for even more action than books 1 and 2, you'll definitely find it here, with the prisoner of azkaban. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Put a smile on my face.","review":"This was a lot more entertaining then the first two and I was glad it ended the way it did.

ROWLING It really makes you never want to put the book down I have read the books up to the fourth one awhile ago & decided to read them again due to lack of remembrance. Sirius Black has alot to do with this third book he had escaped from the Azkaban prison which nobody thought could be done everyone knows about It even the muggles so this Is a huge thing seeing as he killed I believe Its thirteen people with one spell so hes a convicted murder & people believe that he Is looking for Harry Potter If you want to know more about this wonderful third book of J.K.ROWLINGS Harry Potter & the prisoner of Azkaban you should read It!

He has brown hair, glasses, and a scar on his head. He likes to play a game called Quidditch which is played on a broom stick. In the story a prisoner named Sirius Black escapes from prison and everyone thinks he is after Harry. You will need to read the book to find out what happens.I really liked this book.

In fact, we're all crazy about all of the Harry Potter books. At first, I wasn't sure about what all the hype was all about. Then my friend got book three, let me read it, and I fell in love. From then on, I was always on the lookout for Harry Potter. Now, my friends and I are searching for the 4th book, Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. It sounds really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Is Too Good For Words","review":"I have read the first two Harry Potter books in four days. They were both unbelievable and by far the greatest book series and single books I have ever read. The Prisonar of Azkaban is in the mail and on its way. I feel strongly that when this series wraps up, J.K. Rowlings will have more awards than Harry Potter has spells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far","review":"I have to admit that I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I AM a compulsive reader, however, so I keep reading these books even tho I was deeply un-impressed with the second one. This one, however, is the best of the lot! I haven't read book 4 yet, BTW.Without giving anything away, if you've really understood the first 2 books, you kind of know what is going to happen in this one. It's just a matter of waiting to find out HOW it happens. I was semi-impressed at the lengths they had to go thru to make it all fit together. Simple stories bore me, and this plot was anything but simple.Some of the same complaints are still there, however. This series is obviously targeted at a market 20 or so years younger than me, it'll never stand up with some of the \\"classics\\" of fantasy, but it's still occasionally fun.I still recommend reading them for yourself. Some people may not like this, some people will be surprised to discover that they enjoy these novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! WONDERFUL! DELIGHTFUL! AWESOME! YOU NAME IT!","review":"This is my second favorite book ever! (The first is Goblet of Fire) ; ) This book will leave you with your mouth open. It has so many twists and turns and surprises! It's extremely hard to put down! In this book Harry is in his third year at Hogwarts along with his friends, Hermione and Ron. You meet a LOT of new characters including a really cool Professor named Remus Lupin. And a mysterious teacher named Professor Trelawney. Hermione will begin to let up a little in this book and you'll be surprised at some of the things she does. Now read it and you won't be disappointed at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent installment","review":"In his third year at Hogwarts, Harry and his friends have even harder classes to master, as well as worrying about the escape of Sirius Black from the Azkaban prison. Black was convicted of killing thirteen people with one curse and is supposedly You-Know-Who's main henchman. And he's on his way to Hogwarts! Continuing her breathtaking storytelling, Rowling gives readers an exciting mystery, as well as loads of thrills with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they take on not only the henchman who helped get Harry's parents killed, but also as they face off with the dreaded Professor Snape and the unlikeable Draco Malfoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan","review":"I find that the Harry Potter series is the greatest series of books written, since Nancy Drew, or The Vampire Chronicles.

It has so much in common with Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"This book was thoroughly enjoyable for all ages. I began to see many 10-12 year olds with their noses buried in all the Harry Potter books and was convinced to read the first one. I was promptly hooked and read the second one immediately. I couldn't wait for this one to come out and I was completely satisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"The series stays strong","review":"After reading (er, after my kids read) the first two Harry Potter books, we all anxiously waited for the third -- could it be as good as the others?I won't try to say which is better; they're all good, having different aspects to them. \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" has more suspense at the end -- my daughter's eyes got wider with each surprising revelation and twist, and it was impossible to put the book down during the last chapters.Highly recommended, and we're anxiously waiting for Harry Potter #4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book","review":"I just started reading these books and I really love them.

Looking forward to the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I read this book when I was 11 years old. I am now 22, and I still read this book regularly. I can safely say the harry potter series has changed me life. It is because of J.K ROWLING that I am now an author myself.Harry's world is unique.

In this story, the school finally gets a good Defense Against Dark Arts teacher. This book is filled with surprises. However, this time there is one suspect until the end. His name is Sirius Black. This book is filled with many surprises, but is scarier than the first two. (until near the end)In every book it seems like you learn more and more about the night Harry's parents were killed. In this book you get loads of information about that night. I can't wait for the fourth book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive book for all ages","review":"The Harry Potter books are bestsellers, and there is no confusion why they are. The plots are entertaining, the characters colorful and detailed, and the writing great. The third one is just as good as the previous two. I thought that the dementors were fascinating. The storyline as always was addictive; I finished the book in just a few days. The wait for this book was well worth it. I recommend that everyone read the entire Harry Potter series, even if you are not a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger Lickin good","review":"In South Africa, this book has been a phenomenal success.

Actually WANTS to read and told me his heart pounds with excitement to read them. I don't understand what all the hoopla is with people who don't want their children reading these books because of the witchcraft, etc. We are devout Christians and we feel our kids are grounded in their faith and know the difference between fantasy and reality. You can't shelter your children from everything. At least they are reading. People were upset with L. Frank Baum and the Wizard of Oz when it was first published for the same reasons. Lighten up and let your kids have some fun and fantasy in this otherwise crazy world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"A great book because of the way it captures your mind.

So I conclude that everyone who likes a good book should read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book(s) of the Decade","review":"I read about the hype and the hoopla and I thought, I hate kid lit. But I succumbed to the lure. The books were staring me in the face everywhere I went. Bookstores, grocery stores. I bought a paperback of the first book at the market. Drove home. Crawled into bed with a large glass of limeade and a pile of sugar cookies and began to read. With much cynicism, I might add.Sometime in the night I crept out of bed and ordered the rest of the books from Amazon. Ordered the first one in HARDCOVER. And the whole time I'm thinking, I don't think I can wait for the fourth one.Even people who HATE to read will love these books.

I adored it and so did everyone I know who read it. I love books(especially long ones)and I loved the length of this Harry Potter, even though I loved the other ones too.

Will this be the last Harry Potter Book? Read Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkeban to find out. I think this book is the best book of the three Harry Potter Books that have been written so far. This book has so many twist and turns, (the most I have ever read in a book), that it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I hope you enjoy this book just as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on going...","review":"There's not much I can say for this book that hasn't been said for this book or any of the others in this series. More of the wizarding world and Harry Potter's past is revealed with the introduction of the character Sirius Black, who is this book's antagonist - or apparently. This installation delivers a solid dose of action along with more trivia about the wizarding world and a few more tempting hints about Harry and Voldemort."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Harry Potter series is the best","review":"i think Harry Potter And the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best book i ever read.

I'm 13, and I love the books, but I don't think I would have understood them as well if I was only 9 or 10 years old. They're easy enough to read, and the vocabulary isn't to hard to understand, but the things these books try to teach (you know, values...) would have gone right past me if I was only, say, 11 years old. (Not that some younger kids wouldn't see the underlying meanings, but the majority wouldn't.)Anyway, this book was, I have to agree, one of the best in the series with the exception of maybe \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" or \\"The Goblet of Fire\\". But I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone under the age of 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite one!","review":"Hello! This is a great book! It's so cool!

It's also good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real wizard and witch thriller!","review":"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is so far the best in the series. Not only do Harry and his friends mature in their wizardry skills, they also handle some very difficult social situations, and exhibit their own growth throughout the book. J.K.

I truely did not want the story to end.It is a must read for adults as well as their children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first two...","review":"Each Harry Potter book keeps getting bigger and bigger, withthis one a whopping 435 pages! However, I found it a much better bookthan the first two, where he spent too much time being persecuted. However the same formula is here, with the denoument coming as the school year ends. And how could any responsible adult, witch or not, keep sending the child back to that abusive family? Yet this is the best of the three, with Harry and his friends standing up more for themselves and each other. I still detect the influence of Terry Pratchett, especially as represented by the \\"monster book\\" Hagrid sends Harry. Hmmmmm...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best So Far","review":"I need to preface this by saying I've not yet read Goblet of Fire. That aside, Prisoner of Azkaban was by far the best of the first three books. In my opinion the first two were pleasant little books but Chamber of Secrets was nearly a carbon-copy of the Philosopher's Stone and that took a little bit of the bloom off the rose. However, with the third entry in the series, Ms. Rowling tells a new story (not the same old 'oh-look-Voldemort-is-back type stuff) and really develops the characters for the first time. Harry, forced to deal with the reasons for his state in life, reacts as I imagine a real 13 year old would--angry and confused. Hermione is fleshed out and made to be a little deeper than the know-it-all she's been the whole series. Snape is a delicious villian and steals all the scenes he's in toward the end of the book.All in all, the best to date. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenceful fantasy book for ALL ages!","review":"Harry Potter strikes again in his 3rd year ofHogwarts.

It is astonishingly clever and inventive. I still marvel at the ending. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of The Series","review":"This book is definitely the best in the series. It is much better than book 4 which i would only give 4 stars. The characters are well developed throughout the book, and the story takes unexpected turns, and it is not as dark and depressing as book 4. You definitely want to set your standards for harry potter with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"10,000,000 stars","review":"This book is probaly the most thrilling out of the 3 books that J. K.

Rowling did a wonderful job writing this book, it is full of imagination and creativity. The Harry Potter books are the best books I have ever read but out of the three this one is my favorite!

A friend told me about these books. Now that I've read all three, I'm eagerly awaiting the next ones! They are quite enjoyable. I even cried at the end of this last one. Yes, there are some gross things in the book, so in my opinion, I wouldn't let anyone younger than 10 read it. If possible, I think a parent should take the time to read it with their kid(s)- more fun that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with each book","review":"This story continues to get better and better. I acutally find myself rooting for Harry to become victorious. You really like the good guys and really dislike to bad guys.

There is alot more action in this book than the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the best of the best. It's about a boy who finds out he's a wizard (in the first book) and goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This boy, Harry Potter, has two best friends named Ron and Hermoine. There is a convicted murderer on the loose and they're trying to get him. Harry lives with his terrible aunt and uncle who has to sign a form to go to a town called Hogsmeade but he blows up his aunt once removed instead.Ron's rat \\"Scabbers\\" turns out to be an anamagus (can change into an animal). He betrayed Harry's parents. Harry's 'defense against the dark arts' teacher was Harry's dad's best friend. So was the convicted murderer and scabbers. Harry's mom and dad were killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort (he who must not be named).I liked the book because it had adventure, imagination, and it was really 'coolio'. Your only hint as to how it ends is that Harry's laughing hysterically and that he got the form signed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Series Magical","review":"I think they have really changed the world and the world of imagination I read them with my daughter and she has all three of this magical series the Harry Potter series makes you feel like you have imagination again it is a moving fantasy good description fun for the whole family one of the best books I've ever read.Buy Harry Potter it will move you like it moved me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!","review":"I've read'm all that are out so far and this is still my favorite!Oh yeah, and I'm in my forties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a super book","review":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the best book I ever read, and I've read a lot of books. I highly recomend it.Harry is in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Sirius Black, a murderer, is on the loose. He's just escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and everyone thinks he wants to kill Harry. It's very mysterious and once you start reading it, you can't stop. A FANTASTIC story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter","review":"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of AzkabanBy J.K.

Harry has to deal with some pretty weird things.Harry must now face his fears of dementors with the help of Professor Lupin.I think Harry Potter has a stunning edge to pull your soul in and make you just WONDER.Harry and his friend Hermione must help save two lives.Can they fulfill the task?

But (this's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars) I enjoyed Book 1 the most so far.In Book 3 the action, which led to the main plot of the story started out much sooner than Book 2. The details seem to be a lot in this book that I got lost some time after putting it down for a day or two. Nevertheless, overall the author's imagination and creativity still abound...as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Even though this book is about witchcraft, I am a Christian that likes this series. I understand that witchcraft is no the proper way to live, that God is the only way. This book focuses on Harry Potter, a thirteen year old wizard who attends Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. It also focuses on Harry's best friends, Ron and Hermione. (Pronounced Her-my-en-ee)Great book for all ages. I've read this a lot of times and always find something I didn't notice the last time I read the book. I really love this book and the others in the series. Girls, Boys, women, men, people young and old alike should read this book. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of 4!!!","review":"Out of all of the Harry Potter books, this was my favorite book. I found the 4th book dark and sorta evil. but the 3rd was just right for me.

ROWLING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"It's been a very long time since I read a book series this satisfying. I'm not a child or teenager, but the stories captivated me.

But I advise you to read the two books that come before it. So if you like fantasy, mystery, and adventure, I recommend this book for you. But again I suggest you read the first two first. I think this book is one of the best I've ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Harry Potter Book 3","review":"I bought this book for my 8 year old daughter but I think I enjoyed it almost as much as she did.

Recommended for adults of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Delight","review":"I am well into adulthood and had not bought into all of the Harry Potter hype. I guess I believed the critics who said that these stories were not as good as their marketing. My mother gave me this audio book narrated by Jim Dale and just to give myself a break from public radio, I poped it in while cleaning one night. How shocked I was to find myself totally absorbed in the story. I began to think about the characters throughout the day and wondering what was going to happen next. I was especially impressed with the detail and intricacies of the ending. The suspense almost killed me and the conclusion of this book left me with a desire to read all of the books in the series immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXPECTO PATRONUM !","review":"IN this heart stomping avdnture book people might say that its not a christian book.

(sorry to repeat my self but this book basically just like the last ) once again Harry has mistaken the bad guy then get caught up in the moment and doesn't think about what is happening, so yes the portrayer of \\"evil\\" deeds is not in fact the actual portrayer i.e. Snape, Ginny, Black e.t.c."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","review":"Jim Dale has done an excellent job 'acting' out J.K.

I encourage you to read the book, and after you have completed the book, I encourage you go back and listen to the audio books."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAD ME ENTRANCED","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It has given me the inspiration to read books more often, due to it's entrancing plot. Also, I found it one of my favorites in the whole HARRY POTTER series because it was a change from the Harry vs. Voldemort, as the others did, and was interesting and unique. Also, it was full of suspense, twists and turns, and surprising secrets (read and find them out).This book's a classic--to be read by all. It has lovable characters and a thrilling storyline--it was GREAT!!!I was enthralled with this book, and would encourage kids and adults of all ages to read it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Dont Get It","review":"I get that it would be fun to be a wizard and have power over adults. I get that it would be fun to go away to boarding school where people try to kill you all of the time. But I get nothing beyond that point. These books are not fun, the writing is monotonous if not arduous and certainly painfully untalented. The stories are almost without plot and the only twist Rolling seems to be able to pen is- \\"whose the bad guy\\". Who cares! There is a bad guy, I get it, make something happen. These non-stories are so dry; all occurrences are situational and not plot driven, leaving virtually no storyline, no fiber. There is some flash in Goblet of Fire that is slightly more entertaining than previous Harry's, but also less enveloping. The deep and complicated story (giving nothing away) is as follows: Harry goes back to school, there's a contest, Harry meets the bad guy, NOTHING happens, Harry goes home. Deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"All these books are about witch craft.","review":"I cannot believe that Amazon would sell Mr. Potter's books. All his books are about witch craft and pull children into this cult deeper and deeper with each book.

At first reading of the Harry Potter books I was intrugied, but still couldn't quite understand the crazed obession I was witnessing around me. But that all changed the moment I open this book. I was gripped from the first mention of the elusive Sirius Black and rarley put it down from then on. This book was so much darker than the others...Harry's fLair for his childish misadventures were long gone, he was faced now with true danger, and the true darkness of the story began to set in.The characters gain much more depth, and new wonderful one are introduced. Sirius Black quickly become my favorite literary character of all time. Each time I read this book I am moved to chills and tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.K. Rowling is the Best","review":"I am a 4th grader with a passion for reading fiction since I was only 5 years old. When my dad bought me Rowling's books, I thought he must be kidding because the text were in large print which made me think that the books were only meant to be read by \\"kids.\\" But after reading all of them, I can say that they are the best out of the hundred or more books I have read in my lifetime. Sorry Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!","review":"I think that Harry Potter, not just the third book but all of them, are teriffic books! I read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in one day, but I think my parents missed me. I thought that the end was a bit confusing, but after I read it twice, it got clearer. Everyone should read Harry Potter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's something about Harry","review":"Each Harry Potter book seems better than the last. This one is my favorite. It contains lots of adventure, mischief, and surprise. Harry and his friends are growing up and must face problems that even the adults in their lives can't solve. Will Sirius Black kill Harry? Is this escaped convict what he seems to be? What about Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and even Ron's rat, Scabbers? Is the black dog that Harry spots everywhere really a death omen, as his fruity Divination teacher claims? Curiouser and curiouser. So far, the Harry Potter series is at the top of my favorite books list. Read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, you will positively love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is the Best","review":"All the Harry Potter books are good. I read all 3 and now when I read a book it seems so boring. My favorite parts are when the houses play Quidditch. I used to read it and I didn't want to stop. I stop at like 1:00 in the morning they're so good. I like reading a part when it's the same part as on the front. The back too. I think that if you haven't already than you should read any Harry Potter book. Not just this 3rd one. That's also a good thing, you can read anyone you want and J.K. Rowling will tell you everything that already happened so you don't get confused. I think you should read any Harry Potter book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far.......","review":"J.K. Rowling truly has a gift for story-telling as shown by her amazing tales of Harry Potter and his adventures through school. Reading the first three books made me feel like I was right there with him, watching on as he found out he was a famous wizard, as he battled giant spiders and an enormous snake, and as he found out the truth about Sirius Black. The release of the fourth book seems such a long way, that's how good the books are. Hermione and her perfectionism, Ron and his humor, and of course the irreplaceble Hagrid and Dumbledore. These characters will most likely become some of the most significant throughout all of literature. I would gladly and highly recommend them to anyone whether it be a 3rd-grader or a grandparent. I am positive that anyone will find these books to be of the best quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic?","review":"Yeah thats right. These books don't teach violence or killing they teach loyalty and friendship and where to place your heart. Give your kids the books they are such presise and good lititure it's a oppertunity not to miss. I asked my pastor and he says it is important to believe in magic. If we didn't have magic to brighten our days life would be a bore. It is not offensive to religions. Here are some exapamples: Hermione forgiving Ron Ron worring about Hermione getting better Harry paying for his teasing the Dursleys Sirius Black trying to prove himself innocent Hermione never missing an assingment These are just some examples to how the books teach good traits. Just look around at Halloween and see all the Hermiones telling people they should be more organized and themselfs trying always trying to get good grades to be more like her. DON'T BAND OR GET RID OF J.K. ROWLING'S WONDERFUL PIECE OF ART. As Albert Einstein said,\\"Imagination is more important than knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's simply amazing!","review":"How can you sum this wonderful book into such a small review?

Over all this seris shpuld be a classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for any age","review":"I found this book very intersting. Any age could read this book. Parents to younger kids and teenagers too. It does have some older subjects to be weary of for little kids though. The plot is so intergratly woven through the story you just can't put it down while your waiting for what is going to happen next. After a week of hard school work a light book like Harry Potter is just great. Read this book whatever age you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical Thriller to be enjoyed.","review":"Harry Potter enthralled me. Ms.Rowling is an imaginative author who has written fabulous books. I even tried to solve the mysteries,but my suspects were not the suspects in the book. I enjoyed all the Harry Potter stories with each as wonderful as the next. I hope in the fourth book Sirus Black writes to Harry, there are more mysteries to be solved and lots of adventures waiting for me to read and enjoy with a nice mug of steaming hot chocolate and one slice of toast with melted butter smothered on top."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second-best book of all time","review":"I love this book!I love the Harry Potter series, and of all of them, this is my favourite.I was so dissapointed by how short the movie was for this book because this movie is shorter than the previous one while the book was longer than the previous. This book rocks!The main characters in this book (in order from most to least important) are Harry, Hermionie, Ron, Proffesor Lupin (the new defence against the dark arts teacher), Proffesor Snape, Sirius Black (the former deadly prisoner of the wizard prison Azkaban), and (now Proffesor) Hagrid.If you liked the other Harry Potter books, espesially the Sorcerer's Stone, you will like this one.The Harry Potter series is great for anyone ages 8 to adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","review":"I think that the \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is one of her best books, because of the way she combines fantasy,suspence,and action.

There was a lot of backstory that you find in the book that is not in the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mystery of Harry Potter","review":"I think that this book is an exciting adventure that takes place at Hogwarts school of magic. Harry and his friends have many adventures in the story. To understand this book you must read the other 2 Harry Potter books. All the magical and mystical adventures Harry faces, he always knows he can count on his friends and if you read this book and find out just what his friends do for Harry you will almost definitly want friends like Harry's. You will enjoy every word of this book from the beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visualisation and Fantasy at its best","review":"My first visit into the world of Harry Potter, I was extremely impressed.The magical ride that J.K.

Highly recommended to all, especially the fantasy lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"I have recently begun the HP series, and the third installment was easily the very best!

This book was by far the best of the three. It kept me guessing what was going to happen to Harry, Ron and Hermione. The only problem is that I read it so fast and I finished it before I knew it. When is there going to be another book? I have never been so excited to read before.

Try Lloyd Alexander (Prydan Chronicals), Dianna Wynne Jones (Archer's Goon- highly recomended!), Susan Cooper, Madeline L'engle, or Philip Pullman, to name a few. These fantastic authors are sadly being overlooked in the Harry Potter madness! So while you're waiting for book #4, please check these other authors out. I guarantee you that if you like Harry Potter, you will at least like ONE of these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very imaginative... fast-paced... interesting... I liked it.","review":"I loved the entire Harry Potter series (or at least the three that are out). The Prisoner was the best, by far. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and, unlike many books, the character you suspect most is usually not the one that's to blame.

Hermione is the key!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Words- Suspenseful Story","review":"I loved this story, as I have loved the other two. This one has caught me by surprise many times and I love that in a story. When you find out about Hermione having so many classes you wonder how. I have tried to guess but I was wrong. When I found out about the hippogriff I thought Ron, Hermione, and Harry would be able to save the case and they ended up saving it in another way. When I found out about Harry's godfather I was shocked I love the way Rowling keeps you second-guessing and I hope she does that with the rest of the magical Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, EXCELLENT, AND ALL THOSE OTHER GOOD WORDS","review":"THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ !!!!!!!!

It has a complex plot and a darkness to it that I enjoyed. It is as if Rowling is letting the books become more adult as the characters in the book grow and as probably the readers also are maturing.It reminds me of the middle Star Wars movie - The Empire Strikes Back. There are some emotionally mature things that happen but I think that the payoff will be big in the future novels.I keep wondering if, in the end, will we discover that Mum and Dad Potter are possibly .... well, I'll keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Fast service, but the book is a little old...still enjoyed it tho and no pages missing!!

There is no computer game in the world as good as these books. If any kids are reading this review, I reccommend you get hold of 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' and the other books in the Narnia Chronicles, by C.S. Lewis. If you love Harry Potter, you'll love reading the adventures of Edmund, Peter, Susan and Lucy in Narnia. But I can't stop here any longer as reading all these positive reviews. (I am ignoring those ignorant people who had only negative comments to make about Harry as they have obviously missed the point.) I am going to get into my PJs, make a hot chocolate and consume a pack of TimTams (great Aussie choccie biccies) and re-read all my Harry Potters. Its about time. Its been 2 weeks since I read them the first time. I need a fix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for All Ages","review":"Anyone any age can enjoy this book. Well written.

A richly layered story that reveals more and more with every read."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!","review":"This was the best book I've ever read. It's probably the best of the Harry potter books that have come out. I finished this book in less than a day. I couldn't put it down! All my friends love it too. I loved everything about it. Ive read the 3 Harry Potter books at least 10 times each and I'm still not tired of them. They contain lots of fun and action, not to mention some suspense. I suggest that everybody should get the series. I can't wait till the 4th book comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT.","review":"It was came in earlier than expected and is in an acceptable condition. I'm collecting all Harry Potter series.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars from a seventeen-year-old reader","review":"I checked out the Harry Potter books out of curiosity when I heard that even adults were said to love them. I was hooked after the first one and the three Potter books have been the best, most relaxing, and fun reading I've done in a long time. If a high-schooler can appreciate Harry Potter, anyone can. I do think, however, that \\"magic\\" should be discussed with child readers so that they have a realistic perspective on the world around them. The occult scene in our world is nowhere near as benign as the environment at Hogwarts and children enamored with the magical realm in Harry Potter need to understand that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book review","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is a boring sequelof the Harry Potter series. There were a lot of mystery's that were all mostly at the end of the book, The story line also was not as good as i heard it was. I for one enjoyed the short read but it was not as exiting as the Harry Potter books before it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter never stop.","review":"Harry Potter is a great book because it makes people wonder. Is this really magic or a great authors mind? Harry Potter is an eagle who flys over the country. He never stops. Harry Potter is such a great book beacause it is like you are living inside Harry Potter. It is your world that see in his eyes. Harry Potter is good because people see the whole story. You know everything about Harry Potter's world. J.K. Rowling uses her words well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very good.","review":"I'm glad to read this book.I want to introduce it to all children online.I think this book is suit all younger"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my first HP book","review":"Frankly, before the age of nine, I really couldnt care less about this series. But my mom bought me a copy of this book, and eventually, driven by boredom, I read it. I LOVE this book and was a little upset when the movie came out, it being much less like the actual pages. This book is the pinacle of harry potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting mysteries","review":"Another exciting installment in the Potter series, Prisoner of Azkaban introduces us to the menacing Sirius Black, who has escaped and poses a threat to both Potter and the world at large. But there's a twist...Plus, Hermione has a secret...And the new Defense of the Dark Arts professor is hiding something...So many mysteries to unravel, which makes it hard to put this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably good!","review":"The internal continuity of the series impresses me in this, the third Harry Potter book. Characters and events that may have been mentioned in passing in earlier books take on new meaning, lending a new sense of depth to the work as a whole.Note to adults: don't presume that these are \\"children's books\\" in any way, except that children will enjoy them as much as older folk. The main characters may not even be teenagers yet, but that makes the story no less appealing.At age 42, I find these to be some of the most enjoyable fiction I've found in years. My tastes usually aren't picked up by the mainstream, but this is one best-selling series I'm happy to have discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Harry Potter book so far!","review":"I must say that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the first five Harry Potter books. Unlike the others, there aren't any Lord Voldemort battles, which gives it something different. I also greatly enjoyed the addition of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This book is very entertaining and will keep you absorbed until you finish the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just keeps getting better and better","review":"The Prisoner of Azkaban is the greatest and most suprising Harry Potter book so far! I couldn't put it down, i would stay up until 3 in the morning reading it. J.K. Rowling has really out-done herself with this shocking book! And when i say shocking i mean shocking. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is after Harry, but why? I don't want to say to much but this is the best in my opinion! I give it 5 stars, but it deserves 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite books!!","review":"Harry potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the best books I've read all my life. I'm really looking forward to reading more by J. K. Rowling. She's such a good writer, and wrties about exactly what I want to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought they couldn't get any better!","review":"When I read the first 2 Harry Potter books... WOW. But the third one just blows them away! It is amazing! I absolutely loved the first 2, and the third one has got to be at least 3 times better than the others. J.K. Rowlings continues to amaze me. As for the parents worried about the witchcraft scene: Don't. It's not dark magic, and it's not something that your kids will try out or anything- it's more of the practical kind of magic, i.e., herbology: take willow trees. You put two kinds of acid together, and what do you get? Salycilic Acid, which helps headaches- also known as aspirin. I strongly recommend you read these before banning them from your household."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK","review":"I loved it, and I love all of them but this one I got to meet a new character, sirius. I could actually see the characters and picture them in my head, its that good, kids and adults of all ages will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just get better and better!","review":"Well, I thought the other two Harry Potter books were fantastic, but Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was more than fantastic. It was spectacular! When I finally got to read the book, I was reading it at night, and I kept saying to myself, \\"just one more chapter, then sleep,\\" but I ended up finishing it that night, because I always wanted to find out what would happen in the next chapter, and if Sirius Black would catch Harry, and if they would win the Quidditch match. The Quidditch matches were exciting, because I really wanted Gryffindor to win. And it was driving me mad trying to work out how Hermione was getting to all her lessons. I can't wait to read the fourth book in the series. I wonder what's going to happen at Hogwarts in Harry's fourth year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to be read over and over again!","review":"Ever had the sort of book where you just can't seem to get to a good stopping place? Well, Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Askaban is one of them. Enlightning and imaginative, I couldn't put it down. Well woven into the tapestry of the story are the characters families and opinions. So if you havn't read it, this is just another missed oportunity to read something great! -L. Wilder"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the most fantisizing and fun book ever!","review":"I thought this was a completely inchanting book. Harry Potter books are incredible. I love the way J.K.

I would recomend this book to anyone who has ever been a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great parent/child reading!","review":"I started reading the Harry Potter books because my daughter was into the first book.. she tried to explain the plot and her excitement, however, I did not seem to be able to follow her.. I picked up the first book after she finished and read all three in one weekend! great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter at it's the Best!","review":"For a child, most books are very boring, but the Harry Potter books are definetly not! This, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, is my favorite, since you discover more about Harry's father's past and the death of Harry's parents. Harry's rivalry against Draco Malfoy is at it's height due to the planned beheading of the hippogrif, Buckbeak. Two of James's friends from hogwarts appear, including a \\"enemy\\" the man who caused his death Peter Pettigrew. This is definetly the best book I've ever read! Although I am at the borderline age to read this book (12) it stills thrills me every time I read it, along with my parents, teachers, and friends! I definetly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good book and very suspensful.","review":"I think that this book is the best one yet. The end is suspenful and great. Of course it's disapointing that ohh well you should read it. I had trouble getting to sleep it was so interesting. The moment I got it I just plooped down on the couch. It was surprising and J.K.Rowling did a very good job. I liked the first book, I loved the second book, and I loved this book to."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"It deserves 5 stars.

Definetly a five star book-maybe more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best children's books I've read since I was a kid!","review":"I'm a nineteen year old college student, and the only reason I read these books was because I worked in a bookstore. And now, I'm making all my friends read them, even though they think they're too old. Well NO ONE is too old to read these books. They are fabulous (and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word). I read the second and third in under a day each. I intend to give these to every child in my family from now on. I cannot say enough about these books. READ THEM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...better than the first two!!","review":"I admit, I'm 37 years old and I love these books. I don't have any children, but I bought all three books anyway. I do feel the third book in the series has a better plot line than the previous two. The first one set up the premise of the series and the second one was great, but the third one had an extra something. The author brings you up-to-date from the last two (incase you haven't read them) and the reader never feels lost. Bottom line...if you haven't read them do!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is the coolest wizard","review":"I have all the Harry Potter books and have read them all. I think this ones the best because it reflects on what really happened to Harry's family and their childood. It also has more of my favorite parts: Quidditch! My favorite sport in the world (or the wizard world)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE HARRY TO RULE THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OK, I won't tell the whole plot, but here goes. This dude name Sirius Black is a fugitive from Azkaban, a penn. He's Usama, Hitler, and Hussein rolled into one menace. He's after Harry. Dementor's are like FBI men that try to find SB. There's more twist than a screw.This is the most amazing book I've read. Details, plot, rivalry, and all around HARRY GALLORE! If you read one HP, read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three's the charm.","review":"These books keep getting better. Year 3 at Hogwarts is even more exciting than years one and two. If you are reading this review, hopefully you have read the first two books. If you have not yet read Harry Potter and are reluctant to do so, simply because the books are so popular, you are seriously missing out. Ms. Rowling knows what makes a child tick. She knows what kids are scared of. She knows what kids are fascinated by...magic, ghosts, monsters. She is a terrific writer. These books are remarkable for the simplicity of the prose. The adjectives and descriptions make the characters leap off the page. My son is three and I can not yet share these stories with him as he is too young. I am not at all surprised by how popular these stories are all over the world. They have a universal appeal. I will keep this short so that you can read the other thousand reviews. Enjoy. I highly recommend this book for both adults and children, provided that you have read the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just get better","review":"Harry Potter number 3 was fantastic - You'd think it was impossible to improve on the first two, but J K Rowling does, and how! Harry's adventures with his friends and enemies (indeed, it is difficult to seperate the two sometimes) just get more thrilling in each book and in each chapter. You'll love it, no matter what your age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written","review":"I can honestly say that this is my favorite Harry Potter book. It's also the longest.

The characters are so well developed and funny that i would find myself reading eighty pages at once, and i am at an age where most of my peers, including me, don't enjoy reading, but this book was simply AWESOME. I can't wait for the fourth book to come out either. I would say buy this book no matter if you do or don't like wizards. If i could give this book ten stars, I would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all ages...","review":"Congradulations to J.K. Rowling for creating such wonderful stories about a boy named Harry Potter going to wizarding school. I couldn't wait to sit down with my son and read it to him to find out what would happen next. I appreciated the more detailed plot and suspense of finding out what was happening and why. My son really liked a part at the end but I can't tell you what that is, so you'll need to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book 3","review":"Like the first two Harry Potter books this book is great, it is in this book that parents should beware; it starts to have a few more moments that might scare the younger reader, it takes on a darker side as Harry ages and Voldemort begins to gain his power back, Definately makes you want to continue to read the complete set, this is my second time thru the books and I never tire of reading them.

They are well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of All","review":"In my opinion, J.K. Rowling's third book was the best. If you read this book, you should expect the unexpected. [...]The book was interesting because of the realistic dialogue. For example, I thought it was real the way she describes when Hermione, Ron, Harry and Lupin are in the willow tree with Black.I liked the book Prisoner of Azkaban because of friendship and loyalty. Lupin knows that he's going to be in trouble because most people think that Black is bad, but Lupin will never doubt his friend no matter what. [...]In this book, you will learn about trust. Dumbledore covers up for Harry and Hermione when they go back in time. He trusts them to be back in time.So far, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best book J.K. Rowling has written. I think everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"I received the book which I ordered in near perfect shape.It was delivered in a very timely manner.

A compelling and entertaining story with fresh twists and turns. Really, though, the whole series is a single story, so It would be better to start at the beginning and read through to the end. It's clear, for the most part, that the bad guys are bad and the good guys are good, but Rowling does muddy the waters sometimes in a manipulative way. This applies to Snape, who seems to be a Slytherin baddie, but eventually turns out to be a self-sacrificing hero. It's ironic that fundamentalist Christian groups--not true Christians at all--have objected to the witchy trappings of the stories, considering that the whole story is a Christian allegory, with the Chosen One offering himself for sacrifice at the end and then is resurrected. It cannot be an accident that, in an age of declining readership, so many have read Rowling's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry potter And the prisioner of Azkaban","review":"Dragons,trolls,and flying brooms.This is what you'll encounterin Harry Potter And the prisioner of Azkaban.I personally enjoyedreading this book not just because it was a fantasy,but also becauseof it's constant plot twisting. If you think you know what willhappen next in this book,think again.This book is a cross between\\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Final Fantasy\\".It is like StarWars because ther are several role reversals,and it is like\\"Final Fantasy\\" because of it containing wizards,witches,andspells.

We are taken back into the mystical world of Harry Potter. This time around the plot is more intriguing, the characters more vibrant, and is even more enchanting than the first two novels. As always, there is magic at every turn, twists, turns, and plenty of adventure. This book is pivotal in setting the stage for the long anticipated fourth novel. We meet Sirius Black, a key character in years to come. As we do all this, we are enchanted and refuse to put the book down. This novel is the best in the series thus far. I reccomend this book for all ages, a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You've Liked the Others Then You've Got to Read This One!","review":"Boring, boring, boring, not! This book is crammed full of exiting little adventures (as the others have) and ends up with a twisted and suprising end (as the others have). But there's something this book has that the others don't, and you ask what, well there's new characters, new adventures and new obstacles of life for Harry to overcome. J.K. has amazed me with her skill to write. It's totally out of this world. Don't ask me where she comes up with these ideas but they are obviously good ones. All three of her books where and still are Best sellers some (maybe even all)of them for six months or more. Well I must be giving you a neck cramp, but to sum it up this book is exllent for everybody who can read.

Cracked the cover around 10pm and finished it about 5am...couldn't put it down!Read the second and third ones as soon as I could get them, pretty much same way, in one or two readings.

Harry Potter loves the wizarding school that he goes to called Hogwarts. The only thing is that every year something terrible happens. All the books are very exciting and enjoyable. Please read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Book","review":"This book is about Harry's third year in Hogwarts. The book is a continuation of the chamber of secrets. Others who read magical and fantasy, books will enjoy the series from the writer, J.K. Raweling. I would recommend this book to others who like fantasy, magic and advanture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prisoner of Azkaban review","review":"I love the book. The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is b/c the print in the book is huge. I didn't realize this is what I was getting at the time but I would have preferred slightly smaller print. It's great for younger kids though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic rendition","review":"I won't bother to get into the details of the story, as most know it by now. I have to say, though, that the audio books on CD have been fantastic. Jim Dale is a Grammy Award Winning narrator, and it shows in these recordings. He nails the accents, and has very crisp and distinct voices for each character. As soon as a new character begins to speak, it is easy to tell exactly who it is. The pacing is comfortable to listen to and the volume never rises to an uncomfortable level. A very well done rendition of the book. I leave it in my CD player in my car for when I take my daughters on any trip longer than 15-20 minutes, and they absolutely love it. My oldest, 4 years old, memorized the audio passages and is improving her reading by reading the same passages in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best potter","review":"I'm a big potter-head and this book, in my opinion, is the best of them all so far. Rowling really had a trning point in this novel and it is much more gown-up. You do not have to read the first two to understand this book and the plot is very quick. harry is being pursued by Sirius Black, the man responsible for his parent's deaths. harry must come to terms with his own anger and find out a lot about his father's past. The ending is really exciting and very well written. i don't waant to give away what happens but i was really surprised aboout all the twists and turns at the end. the book is anything but predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Framed!","review":"Nobody has ever known how exactly Harry's parents died in the hands of Voldemort. This book, however, gives us some insight about what happened on that fateful night. Sirius Black, a \\"murderer\\" who escaped from Azkaban, the wizarding prison, and was on the run. Rumours were flying around that Sirius was after Harry because he, who was Harry's parents' best friend, had betrayed them and given them away to Voldemort. What was the real truth behind it actually? The story has so many twists, including Ron finding out that his rat Scabbers isn't a rat! In fact, it was a man by the name of Peter Pettigrew, servant of the Dark Lord and was an animagi. What is an animagi? Read the book to find out. Sirius Black was one too and he was able to transform into a great black dog. Time-turners, Marauder's Map, Hippogriffs, Dementors and not to mention the fever-pitch excitment of the Quidditch Final at Hogwarts, this book is one that you will never forget and will never put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is A Very Good Book","review":"I thought this was a great book. It really cought my attention and I am not very interested in books. This is the best book I have read. The book never really loses you; it will get slow for a bit and then it starts right back with action. My favorite part of the book was the Quidich games-- they are always exciting. I would recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Door to Fantasy in Harry Potter","review":"When I first heard about Harry Potter, I thought it was some stupid book that the kids in school like. But when my friend convinced me to read it, I was hooked! The way Harry Potter, an average normal boy, finds out he belongs to a wizard family, and will attend Hogwarts, the school of Withcraft and Wizardry, is just so charming, I could not resist. This enchanting story is the most delightful tale I've ever read. It's like you're entering the door to fantasy aas you turn the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"With my very busy life and working three jobs I miss reading so very much.

I read the first Harry Potter book because I had heard so much about it. Now I am hooked on the series. The books have many layers and each one seems better and more complex than the previous one These books can be enjoyed at many levels so they are not just for the young. To really \\"get\\" the movies, it is necessary to read the book first too. I gave this book \\"only\\" four stars because I think book 4 will be even better.

I used to say that if I wanted to read childrens books I'd read Dr Seuss, never mind this Harry Potter crap, but boy was I wrong! Rowling is just, plain and simple, a great storyteller. An absolutely wonderful storyteller, in fact. If you can make it through the first three chapters of her first book, the Sorcerer's Stone, then you will be hooked, and that's the bottom line. Read them in order and don't start reading them if you're busy, bcos they are unputdownable. I have read the first three books, all in one sitting, more or less, and re-read the first two, again in a single sitting. These are now my all-time favorite books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cline's review","review":"I thought that this was one of the greatest books I ever read I thought it was neat how Harry got to use that one spell to stop the demons from coming after him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Allen's Project Review","review":"I think that this book is extremely exciting. The way theauthor writes is amazing. It's like a long drawn out dream in the eyesof the main character. She makes her point straight out, but a bitmisty so you dont exactly know what is going to happen next. I likethis type of story because it keeps you on the edge of your seat atall times. You can feel the thoughts of the main character, and theemotions like they are inside you. She makes you wonder what it wouldbe like in that situation. Its exciting how she changes from onesubject to the next in this particular book, but some how manages tokeep you right there with her the whole time... That is the kind ofthing that i like to see in a book like this. This author has alot ofmomentum and could come out with chart-topping novels time after tomei guarantee. This book is great .. i give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","review":"The book I read was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

At Hogwarts the kids have some interesting teachers.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is about a kid named Harry Potter going back to a magic school called Hogwarts for the third year. He has two best friends, Ron Weasely and Herminoe Granger. During the book a prisoner from Azkabannamed Serious Black escapes and is looking for Harry to kill him, but a few things get in the way.

He has the contract for the UK releases of the series, it seems.I have listened to Jim Dale's reading (he was the worst 'actor' in the Carry On films of the 60's and 70's) and can't disassociate him from the abysmal performances he gave in already badly acted films. His reading isn't much better and please forget that he has a British accent (the only valid reason for getting the gig) - It is forced, and he over-compensates for the lack of clarity in his 'luvvy', sometimes pompous, \\"I am an actor\\" drone.His HP version isn't a patch on Stephen Fry's. If you get the chance to buy the UK releases of the audio books, do so and avoid Mr Dale's weak and wimpy recordings.Such a shame that he landed the US contract, when we could have all enjoyed Stephen Fry's eloquence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is my ver favorite Potter book it's got a good lesson and something good finaly happens to Harry. I like it alot I think it is very well writen and like all the other books has a good moral to it. Some people are concerned about these books teaching there children that witchcraft is good, I personaly disagree with this I think the books all have a great moral to them and granted they are about magic but the good is clearly seperated from the bad and though there is some copying of homework and some sneaking out of school and bending of rules the copying is obviously wrong but it ads a touch or relisim to the story these are 13 year old kids so some of that will be going on and the sneaking out of school and bending of rules (though it might not seem like it at the time) is always done for the greater good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and friends return in the Prisoner of Azkaban","review":"We have met the characters and we have seen what they can do. Now it is time to test their limits, their emotions, their bravery. Who will they trust and why?

See if you can figure it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rohan Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","review":"The name of this book is called Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Its author is J.K. Rowling. This book is an action packed story about a boy named Harry who has to live with his nasty aunt, uncle and cousin. In the first book he realizes that he was a wizard. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry packs his suitcase and goes on a wild bus ride to what he calls his real home, Hogwarts; school of wizardry and Witchcraft. But challenges will await him there....... I like this book because it has good setting and character description. J.K. Rowling has written two books before this and two after this. I think this book is fiction because it's about wizards and witches. This book is great for children adults of all ages. So when you go to your library make sure to pick up Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was okay.","review":"ACTUALLY THIS BOOK WAS GREAT, I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR SO YOU WOULD READ IT. tHE PLOT WAS EXCELLANT, HOWEVER i WISH A CHARACTER LIKE pROFESSOR lUPIN OR sIRIUS bLACK REMAINED.

Unfortunately, he was not able to finish reading the third book after I read the chapter that dealt with reading tea leaves.

I have recently read other works of literature much better. Artemis Fowl is another fantasy book involving magic, but the story is far more captivating.

I just hate to say it to those people who critized Harry, but they're right. To anyone who knows anything about literature, the book is probably worth around 20 and 30 dollars.

Like the usual Superman movie, there is a heroine who loves Shenshaah not Vijay. And in the typical fashion as in SUperman movies, evil is finished at the end. Here the villain played by Amrish Puri is hanged inside the courtroom by Shenshaah. Shenshaah played by Amitabh Bachchan; this is one of his memorable roles ever.

Unfortunately, I was born after the major part of her film career was over, but I managed to get to know her through the late show on tv and her ill-fated tv series.Thankfully, John Oller managed to give Ms. Arthur's fans a view of the private woman that her movies absolutely never hinted at. He thoroughly researched his subject and gave us a glimpse of the lady that I had never been able to comprehend before.Without going into details (and ruining this book for you), I can only tell you that I picked it up and read the entire book cover to cover in a few hours.While Jean Arthur may have been the most famous \\"recluse\\" that Hollywood ever spawned since Greta Garbo, she was not reclusive at all in some ways. She needed her space and appeared to be comfortable with a certain level of anonymity in her later years. I think that element makes this an exceptional read because Jean Arthur had a lot of substance as a person as well as a strong sense of self-integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her screen persona and life did not match!","review":"She was a delight to watch in all her films, but it's sad to know life, on the whole, did not bring her the same pleasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sympathetic biography!!On Paperback!!!","review":"Asolution to the mystery is provided by...John Oller\\"s objective,well-documented study of Arthur.

The enigma of Jean Arthur -- why she retired at the height of her career during World War Two -- is answered, and the answer offers a fascinating character study of value not only to those of us who love Miss Arthur but to anyone interested in gifted people and in the struggle of a woman attempting to exercise power in the form of self-determination in a male-dominated world. The book also offers an excellent inside view of the film industry and the Broadway theater of the 1940s and 1950s."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Idolo de Mexico","review":"This Cd is great because it shows perfectly the spirit and the culture of Mexicans.

Pedro Infante was an actor too, and during his career he was recognized as one of the best in Mexico and he got great succes around the world. In his films Pedro sang several songs which some of them are included in this CD.

I needle-tat and was able to follow the patterns easily--not always the case with other pattern books. I'd recommend this to any current or would-be tatter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but not worth the price","review":"If you want a book filled with colorful pictures of tatting, you'll find them here. But, if you want patterns to tat all those pretty projects be ready for a surprise, because you won't find most of them. The first half of the book is filled with pictures of tatted projects, but no patterns to accompany them. The \\"New Twist\\" must be the use of obscure threads for most of the patterns given. Not only are these threads *not* readily available to tatters, there is no reference for conversion to the cotton or silk threads tatters usually use. Most of the patterns included are not especially unique, not enough to justify the relatively high cost of the book. Save your money, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential but no patterns","review":"I was so excited when my mom gave me this book for my birthday, but my excitement quickly gave way to disappointment when I realized that no patterns were given for the lovely items pictured in the first half of the book. The designs that do have patterns aren't all that different from those you could find in less expensive books. I'm also a bit intimidated by her use of unfamiliar threads as I don't know what size they are in order to make a substitution. I think the title \\"More than 100 Glorious Designs\\" is a misnomer since there are only about fifty actual patterns given. The one pattern I did attempt had such horribly written instructions that even with looking at the photo I had to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"fabulous fanfare and little else","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews.

I found was a book with a lot of nice pictures, but not much in the way of innovative design.

Who is going to tat a sweater for a teddy bear, or a lace cover for a vintage perfume bottle, or a little doll hat?

And it just doesn't work. Yes, the piano playing is \\"beautiful\\" but after about two minutes worth, you are wondering if the elevator doors will ever open because this is the kind of gooey, saccharine music that is played in elevators. The spinning chandeliers above, next to, and around the piano are an obvious (and weird) imitation of Liberace's famous soliltary candelabra. When this guy gets to Vegas like Liberace did and is making a million dollars a week like Liberace did and has a million fans like Liberace did, maybe I'll re-consider.

In others, Orwell's narrator is amazingly prescient on economic facts and class status for a contemporary reader.

The candor, the honesty, the confrontation of unpleasant facts dead on...all his signature traits are deployed. He develops such a rapport with the reader, a rapport that transcends time, place, etc., that one begins to think that Orwell is a dear old friend sitting next to you, and speaking in your ear.This portrait of suburban anomie predates the countless similarly themed, lesser works inflicted on the public by countless third-raters subsequent to World War II. Orwell is no third-rater...he clocked the mise-en-scene, and laid bare the ennui, meaninglessness, and alienation, with excellent prose, and beautiful metaphors.I don't think this book is as well-honed as Burmese Days, but it is a memorable achievement all the same. If you are a fan of Orwell's style, this will go down like fine wine...and the aftertaste will be pleasant and lingering"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orwell wrote more than 1984, Animal Farm and essays?","review":"Having reread 1984 (a great book), I decided to pick up one of Orwell's less famous works. Coming Up for Air takes place shortly before England enters WWII. The sense that another war is inevitable shapes the book. Basically, it is the story of a common man who has lived without real direction and returns to the town where he grew up as a child. We see -through him- a world changed for the worse by industry. It is not as impacting as 1984, but still a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Up for Air","review":"Great book! A must read! The ending is fantastic, Orwell really involves the reader with this one. Starts off a little slow. This book comes in waves.

It is the story of a man who first recounts his life before the war and then decides to take some sick leave and visit his old home. Most of the book seems to be devoted to fishing. It is sufficiently cynical but sometimes a plot is nice. Orwell should never use the Hemingway's style. Its not him.

From the opening song, Liquid, to the hidden track I was amazed. Jars play their own blend of christian acoustic rock/folk. The song that stands out above the rest is flood. But, there are many other excellent songs such as like a child, Liquid, Love song for a Savior, and my personal favorite Worlds Apart. Worlds Apart is a song about pride and how our human nature is so different from what God has planned for our lives. If you listen to CCM and don't own this CD I would reccomend that you make this the next cd you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This cd is awesome! Its much better the Much Afraid.

There is not much more to say than that.Unlike their later albums, this album is almost entirely accoustic. (There is one electric guitar on \\"He\\", but it's barely noticeable.) Also, unlike their later albums, this album stands as one complete work in and of itself. You won't want to listen to just one song, you will want to hear the whole thing, over and over again.

I love Much Afraid so I decided to finally buy this album. I personally only like the songs \\"Liquid\\" and \\"Flood\\" quite a bit, and then \\"Art in Me\\", \\"He\\" and \\"Blind\\" are ok. \\"Love Song for a Saviour\\" is too repitive, and the rest of the songs aren't that great.However, many people won't agree with me. To be honest, this album is too acoustic and folkish for me. Not being a fan of folk music, I don't like this album that much. I much prefer the more pop/rock flavour to Much Afraid and Jars of Clay's great new release, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\".If you love folk music or acoustic rock you should like this album. I must admit the instrumentation is really interesting, especially on \\"Boy on a String\\". This album is definitely unique; it's just not my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant music for all","review":"Thank's for putting gospel on track, it's a great - no, a fantastic album.

Before long I was singing to every word of the songs! I couldnt put the C.D down! The lyrics were awesome, and it talked about just what I needed to hear about: GOD! This c.d brought me closer to my parents, siblings, and God! Its the one C.D we ALL agree on! You'll Never regret buying this C.D!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God shaped these Jars.","review":"All four of the Jars were majors in music and in God, which turns their album into an awesome project!

It's been rising up on The Billboard charts as we speak.

My wife bought it for me when I was deployed to Bosnia. I used to listen to it on my portable CD player all the time. More recently, I have been listening to other bands, but I have not forgotten the album that started my quest for great Christian bands--Jars of Clay.Simply put, this album is great. The best songs are \\"Liquid\\", \\"Sinking\\", \\"Boy on a string\\", \\"Art in me\\", and \\"Flood\\". The songs fit very well together, and make for a great listen. I highly recommend this album for anyone looking for a great Christian band. Their songs reminds me of Toad the Wet Sprocket, so if you like that sort of sound you will definitely like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CD's","review":"I have only bought a CD or two each year for the past four or five years. Thankfully this was one of them. I listen to it all the time and have yet to tire of it. I will let you in on a secret.

I first heard Jars of Clay at their concert at DC/LA '97 I loved it! Then I borrowed it from a friend, that clinched it, I had to buy it. Now I have it and it's my favorite!The song \\"Blind\\" is my favorite even though it's short.

A much better album:The Eleventh Hour"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"First off, Flood is a killer song. That out of the way, the rest of the album is barely tolerable. The drum machines, redundant guitar strumming, and annoying samples make up an album that doesn't live up to its hype.

A year later when I heard it on mainstream radio, I knew I had to buy this album. Ugh..I'm sorry I did. \\"Flood\\" is the *only* reason to buy this album; the rest of the songs don't even measure up to it's greatness (in fact, they are quite boring.) So, if you really love the song \\"Flood\\", get this CD. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this CD, and now that I have it I have to say that I was really disappointed.

Sorry JOC fans! Had to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is One Of The Worst Albums Ever Made","review":"This has to be one of the worst albums ever unleashed on the public. Mostly a bunch of extremely poorly written psuedo-songs. The radio song \\"Flood\\"is the only listenable song on the CD and I suspect they had help from someone in the writing dept. on that one. After foolishly purchasing this album for $17.00, I turned around and sold it to a pawn shop for 2 bucks. I felt kind of guilty ripping off the pawn shop for 2 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Song for a Savior","review":"I know this might sound trite, but this is the best cd ever! With the intense musical talent, inspirational lyrics, and original melodies this cd has become my favorite. I especially love the song LOVE SONG FOR A SAVIOR. The sweetly haunting words of this song are amazing! Dan Hasletine's awesome voice also enhances this startling wonderful first cd.

Dierdre is beautiful, despite having what Regency fashionables would call unfortunate red hair, and has been coddled by her oldest sister Minerva into believing that she is the smart one of the family. Lo and behold, her meddling fox-hunting father arranges a match with the seemingly vacuous Lord Harry, whose fortune would solve the Armitage family's sudden financial woes. Lord Harry, however, is far more than he seems as he woos Dierdre and handily rescues her from the hands of Guy Wentwater (seen in the previous two books in the series).Chesney weaves her usual tapestry of comic characters, sweet romance and Regency lore into a fine read that never takes itself too seriously. Great fun to follow the ups and downs of the Armitage girls as they chart the sometimes choppy waters of London society."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think Deirdre to be the Most Humorous of the Six Sisters","review":"Luckily I began M.C. Beatons' Six Sisters series at the beginning, with sister number 1, Minerva. Reading Deirdre's story, the third sister of the series, was, in fact, a pleasant and very humorous read. Having read all six books in the series, I think \\"Deirdre and Desire\\" was the most funny, due to the other interesting characters introduced in the book.Deirdre, like her older sisters is flawed. Amazingly, having a reverend for a father, Reverend Armitage (whose character appears in all of the sister's stories) has no bearing on the sisters' flaws. They don't necessarily learn from each other and all go down the same rocky path to HEA.All in all, Deirdre's story was one of the most memorable of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too drawn out","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read, and it will be the last, regardless of the other reviewer's comments. Reading this book was a total waste of time. Indeed, toward the end of the book, I just simply quit. I agree with another reviewer. I didn't care about any of the characters enough to finish this this long winded tome. I continued to read the book in hopes that I would eventually become interested or caught up in the story, but it never happened, and in fact, the story and characters just became more annoying and aggravating with every page.There are so many other great books out there that a reader does not have to waste days on end reading this book that doesn't provide any excitement or suspense to hook the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous waste of time","review":"I have read many books by Penny Vincenzi and have never been disappointed until I read this one.

I highly recommend his books and stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"great songs, poor recording","review":"This would have been a great show to have witnessed. Very few live recordings have the quality of sound that we are so accustomed to these days and this is no exception.

That is what I am purchasing next and advising whoever reads this to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kennedy Book Ever Written","review":"Chris Lawford's book is the first book about this legendary American family from the inside. The Lawford family was unique in that it straddled both Hollywood and Washington. It's a fascinating read well told. I highly recommend it. Lawford's American Dream turned American Nightmare is gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searing Autobiography","review":"This is a most unsettling book! While it is extremely well written(a total surprise), the tale it tells left this reader unable to decide whether she was glad she had read it, or wishing she had never bought it. I am not a fan of the self-annointed \\"royal\\" Kennedy clan. I have always thought them to be over-indulged, self-important and self-promoting with much of the media and country buying into their fantasy. This book peels away much of this facade, some of done unintentionally, I think. Christopher Lawford was born to two people with appalling parenting skills......not an uncommon Kennedy family occurrence. With the sad lack of a decent role model, it is a wonder that he was ever able to pull himself out of the downward spiral of drugs and alcohol. After all is said and done, I wonder if he will ever truly get over being a \\"second string\\" Kennedy, though? Just his admission that he still emphasizes his connection to the family, when meeting people, makes me doubtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moved by your work","review":"I haven't been unable to put down your book, \\"Symptoms of Withdrawal.\\" Actually I have been mesmorized by the writingand not sure why, but it is probably the combination of honesty, identification and a glimpse into (the different, but the same)path you travelled.I have always felt honesty brings healing to everyone exposed to it and is sorely needed in our world today. I believe your bookaccomplishes this. You do have something special as a writer and may have stumbled onto your greater purpose.In any case, I had also tried some writing after 25 years of sobriety and it paled in comparison; so I can appreciate a gift like this. Sorry for rambling like this but I was so moved by your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"I just finished \\"Symptoms of Withdrawal\\" today. For lack of a better word, it was riveting! Mr. Lawford, your writing style is terrific. You manage to be self-deprecating, insightful, humorous, sympathetic and above all interesting. I never thought about the burden of a person who appeared to \\"have it all.\\" You showed an amazing amount of courage to \\"put yourself out there' the way you did, especially since many of your relatives who are still living were not always portrayed in the most flattering light. Again, kudos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When all is said and done","review":"what we are left with is another middle-aged male who had to leave his wife (who stayed through all the s**t)and children in order to \\"find himself\\". Not suprisingly in the arms of a YOUNG blonde \\"angel\\". Kudos to him for getting sober--a rasberry to him for what he has done with his soberity and to the immediate family who loved him through to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some later thoughts","review":"It has taken me some time to express my thougths about this astonishing book....primariliy because the author's candor is really extraordinary given that there really was no compelling reason for the him to do so(unless one includes, of course his own salvation). I think, this is \\"community service\\" of the highest order - the willingness to share his personal experience is a real gift to the reader , especially one who may share the same disease without knowing that there is hope..."},{"rating":"1","title":"He must have needed some $$$$","review":"For someone with a law degree, he makes a lot of grammatical errors. He didn't seem to learn for a LONG time that addiction isn't a healthy lifestyle. Some of the things he writes about his relationships with dead cousins don't quite ring true. I wonder if he feels OK about being one more person cashing in on the Kennedy name? I quit reading when he wrote that the Kennedy memories were over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symptoms of rambling on","review":"Mr. Lawford had an opportunity to explain causes, consequences and recovery from addiction in a more concise and clearer way. He left holes in parts of his stories and left this reader wondering if he wrote a book just to make money after having squandered his inheritance on drugs, partying and because he could. This book had so many chapters because he repeated himself over and over again, with many times not making a clear point. Very disappointed !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of Camelost","review":"Lawford, a Kennedy who never got much notice outside the family, wrote a brutally honest memoir here of his drug and booze addictions. The writing is absolutely first rate, and a rarity in its candor about the Kennedys from the insider view. The style is funny, and you'll be chuckling as well as sympathizing, even though Lawford managed to blow more chances that most of us will ever get. He's still narcissistic 20 years into his recovery, and that's unsurprising since, as he notes more than once, sober addicts are still the same people, just sober. The memoir is best on the early years growing up as the son of JFK's sister, Pat, and the actor Peter Lawford. One wonders how this all went over with the Kennedys when published? Though it's gentle, they can't have been too pleased. And that means good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent personal memoir.","review":"A well-written account of how the author has found his own way in life. That of course is the only real success for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candid, profane, funny and moving","review":"Yes, Christopher Kennedy Lawford was born with many, many advantages. And, as he admits more than once in this book, he managed to squander almost all of them, reinforcing the point that addiction is a great equalizer. This is a memoir filled with regret and loving acceptance. The generosity with which he addresses his cousin David, his mother and his father is touching. The unblinking honesty with which he addresses his own shortcomings is important, as well, because it illustrates how we can't overcome problems we won't admit we have. This daring portrayal of his own descent and rebirth rang true to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"WOW! Wonderful book. I'm a 39 yr. old woman from Chicago. I've had a \\"Kennedy thing\\" for many years - reading (seriously) about a 100 books & own an extensive Kennedy library (I do read lots of other things too!!) I also became addicted to pain killers after an illness. Chris, your book is so profound, poignant, and wonderfully written! I laughed so many times! By far, best Kennedy book I've read (my other faves: Lawrence Leamer's books, Dark Side of Camelot & Sins of the Father). And....you are adorably gorgeous! Thank you for such a beautiful, honest, eye-opening account of the reality behind being a \\"Kennedy\\". I can see why this book has received four stars in several reviews. By the way, I'm trying to get off my last bit of Suboxone....can't wait to be totally free of this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still waiting for the enlightenment","review":"I agree with much in the reviews that I just read, however, the lack of index with the comment on why no index proves that Chris Lawford has a long way to go to get to be the individual he claims he so wants to be. It was a power play on those Kennedys he envys so much. I found the book well worth reading because I have read so much about the Kennedy family, and was intrigued by Peter Lawford as well, but was disappointed that he does not seem at peace...which I was anticipating. He is more worried about us thinking he is a good father than his children needing what a good father provides, stability, being there day to day, and giving up a bit of himself for the sake of his children. He seems to have fame as a goal, which does not work. Fame comes from a passion for something which is executed without regard to what others compare. I wish him well. My dad was an alcoholic,too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Luck! Great read.","review":"I have to admit I bought the book because Kennedy was on the cover. But I kept reading because it was honest, down to earth and at some points down right funny. That is not to minimize the pain Mr. Lawford suffered growing up. Just a tribute to his writing ability. I am empowered by this book and even though I am star struck, I feel better having read. Best of luck in his continued recovery.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unedited Manuscript Sees Print!","review":"Unfortunately I have become used to typos in books. Although this was a rare occurrence 20 years ago almost every new book has a few. But this Lawford book has at least one error per page. Not just spelling, grammatical, and continuity errors but also chronological, factual, and historical. Chris goes to a jewelry store to buy a \\"bobble.\\" Do you think he meant bauble? He mentions a cat with a \\"gastronomical\\" disorder when he clearly means gastrointestinal. Was there any editing done at all? Or did the publishers just rush to print with yet another Kennedy book? And there were way too many glimpses of Jackie in the bathroom. Chris, please show some restraint and have some respect for the dead. The addiction/\\"recovery\\" story is old news but having a few Kennedy connections will always sell a book, no matter how badly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacing One Addiction With Another","review":"What's amazing to me most about this book is that Chris Lawford seems merely to have transferred his intense need to blot out the \\"pain\\" of his existence from using drugs to \\"using\\" drugs. After any number of failed careers and relationships, now he's decided that saving others from addiction is his new meal ticket...oh, excuse me...calling in life. What rings out loud and clear in his writing, however, is that Lawford is still the same, shallow narcissist he's always been, and that even in his 50s, he seems to be immune to any of life's lessons. Lucky for him the Kennedy family coffers are always there to pick up the pieces.Aside from that, the book is poorly written and edited. I can't imagine Norman Mailer's reasons for claiming that Lawford was a good writer, but it must have been payback for something, because he's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on so many levels","review":"Christopher Lawford has written a wonderful book, real and honest and compelling. He has a great story to tell and tells it well. Above and beyond that, his journey is an inspiration. I hope to read many more books from him in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symptoms of Withdrawal","review":"Fascinating. Amazing how someone bestowed with such gifts can become so embroiled in addiction. It demonstrates the power of substances entwined with a susceptible personality. We as a nation need to seriously examine how to deal with this scourge as the social and financial ramifications are dire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"This book was very entertaining and although I am a Republican, really liked the Kennedys more after reading the book. He was very appreciative of the Kennedy uncles and how they tried to do the right thing and keep family together. He was also very funny and likable. Not narcissistic at all. Realistic about his addictions and his own failings. Would like to read his other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shades of a poet","review":"Mr. Lawford has written his story with such humor, grace, and feeling, that I didn't want it to end.Definitely worth a read and much better than I could have predicted due to the poetic grace in which Mr. Lawford pours out his soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging reading","review":"Christopher Lawford demonstrates a great memory of a lot of family history - both Kennedy and Lawford which is most interesting. The reader feels privileged to some insider information but not to the point where you feel the Author is gossiping for profit. The photos shared in the book are enjoyable as they are most likely from a personal collection and often candid showing the \\"fun.\\" Chris seems to relay in his writings how somehow he always felt like an outsider and makes you feel that somehow because of this bit of distance from the \\"family\\" it may be a small part of what helped save him from his addictions. He's a very strong person and has so much life ahead of him. Through reading his book, I will most certainly follow the rest of his career with interest and a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris, you are correct!!!!","review":"Chris,you are correct!!! You will always be second string within the Kennedy clan and as a person. I do not see you as a good father, person or writer. I feel sad for your family. Enough said, I have wasted enough of my time on this foolish narsictic book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Grace","review":"The reader wades through 7/8ths of the book in muck and disgust hopeful that the end results in a cleansing shared with the author, some kind of insight and wisdom that makes the read worthwhile. But all we get is cheap grace spewed at the bile we are left standing in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symptoms of Withdrawl","review":"This was a book that was better not written, or at least not published. As Woody Allen once coined a phrase, the book is, \\"a miasma of asinine cliches unrivaled in Western Literature.\\" Why should any self-respecting individual want to read yet another paltry story of excusess as to why a drug addict became a drug addict ( and who seems to have a somewhat sardonic pride in his past addiction.)Being a Kennedy is not worth a plug nickle--and as this Kennedy shows--it sure dosen't make you smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"lookout Oprahs bookclub!!","review":"if oprah doesnt review this book then shes just mad.

I make my living through irrigated agriculture, and so am intimately involved in the myriad of issues surrounding the survival of these incredible creatures. Dr. Montgomery's book is a good introduction to basic salmonid biology (a topic most of the public, including \\"activists\\" are shockingly ignorant of), is blessedly free from jargon and acronyms, and recounts the sad history of our interactions with this fish without didactic and self-righteous screaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salmon","review":"Great book to learn about world-wide history and the salmon's demise repeated over and over country to country.

The pictue quality is below the standard of VHS (perhaps a PAL conversion?)and the sound has been mixed so poorly that you often can't hear what's being said due to the overbearing effects track. If you can manage to look past this butchering, you may be able to appreciate this great example of '70's Australian culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic movie, crummy DVD","review":"This is a 5 star movie with 1 star disc quality. The audio is so poor that I would not recommend its purchase to others. I can't even share this movie with friends, as they won't be able to understand the dialogue - it's only because I know most of the dialogue already that I can stand watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My only disappointment from Amazon!","review":".This is a GREAT movie!This DVD is a LOUSY copy, with a difficult to hear vocal soundtrack, mostly drowned out by the music and FX.After I advised them of my disappointment, the nice people at Amazon sent me a replacement copy, but that was just as bad as the first one.I have copies of this movie going back over 25 years on various video (tape) formats, so I know what the David Williamson dialogue should sound like.A wonderful piece of late 1960's Australiana, which unfortunately is spoilt.For my money, try and get yourself one of the VHS versions, as this one is not worth the plastic it is burned into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party time - so put on the boxing gloves","review":"Don (Jon Hargreaves) and his wife host a party with friends to watch election returns (in Australia), only this party is more like a fierce battle in a hellish war than a pleasant time spent with friends. Everyone is on the make and most of the party-goers are boorish and nasty. It's reminiscent of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF in this regard, though it's greatly magnified in the nastiness department. The acting is excellent with good character analyses, but these people are so cruel to each other that watching them becomes almost unbearable. Why would anyone stay at such a party?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don's Party - Poor sound","review":"For an iconic Australian movie, this is the worst soundtrack possible.

This is a huge book, and I almost didn't bother to pick it up at the bookstore because I figured a book this big must be $20 or more. But it is only *half* that, less than $10, which is nearly unheard of for modern kids' picture books. Buy it because it is a fantastic book that will fascinate you and your kids alike, and appreciate that it is a steal at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy two of them.","review":"The previous reviews say it all. This book is so engaging that my kindergarten-age son and I both love it. The illustrations are mind-blowing, when you hold them right up to your face and see how a T-Rex could chomp off your head with just a nibble. Other books don't do justice, even when they have the drawing of a human standing next to the dinosaur.At our school's Scholastic Book Faire, we bought the Life-Size Sharks book for my son, and we bought this Life-Size Dinosaurs book as a gift for his class. When we got it home, he loved it so much that he insisted on keeping both books.Now we have to get another one, so we can make good on our gift to the class. If you have a school-age kid, save yourself some trouble and just buy two copies. The price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item was great...for about 5 hours","review":"I purchased this MP3 player as a replacement for another that malfunctioned.

Although this is far more mellow and laid-back than just about all of Kelly's other albums, the consistant quality of the songs make this a treat to the ears.Kelly has said that it was around this time that he discovered God. God really must have inspired him, as it is far greater than his previous work (although 12 Play is a classic).Just about the best ballad Kelly ever wrote (\\"I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) is probably the best song on the album, followed closely by the mid tempo \\"Thank God It's Friday\\". The multi-octave style of Marvin Gaye can be seen used here.

Go right now to your cd seller and buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon Posford has gone 8 clouds beyond this","review":"Perhaps this might have been considered good when it came out, and when most of these reviews were written, about 11 years ago. However, this is nothing compared to the later work of Simon Posford (the force behind Hallucinogen, Younger Brother, and Shpongle). This one and \\"The Lone Deranger\\" are quite repetitive... one dance beat repeats all the way through most of the songs. Simon is just getting the knack of his synthesizers on these early works. I only kept one song from these 2 albums on my music player... and even it isn't a standout. \\"In Dub\\" by Hallucinogen, on the other hand, is much much better, as it was produced years later, and is slower paced, trippier dub. In fact, \\"In Dub\\" ranks very high on Simon's discography imo. Afficionados of Simon's later work can forget about the two sophomoric Hallucinogens."},{"rating":"1","title":"R rated, profanity. Negative attitude. Not a good trip.","review":"\\"I'm on f---ing fire\\" is repeated loudly on the 5th track, impossible to ignore. This cd has a fry mentality, for example, sinister laughter when a daytripper attitude was possible. This is not a joyful piece. Those desiring peace of mind or relaxation should look elsewhere. Perhaps good for a rave, but the profanity renders this unsuitable for background music in the family den or dentist office. Eliminate the vocals altogether and this would be outstanding Trance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody say Yes Yes I say No No","review":"Probably a lot of Hallucinogen fans doing reviews here...It is not bad not at all but i dont think this record has IT.

Great band, and refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm... not so sure about this one","review":"To be honest, I used probably less than half this book. I read through the verbal sections and those were ok. I skipped much of the math tutorials because I use math all the time in school. But when I got to scale reading, 3 out of 10 of the samples questions had incorrect answers. That was a shocker to me. How do book editors let 3 errors go unnoticed. Following that, in the mechanical section, there's a statement about how you compare viscosities of liquids.\\"engine oil has a high viscosity because it flows easily while molasses has a low viscosity because it flows quite slowly.\\"For those of us who've had a decent amount of exposure to either math, science, or mechanics, we would know this is a complete fallacy. The typist probably got \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" mixed up late at night while drinking liters of coffee. But this does a huge disservice to anyone who isn't too familiar with these things.I give this book 2 stars based on the absurdity of the errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly edited","review":"This book has a ton of typographical errors. This book and the Arco book appear to be the only 2 books available as study guides for the AFOQT. After buying and studying from both books, I am not surprised the Air Force recommends studying from other guides like SAT, ACT, GRE, etc. The explanations are poor also. I've been studying from these books and bought other guides and have basically been using the other guides to find explanations for similar questions that I do not understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not rely on this book!","review":"This book is full of typographical errors and wrong equations in the math section.

I took the ASTB and used this book only for the practice tests. It created a ton of extra stress because I was convinced I was going to fail the mechanical comprehension section after taking the practice tests in this book. I am an Aerospace Engineer by profession and could answer most of the questions, but only with a physics book at my side and a graphic calculator. Absolutely terrible test prep book and it didn't even have any spatial appreciation prep material. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this book for ASTB and was sorely disappointed. It was like someone told them the general areas the ASTB covered and they made up their own questions. It wants you to learn things that will never show up on the ASTB and then proceeds to not even mention large sections of the ASTB like the spatial reasoning portion or the Aviation and Nautical Information portion. Even ignoring these elements, the fact that the book has numerous errors made me throw mine away in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprepared","review":"I'm not a rocket scientist but I'm not an idiot either.

Khanna is solid, and Chopra very effectively underplays his bad guy. He's quite convincing as a dude who believes in \\"breaking rocks with glass.\\" Kolhapure, a young teenager when the film was made, gives a highly charismatic performance that makes me want to see a lot more of her work. I wish her character had a little feistiness, though that would have made for a different story -- yeah, the one _I'd_ have written. (Note that the IMDb credits, and ergo the synopsis given here, erroneously reverse the roles played by Munim and Kolhapure in the film.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth And Relaxing","review":"The sounds of Grover Washington's saxaphone are indeed very soothing. The special effects from the synthesizers and the precussion merely add to the songs rather than over color them as other artists sometimes do. The themes on each of the songs are quite memorable. Caught A Touch Of Your Love is probably the most memorable piece on this collection as BB King delivers some fine vocals and guitar licks in between Grover's tender saxophone sounds. The Look Of Love, Monte Carlo Nights, and The Title Track also are very memorable mostly due to the balance between the instruments. The bass lines on Monte Carlo Nights are just pulsating. Anyway, its hard to beleive that I am the first one reviewing this recording because this collection defintiely needs to be bought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real smooth, gentle and relaxed","review":"Like to say this I'm the 2nd reviewer who's reviewing this album peers to be a rating classic.

King, Richard Tee, just to name a few others I can't name.Well first of all, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic like the first 3 albums, but still a worthwhile listen","review":"The only reason why people bash this album is because it followed PEOPLE'S INSTICTIVE TRAVELS..., THE LOW END THEORY, and MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS. Yes, I do not think that this album is quite on the level with the first three, to say that Tribe fell off is ridiculous. There were definitely some banging tracks on this album. And Consequence is a nice addition to the album. My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Jam\\", \\"The Pressure\\", \\"1nce Again\\" and \\"Stressed Out\\". If people would judge this album on its own merit, rather than compare it to past classics, this album would be seen as a great album in its own right.

This album is the beginning of the end. I still (after four years of the album existence) can't figure out one of the most exceptional rap groups of the New School fell off as hard as they did. This album completely embraces and cherishes the worst cliches of hip hop. \\"Stressed Out\\" has maybe the worst R and B choruses in the history of Hip Hop.I think that the individual members are still trying to recover from the blow of this album.

Tribe is one of the greatest hip hop groups ever(next to Wu Tang Clan)and I can honestly say that what makes this group so special is how they connect, Phife and Q Tip blend so freaking good together especially with Muhammads amazing yet very kick back beats. Why is this getting less then 5 stars or more I really dont know, all I know is that this is an incredible hip hop album with some really kick ass songs. Is it \\"Midnight Mauraders\\"? Nah, is it \\"The Low End Theory\\"?...Nope but is it still an amazing hip hop album....hell yes.. It even has one of my favorite Tribe Songs ever \\"The Hop\\"...god I love the chorus to that song..Well anyways COP THIS album!

Don't believe all the hip-hop historians that are dismissive of this record. I've always felt that Tribe had 4 classic albums: People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, The Low End Theory, Midnight Marauders AND Beats, Rhymes and Life. I always hated \\"Stressed Out\\". Besides that this joint is CORRECT. Critics often try to front like this album has little redeeming value. \\"The Hop\\"? \\"Wordplay\\"? These tracks are ILL.

I'm heavy metal, punk rock to the bone. When I heard this album back in '96 it only took one listen to get me hooked on it. These guys are just unreal, they have some off the best beats, lyrics, and vocals I've ever heard when it comes to rap music, and I've heard plenty of other artists in this genre. I like the way they combine emotion with pure, raw talent. To sum this up, this is an esential cd for anyone's music collection, no matter what style of music you're into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic UGK","review":"This album in my opinion is a definate classic. Alot of rappers today that are from the South really got influenced by this one.

This is such an amazing album, from top to bottom... not a single mediocre track on it. It's a damn shame not very many people know about UGK outside of TX, but I have a feeling all that's gonna change in the near future. This album was put out 7 years ago, and it's still 100 times better than a lot of the whack stuff being passed off as rap these days. Seriously, it's almost excruciating to listen to 99.9% of hip-hop put out 7 years ago these days, but not this one.... just buy the cd and you'll see.

ONE DAY and PINKY RING ARE THE TOP 2 SONGS although every other song is just as good. I like the way they use live instruments with droppin bass and super crisp lyrics. UGK has been on several No Limit releases and No Limit should be honored to have them. I am lookin straight forward to DIRTY MONEY it was supposed to release back in April but it was pushed back until today 10-26-99 Pick it up I am sure it will be TIGHT but I dont think anything can outdo RIDIN DIRTY.

Through all of the flights it flew with me. If you cant feel this CD ridin in the night around 3 in the mornin I can't help you. This CD sets the mood for any on road situation.

The best songs are \\"One Day,\\" \\"Murder,\\" \\"Pinky Ring,\\" \\"Diamonds & Wood,\\" and my personal favorite along with track 5 is \\"Hi-Life\\" because that song is so real. These are no sugarcoated, powder puff rappers that you hear on the radio. UGK is too real. Get UGK's entire collection because they never put out a wack album.

I agree with all the other reviews on here... if you are a death metal fan, it is mandatory that it be in your collection.

Songs 1-4 just KILL, & the brutality doesnt end there! It all ends with \\"Reduced to Ashes,\\" which starts out kinda slow and then suddenly gets fast again! I LOVE it! Listening to this CD is like getting a brutal beating... great stuff here! I'd say get this CD or that re-release double pack \\"2 From the Vault\\" which has this album & \\"Testomony\\" with it.

I was greatly disappointed in the product. In general, the design is fine. However, the 1/4 - 20 threaded stud was so poorly cut and chrome plated that it wouldn't even screw into the mounting hole on my binoculars. I ended up having to recut the thread on the stud with a 1/4 - 28 die. It works fine now but why should anyone have to do that.

It fits and works for me or you can say that it does its job (as compared to some reviwers those who have complained for certain things). I am using on bushnell binoculars so have no issue of compatability.One thing that I noticed is that as this adapter holds the heavy binocular from the center so the two sides tend to swing on either side while viewing (like a see saw) and the adapter screw get loose from the binocular and as my kids were using they dropped the binocular but luckily it did not break. Otherwise without a tripod it is difficult to view clearly using heavy binoculars because of slight shake/movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the product details??","review":"Why is there a generic product description?

Nobody knows anything beyond \\"Your Love\\". If people were only exposed to the rest of their stuff, there'd be a heck of a lot more hardcore Outfield fans. But that's besides the point. The point is, this is a very good album of unreleased tunes post \\"Rockeye\\", worth having for anyone who loves the Outfield. There is another brand new album out called \\"Any Time Now\\" and it's available through CDbaby, it sounds a lot like \\"Extra Innings\\", there's a new version of \\"Heaven's Little Angel\\" and some other songs which are also pretty good.

Even the parents can enjoy this cd, smiling at the ballads and snapping their fingers during the uptempos to embarrass their kids.I strongly recommend this cd to you. More than likely, you'll enjoy it as much as so many other people do. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of my most favorite CDs!","review":"I Like them a lot! My Favorite song would have to be \\"As Long as You Love Me\\". They have sensational voices. The reason I rated them only 4 stars was because I only like a couple songs on their CD. I wish they had more songs that I like on one CD. But a song that I hate could be song somebody else loves. I still absolutly LOVE the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"BSB... rulez! This cd is great. I love Hey Mr. DJ. This is an album that you can listen to the whole album and not skip songs. Half of the album was released as singles. Here are they songs that were singles: 1. We've got it goin' on 2. Guit playing games (with my heart) 3. As long as you love me 4. Everybody (Backstreets's back) 5. All I have to give 6. I'll never break you're heart If you like those songs, go ahead and get the album... it would be better than six singles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSICALLY AND VOCALLY SMOOTH, LIKE HOT COCOA ON A COLD NITE.","review":"I BOUGHT THIS CD AND WAS COMPLETELY THRILLED WITH THE DIVERSE MELODIES THIS GROUP CAN DELIVER. I AM A ARDENT FAN, BUT STILL TO LISTEN TO ONE OF THEIR OLDER CD'S AND TO HEAR THE STRENGTH AND BEAUTIFUL HARMONY THEY PRODUCE IS AMAZING. I HAVE HEARD THEM IN PERSON AND THE CD IS ALMOST AS GOOD. THIS GROUP HAS TALENT AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE STAYING POWER LIKE THE BEACH BOYS."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Whitney Huston would say, \\"It's not right, but it's okay\\"","review":"Okay, I admit it. I, too, used to be a BSB fan. Everytime I saw one of their videos I would cry (how pathetic is that)?! Well, with the help of rock and roll I have managed to turn my life around. The fact is that none of these guys can sing well, with the exception of Kevin who seems to have been banned from singing on this album. The only talent that they deserve to be credited for is the fact that they can do what their managers tell them to do. But I must admit, those managers can be smart at times. The best song on here is \\"Everybody.\\" \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" is okay too. If you are so down in the dumps that you can't stand it any longer, then this music is sickeningly happy and monotonus enough to put you in a better mood. Otherwise, leave this album alone and let it die in the graveyard of boy bands before them."},{"rating":"2","title":"all their cds rock","review":"I don't have THIS cd, but I have the first cd, 2nd and 3rd which has all of the songs on this cd. This cd is amazing. It's not as good as millennium, though. If you like the sound of BSB, you'll love this. There are a mix of dance tunes and pop/r&b. Everybody should have this cd. I suggest getting the first cd, \\"Backstreet Boys\\", AND \\"Backstreet's Back\\", instead of this cd, if possible. This cd is just a mix of those two cds...but if you can get both cds do, cause there are other REALLY cool songs you'd be missing out on."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good enough for me!","review":"I think that this CD was a collection of beats and tunes.

I recommend it to anyone with good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"one awesome CD!","review":"i got this cd for christmas 1999 and i think it is a really good cd. if you saw the 1998 world tour there are a lot of songs on here from that tour. the music is a lot different from what you would here on the millennium cd...but it is still bsb and it is real good. it is more of a dance cd...alot more pop. i would say to every bsb fan.....this is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god they're back again. Please kill me now.","review":"As with all their other work, this CD mainly contains putrid, bland songs with reused hooks which have been heard a million times over. New Kids on the Block circa-1999. Please, somebody save us from this rash of brainless bubble-gum pop which has hit the charts in the few remaining years of the millennium. I wish I could destroy this CD. My younger sister brought it home about 3 months ago. Since then it has maintained a very unwelcome presence in the family hi-fi. If copyright permits, I'd like to reproduce the following from a music magazine: \\"There is, as everyone over 17 knows, no point in explaining to a teenager the reasons why a slick pop group like [fill in the blanks] is the same old refried slop that's been served to teenagers for close on half a century now.\\" I would not recommend that anyone buy this album. It's been done before. And better.PS Is there any way of giving negative stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"the music is all the same they dont make there own songs and the record cover is the same as there newer one get the hanson cd at least they make there own songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music? try waste of time","review":"Calling this stuff music is a travesty. Look at bands who really put their heart and soul into an album (i.e. Grant Lee Buffalo, Jeff Buckley, U2). I did not buy this album, but rather, borrowed it from a friend to find out if all their songs were as bad as the ones on the radio. Yup, they sure are. Spend your money wisely people."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've got it goin' on!","review":"My dad actually bought me this album over 3 years ago when I didn't know who the Backstreet Boys were, and since that first time I heard them, I have loved them! This album is awesome, I don't know wheather to say that it's better or worse than Millenium because I love them both, but I think I like this one more. \\"As long as you love me,\\" and \\"Quit playing games with my heart\\" are nice and romantic, while \\"Everybody,\\" (a personal favorite) and \\"Hey Mr. DJ\\" are sexy and fun to dance to. This is a great debut album,They harmonize so well, and they do not lip-sync, they are truely real performers! If you like any of their songs you have to buy this album! The only one thing that is better than this album, is seeing them perform live! But since we can't all do that 24/7, this album is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is considered music???????????????????","review":"This type of junk will continue to sell until the teenage girls outgrow it.

I give it 5 stars because, all of the up-tempo songs have a good beat, the ballads are sweet and soothing, these guys are amazing. I don't know how people can't love these guys. They've been around for 7 years. Come on BSB fans, let's keep them alive so they'll be around for another 7!"},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon people this is from 4 years ago!","review":"I'm sick of looking at these negative reviews. This was released 3 or 4 years ago in Europe where and when pop like this was and is popular. In the past years they have grown so much more mature though. They wanted a more mature sound for the U.S., that's why later they released a collection of songs not quite as cheesy here. It's all about different countries and their popular culture. And if you listen to their more recent CDs, for example another import \\"Backstreet's Back\\" and the new one \\"Millenium\\" they really have grown as musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Freedom!","review":"Freedom of speech is a great thing I guess, because it allows someone to compare the Beach Boys to [gulp!] the Backstreet Boys. Brian Wilson was a musical genious - a composer, arranger, performer, and producer. The Backstreet Boys are studio singers, any one of whom is replaceable any time. Staying power? Don't bet on it. These are the future stars of VH-1's \\"Where ARE They Now? As for the album - there are a couple of good songs, but overall it's just kind of weak. 1-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC","review":"THIS CD CAME OUT AUG.12,1997 IN AMERICA AND I HAVE LISTENED TO IT EVERYDAY AT LEAST 20 TIMES.

I LOVE YOU, NICK. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"My first mistake","review":"Let's be forward, who really doesn't think they are good-looking? I mean, they are. And they can sing. They aren't pulling some Milli Vanilli thing. So, I saw the videos for \\"Quit Playing Games With My Heart\\" and \\"Everybody\\" and so I bought the CD thinking it was going to be REALLY good because of how good and original those tracks were. I must say it's a GREAT deal better than some of the boy band stuff out there now, but it's still practically 12 of the same damn songs. There's hardly any differential matterial on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Head Hurts","review":"To think they call this music is disturbing. I am in the generation that likes this.

The major vocalists each have distinctly different approaches to similar material. The group's upbeat dance tracks have made them a pop sensation in the US. Even their love ballads are more upbeat than the average pop love ballads, containing more distinctive and utterly more recognizable rhythms and melodies. Unfortunately, the Backstreet Boys still sound too unoriginal and their lyrics are too standard, too simplistic. If they were to branch out slightly more with different, warped topics they might be able to produce some more memorable gems. This is still, all in all, a very well-produced CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"From what I heard...ugh","review":"Well,I was just about to get this CD, until I looked at some of the comments.

Everybody(Backstreet's Back) makes me rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just really good, the best I must say!","review":"Ever since BSB came out I've been in love with their songs. All the ballads and dance tracks are perfect. Brian, Nick, Howie, AJ and Kevin sing in beauiful harmonies and the beats are really cool too. They are responsible for the most catchy, danceable, funky, sweet and soothing ballads and tracks. They're hands down the BEST and they RULE! Buy their debut now, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad is this cd? VERY!","review":"This CD is horrible. I used to like the Backstreet Boys (and I still do sometimes), but this is absolutely the worst CD I've ever heard by them. The only good songs are the ones that have been released as singles and maybe a couple of other ones. It's all hyper and drummed out. Every song sounds different, but sometimes it's in a bad way. If you're a diehard BSB fan, you MIGHT like this. If you're not that big of a fan, STAY AWAY! It would be horrible for this cd to turn you off to pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me explain BSB's \\"musical range\\"","review":"Cheesy love and dance songs that stay stuck in your head and that all sound the same, made up of annoying 5 part harmonies, synthesizers and drum machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you listen to this group?","review":"If you like Backstreet Boys, there is something wrong with you.

A really grrrreeeeeeeaat album!","review":"I have all of BSB's albums, but this one wuz my fav! 'That's the way I like it' was the BEST! 'Everybody(backstreet's back)' wuz good too, but I'll say 'That's the way I like it' wuz definitely way out! What I like about BSB is that u get to hear all their voices & they reall have a good beat. Everytime I listen to their songs, I can't help singing along (at the top of my vice, too!) The conversation part wuz good too except Kevin's was so low that you have to turn up the volume to the max. to hear it. (;-)just kidding. it wuz not THAT low or anything)All in all it wuz a pretty good buy & for all u BSB lovers, its a MUST get album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A packaged deal by the record company.","review":"Where is the talent? Only a few of them actually have decent voices, no one is a standout with a great voice. The songs are all the same, lacking a variety of subject matter and any real expression lyrically. The music itself takes few chances and appears to be a lot of keyboard and synth programing. In the tradition of vocal bands they fall very low on the list in terms of talent. The Beach Boys, The Clancy Brothers, The Platters, The Coasters, The Kingston Trio, The Brothers Four, etc. One could go on and on. As far as R&B vocal groups are concerned, take any motown group and they stand far above the Backstreet Boys. Take Six is an excellent acapella band which goes to town all over the Backstreet Boys. Overall, they are breaking no new ground musically and they do not even stand up well against groups within their genre. A total bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"So What If They're Pop...","review":"I got Backstreet's debut album a couple years after it came out, but I still thought it was pretty good. \\"Quit Playing Games\\", \\"As Long\\", \\"All I Have\\", \\"Everybody\\", and \\"Never Break\\" are all enough to make you want to buy this album. Although BSB is adored by millions of pre-teen girls, you shouldn't totally dismiss this album. However, this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the years. I never understood how this music is considered \\"pop\\" when all it is R&B. But that's all a part of a critic's job- to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB are very talented!","review":"I bought this CD in September of 1998 and I loved it immediately. I am now a HUGE BSB fan and I think the are the most talented group out today. I definitely recommend this CD for people of all ages. Also I recommend their latest CD \\"MILLENNIUM\\" which is even better! kristy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Boys","review":"I think that this cd was really good. I don't know why people hate the Backstreet Boys. I think that people hate them because N'SYNC copied them. But the cd could have had a few more songs. It was pretty good though, but Millenium was better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again!!","review":"Teh backstreet boys are no different than the new kids on the block. They may say that they are different, and that they are doing there own thing, but im sorry to say that there is no room left for orginality in \\"boy bands\\". They cant dance, they cant write music. Collectivley speaking, they may sing a little better than new kids ont the block,(although there is better studio equitment now, so that makes up the difference), they are not amazing singers, in fact, it sounds like there straining to hit all the differrent notes. there are tons of guys out there who are better dancers, better singers, and (GASP) better looking than the backstreet boys, they just havent been in the right places at the right times. The backstreet boys will not be around very long, trust me, because teenage girls DO grow up. Envietably, they will become yesterdays coffe, just like New Kids on the block. Faster than you can say Backstreet's Gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written lyrics, lacking capability","review":"I have to admit that I once owned this album. Going to a teeny-bopper dominated middle school I did it to be cool and fit in. I tried listening to the music but I found none of the songs interested me or were good. So of course I sold the album to a resale disc store. For all of you Backstreet Boys lovers- I'm not trying to trash you but there is so much better music out there. These songs lack intellect, good lyrics, and variety. All the BSB do is sing about the same thing (love) in a corny unattractive way. Good CD's contain songs that grab the listener realistically and are more substantially based than telling about the same heart-breaks with the same words, over and over again. Sorry, BSB, but despite some of your ratings you aren't even worthy of being on my list..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this CD is so shallow and meaningless","review":"can you believe that a band like this could top a chart?

This isn't man made music, it's just like rap, it's made by a machine. These guys aren't even a group they were put together by a corporation based on looks and blending vocals. They are a bunch of sissies without any style to call there own, any real music tallent besides vocals ability, and they have not attitude as well. They only things these guys say are what the record companies tell them to, they don't even write their own songs, they just improvise and let professionals pen their predictable and one dimensional lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember what happened to New Kids On The Block?","review":"They all started working at Burger King - now two of them are trying to make a comeback because of NKOTB clones - Backstreet Boys. There is no musical merit here, it's all sequencers and drum machines, weak multi-tracked vocals from 5 pretty boys who can't synchronize their voices, and the most banal and inane lyrics I've ever heard. I can't believe people actually listen to this when there are talented groups like Sonic Youth, Pavement, Built To Spill, Sebadoh, and 764-HERO who write incredibly complex music and lyrics and deserve all the attention in the world. Don't let MTV tell you what to listen to - become an individual and shun the machine.

I can't reallly say much about their first album (yes, the Asian version) but that it had a couple of really good songs, but the second album (Backstreet's Back) was out of this world. I know, some of the lyrics were really cheesy, but this kind of cheese I'd have anyday. My fave is..surprise, surprise...if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy. And their conversaion mix of All I want to give was okay too.

I do not want to listen to guys singing to each other about how sexual the other is (Everybody). There are a hundred other groups out there exactly like these guys, N'Sync and 98 degrees to name a couple. Where's the originality?? And what's with the sudden explosion of teenage, all guy, pseudo-seductive group clones? The lyrics could have been written by my ten year old brother. Part of a good song is how lyric the lyrics are, and how the lyrics complement the music and vice versa. The Backstreet Boys may as well be humming. Simply put, this music is fluff.

A couple of songs are okay, enough to give them 2 stars, but I just really wish that the radio would quit with most of their songs. If you like NSync (although as much as I am against pop music and teenyboppers, I think NSync does sing better), Britney Spears, and others like that, you'll probably enjoy this CD (or the CD cover)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very un-entertainig book, which never seemed to get started.","review":"I had to read this book for school and I also had to do a report for it, and I felt I was being tortured by having to read it.

I had my doubts about it but it's actually very useful. It installs in 10 minutes or less.

It seems that it would have been rather simple to give them a full range of motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I received this product in record time, but after installation I realized the unitwas not as good as the ball and string I had been using for years.

In their attempt to reclaim the golden crown of death metal, Six Feet Deep have unleashed masterpiece of muddled riffs, and horrible vocals. At best, this is a mid-paced joining of metal and hardcore, combined with the outdated vocal belching of former Cannibal Corpse frontman Chris Barnes. With songs focused around death, murder, rape, and insanity, one could almost say the novelty is over. Also found on the album (depending on which version you have), there are 3 covers, \\"War Machine\\" by Kiss, \\"Wrathchild\\" by Iron Maiden, and \\"Jailbreak\\" by Thin Lizzy. The slaughtering of these classics should have been left off, so that their good names would not be smeared in this failure. Not all of the musical efforts are bad, but they do not show any lasting improvements either, especially with the vocals. Bottom line, save your money for something better to come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barnes' worst effort","review":"This album was on hell of a letdown, especially after the great \\"Warpath\\" album. Replacing Allen West with former Massacre guitarist Steve Swanson was a terrible move, as was letting mediocre bassist Terry Butler write songs. Many of the songs are done in early 90's Massacre style (which is boring as hell, second rate death metal). There are about 3, maybe 4 good songs on here plus a couple of halfway decent covers. Uninspired guitar riffing for the most part fill this album. The vocals are pretty good however. I think Barnes should have stuck with the uniqueness of his previous album. He is trying to go back to a \\"brutal\\" death metal sound which falls miles short from recent releases from Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Krisium, Morbid Angel, and the such."},{"rating":"1","title":"maximun violence is to limited","review":"The only reason i got to hear s.f.u.'s 4th full lenght \\"maximun violence\\" was because my friend blast it every time i go over there as if he is trying to impress me or try to get me to like these guys.

Haunted was pretty good, but could definatly have been better, then there was the let down of Warpath which was pretty boring, and then there is Maximum Violence. The cover art alone tells you this cd is gonna be great. Six Feet Under got faster with this album, added alittle more gore to the lyrics, and Barnes does the best growling he has ever done in Six Feet Under with this one. Awesome songs like \\"Victim of the Paranoid,\\" \\"Bonesaw,\\" \\"No Warning Shot,\\" and the Kiss cover of \\"War Machine\\" really make the album worth while. But it doesn't stop there, \\"Hacked to Pieces,\\" \\"Brainwashed,\\" and \\"Feasting on the Blood of the Insane\\" are great songs as well. Definatly Six Feet Under's best effot by far.

The riffs are relatively simple and comprise of a few chords, the drums are amatuerish, the bass is non-existent and musically this is stagnant. Nothing original or innovative what so ever. The vocalist has a pretty good growl (although I prefer Chris In Cannibal Corpse and I think they're a better band generally) and I suppose the lead guitarist knows what he's doing to some extent, but really.

The lyrics and instrumentation are exceptional and Bert can still sing like no other. I must say this though; if you're going into this album expecting the same hard-hitting emotion as the first album, you will be disappointed. The songs are a lot softer and the style is almost entirely different. On the other hand, if you treat this album as its own entity you will find a well done, all-around album. I for one, thoroughly enjoy this album. The lyrics are compelling and deep and there are even a couple songs reminiscent of their first album (energy wise). I recommend it to any music fan, but for those of you looking for thrash, you have been forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood Swings in Punk Land","review":"Geeeeeeeeeeeeez. I wanted to do a second review of \\"Love & Death\\", and after 3 months I haven't changed my mind, that is songs like \\"Hard to Say\\", \\"Take it Away\\", and \\"Lunacy Fringe\\" are great songs & I don't care if they come from an emo/punk band of whiny wannabes, or that they have a following from depressed bored suburban rejects. Some of you guys with your atrociously scathing reviews are pounding your heads in over a young group-just because they sing about issues you can't relate to. No, they may not be Black Sabbath or Green Day, but there is some melody to some of the songs, and decent lyrics especially \\"Light with a sharpened edge\\".

If you are thinking about buying this cd, save yourself $7.50 and just buy \\"All That I've Got\\" off of iTunes because it's really the only decent song on here.

Unfortunately, a characteristic of EMO people is the fact that they only attempt 'suicide' so that they can get attention, which means we could be a long way off this genre of music dying off. And let's face it, they are getting all the attention they will ever need off today's depressed teeny bopper. Let's hope once the current batch of 12 year old girls matures or dies off, emo will die with them, and we can get back to regular music, rather than faggots whining about their daddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"The Used used to be good, but In Love and Death SUCKS!!!!!!!....i liked 2 songs on here \\"Cut Up Angels\\" and \\"I'm a Fake\\" but other than them 2 songs..they suck.....this is almost as bad as the (...)

BUT i have listened to both their cds all the way through (well... almost). Needless to say, their first album was better, but IN LOVE & DEATH is actually pretty good. I think they could of done a little better. The first three tracks are pretty good, but tracks 4 and 5 are horrible! They were so bad and just skipped them because they're rather annoying songs. The next tracks are ok, but they kind of odd. Just the tune of the songs, i guess. then there's track 9, the best song on the whole cd with heavy guitars and screaming. Totally rad! the last three tracks are pretty good, no complaints. Overall, a pretty good follow-up to their first album, but it could have been improved. If you wanna get this album go ahead. Either you like it or totally hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophmore SLUMP","review":"i love the self titled album, and that album is what changed me from gc and simple plan to hardcore and screamo. this album makes me feel like they want me to like that genre again. this cd PISSES ME OFF!!! dont get me wrong, this band is sooooooo talented but they have in a way sold out in my mind; therefore they receive 0 stars, but i cant give them 0, so they got 1. maybe their next album should be hardcore and screamo not pop like britney spears and good charlotte. this album pisses me off!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is really, really bad... really.","review":"The only thing more depressing than listening to Bert's make-believe phoney suicidal ramblings, is the fact that Bert still hasn't committed suicide.

But their sophomore album, this In Love And Death stuff is HORRIBLE. 90 percent of it sounds like they wrote it specifically for 12 year old good charlotte fans. One song, \\"Im A Fake\\", starts out with Bert saying a corny spoken word poem about cutting, \\"Im cutting trying to picture your black broken heart, love is not like anything, especially a ____ knife\\". CORNY. The only good song is probably \\"Soundeffects and overdramatics\\", which features the singer from Coalesce. Save yourself the money, just go download soundeffects on itunes for a buck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey sean, way to sell out","review":"so, i used to have lots of respect for the band Coalesce, until Sean Ingram decided to do vocals on this piece of garbage here. as you can tell from my review of the used's self-titled joke you know how i feel about this waste of space. way to sell out Sean, just because some skinny nerd wears your shirt in a video doesn't mean you have to do vocals on their cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"The Used is a great emo-rock band but I HATE THIS CD, they're doing something that doesn't work.

How can a band with that much potential make an album like this? They used to be rockers! Over half of this crap is so poppy it doesnt even sound like them. Now i know they can still write good music, from hearing songs like Listening, Take It Away, Sound Effects and Overdramatics, and Let it Bleed. Those songs are good (Im a Fake is okay too). But COME ON! Where is the old band that created a masterpiece as their debut album? I don't recommend this at all. If you want a good cd, get the first one. The Used has basically sold out with In Love and Death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never woulda guessed...","review":"To be clear, the Used's self-titled debut was pretty much a classic in my book. The variety of songs, Bert's emotion, and solid guitar and drumwork led to a stellar album. But all good things come to an end, and the Used have officially ended. The first song, which is also the first single, is probably the best track-but that's like trying to pick the best disease to have-it sucks no matter what. There is no way they could have been happy with the way this follow up turned out. I just hope Finch doesn't do the same thing.

Basic drum beats. Easy guitar riffs. Generic vocals. Sounds pleasant to listen to for the first time, but makes you want to puke the second time. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not great","review":"whoever gives this a one is retard. while they do have a few softer and out of place songs, the overall product is better then most. also, \\"sound effects and overdramatics\\" could quite possibly be the best song the used have ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable.","review":"As a fan of The Used I was highly looking forward to the release of \\"In Love and Death\\". I was sure they were going to top themselves, or atleast I hoped they would. Unfortunately, the only surprise I got from this album is how amazingly unemotional and cold the album seemed to be. They seemed to be trying to fit into the stereotype of those like Simple Plan, Story of the Year, and even Good Charlotte. I will give it that I did enjoy three songs on the album: \\"Take It Away\\", except for its rather bland lyrics and the strange speech in the bridge of the song that sounds like someone who has everything just trying to find something to complain about; \\"Listening\\", nothing too grand, but atleast better than \\"Cut Up Angels\\"; and \\"Sound Effects and Overdramatics\\", which yet again seemed to have lyrics that were not too thoughtful, just more overworked words.Probably one of the greatest sophmore disappointments I have ever encountered, but I will always love \\"The Used: Self Titled\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A new move Forward","review":"The Used takes a step forward with this new album offering a bombardment of melody and intricately intertwined well-written music. Each song being so infectiously catchy that you rarely want to move on to the next. The Album still boasts those songs that will reach in and rip your heart out with one fail swoop, but they are intermingled amongst a greater array of more melodic and catchy pieces. This album and their first is a testament to the mastery that The Used has over the artistry of music. Forever a Fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They've changed but they still kick ass","review":"We've all seen it before; bands go from heavy/alternate rock to soft (...)rock. It happened to Green Day, American Hi-Fi and Incubus, and now its happened to The Used. BUT! This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sure this album doesn't have the heavy riffs and screaming vocals as songs like Maybe Memories and A Box Full of Sharp Objects from the last album, but it takes on a softer side like the songs Blue and Yellow, Noise and Kisses and On My Own. So basically if your after music like Spineshank and Taproot, avoid this CD, but if you like softer rock such as Taking Back Sunday and The Juliana Theory, this album is perfect! I love this CD as much as I loved the last one and my favourite tracks of In Love and Death are I Caught Fire, Listening and Hard To Say."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"you buy the CD, and listen to \\"Take It Away\\" and think WOW! this is gonna be awesome, and it all goes downhill from there...peaople say that \\"All That I've Got\\" is a great track, i think take that amd boyzone could have done a better version, its just sounds so pop music, and whiny, i just want to strangle Bert on this track.listen to the first album \\"The Used\\" its much better.all in all very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy","review":"This album is amazing.

I must admit upfront that I really don't care for the genre of this band, but I thought their self-titled cd was decent (maybe a 2 or 2 and 1/2 stars out of 5). The only redeeming quality of this disc, however, is that it doubles as a coaster for my cold beverages."},{"rating":"1","title":"To all fans of the used:","review":"This album is not okay. (i promise). Seriously. Teeny boppers everywhere take note: The Used has as much soul as the bottom of my shoe, and talent reminiscent of My Chemical Romance. None. Stop polluting the earth with your fecal bands. One day everyone will laugh at bands like this, and cherish bands like Yellowcard. Punk Rock violin is AWESOME! Seriously though, get some roots, listen to some spice girls (early stuff) and new kids on the block (uncorporate stuff). Ubiquitous.

Please come back to the way you used to be, the Used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll try to be fair here...","review":"I could try to take up the \\"this is a poser pop-punk band!\\" argument, but I'm not going to. Focusing on the guitars and drums, I feel that the pop-punk label is sort of a stretch. So I'm going to focus on the Used biggest problem as a band:THE USED HAVE THE WORST SINGER IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Good Charlotte, blink 182---none of these bands vocals compare to the awfulness that the Used acheive effortlessly. This guy's(?) vocals are so distracting that any appeal that the guitars might have (not that they have much, but as I said it's hard to tell) is gone.So, if you really like those four bands I mentioned above, the Used's singer might not bother you. If you are normal, then I highly recommend that you stay away because listening to this band's metrosexual ****** will probably make you instantly throw out the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"UM...... NO!","review":"What the HELL is this?!?!? I heard them oepn for blink 182 once and i thought they were great. I saw their video for \\"take it away\\" on much music and i loved it so i decided to buy it. HUGE MISTAKE! The only good songs on this whole album are: \\"Soundaffects and over dramatics\\" and \\"Take it away\\". I mean theres one song called: \\"Lunacy Fringe\\" The intro sounds mexican almost! And then \\"soundeffects and over dramatics\\" is like hardcore punk. DECIDE ON WHAT GENRE YOU ARE! What is with that spoken corny intro of \\"Im a fake\\" ??? SERIOSULY NO! I DO NOTTTTTTTTTTTTT RECOMEND IT..!!GRRRWHAT A WASTE OF 20$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling Used","review":"For the first time in my life an album has left me speechless, and not in a good way. I'm still trying to grasp the concept of how they could actually put something like this out. The Used are a good band, but this cd is not. If you loved the debut album, you will be disgusted by this one, it is absolutely nothing like the last album. Lyrics are mediocre at best, and the melodies sound like....like........for lack of a better word, horrible. Nothing original here like the self-titled album. Just bunch of crap tied together, to make more crap, so that it can be spoon fed to the highest music consumer market......little teenage girls. In Love & Death, should have been more like 'whatever originality we had, we just lost with this album.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Surprise","review":"While this album is not exactly what I expected out of a sophmore album from The Used, I was definitely happy with the outcome. In Love and Death is not as hard-hitting as the self-titled, but their new sound is impressive. This album will be more appealing to the masses, and they pulled it off without turning \\"MTV\\". Bert's vocals do not express the same amount of angst, but the lyrics are nothing to frown at. I only have 2 major critiques, and 1 is that Bert's voice fluctuation is one of his best attributes, and he doesn't show it as much as he could in this album. My other is that for some reason they chose not to portray Branden Steineckert's speed on the set in nearly enough tracks. Overall, the album is worth a lot more than the money you'd spend on it, and everyone should go and buy it, whether you were into The Used before this or not.Preferred Tracks: 1,2,3,5,6,11"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great sophomore album. The Used does not disappoint. Bert's voice sounds incredible!

This CD is no exception. They are one of my more favored bands. This music to me is enjoyable, leisure music, and that's what I do. I enjoy this music in my leisure. Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best!","review":"In Love and Death is not only my favorite record by the Used, but also one of my all time favorites. They add more production without over-producing it, and still make it about the music. The songs flow and fit together perfectly, as opposed to the Self Titled where the focus is more on each song as an individual. Song highlights are I Caught Fire, All That I've Got, Cut Up Angels, Light With A Sharpened Edge, and Hard To Say. I highly reccomend not only this record, but also The Used's Self Titled and Lies For the Liars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bastardization of Modern Music","review":"I have waited for 2 years for this album to come out and I must admit that I have never been so disappointed with anything in my entire life. This band has meant so much to me and the lyrics to their old songs really had meaning to much of their audience. This album sounds nothing like their old one. I wanted to cry because I felt so betrayed. This new album is lacking in creativity ( it basically sounds just like any other generic \\"punk- pop\\" band out today), it is lacking in energy, the old anger and feeling in their old lyrics are missing, and in general it just sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bert's voice is so God DAMN ANNOYING!!!","review":"BERT, please don't scream.You sound like a pansy little poofter.If you are going to continue screaming, do it in an artistic way that also sounds good.For example, the lead singer of Foo Fighters."},{"rating":"1","title":"OmGzZzZ","review":"OMG. cUt mEh WrIsTs AnD bLaCk MeH EyEs!!!!

Well i finally listened to the entire cd and i have to say its all crap except for one song, \\"Sound Effects and Overdramatics\\", and that song is really really good (thanks to the singer of Coalesce, who were one of the best bands ever). i'm sure that if you are a fan of mtv's \\"flavor of the week\\" bands you'll love this. If you want a good pop-punk cd pick up Fall Out Boy's \\"Take This To Your Grave\\" or Motion City Soundtrack's \\"I AM THE MOVIE\\". If you want a good screamo release pick up Thrice's \\"Illusion of Safety\\" or Thursday's \\"Full Collapse\\". and if you want a good hardcore cd buy Every Time I Die's \\"Hot Damn\\" or anything by Converge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew! The Used! Get it off me!","review":"It's not that I don't like this cd because it's emo. I don't like it because its bad. I like the first track and thats it.

I have no idea how bands like this get such a great following. People!! Bands like this are making HUGE bucks off of your inability to see through their cheap superficiality. This is another band, spawned from the middle class suburbs with plenty of cash to start with and nothing new to say. If you just want energy and aggressive sound, go check out when it started with Black Flag or Descendents (Milo Goes to College). But if you like this whining, \\"troubled\\" show of teenage angst, yeah check out bands like this. I mean, they tour; if you don't mind paying 300% more than you ought for blah blah music.

These guys say their music is from the heart and authentic, but let me tell you that its just a fallacy.You want something thats from the heart,honest,intellecual?...Then go get Social Distortion's \\"White Light,White Heat,White Trash\\" and \\"Sex,Love,and Rock'n'Roll\\" which came out on the same day as this faulty effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite Sophomore Slump","review":"This album was a real letdown after the promise of the first one. I can't think of an album that I bought with so much excitement only to be this disapointed. While the first album had emotional music with originality, great songwriting and the perfect metal tinges,In Love and Death seems like it was slapped together. I kept trying to get into it, but the songs just don't have any soul. The first one was impossible to not listen to. Sometimes magic is hard to recaputure, I guess. Let's hope things look up with the third album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica's review","review":"I think The Used is one of the most talented and most creative bands out there.

It just means that more people are listening to them, and thats good. Good for them! who cares who listens to their music, that isnt what music is about, its about hearing music that YOU enjoy, and if you're a musician GREAT, Good for you! Just play!

I recommend this book for anyone who is into the bible or the Book of the Revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good series, but too much repetition in this one...","review":"Although I think this series is well written and interesting, for the most part, this book in the series reiterates too many of the facts that have already been stated. If you don't know what is going on, go back and read the first two books again, don't take up 100 pages telling us what Rayford has done wrong, what Buck has seen and done before, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"more action than the first two","review":"This one was more face-paced than the first two books, which made it hard to put down. There's more action, more events happening, not so much downtime and thinking and pondering of the characters.

The story is compelling at times but these books are very poorly written. It is sometimes tough to continue reading. The characters are not well developed or believable. The women...don't get me started...the women are so simplistic and unnecessary. It is shameful that the female characters are portrayed as such silly people. There is something about these books despite the many flaws that keep me reading. My husband and I enjoy talking about them and comparing the pre-tribulation theory to our own faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THESE BOOKS!","review":"I gave one out to lots of family and friends for Christmas this past year.

It is so close to reality, that it truly is frightening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-Packed Christian Fiction at Its Best","review":"This book is a great step forward for Christian Literature. The writers integrate faith with all the other aspects of life so well, you actually become immersed in the novel. I believe this is the best book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the 3 book series","review":"Disappointing. Loved the first 2 books, but this one seemed like the authors rushed it out to meet a deadline or something. Could've used more thought & originality. Certainly still worth reading, but don't expect the quality of the first 2, which were phenomenally good."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is just another example of how terrific Tim and Jerry are! This book is an eye opener into how deceitful the antichrist will be. It kept me on the tips of my toes, and even though I have 2 young children, I found that I could not put it down! Wonderful reading, thoroughly entertaining, terrifing concept. What more do you want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most interesting character is the car","review":"I just went to the Los Angeles Auto Show found myself drawn to the Land Rover/Range Rover exhibition because this amazing vehicle has near super powers in the Left Behind series, particularly in Nicolae. The blessed Range Rover consistently delivers Buck from one certain-death situation to another, yet always spirits him away unscathed. This is clearly the unstoppable vehicle to own during the tribulation. Thanks to authors LaHaye and Jenkins and their persuasive brand placement, I'm buying Range Rover from now on, extravagant price be damned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE FICTION","review":"Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sheep Fodder!","review":"Why God or Satan would want anything to do with our planet or it's people is beyond me.

At least then you can get it all for 8 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books are great for those teetering on the edge...","review":"If you're like me, not terribly interested or concerned in the second coming of Christ; this series will help you open your eyes to God all around you. This series is bringing me closer to the Holy Spirit. LaHaye and Jenkins write for everyone- not just Christians. I urge everyone to read this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is as good as the first two, and more!","review":"The book uses its wonderful language, interpretation, and symbolic nature of flat-out response to answer the popularity of the first two books. As it describes the work of the Anti-Christ, it propels itself to the well-deserved earnings of fame and glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confession of a \\"Left Behind\\" junkie, and a warning","review":"While this is certainly an interesting interpretation of end times, the characters are ineffably disappointing in their two-dimensionality. I don't believe them, nor do I really care about them. The dialogue is dispensible, and I found myself skipping pages of dialogue just to get to the next plot element. Yet, to my shame, I am hooked on the books and will probably read them all.Reader, please beware: Bible scholars have debated to no agreement on the time of the Rapture relative to other end time prophecies. While the Rapture may come before the Tribulation (HOPEFULLY!), it also may not! Be ready to endure it and be FIRM on your foundation in Jesus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! The best one yet!!!","review":"I truly believe these two authors are annointed by God! If you read the book of Revelation, and then read the Left Behind trilogy, you can get a clear picture of what the apostle John saw on the isle of Pathmos. The rapture and continuing events could truly come about in this way! And for those of us that will not be here after the Rapture takes place it is a glimpse of the terror that will take place, I pray that these books will make everyone who is not sure if they will leave when the trumpet sounds, get real and serious with God!!! Everyone who has unsaved loved ones should prompt them to read these books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very predictable plot with poor dialogue.","review":"For those that are recently convert Christians, this book might be somewhat interesting. However, it lacks depth and character building. The plot is simple and predictable and paces itself in order to spread out the story over several books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"Dispensationalists have managed to reduce the book of Revelations (a book difficult to understand) to a John Grisham novel where every Italian is a villian. It's an absolute travesty when people use God (Who is love) to spread hate. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"Our bookclub, The 8th Kingdom, read and reviewed Left Out, which we enjoyed, then Tribulation Force, which was okay, then Nicolae, which turned us off the series. It has become a soap opera. The original idea has plummeted into macho men who do incredible stunts without harm, and women who are treated as \\"prizes.\\" The series could have developed into a useful and creative study guide of the Bible. Now, we're getting sparse smatterings of Bible-speak while Buck, Chloe, Rayford, and Amanda are dodging earthquakes and Nicolae who lets them live while he destroys everyone else not to his liking. Really! I'm giving my unread copy of Soul Harvest to the library. The 8th Kingdom is moving on to books with stronger characters and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, a Christian novel that won't insult your IQ","review":"Why do they always have to make it seem simple? Why are the chareacters always so boring? Why do they always make it seem like morality suddenly becomes black and white? Why do they always seem like they are written for fifth graders? Why areChristian novels so BAD? If y6ou've asked yourself these questions, buy We All Fall Down. Smart, funny, and totally engrossing, this is the best novel about Christianity that I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicolea a great novel and the greatest villian of all time!","review":"Let me start by saying I love this series! Nicolea: The Rise of Antichrist is a great novel for both believers and none believers,but I feel that the title might decieve people who might read it before any other leftbehind novel, and believe its the only novel in the series you can judge Nicolae's villiany from. But each novel before and after Nicolea reveals someting new about his evil nature that will but him in to a darker light then you might have put him in before. I don't care what your moral beliefs are if you have read all of these novels then you would have to agree with me that Nicolea is the greatest villian ever created!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest of the first three","review":"Though the story (I guess I should say prophecy yet to be fullfilled) brings the reader deeper into the mire of earthly doom, Nicolae (book 3 of 7) is the slowest so far.For a novel that is 415 pages long, I felt it could have moved at a much faster pace. Don't get me wrong, there are at least 2 exciting moments in the book that were real page turners, but the other 350 pages dragged on. It does help further along some character development and their are a few interesting sub plots, but I look forward to the 4th, for it appears now things are about to pick up for the Tribulation Force and the forces of good and evil.My only real complaint is some of the hokey dialouge. I consider myself christian, and yet I don't hear people talk like the characters do in real lide. The dialouge is at times, campy, like June and Ward Cleaver. If the end times are upon us, reality would be much harsher than portrayed here.I give this book 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I'm still addicted to these books.. this on had more rehashing than usual of the first 2 books On to the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"It was an amazing read. I would absolutely recommend this book to a friend. It was a quick download and I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"book 3 Left behind series","review":"I didnt read this one in the given order. I almost didnt want to read about him, Nicolae. but I did go back and read the book and I am glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on the Entire Series","review":"I would just like to share that before I even began to read these Left Behind books, I went to a bible study and we did several studies on Revelation and covered all the judgments, seals, angels, trumpets, horsemen, etc. and this is actually extremely close to the Bible. Someone else on here made the comment that they're trying to take visions and apply them literally. Although I agree it might send a bad message that even if you don't believe when the rapture happens that you can still be saved, these books are excellent and Nicolae is my favorite thus far (no I haven't finished them all). The thing is though, do you want to be here when all that's going on? I wouldn't think so... Read the books, do some research in the Bible if you need to and enjoy. This isn't EXACTLY how it's all going to happen but these two authors have done a great job at trying to make a good story out of it and still stay true to the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicolae is a poor excuse for a villain.","review":"I'm sorry, but Nicolae is hardly the diabolical nemesis the antichrist is supposed to be. He feels more like a slick politician or a bureaucrat than the embodiment of evil. The villains in James Bond movies are far more sinister than this. Maybe it's because the authors are writing for a Christian audience that they feel that they have to sanitize their characters. You won't find a good characterization of evil here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying the hardcover.","review":"As much as I liked the first one, the sequels are getting a little tiring. It seems like the authors have to recap everything that happened in the previous novels for anyone who picked up this one out of sequence. And I'm not sure these are worth buying brand new. Wait for the paperback, or borrow them from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and extremely thought-provoking!","review":"The 3rd book in the Left Behind series, this one continues the story of those still surviving the Rapture, and how they overcome obstacles in their quest to keep going in the face of the AntiChrist. Like the books before it, the story races carrying you through to the end far too quickly. Having read a lot of prophecy material and Revelations, I can testify to the accuracy of the authors' view of the period post-Rapture. Be warned and BE READY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming but Deadly","review":"This Series is GREAT! The plot and the characters are building slowly but steadily. The characterization of Anti-Christ is excellent. Charming, a man of Peace, a concerned humanitarian, but with a sinister side that hides just below the surface. You only see it now and then, and it confirms the worst. I am giving this to all my friends who don't know the REAL Christ. Keep up the Good work Tim and Jerry! Thank you to Amazon for the speedy service and the discount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-nighter: suspenseful and terrifyingly realistic!","review":"Although some people say that Nicolae isn't as frightening or obviously evil as an antichrist should be, I feel that he is a realistic portrayal of the one who will come and falsely recieve the world's trust. The author's do a great job of devoloping Nicolae's character into one you can almost like and then showing you the evil he is truly capable of. This book made me realize just how deceitful the antichrist will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The keft behind series","review":"I ordered this book way back in august and i have recieved the entire series but i still have not recieved this one yet and its october...i want my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NICOLAE","review":"This is a wonderful addition to the Left Behind series. I enjoyed getting to know the enemy through the eyes of Tim LaHaye. I reccommend this series to anyone who is searching for answers to questions about Revelations."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series just keeps getting better","review":"This is easily the best of the first 3 books in this series. It is hard to put down once you start. Much more action and adventures in this one. Unfortunately for me, I know how this one turns out. I read Book #4 Soul Harvest first, by mistake, and now, I have had to back track. If you do the same thing, do not fret. Books 1, 2, and 3 are just as exciting even with what I already knew. I can't wait to finish the rest of the series. Good vs. Evil and no matter what, those who believe in the Bible teachings, know the Good guys win. It doesn't get any better than that!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"10% Can't-put-it-down substance, 90% filler","review":"I would have to rate Left Behind as one of my two favorite books of all time, a definite 10 rating. Tribulation Force certainly falls within my top ten favorites scoring at least an 8. Nicholae, however, seems to have dropped off greatly. It appears to me that the idea of a seven book series seems to be a novel idea (no pun intended), but after reading Nicholae, I'm afraid of more filling dialogue as opposed to the gripping action and suspense of the first book. I am still enough of a fan to continue to read the series but had I known what I know now, I would have gone to the book store and simply read Chapter 19 (and would not have missed out by doing so). I love the series but it appears to me to be a ploy to make twice the amount of money to tell a story that could be sufficiently be told in three (maybe four)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind, Tribulation Force...","review":"I'm writing this review on the Nicolae page because I happened to land here. I have only read the first two books in the series--I quit on Nicolae. As a Christian I am embarrased by the poor writing in these books. The characters are so paper thin and unbelievable that I don't see how anyone can identify with them. The writers seem to have absolutely zero flair for capturing the range of emotions common to human beings and they have no talent for writing realistic dialogue. Even the non-Christians seem to come out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Really, really bad writing. Lame...very lame. If you want to read some good Christian novels, pick up \\"Pontius Pilate\\" and \\"The Flames of Rome\\" by Paul Maier; or some C.S. Lewis books like the Space Trilogy or The Screwtape Letters. They're not only thought provoking but they are skillfully written as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for all to read!","review":"For those who like only books that can hold their attention this is the one. After reading the last page of this I had to get Soul Harvest, which I am reading right now. This series of books has made me a better Christian by far. How anyone could read this book and not wonder what is to come and where you are going is hard for me to understand! I hope all that read this book are given the nudge they need to become true Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far.","review":"The only reason I picked up this book was because I was intriged by the ending of the last one. And I'm glad I did. This was the best of the series that I've read. The plot never slowed, and life in the tribulation got very complicated. And you've just got to read that final scene to believe it. Don't hesitate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found the third novel \\"Nicolae\\" to be a disappointment.","review":"The main problem I had with \\"Nicolae\\" was that for the anti-christ, he was not very mean, or treacherous. I know some people who make this character seem like \\"Mickey Mouse\\". When the believers are persecuted, it's got to be really BAD. In America we have been blessed, and most individuals have not had to face heavy persecution. Perhaps this is why this novel is deficient in relation to persecution during the tribulation. Make it rougher- the anitchrist is supposed to \\"wear out\\" the saints of God. Inspite of my feelings about Nicolae, I am looking forward to reading Soul Harvest."},{"rating":"2","title":"great books","review":"Love the Left Behind series. Found Web Page about the upcoming books with thier titles and now lost it. Can't wait for upcoming books. Wish I had the Web page again. Just so I could Know the titles. Great Books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I began reading this series in November, starting with Left Behind. I literally had to stop on the way to the airport for an overseas trip to buy Tribulation Force. I could not leave the country without it. Finding Nicolae in the stores was a Christmas present to myself. I have shared these books with the gentelman who leads the Sunday School class for high-schoolers at our church. He is using them as a basis for teaching these young adults the importance of being IN the church, not just attending. I can hardly wait until the next one is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicolae The Rise of the Antichrist","review":"This series is the best I've seen what an incredible way to witness to the unsaved. These books are so good they'll keep anyone hooked, and possible give people something to think about ...so they won't be LEFT BEHIND. The only problem I had with Nicolae is that it tended to be a bit repetative in re-explaining the relationships between the characters. I read all three books in about 10 days I didn't need to be reminded who was who. I can't wait until August to get my hands on the next book. Keep up the great work. I was thrilled to hear that there will also be a series for young readers. Bless you for your work!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"The Left Behind series has been very interesting, the character are strong and keeps you wanting to learn more. I felt that the \\"bad guy\\" Nicolae should have been in this book more often since his name was the title. But getting to know the seperate characters keeps you reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great action","review":"This is where the Left Behind Series starts to get good! The Antichrist has started World War 3 and the Tribulation Force struggles for life. Buck Williams goes to Israel to rescue Rabbi Ben-Judah, while Rayford Steele is forced to work for Nicolae Carpathia and gets to hear all his dirty little secrets. Just a couple things made me uncomfortable. The eschatology wasn't so great, and it was a little too \\"macho.\\" The men go out on all their adventures while the women just get in trouble and have to be rescued. I liked Left Behind The Kids better, because the girls are just as smart and important as the guy characters, and they're not all ditzy-blonde like Hattie Durham. But to get to the bottom line, this is a great story, and it's awesome to have a gospel series that gets the respect of the mainstream market."},{"rating":"2","title":"An average book in a great series","review":"I've enjoyed reading this series, but I was disappointed that this installment strayed from Bible prophecies and was more about character interaction (boring interaction at that). However, things really start hopping at the end, but the ending is rather ubrupt forcing the reader to immediately want to read #4 in the series. The 1st 2 in the series were quite engaging, #3 Nicolai was somewhat disappointing when compared to the other books, but still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"In \\"Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist,\\" the third book in the Left Behind series, Nicolae Carpathia comes to power as the Antichrist predicted in Revelation, two years after Jesus Christ raptured his church. While many citizens think of him as a pacifist who wants to bring peace and unity to the world, he is the main worker for the devil himself. Rayford Steele, Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams, Chloe Steele Williams, Amanda White, and Rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah are new Christians who call themselves the \\"Tribulation Force.\\" Rayford and Buck both work for Carpathia; Rayford is Nicolae's airline pilot, Buck is his senior writer. It can't be too long before they are exposed as Christians. Or does the Antichrist already know?If you are a true Christian or a skeptic, this is an excellent book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting could not put it down. Read it in 4 days.","review":"More compelling than \\"Piercing the Darkness\\" or \\"This present Darkness\\" more believable. It usually takes me 5-8 days to read a book. I read the whole series in less then 14 days. From the moment you are first introduced to Steele, Buck and Chloe, you find yourselve becoming a part of their adventure. I have passed it on to my teenage boys who are reading it for school. I highly recommend the series to all readers. This series has made me rethink my attitude towards the Rapture. I don't want to be Left Behind. Neither should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...what if we're all wrong?","review":"This thought just occurred to me, but what if Nicolae isn't the Antichrist, and actually Buck or Rayford is?!? Wouldn't that be the ultimate plot twist? The Bible says that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, and maybe the good people are really evil and the evil people are really good. Or even worse, what if this whole Left Behind series is really not Christian at all? What if we're just being manipulated by demonic forces? What if these books are actually causing Christians to sin by being more materialistic (buying more books) and more covetous (wanting the next book as soon as possible)? I'm going to be a little more careful about all this stuff now. I mean, what if Y2K hits and all the non-Christians disappear and all the Christians are left on earth to suffer God's judgment? You never know - it could happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicolae another great book","review":"The third book in this series was just as great as the others.As a gift last Christmas my friend gave me the entire Left Behind series and told me I should read it. I started out with the first and am slowly working my way into the series.In this book Buck, Rayford and there wives are still trying to find the answers they need. This book has it all the action, the adventure, the plot twists.Overall, this was a great book, and I can't wait to read the rest in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open to God's Love","review":"\\"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\\"When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll need the patience of an angel to get through these books","review":"The Rapture and biblical prophecy are fascinating subjects that could be the basis for a roller coaster modern story. Unfortunately the authors dilute the potential with long, boring, inconsequential text. I trudged through the first 2 books, then finally threw in the towel on the 3rd after reading a *chapter* describing a traffic jam! The best of this series could be distilled to just a few books but, keeping with the theme, it's already too late..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"Some of the graphics in the book are a little much but the author's don't call any punches and don't want to sugar coat anything. The story moves fast and holds your attention along with being well written. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR CHRISTIANS AND NON-CHRISTIANS ALIKE","review":"I have always struggled with the reading and understanding of the book of Revelation in the Bible. Tim LaHaye has written LEFT BEHIND, THE TRIBULATION FORCE, and now NICOLAE in a format that is easy to read, tough to put down and really helps the Bible come to life. I have begun to reread Revelation, and things that once seemed confusing now make more sense to me. I understand that these people as well as events in the book are fictional, but it makes sense. I would recommend this book as well as the previous 2 for any Christian who wishes to grow in his relationship with Christ and understanding of the end times. I would also recommend these books to any non-Christian. These things will occur. Don't be LEFT BEHIND."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romanian? Get real - a Romanian?","review":"The average reader probably knows only two things about Romania -it's the country of a fictional archfiend (Dracula) and the historical archfiend who inspired him (Vlad Trepes). You would that instead of picking further on this now improvrished country which is a threat to nobody Lahaye and LaHaye would have written about an antichrist with a background that gave his a mediocum of irony.Myself, I would have used a seemingly straightforward Texan who grew up in a political family surrounded by the power and influence of the energy industry, who had the enthusiastic backing of the wealthiest part of our country, the support of the all-powerful U.S. military, plus had millions of highly religious followers ready to snarl in defense of the man when the slightest criticism was applied...now *that* would be a believable Antichrist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"Nicolae, by Tim LeHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, keeps you on the edge of your seat as Buck Williams, Rayford Steele and his daughter, Chloe, are on a mission to win as many souls as they can to Christ before the Second Coming. Not only that, but Rayford and Buck both work directly for Nicolae, the Antichrist foretold in biblical prophecy. Nicolae is the worst person in history to walk on the earth.I recommend this book to everyone. There are so many intense parts, especially about the rescue that Buck attempts. It is written so well that you can picture everything from the beginning to end. I promise this book will not bore you at all. The characters' feelings are described with details so that you feel like you know them personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this book down!","review":"They just keep getting better!

Not only are they enjoyable, but they are life changing. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but mistitled","review":"Nicolae was not the focus of the book at all-no more than he was in Tribulation Force. I am in love with this series, though and finally secured a copy of Soul Harvest at the library. I REALLY DIDN'T APPRECIATE the couple-page recaps of the first 2 books, as I'm sure other readers didn't, and truly wish Jenkins and Lahaye had left that out; hopefully, they won't make a habit in the next ones of briefly summarizing the preceding books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Only the global war thriller The Triumph and the Glory can rival the Left Behind books for beauty of theme, glorification of pure-hearted characters, and simmering suspense. Nicolae is the best of the three so far, get yourself a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicolae is exciting and it keeps you reading it none stop.","review":"Nicolae is the third and most exciting book in the Left Behind series. It will make you read it into the wee hours of the morning. It starts off right where Trib Force left off and Nicolae Carpathia doesn't lose a step on his evil ways. The Trib Force also adds a new member to its group. The book takes place in all sort of places like Israel,Chicago, and in New Babylon. The book will be no disappointment to any Left Behind fans because of its outstanding writing. So don't miss Nicolae!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointing . . .","review":"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through \\"Soul Harvest\\") are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone. These books are the shallowest of shallow, with about as much intellectual stimulation as a bowl of cold oatmeal. There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--\\"The Last Day.\\" If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, \\"The Last Day\\" delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile \\"Left Behind\\" stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, poorly executed","review":"While it is an interesting idea to write a novel in which people undergo the protestant conception of the \\"end-times,\\" this book is remarkably poorly written and contains a ridiculous plot. The characters complain about persecution of Christians, yet continue to be employed in the highest levels of government, one using the Antichrists' own magazine to publish articles accusing the world leader of being the devil incarnate. Another, who is the Beast's own personal pilot, berates his sinful nature after >gasp< cursing when he can't contact his wife after the city she is in has been nuked, with one of AC's special non-radioactive nukes. The dialogue is laughable, and on the whole the project is of an extremely low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor format","review":"I found this book very frustrating from the sense of how it was written; the format if you will. The author \\"profiles\\" about 70 homes, but gives very little history on each home, and the most disappointing/frustrating aspect of this book was for all but a few homes there was only one, yes ONE photograph of the exterior. Simply put, there would be one exterior photo of the facade, a couple paragraphs of text, and on the next page, on to the next house! Gee thanks for that photo of a beautiful mansion. I sure wonder what the foyer or the formal dining room looks like, but I guess I'll have to just keep wondering!? It's simlpy astonishing that there is one exterior photo per house, and that's it. I believe the author would have been much better served focusing on each house more, discussing the history and providing several exterior shots of the home and grounds(including landscaping and gardens), as well as the interiors.

The recipes have even been \\"approved\\" and enjoyed by my non-vegetarian husband, which is more than I can say for any of the complicated ones I labored over from my Vegetarian Times magazine. Another plus of this book is that all of the ingredients are not obscure and can be readily found at mainstream grocery stores.

I really appreciate the small(er) ingredient lists, the use of canned/frozen foods (so I can actually find the ingredients in this little town!), and the way each meal is complete with side dishes and directions about what to do in what order to turn out the dish in under 30 minutes.

However, almost all of the 150 recipes are disgusting. Even their guacamole recipe has unnecessary and nasty ingredients in it, which, as a guacamole lover, I find personally offensive. It's true, I need fast, uncomplicated vegetarian meals, but that doesn't mean I'm sacrificing quality, taste, and self respect.What's worse is that all of these recipes make 6 servings, sometimes even 8. I'm sure that's great for families, but I'm young and single and living in a city, so making 6 servings of anything other than an alcoholic beverage is absolutely insane. I tried to cut back the ingredients by half, but then I have all these weird amounts of ingredients and I'm still making too much food.All in all, this book sucks. Don't buy it. Seriously.

Thanks, Ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bette Davis / Bogart classic!","review":"This was one of the early Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart films. It has my praise for a number of reasons, one being it was shot using a very limited number of scenes. Two, the film gives us a real perspective of life through the \\"love is not enough\\" factor and does not lead the audience into believing all love stories have a happy ending. Three, you really get to see how GREAT of an actor Bogart really was. Although Bette Davis had a rather small role as a supporting actress of sorts in this film, her character is vital to the story. Any fan of either two actors should see this film and own it. I'm also impressed with the artwork and special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-time classic now dated","review":"I am a big Bogart fan but hadn't seen this movie in a while. I watched it and found it somewhat uninteresting and dated. The first 1/2 hour is mostly Leslie Howard and Bette Davis talking and flirting. By the time Bogie showed up, I'd just about lost interest.

Bette Davis plays a young woman who lives in a desert town with her father and works as a waitress in his desert cafe, she is bored and would love to leave home and go see the world! A disillusioned writer played by Leslie Howard stops at the cafe and she falls for him but when a criminal played by Humphrey Bogart and his gang are on the run from the law they hide out in the cafe and hold everyone hostage. This is a good movie and I like that Bette Davis is playing a nice girl who is sweet and compassionate when it seems that she was generally known for playing ruthless, cold and calcuating women so this is a nice change. I'm pleased that this movie is finally on DVD and I recommend it to any fan of Bette Davis, Leslie Howard and classic movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps one of the best written scripts ever.","review":"Although the cinematography is not the best that it could be, this movie is very well done. As a viewer it is somewhat difficult to follow at times, but Bogart, and Davis are outstanding, with a very solid supporting cast. Well worth renting or buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the bunch","review":"Warners Gangsters Vol. 1 is definitely the best package of the 4 volume series. The original classics \\"Little Caesar\\" and \\"The Public Enemy\\" are brutal and raw for their time. Robinson and Cagney are second to none in their respective performances. These two films are to Warner Bros. what \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\" are to Universal. My favorite of the lot is \\"Angels With Dirty Faces\\". If the end of this film doesn't bring a tear to your eye, then you're not human. \\"White Heat\\" shows that Cagney still has the magic after 12 years away from the gangster genre. And \\"The Petrified Forest\\" (the reason I bought the package to begin with), although an outstanding film with a fine performances by Bette Davis and, especially, Humphrey Bogart, is the weakest offering in the set.

There are no real high points and the plot does not really make sense. Leslie Howard's role is annoying and again unrealistic, and Bette Davis just rolls along on this disaster waiting to happen.

It is all encompased by this one story, a national microcosm in a desert truck stop. Not only isn't it dated, but in some ways it seems that we are just catching back up to it. Leslie Howard gives his best lifetime performance as Alan Squire, a drifting, disillusioned combination of artist and intellectual. Betty Davis is perfect as the pure, unspoiled spark worthy of dieing for. And Humphrey Bogart as Duke, is the model anti-hero, a supposed mad-dog murderer with more soul than the creatures, and the system, certain to bring him down...."},{"rating":"1","title":"upset by it","review":"i'd like to warn people who like bogart and davis, who enjoyed movies such as \\"all about eve\\" or \\"baby jane\\"; \\"the dark passage\\" ; just like i did.

Leslie Howard is, as usual, a watery intellectual, this time turned hitchhiker. Humphrey Bogart is the tough guy whose entire role required little more than sitting pointing a gun at people. The others were unremarkable.This movie wants so much to live, and love, and be loved, but there is nothing to be found for it - not here nor anywhere else. It longs to be buried somewhere in the Petrified Forest, where the winds can blow over it, and perhaps - being so chocked full of dramatic, poetic statements, some will leak out from its grave, and the occasional tourist will hear the gentle whisper, \\"'Tis for this end that we twain are met!\\"Let this movie rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"got the book same day","review":"He delivered the book to me the day of because he was a previous student in the class.

The main character Rosie Richardson is the link between the two. She starts out as an employee for a 'glossy' magazine. She meets many celebrities and has a celeb boyfriend, however finding her life overly stressful and slightly unmeaningful, she decides to leave her life in England behind and go to work in Africa. When a famine and locusts threaten to wipe out thousands of people near her camp, Rosie returns to England in order to strike up support and raise money for the cause.

She ended up driving me nuts, as did almost every character in the book. The dialogue for certain characters, like Nadia & Andre, was very annoying & was hard to read smoothly. There is also very little humor or romance in this book. While you feel for the refugee story the rest of it is pure cr*p and should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridget Jones goes to Africa","review":"Ever wonder what it would be like if Bridget Jones got a job in an African refuge camp during a famine? Wonder no more! This is a valiant attempt to juxtapose the life of celebrities in London with starving masses in Africa, and the crassness of the celebrity-charity culture, but it just doesn't work. A proto-Bridget-Jones character has a bad relationship, so the logical thing to do is to became the administrator of an African refuge camp (???). I think it would have been more effective if the book just stayed in London, because the parts in Africa are contrived and pat."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. I was very disappointed because I was expecting something as good as Bridget Jones but instead got a book that was not funny or, in anyway, believable. The characters were so incredibly annoying that I had trouble even finishing the book. Ms. Fielding's first book should have remained unpublished in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Nice Surprise!","review":"I was a little worried about taking on this debut by Helen Fielding. I mean, how could it be as good as the \\"Bridg Jones\\" books? It's just different. Not better or worse...just not comparable. And, I don't think it's far to just presume she's going to always write like that. This was a really nice book and I had lots of fun making my way threw it. \\"Cause Celeb\\" certainly has my vote. A really nice treat and a great debut novel. Helen Fielding's got the RIGHT STUFF! I can't wait to read more of her work. BRING IT ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for her next novel!","review":"Very entertaining; couldn't put it down. Came upon this after finishing the delightful Bridget Jones' Diary. How she combines comedy (albeit satire) with the harrowing situation in Africa without trivializing is particularly deft. Am I the only person that thought her villains - Oliver and Daniel in BJD were awfully similar?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This is an excellent book. The characters are well done, and the scenes in Africa make you feel like you are really there. As someone who once considered making a similar life change, this gave me a small taste of what it may have been like. If you like Bridget Jones but crave more substance in the story line, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cause Celeb","review":"I am not reviewing this book, I am providing information to my book club so they can decide which book to read next. I order several books each month for my book club. At times, it is necessary for me to provide a summary of each of the hostesses choices so the book club can pick a read for the upcoming month.

If you don't have any Ganstarr joint's you this is a must. there are a few joints that i could say i would have used, but i won't complain.For those of you who HAVE been keeping up with them, this is STILL worth getting, There are new joints on here that are straight MIND BLOWIN'!!! Including tracks featuring Inspecta deck, one featuring the formentioned Lyrical \\"Master\\" Rakim.

But if you take the time to read through it, this book actually does a nice job of explaining the subject. Other books I've read just show you how to construct vanishing points, measuring points, etc. But this book actually does a decent job of explaining why these constructions work. It has given me an deeper understanding which makes all the techniques much easier to remember and apply. Highly recommended for anyone serious about learning to draw in perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aggression's limit.","review":"This CD is one of the most aggresive one's out there period. The CD starts off with the brutal masterpiece \\"Certain Death\\" and goes straight into a flurry of face melting songs one after another. Definetely ranked along with \\"Pleasure to Kill\\" (by Kreator) in the speed section.Sadus fits in with the Death/Thrash categorie. Darren Travis puts down some very harsh (good) vocals. Kind of like if Mille Petrozza lost the German accent, but a tad more aggressive.\\"Chemical Exposure\\" really is just what you need in your collection if you're serious about metal (good metal)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight No More","review":"Most \\"professionals\\" try to make fighting acceptable in relationships and I think that is to justify their own weaknesses.

They treat people like they are stupid and seemed more concerned about having the negative comment removed instead of being concerned about my issue. On top of not receiving the CD driver, the car charger broke the third time I ever used it. It was all a waste of my time and money. After not receiving the CD driver, the car charger breaking a few days later and the rude service, I opted out of the items being replaced. What guaruntee do I have that the replacement will have the CD driver or the car charger won't break again, and having to wait, again, for them to ship the replacements. It's not worth it. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gadzooks! My purse purloined by ren-faire poseurs!","review":"This album doesn't suffer a lack of talent as far as musicianship goes. Tracks #6 and #16 are good and show what this album could've been. The problem lies in the songwriting, arranging and production. This is NOT Rennaissance music! I'm not sure what it is trying to be, but it fails miserably. Ms. Night has a lovely voice, but she doesn't really stretch herself. After the first couple of songs, her singing becomes tedious. Rock rhythms, synth bass lines and the excessive doubling and reverb on the vocals not to mention the weak lyrics and songwriting really disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackmore's talent shines through yet again!","review":"Ritchie Blackmore is no doubt the greatest guitarist this world has seen.....from Deep Purple to Rainbow and now with Blackmore's Night. Certainly a far cry from his \\"Smoke on the Water\\" days, Ritchie has embraced a medieval feel and produced another showcase of musical abilty and songwriting talent. Candice Night on vocals adds a whole new dimension to the music and sounds terrific throughout. Great album !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID","review":"Another solid effort by Ritchie Blackmore. The track \\"Under a Violet Moon\\" is top of the line. I will say that I much prefer the more energetic version of it which is on the DVD. Ditto with \\"Wind in the Willow\\". But how cool is \\"Durch\\"? Or \\"Beyond the Sunset\\"?. Gotta love those instrumentals!!! Not that I have anything against Candy's smooth, yet unremarkable voice....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackmore does it again!","review":"Richie blackmore has always been my fav. guitarist. When he is with Deep Purple or Rainbow he always rocks. On this cd he changes from electric to acoustic guitar, but it still rocks. This cd is mellow, but it cranks at the same time. It reminds me of what Stevie Nicks would have sounded like with Richie on guitar. A must cd for any Richie Blackmore fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you sure this is Ritchie Blackmore?","review":"Ok, no offense to all of the Deep Purple/Ritchie Blackmore/Rainbow fans out there, really. My husband is the biggest Blackmore fan, so when he said that he wanted this CD for his birthday, I of course obliged.I couldn't believe my ears when he popped the disc in. Hence my title of \\"Are you sure this is Ritchie Blackmore?\\" I have been subjected to Blackmore's priors for years, and needless to say, I am NOW a fan!!! This is a long distance from his usual metal style.I hate to admit it, but I want this CD now. I'm going to have to fight the husband for it. The acoustic on here merely adds to his lengthy list of talents, both solo and w/the various bands he's been with.I eagerly await the next Blackmore's Night purchases I am about to make. For a not so huge Blackmore Fan...it's FANTASTIC!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Travel on a CD","review":"Blackmore's Night has proving that time travel is possible. Listeing to this disc at points it is easy to see yourself hoisting a foaming mug of ale with your friends in a tavern while a traveling bunch of minstrels play. The entire cast of musicians who worked on this disc are phenomenal and this has resulted in a CD that is quite simply a lot of fun to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively and Entrancing","review":"I had not been previously familiar with Blackmore when I bought this album, and I didn't know what to expect. I was not disappointed. While some of the tracks tended to get redundant, most of them kept up a lively and entertaining atmosphere; there is also a nice blend of upbeat and slower tracks that keeps the album as a whole moving. Candace Night has a great vocal talent, but Blackmore as the main composer and instrumentalist was the one that enraptured me with his original melodies. My favorite tracks were the title track, Spanish Nights, and Gone With the Wind, which all have a flavor of something wild and gypsy-like as well as a definite modern twist. Altogether, this album was very enjoyable and has remained one that is found quite often in my cd-player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just slightly better than \\"Shadow...\\"","review":"This CD is only *slightly* better than \\"Shadow of The Moon\\". To repeat my opinion about Blacmore's Night efforts: it's a sentimental and not very skillful stylization for early music. Apparently Blackmore is a very good guitar player, but his skills as a composer (esp. concerning melodies) are somewhat questionable. I wouldn't mind this album if it didn't pretend to be something it isn't - a modern interpretation of an early music. It's just some \\"romantic\\" pop. And finally, if you really like \\"Past Time with Good Company\\", give \\"Pastime with Good Company\\" by Gryphon and \\"King Henry's Madrigal\\" by Jethro Tull a listen - and see which one you like the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic,poetic...a great album.","review":"Ritchie Blackmore has always been known as a guitar god;'Under a Violet Moon'introduces Ritchie the poet,the minstrel and the troubadour.This is a one of a kind trip,an excursion into magic and poetry-for this one you will need some good wine,true friends and companions,incense and candle light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great effort from Mr. Blackmore","review":"A Great pice of work.

In case you didn't know; anything that is \\"screwed\\" or \\"chopped\\" is just a remake of the original album...but not in a good way. \\"Screwed\\" is like taking the entire album and slowing it down so that the song sounds like it is being played in slow motion.

Although he had thrown in a dose of R&B with a crossover appeal on his earlier albums (as with the hit \\"Close to You\\"), he had never quite fully crossed that line into sheer pop-dom. But now his music has become a disturbing mix of Shaggy on a bad day and The Spice Girls (Listen to \\"Mary's Got a Baby\\" to see what I mean.). I can count on one hand the number of songs on CombiNation that are identifiable as reggae. I suppose the worst thing that could've happened to Maxi Priest occurred when his non-reggae songs \\"That Girl\\" and \\"Summertime\\" (with Shaggy) became popular, thus giving him license to officially sell out."},{"rating":"1","title":"True example of how artist sell-out thier soul!","review":"Maxi could have left a huge foot print on the walk of Reagge music if he could only remember his roots instead of what is hot on the market.

It fits four comfortably, six snugly. They can eat next to us and go off to play without disturbing anyone. I leave this out all summer so that we can do crafts outside or just have snacks on the patio when the weather is nice. I don't know about the reviews regarding bending seat as I've sat on it many times without bending it. I'm 5'2 and 120 lbs. That's plenty big for those who said a large child could bend the seat. Anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will bend, warp quickly","review":"I bought this table for inside use. I liked the idea of bench seating for my toddlers. It is a safe table with big some issues. As soon as your child sits on the table (& believe me he won't be able to resist :) the table will sway/bend in the middle & stay that way. It makes it worthless for building blocks, arts, etc....it becomes a tea party table only & even then frustrates kids because nothing will stand up on it. You won't want to give them real food on it because everything will topple & fall off.I just ordered 2 desk size Virco tables with adjustable legs because I know they will never bend.

This was the only place that I could find this table online without having to pay a ridiculous amount of money to have it shipped. (And I couldn't find it in a store anywhere).

Even the comic songs score points: \\"When I'm Not Near The Girl I Love...\\" and \\"The Begat.\\"This original cast recording has sound that is not the best, but the performers shine and until a new, complete recording is made, this one will have to do.

I'm a huge Dean Martin fan, and this movie cemented it for me. They just don't make guys like that anymore. The movie offers lots of quotables, like \\"ha ha and ho - that's a jolly notion\\" and is, that I've ever found, the **only place** to find Dino singing \\"I Only Have Eyes for You.\\" I am so very happy it's finally out on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY if you're a fan of Runyonesque characters","review":"I am NOT a fan of Damon Runyon or \\"Guys and Dolls\\", but I DO like Martin and Lewis, so I got this DVD.

I may trade this one back in to Amazon for store credit.I also noticed, as another reviewer here did too, that the DVD's cover art is peculiar. As far as the disc, the actual digital film transfer is well done, and the color looks very good for being more than a half-century old.- William"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poop-tastic","review":"The enzyme has become hard to find around town.

Gerhardt's interpretations of these selections from great film composers (there's a whole series, see my other recommendations) are stunning, true to the original recordings, with all the passion and grandeur that they deserve without having to conform to a) screen timing, and b) the limitations of monaural optical film soundtrack methods of the time.Finally, that these are available in Dolby Surround, is NO gimmick. These 1970s recordings, remixed for CD release in Dolby Surround, sound FABULOUS with a receiver in Dolby Surround, Pro Logic, or Pro Logic II Music decoding. (I don't recommend you use \\"movie\\" settings, as the music isn't really meant to be channeled to Left, Right, and Center.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Useless","review":"I still can't believe it..... I was such a fan of Chantay savage, yearning for this new album for years. \\"this time\\" is one of the worst album i possess. there ain't no song that saves the cd; each one looks like the other; the production is so poor and common....a total DISASTER. I love chantay's two first albums, \\"here we go again\\" and \\"i will survive.\\" Steve \\"silk\\" hurley's production was simply great, as usual.

Well she has come out with a killer album that although long in the making is even better. This is THE album of the year so far.

Once out she wants to build her \\"own organization\\" so she can start her own record label, although I couldn't figure out why she needed her own record label. She mostly spends her disposable income on clinging clothes that make her look chunky.As a new drug dealer in town, she steps on the toes of the existing one. The writing was cliche and the dialouge was terrible. The actors couldn't deliver their lines with any kind of realism.

I also used STP total feul system cleaner two times. now the car barely shows any rough idle. I can't say it was STP or this filter really. It's just a filter just like other filters and if it do good for a lifetime, that's a mystery for me too.

I don't want to tell there is not any, but I can't sense anything and to be honest, 1 to 4 HP increase is REALLY NOTHING. so, if you want to order this, don't fool yourself. just consider the economic side of the story and order it. as opposite of what is advertise, You'll gain no excitement with this purchase at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice","review":"I'm a homeschooler and we were studying ancient Israel recently.

I bought it on recommandation from Country Living, July 2002, a beautiful photo of Boxer puppies, and expected the book to be a continuation of various breeds with just that puppy feeling. The Boxer photo is a good shot - you can almost feel the softness and sweetness so wonderful about puppies. The rest of the shots - well nosehairs - a shade of something or other dog-bodypart - etc. have little or no pup feeling whatsoever. This is a book for someone interested i photography -if even, not one who wants to look at wonderful shots of puppies. (I am really sorry I also ordered the book 'Dog' arriving on a later shipment and therefor too late to cancel.)

Aikido and Tai Chi Chuan are both internal martial arts and I would have thought that the philosophies, techniques & applications would have been described in more detail than maybe the two sentences mentioned in the entire book. A great deal is discussed about the history of the Chinese Martial Arts and its influences into the Japanese martial arts, which is fine and perhaps from which the fundamental relations are drawn from.

The two modes I stick to are Ultra and Marathon. I mostly play Ultra because the rocket ship animation that comes up after you lose when playing Marathon can get annoying after a while.The previous version only allowed you to move one space laterally for every space the piece dropped. Very tough. In my opinion, the nicest change in this version of the game is the ease you can slid blocks laterally. The one for one idea is gone. Here in DX, I've gotten to level 30 with regularity, whereas before in previous versions, I was lucky to get past level 20.I'd recommend this game on that change alone. The fact you can keep records for yourself is just a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and very wonderful","review":"Ignore anybody who tells you you can't enjoy this movie unless you know what was going on in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. That's pompous, ignorant bull. This is a delightful, gently but ruthlessly hilarious movie about human incompetence, which is not limited to any country in any decade, or to any political or economic system.We human beings like to imagine we're clever and competent, but were aren't and never have been. We're destroying our beautiful world and ourselves along with it, and the more we try to stop the faster we career toward self-destruction; we aim for the brakes but always hit the accelerator. We're a race of idiots, and anybody who believes otherwise is the biggest fool of all.This is a great movie, and its greatness has nothing to do with Communism or any other ism but with its uncompromising but compassionate and very funny look at what bumbling dolts we all are.

However, this morning my husband pointed out, as he was going to refill the kettle, that around the rim of both the lid and the opening there are \\"rust\\" marks, and it would probably be a good idea to clean it. I took a soft scrub type sponge, and needless to say, the marks are not coming off. I really find this unacceptable. I have had many other stainless steel kettles that have never shown \\"rust\\".

It is lovely to look at but the handle heats up so that it is dangerous to pick up when you have heated the water. When I pour the water, it is inclined to splash in all directions. If you look inside the spout, you can see a smaller ring of metal that must have been someone's brainchild, but it was a bad idea. The plastic on the handle is the only part that does not heat up and you can see by the picture that it is impossible to avoid touching the metal sides of the handle.

The whistle is loud enough to get my attention, without being too \\"shrieky\\". It heats water quickly. I do need to use a hot pad to pick it up right after the water reaches a boil. The description \\"brushed stainless steel\\" is accurate; the brush marks are visible. The shape is less attractive to me than the shape of the same model with colored enamel; I chose this one for ease of cleaning and durability.

It has a good whistle, the handle reqires no potholder, & it is good-looking. The lid fits very firmly so that there is no worry about it coming off while pouring the hot liquid. The spout cover design works perfectly so that you never have to worry about losing the cover, and the 2 quart capacity is perfect for making a large pot of tea.

That's because I feel like this one needs to be defended from some of the negative reviews.1. Boiling a full pot doesn't even get the handle remotely hot.2.

This is well constructed, with heavy gauge metal4. boils quickly5. the axis for the lid is well made and simple, reducing the chances for mechanical issues.6. produces a nice loud whistle7. no issues with rust in the first month of use at least"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Aid Tea Kettle","review":"I looked at everything on Amazone and this one caught my eye. Reviews always cause me to pause, because many are so negative. I finally decided that you just can't please everyone, so I bought it. It is just fine. I use it every day at least once. I would buy it again in a second. I really don't understand why some others were so unhapy with the \\"whistle\\" and the finish. It is a brushed stainless steel pot and lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking Tea Kettle, but ...","review":"This is a nice Tea Kettle. However, if you leave the spout either open of close, it leaks water on the stove. My previous teak kettle did not do this. So I assume it is a faulty design. Wiping the stove multiple times daily can get old. I have returned this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive, solid kettle","review":"This tea kettle is very well built, and as others have mentioned the silicon grips make it even nicer. The whistle is loud, but you can turn it off by leaving the spout up. Only do this if you're staying in the kitchen though - I accidentally let mine boil dry when I went downstairs, and while it's still intact it did get warped a bit. We like the kettle so much I may have to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teapot with Style","review":"This is a great little stainless teapot with a lot of style. Its design allows you to push down a lever which holds the spout open for pouring. It also has easy access to its insides for cleaning. Nice finish, good quality for the money. Very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design - Does not last","review":"I bought one of these 4 years ago. It's a nice enough kettle - I had no trouble with the handles getting too hot or anything, and I like the 1-piece construction of the body (I've had kettles come apart t the seams before) but it started to deteriorate after 2 years. Call me old-fashioned, but a teakettle should last 20+ years if not abused.The spout and whistle-cap mechanism are not as well-constructed as the body of the kettle. The spout began to get loose and the cap started wobbling after about 2 years of use - it became tricky to get the cap to sit right (and if not, no whistle)About a month ago, the mechanism stopped being able to hold the cap open - now it won't stop whistling unless I prop the spout open with something.I'm buying something else this time**FYI - after reading the reviews here I also wonder about the metal content of this item - particularly the spout (one reviewer says it's aluminum, but I think mine is rusting)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great buy","review":"I've had this tea kettle for about a month and I thought so far so good until one day when I was washing I noticed a bit of rust inside. Then I started noticing rust around the top of the whistler. It's a functional pot in that it serves its purpose to boil water and whistle; however, paying over $40 for something that is supposed to be stainless and rusts within a month leads me to rate this product low; needless to say, this is being retunred to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in This Rusty Kettle","review":"I specifically purchased a relatively expensive stainless kettle to avoid problems with rusting. This kettle rusted more quickly and extensively than cheap porcelain ones. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon sold me an old kettle","review":"I just got my stainless kettle, and the hinge is scratched and used! I am applaud by such. I asked for a new kettle, NOT a used kettle. Anyhow, I will have to go to Kohl's or etc. to buy from now on. I am buying a new kettle at Kohl's and exchanging for a new kettle there instead. This also happened last time I purchased a Vulli for my daughter, and it was USED as well. Amazon's quality and goods have gone WAY down. I rather pay more for new items, NOT USED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems - Taking it back!","review":"If you like filtered water, beware. I cannot fill this with filtered water from my fridge because the handle is fixed into place, it doesn't swivel to allow me to get close enough to get the water into pot. The spout won't reach the dispenser either. This is a major problem for me because I like filtered water. It also leaks steam from the lid and dribbles water all over the stove top. I am taking this back, what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you're an average size male, getting your hand in and out of this kettle to clean it is almost impossible. It's definitely not made with American males in mind, perhaps in the land of Lilliputians it would be ok!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tea Kettle","review":"I cannot comment on the kettle's performance. I must have had trouble understanding the ordering buttons, as I had thought I was ordering a (specifically) RED kettle. Not only did my red kettle turn out to be brushed stainless (silver), but I received it too late for Christmas. Not only was it late, it arrived without instructions for returning the item. I have sent (three) Emails to Macy's, asking for return/exchange information. I have now received (seven) Email responses from Macy's apologizing for the delay in responding, but that I should get an answer within three to five days...They should have said three to five weeks!

It left a thick residue on both sides of the lid and pot. I put peanut butter on the residue and let it sit for a couple days and was finally able to wipe off the residue and try my tea kettle.Unfortunately, I was disappointed because my tea kettle did not whistle. The seal isn't tight enough, so steam dribbled out the spout onto my ceramic top. I'm sorry that I will have to return it; I need the whistle since I don't stand over the stove waiting for the water to boil."},{"rating":"1","title":"why make a kettle with a sloppy spout?","review":"love the look and feel but watch your feet when you pour the boiling water out of it. It has some sort of splash delivery system that half does-half does not make it into the cup. It ends up running onto the counter then my bare feet on floor. Seriously, how do you make a tea kettle that can't pour? I keep tryng different ways to pour the water out, ie angle,speed but it always ends the same - a puddle on the counter.michelle milne"},{"rating":"1","title":"6 months then broke","review":"Nice teapot for 6 months. Then the whistle broke. Used it without a whistle for a couple of more weeks and the pouring end spout opener broke. Cheap and flimsy spout pouring opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice kettle","review":"The kettle has a very nice solid design. The handle does get hot, but it not hot enough that I would need to use a pot holder. The water pours out nicely; I haven't experienced any water splashing yet. The lid stays on firmly when close. The whistle is loud. I got a stainless steel one, and I am very please with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea Kettle","review":"This is a great tea kettle. I really enjoy the design. No seam on bottom, nice clean lines, I can hear the whistle well but it is not ear splitting. Do not fill above the spout as stated in directions and you will do fine. Looks great in my kitchen. I do empty it after use and wipe it out to preserve it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it right on the second try...","review":"This is the second kettle I have bought since my son took my old Revere kettle away to college. This one is very satisfactory, does what it should do without fanfare. I keep it on the stove all the time and it looks attractive as well as doing the job. The whistle isn't as loud as my old one, but that hasn't been a problem - I still hear it from the other room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but not practical","review":"The kettle looks nice and works as you would expect. However, the handle gets hot, and the location of the spout cover makes it difficult to release without burning your fingers. I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"The best thing about this kettle is that the interior surface has no welds or seams, so the water is exposed only to steel. Also, after two months, it hasn't fallen to pieces (as some do). Apart from that, what can you say? It's a kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle gets HOT!","review":"The handle does get very HOT on this kettle. It makes me wonder if the designer ever tried this out after making it. The whistle is very quiet and inconsistent in its noise output. If you have lots of water in the kettle, yes it is loud, but if you have just a couple of cups you can not hear it in the next room.It is well made but always very hot on the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.","review":"Got this to use on a glass top stove. Takes forever to heat and you can barely hear it whistle. Might be better for a coil burner or gas stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Function Follows Form","review":"It's difficult for a kettle not to do what it's supposed to do which is to heat water and pour easily. However, I think there are some flaws that only allow me to give this product 2 stars.The primary issue I have with this kettle is that the silicone grip on the handle does not cover the entire handle and leaves some of the stainless steel exposed. With a gas stove, the heat can rise to also heat the handle. When lifting the kettle from the stovetop, the tendency is to grip the entire handle and not just the silicone portion. The same goes for the lid and the spout which I think is positioned in a rather tight spot and too close to exposed steel.The pros -- it's stylish and holds a fair amount of water. However, I think this kettle is about design and less about pragmatic function."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Review","review":"I am writing this review while I am boiling water in my KitchenAid 2-Quart Gourmet Essentials Brushed Stainless Steel Kettle. The time it takes to boil the water is directly related to how much water you put in. Most of the time you never need to use two quarts of water and end up pouring the rest out. THE HANDLE DOES NOT GET HOT. In fact I grabbed the metal portion of the handle just to test it while the kettle was whistling and no problem. The whistle works as you would want a tea kettle whistle to work. It does not drip. I have cleaned the kettle using a sponge with my hand in the kettle. This is a well made and smartly thought out teakettle. You will have it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"well made teakettle","review":"I will give this teakettle five stars if the handle is not hot at boiling point. when I shopping for new the teakettle I make sure there is not plastic parts at all because my old teakettle's plastic part broke after a month. I am very please with KitchenAid teakettle because it is very sturdy & well build."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tea Kettle","review":"I really like this tea kettle. It looks great, but my favorite part is that it has a one piece base. The whistler opens easily and sounds nice. It is easy to pick up and easy to pour. The only drawback is that it is hard to fill through the spout as it doesn't open up as far as some other models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not long lasting","review":"I was given this kettle as a gift about nine months ago. It was used two-three times per day to heat water for tea. It worked fine but the handle got too hot to hold without hot pads if left on to boil for more than a minute or two. The whistle feature fell out of the holding about a week ago so it wouldn't whistle when the water reached boiling. I just left it on the stove for a couple of minutes too long and the water evaporated and the rubber around the handle base melted. Lovely.Overall, it was a good looking kettle but didn't hold up to repeated wear and tear. It would probably be fine if you aren't hard on things and don't use frequently. It was also hard to keep clean. I am now looking for a stainless electric kettle now that won't give off a plastic smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not a stellar kettle experience","review":"for starters, the product arrived with a very marred finish. don't know if all the stainless steel kettles have this, but was a bit disappointed. however, as it would have cost more to ship it back, i decided to keep it and deal and hope for the best.in short: the kettle opening doesn't lend itself to easy cleaning. the handle gets rather hot to the touch when the water boils. the spout opener is a rather ill-thought-out concept -- pushing it down so close to boiling water/steam is not exactly a well-thought-out design feature.in short, you'd probably be better served by a pan of water that has a pouring lip on the side. it's that disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster....","review":"What a disappointment!At first I loved this kettle. It's beautiful, and worked well for us. I didn't even mind that it was a bit difficult to fill. Then the plastic pads that secure the handle melted. The plastic poured down the sides of the kettle and onto my stovetop. Now the handle wobbles back and forth. I guess the kettle is scrap metal. Such a bummer! And a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Issue - Should be Recalled!","review":"Kettle has rubber pads on the handle and where the handle meets the kettle is also rubber. After about 3 weeks of use on a gas 5-burner stove the rubber pads started to melt and shoot hot molten rubber around the kitchen! There is permanent damage to my stove top and a safety concern as my wife tried to remove the kettle from the heat. The rubber dripped all over the stainless kettle and ruined it. Don't buy. I was wondering when I bought it how rubber and heat would work, guess I found out the hard way. This kettle could injure someone, I see a lawsuit in the works it they don't pull this item from store shelves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Kitchenaid, It's not 18/10","review":"Got this just under two months ago and noticed the inside began spotting tiny bits of rust. Just called Kitchenaid and confirmed with a product rep it is not 18/10 stainless steel, it is 18/0 stainless steel. Very good looking but not made of what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle gets too hot to touch","review":"It heats water fine, but...WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WITH THE HANDLE!?Look at the picture, it has rubber on the top and bottom, but the sides are bare metal - you have to delicately hold it without touching the sides or you burn your hands (or just use a potholder).Amazing to me how a company will sacrifice basic functionality for \\"style\\".I'm now shopping for a new tea kettle that won't burn my hand when I pick it up.It works fine otherwise, but I give it one star because it is so frustrating that I need to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"handle gets too hot","review":"I really wanted to love this kettle. It looks good, weighs nicely, holds a decent amount of water, but everytime I actually let it get to a whistling boil, I have to pull out a pot holder to use it or I get burned by the handle. The metal edges get ridiculously hot since the rubber grips do not go all the way around, and it is really awkward to try to hold it so my hand doesn't touch the metal parts. If it just went a little closer to the edge it would work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchenaid Gourmet Essentials 2 Quart Tea Kettle, Brushed Stainless Steel","review":"Do not buy this kettle.

Bad idea; my hair started falling out, the dry patches of skin came back and I gained 10 pounds and never changed my eating habits.

First I started in the shower but moved out of it; I noticed a small amount of water inside the battery housing. I removed the batteries and let it air dry. The second time I used it wholly within the shower and submerged it within the tub which, since it was marketed as waterproof and all, I figured I could do. (i even jammed it shut as hard as possible before operation.) My session ended with no malfunction, but when I opened it up, there was a lot more water in the housing, some of it on the batteries. I towelled it off as best I could, removed the batteries again, and let it dry for several days.Now, it won't come on at all. Switching batteries did nothing. I guess 'waterproof' translates to 'leaky utensil' in German, which is very unfortunate.. I like the design, the quiet motor and the material.

We also noticed that the game stalled between questions but that might be because we have a DVD player from 2001. We also found that the questions began to repeat as early as the second game.

Operating primarily as a guerrilla fighter during the war, over the years many myths arose about the man and his deeds; Mosby puts them into perspective and into a semblance of truth.Unlike many of the war's memoirs, Mosby's recollections are easily read and avoids, for the most part, the stilted language common in those days. Very readable and highly interesting. Mosby was a unique character in many ways, and reading his own accounts of close calls and narrow escapes reveals just how interesting the man was.Recommended for Civil War enthusiasts, students of behind-the-lines warfare or anyone who enjoys a good (and in this case, true) adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful and original novel.","review":"The Angel Max is a truly original novel, written in a prose that is at once detached and cool, intelligent and compassionate, sensitive and perceptive.

There is gentle humor, along with anxiety and sadness in this family, as there is in life for all of us. The book concludes in 1919, an important \\"threshold\\" year in American history.

Oh boy, he punched a guy in the head, I wonder if his head will explode like the other thirteen opponents... guess so. Imagine this, over and over again and you have \\"Fist of the North Star\\" in a nutshell. The plot is nothing special. The animation is not top-notch. Still, some of the characters were half-way interesting... until they died brutally with lots of arterial spray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fist of The North Start The Movie","review":"Its a very good movie. I never knew about it until now. I've watched it multiple times and enjoyed it with everytime I've watched it. I have not seen the series yet but I would like to. I would say to people who are new to Fist of The North Star if you haven't seen it give it a try you'll like it. Its a pretty wild anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"It SUCKED!","review":"I was rather disappointed by this film. I suppose the only unpredictable thing about it is that the \\"Fist of the North Star\\" himself always loses the big fights. The English dubbed dialogue was flat, awkward and just plain lame. Plenty of gore (exploding body parts-- particularly heads), one nude scene. If that does it for you, go buy it. Otherwise, save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning:censored version","review":"I used to watch this movie alot when I was a kid.It was the ultimate violent cartoon, nonstop violence and gore. The video we watched was completely uncut and gory as all hell.But now I have this dvd and it claims that it's all completely uncut for the first time in US but all the gore has been digitally distorted by the distributors.I hate censored films, and I despise those who do the censorship.It angers me like none other, especially when this goddamn dvd is the only available print of this movie out there anymore!Now I have to go track down the old school vhs tape version,which is completely uncut,it's just not as cleaned up as the censored dvd version.Really disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't seen this version","review":"I have the older dvd and had the vhs they were the exact same. Here is what i did however there have been many side stories and stuff. You want to know the legend of Hoktino Ken [...] There it is 4 box sets of the japanese cartoon and the movie. I got the set and all the other movies on my own. I would like to just check out this version but my thing is it seems exactly the same from what i read. Kind of like when Akria got bought out and redid the script so it sucked. I have the original Akira on vhs transfered to dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally ridiculous","review":"Okay, I have to admit that Fist of the North Star was enternaining to watch, assuming you watch it with friends who can mock the movie with you. But it was really, really bad. First of all the movie was entirely too long, the plot was kind of untineresting and I lost track of who most of the characters were for a while. That didn't really matter though. After a point the movie breaks down... ... All it all this movie is terrible the plot is horrible, the violence is ridculous, and the ending will leave you ranting and screaming \\"What the heck was that!\\" for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm this is a terrible anime","review":"I guess you either liked this or you just laughed at it. I laughed at it. No story beyond save the girl, animation was not good... my sister who is in high school has drawn better more elaborate and detailed animation albeit not as long.

This isn't.","review":"I saw this in a small college movie theatre 8+ years ago. I don't remember much detail except for the fact that this movie brought home the fact that all anime is not good.

I would definitely do this again!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Care For Reviews. Care For Your Own TASTE","review":"Well well well. First I would like to stress that these reviews are made in the opinions of the ones who have seen the film. Everyone has a different taste to movies. Well for me, The Fist Of The North Star is like the greatest, most wickest, amazing, animation I have ever seen. I really enjoyed the movie, laughed and cried too. The plot is amazing , the animation is so cool and the violence in this is even more intense than DRAGONBALL ! Others might say that is a stupid movie but I honestly enjoyed watching it and most of my friend enjoyed it too. There are scenes that are comical and tragedical at the same time and you don't know whether to laugh or cry. The scene that touched me most is the scene with Ken protecting the girl! . AMazing STORY. You really have to see it to choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST movie created!","review":"I just can't believe people can actually give this classic a 1 star. Probably still IS the most violent anime or even movie created. Amazing characters like Raoh, Jagi, Rey just to name a few. Action, romance, uuh...action. The more I watch this movie the more I like it! It's still amazing to me that this movie was done in 1986! Don't be fooled by the 1996 B-movie version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yay, it's over!","review":"I just got done watching it. I want my two hours back! Sure, the animation and the violence was cool (at least, until it became repetitous), but the story and dialogue made it ever-increasingly tortuous to watch as the movie ran it's course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neurophysiology (History & Evolution)","review":"This book is similar in format and style to Principles of Neural Science by Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell. Nicholls book is half the length of Kandel's, yet just as good. Colored drawings & diagrams are laced throughout the text. It is strongest in auditory physiology, synaptic transmission, vision physiology, & neural development. Clear graphs and line-drawings of intracellular and extracellular recordings abound. Give this book its chance. It should be on the reading list for Medical & Graduate School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Very good book for general cellular and molecular neuroscience.

I don't mind the name but I do mind that the book serve the purpose I buy it for and this book serves that purpose to the T. It is very enjoyable to read and study. As far as I have read it (and I don't have much time to read) I have enjoyed every chapter of it and expect to continue enjoying it. I was sure glad I got it from Amazon.

Baker is a very good writer who's done extensive research, and the book is pleasurable to read. He makes his love for the place palpable without sparing the reader the frustration a visitor/observer often feels. Other travelers staying where I did ended up borrowing this guidebook for its richness of detail and background that theirs (Lonely Planet) lacked. I liked it so much I'm buying another- I had to leave my copy on the plane as we were without licenses, and afraid of tipping-off US immigration.That said, I wish it were updated a bit. The million bicycles Baker writes about aren't there en masse anymore, and Dulce Maria's was fun but not the throbbing delirium he paints. All in all though, I'll buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Had this been the first book I read on Roger Williams, I might have enjoyed it more;however, I feel it is a weak attempt to present Roger Williams' beiefs and their evolution. There was way too much time spent learning of Edward Coke (although interesting, not the subject of the book). There is more to his leaving the Church of England that just being exiled from the Bay Colony. We get no religious philosophy; just political. Why did he found the Baptist Church in America and then leave it? Seven generations back he was my grandfather; he deserves a better telling. A much more filling work is Liberty of Conscience:Roger Williams in America, by Edwin S. Gaustad."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT GET THIS COPY......MISSING SONG","review":"Superstarr Pt.

K-OS is the all around artist: He writes his own lyrics, plays the guitar, hes an MC and even sings. Exit is an album constructed with intellect and experience. At A first listen you can easily hear the time and effort put into making this release. \\"Patience\\" one of my favorite tracks from the record, really connected to me at the time i first heard it, as i felt like he was writing a soundtrack to what was going on in my life at that time. \\"Call Me\\", \\"Superstar\\", \\"Masquerade\\" and \\"Follow Me\\" with fellow Canadian artist Red One (from the rascalz) are a few more of my favorites.

This is their third album, and it's pretty much in the same vein as their first two albums, \\"Le Sang des hommes\\" and \\"Les Armes de Bretagnes\\", an energetic folk-rock w/ slight proggish tendencies. Maybe a bit like late 70's Tull, but with a bit more accessibility, as well as distinctly bluesy and Breton influences (though the use of a lot of harmonica and bombarde). Newcomers, might be better advised to start with the band's live album, \\"Vol de Nuit\\"; like a lot of folk-rock band's, l'Ange Vert's much more energetic live than in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"shot calla","review":"this album is the best of the two ablums uder his belt. both shot calla and six figuers are tight but this one is one of my favorite albums. with the likes of studio ton, my favorite producers and d-shot on the boards its a yay area classic. it would of been a world wide classic if he had sam bostic on it. but overall it was real"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly D-Shot singing.","review":"This album isn't to great.

You get a brief commentary from Art Chansky, alot of good pictures and a team roster. The championship year of 1982 gets special attention, which is justified as it was a special team. You're not going to find any major revelations amongst these pages, but if you are a fan of Carolina basketball, this is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad execution","review":"The problem with this book is not the content; Chansky's stories are often interesting. The real problem is that Chansky has serious problems with the English language. Scarcely a page goes by without a mangled mixed metaphor or breathless cliche. If you're a Carolina fan though, you probably won't notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most in-depth, honest chronicle of the best coach ever.","review":"As an avid UNC fan, and Art Chansky fan in particular, this is his best work to date.

It chronicles and illustrates all of Dean's teams from 1961 through 1996. I was blown away by never before seen photographs and stories of Tar Heel teams of the past. Rosters were provided on a yearly basis, but statistics and game scores are missing from this otherwise definitive work. It's not all blue either. The author documents some of the failed strategies and decisions made by the coach of the century. In the end, however it is Dean's World not Dean's List"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative, but not engaging.","review":"I'll give Aldiss credit for creativity -- this story of far future Earth is full of very imaginative landscapes, flora, and fauna. But there's not much else to recommend it. The speculations on the evolutionary history of Earth are a little too implausible to overlook. And the story line seems little more than a mechanism for introducing more outlandish creatures.I expect it would be more enjoyable for younger readers, or those who don't demand that the science in their fiction be at least plausible.As a last note, I should mention that I came across this book as one of Easton Press' \\"Masterpieces of Science Fiction\\" series. Given that it is apparently a classic, my viewpoint is perhaps in the minority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of wonder...","review":"This is a story about the end of the world and the many races of man. It is a story about the Sun nearing its final moments and the plants taking over the world. It is a story about the final days of the planet Earth.The story revolves around Gren and the last of his kind, small people who live in the trees. They live in the middle, not too close to the ground and not to high up, near the tips. It is an adventure story, a story of exploration, as we follow Gren and his tribe as they try to survive.This is not hard science fiction and, in fact, I would not call this normal science fiction. Maybe science fantasy? Or just plain fantasy? The Moon is linked to the Earth by giant webs and one side of the planet is locked towards the Sun, so I guess it is fantasy. I enjoyed the book but I just want to warn you, this is a weird novel about the end of life as we know it and don't know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this win the Hugo?","review":"How did this win a Hugo?

The author chooses to use a psychologically remote and emotionally disengaged third-person writing style, that removes much of the human personality from his writing on this highly personal subject. I find C. S. Lewis or John Goldingay much more engaging and provocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Resource for Nurse Managers","review":"This is a well organized resource for nurse managers.

A little overwhelming to the novice perhaps, but invaluable none the less. I have never before seen a reference that listed the individual arias in an opera. One quible. The earliest composer cataloged is Monteverdi. As a lover of Renaissance music, I missed Byrd, Palestrina, Josquin Desprez and others in that period. No doubt the material from those earlier eras poses research challenges beyond the scope of the project but the book feels a little incomplete without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect reference","review":"Recently, I became very interested in classical music. But I had one big problem; I didn't have any friend who get some knowledge about classical music. So I decided to buy books for self-teaching. There were three books I have bought until lately; \\"Classical Music for Dummies \\", \\"The Penguin Guide to Compact Disk\\" and this book. I think that they make good combination for a beginner like me. \\"The De Capo Catalog of Music Compositions\\" has every work list of great composers throughout the history of classical music. I couldn't find any similar book like one at local bookstore. It makes this book very unique and valuable. I actually use this book with Penguin's guide every time l buy CDs.

Do NOT buy this. Buy the actual book instead! I know, I know, crazy idea in this day and age, but Cliffs Notes are exactly what is wrong with the world of literature these days: too many people reading the Reader's Digest version, and not enough actually reading great literature! I mean, come on people, the book is less than 200 pages long. You can read it in one sitting. And it's not even that difficult to understand--the prose is limpid and the plot engrossing.

It is so well written I found it more to be like a best selling novel that I just couldn't put down! Dr. Khalsa's theory of bringing Eastern & Western medicine together not only should be used to treat chronic pain, but practiced with all types of medical treatments. After reading this book I immediately went for treatment with Dr. Khalsa. Seeing his true dedication in helping people understand the way to use the tools nessary to help ourselves was just the precise information I was looking for, for many years. I can't thank you enough Dr. Khalsa, for what you and your knowledgeable staff have taught me.

The doctors knew of no cure. I was lost in a depression so deep. I had no hope.I cried when I read the first chapter of The Pain Cure. For the first time someone could put into words what the pain I felt was. It explained to me why I hurt, and what I could do about it. And from this I have sought the route so I can 'endure my pain without suffering from it.' Last week I did the three mile M.S. walk with my high school. I am doing things in my life that never would have been possible if I had not have undergone the awakening that I have.

I of course have heard of the Squallus, and though I worked at Bupers for almost 10 years, I had never heard of \\"Swede\\" Momsen, who headed up the rescue. This is compelling reading. My Aunt felt this book was better than the \\"Perfect Storm\\" (At least the ending was happier). This is very compelling reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifyingly wonderful","review":"The Terrible Hours enthralls from the beginning. I find Charles Momsen's story to be one of a true hero, perserving because he knew it could be done, and because it had to be done.

A great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summer Read","review":"This is a well-written and researched book that keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat. It's only flaw is that the author did not include any pictures or diagrams in the book, so that it is bit hard to understand what the various rescue ships, people and (most importantly) technology looks like, as well as where the various compartments of the sub are. Overall, an excellent summer read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I love reading these type books and hearing these stories, but \\"The Terrible Hours\\" was difficult to get thru and was more of a tribute to Swede Momson than the actual rescue of this doomed submarine. I found myself skimming thru pages of technical mumbo jumbo about Momson's experiments in order to read about the actual rescue itself.And the lack of a few diagrams of the interior and exterior of the Squalus, made the book all the more difficult to really understand and grasp the entire story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Tale","review":"As I write this review, the world waits to hear of the fate of the Russian submariners aboard the Kursk. When the news first broke, I immediately thought of this book and Swede Momsen. That same night, my sister called me and said, \\"Have you heard? 'The Terrible Hours' is happening all over again.\\" Neither of us had ever forgotten this book.Peter Maas does a terrific job of recounting Swede Momsen's career in the context of this spectacular rescue. You don't need to be interested in submarines or the Navy - just in what can be accomplished with creativity, persistence, and heroism.My one quibble is that I do agree with the reviewers who would like illustrations - that's why the four stars rather than five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me awake!","review":"This book on tape was perfect for a journey from Boston to Rochester, New York. I found the miles flying by as I was drawn ever deeper into the suspenseful crisis of a trapped submarine. Even though it was clear that some of the men survived, because of the amount of first-person information that was given, I still found myself on the edge of my car seat as the minutes ticked by and the air in the sub became more and more toxic and colder.

I could hardly put the book down. It was enjoyable to read about someone who has made such a difference, yet he seems to be relatively unknown outside Naval circles. The only reason I would not give the book 5 stars is its lack of a diagram of the sunken submarine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me the chills","review":"Reading this book in the aftermath of the Russian Submarine Kursk disaster really gave me the chills. The author does a great job explaining how horrible the conditions are when you're sitting hundreds of feet down on the ocean floor in a dead submarine hoping that someone on the surface can find and rescue you before your oxygen runs out or you freeze to death.The book really shows how a few ingenious American heroes overcame huge obstacles and saved the lives of sailors who surely would have perished if it were not for their quick thinking.I really enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who is as interested US Submarine history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer in need of an editor?","review":"I was interested to learn about this true story but couldn't make it past the third chapter.

Characteristic of much of his writing, the book is honest, bold and clear. Nouwen tells it like it is, and shares authentically from his own life. Personally, I find authors who are unafraid to include their own joys and struggles with their spiritual lives to provide me with so much more hope, and challenge. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about what it means to be a leader, thinker, or seeking to deal with their own wounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Academic","review":"I'm reading this book with a group of friends, and we all were surprised at how \\"academic\\" this book is written. By \\"academic\\" I mean, this book seems to be written during Nouwen's days when he was still at Yale University. The wording and word choice of the sentences are much more collegiate than his later works, which he wrote after going to L'Arche in Toronto. The book is still great and speaks powerfully to things of the Spirit, but it is just a little bit more difficult to understand than say, a John Eldredge book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minister self-care","review":"Hey, all ministers should heed the advice of this book.

Nouwen consistently cultivates the meaning of authentic relationships one must have between him/herself, God, and those met in life.This is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrarian","review":"I have hated this book ever since I first read it.

However, the author spends so much time preaching his own personal beliefs that this book and Last Days become boring beyond belief.

If I wanted a book on religion or sprituality, I would have gone to that section of the bookstore.By the way, when I did get to the end of the Ezekiel Option, I was severely disappointed. I read my last of his books.Eric"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evangelism Poorly Disguised as a Novel","review":"This book is terribly disappointing. I thought I was buying a novel. What I got was a poorly written novel selling messianic christianity. One minute there is political intrigue; the next there are pages of prophets, people falling on their knees and nuclear disaster prevented by \\"missiles\\" from outer space.

The Ezekiel Option is like seeing next year's news headlines today. The plot is very good, and gives the reader insight into the psychology and ambitions of the current governments of the world. It is truly amazing how many events Mr. Rosenberg introduces in this novel as \\"fiction\\" which have since transpired. Surely, the coming of the Lord must be soon. This should open readers' eyes to the greatness of the Bible, as God has been so gracious to tell us what is about to happen and how to prepare. I would have given five stars, but as a christian, I am a little put off by all of the violence. I believe that Mr. Rosenberg is very talented and could have written an equally exciting book without so many blood stains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review - The Ezekiel Option","review":"Outstanding book by Joel Rosenberg.

It is an extremely fun and exciting read that will be hard to put down. I'm a very slow reader, but kept the book in my hands all week, everywhere I went, until it was finished - it was THAT good. There have been a few reviews that are quite hard on this author, but I truly think they were mostly without good reason. HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Prior to receiving this book as a gift from my wife, I had not read Rosenberg. Now I am a fan. To me it seems that it shouldn't matter if you are a prophecy believer or not. The writing is first-rate with great pacing. My only critique is that there were too many characters for my liking. I felt like I needed an organizational chart at times.While I don't buy into prophecy scenarios, I did find that this book left a lasting impression. Now when I watch the news or read news magazines ; stories that contain both Russia and Iran aspects really stick out. When I watch or read I do so with an eye toward this book. It is somewhat spooky the way things are lining up... Maybe it is just confirmation bias on my part.Michael L.

It was even better then \\"The Last Jihad\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it again.","review":"Rosenberg just keeps bringing it. I think there is something supernatural about his writing.

The author constantly switches from subplot to subplot so that the storyline developes in a rather slow and choppy fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading descriptions","review":"This book is of course filled with political intrigue but what should be said up front and isn't is that the primary goal of the book is to give Mr Rosenberg a forum to sell his religious ideology. If you are not looking to read a book with an overt evangelical Christian message then this is not the book for you. Every page is filled with Christian ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swimming in the shallow end","review":"I keep desparately hoping to come across intelligent evangelical fiction but I fear that is not to be. After the appalling Left Behind series(which only left behind your wallet but took all your money)I was determined not to buy any more of this genre. But, after hearing it praised by Rush Limbaugh, I relented and ordered it. What a waste. The characters are two dimensional, the plot is boring, the preaching is obvious and once again, I found myself swimming in the shallow end of the great literary pool of truly Christian literature. Where are the Graham Greenes and the Chestertons???? When dealing with the ultimate things i.e.,the battle of good vs. evil, eternity and salvation, can't we please expect more than the adult equivalent of the comic book Bible I bought for my 6 and 8 year old children????

Go to a book store and read the last eight pages and see for yourself. PLEASE don't waste your money on this piece of preachy claptrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Not Very Good","review":"Part thriller, part religious polemic Joel Rosenberg proves that you can't do both effectively in one book. Whats really painful is that he is not a bad writer. The prior two books in this series were good, solid reads. Thats why I bought this one and boy was I disappointed. His apparent recipe was 2/3rds thriller and 1/3 Religious content without any effort to blend the two. The result was an awkward and unbelievable tale with little redeeming value.I am amazed at the reviews praising this book. I cannot believe they read the earlier books in the series. I for one am finished with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned - this is a missionary work NOT a Novel","review":"This book really upset me. It started as a great thriller - but somehow turned into a missionary doctrine. And of course written by someone with a name Joel C Rosenberg - it was a total shock. I have no problems - with biblical prophesys. What I have an issue with is a book that hides on the outside what it is. And also has many characters (including several Jewish/Israeli ones) finding Jesus in the course of the book This seems to me a Jews for Jesus manuscript. Also please note the book has Hebrew writing in it includes God's name in Hebrew - so it should not be taken into a bathroom.There is nothing wrong with someone writing this book and people reading it - but there is an intentional misrepresentation of what this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"Most boring book I've read in a long time.

I am mosthappy and fortunate to have been able tohave these in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action novel from the front page","review":"Rosenberg's novel are always action oriented; the Ezekiel Option is no less. His writing looks like it is from the front page of today's news papers: Iran goes nuclear, Iran and Russia decide to erase Israel, and Israel hints to hold nuclear weapons.The crux of the novel is how the US President and Israel will support each other--or not. Jon Bennett and Erin McCoy continue their spy business, yet get closer each novel on a personal level. Fortunately, Rosenberg spares us any lurid sex scenes.Characters such as Gogolov and Jibril show their true intentions, and Rosenberg does not spare us too much on the violence they are capable. Well, at least he makes it clear enough for my imagination.Very good book in the sequence of Rosenberg Middle East novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put this book down.","review":"I liked this book.

And the first 1/4 of the book was. But by the halfway point, I was so turned off by the heavy proselytizing that it was tough to finish. I have no problem with books of all POV, but I don't like to be preached to. There were multiple scenes where the characters engaged in heavy Christ-oriented prayer sessions, that had nothing to do with the plot. If it advances the storyline, great. But these passages appeared to be inserted simply for the sake of evangelical prayer.This book gets a two-star (instead of one) because the story was ok, but geez (pun intended), ease up Joel.

My husband & I plus several friends have really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't what I expected....","review":"I am an avid reader and looked forward to THE EZEKIEL OPTION, having read Mr. Rosenberg's other two novels. However, this one is very different and not written in the same vein as the other two, even though this is a continuation.The overtly pentecostal Christian overtones were a bit much for me [ and yes I am a practicing Christian]. Mr. Rosenberg has changed publishers with this one - now using the same one as the LEFT BEHIND series. As a result, Mr. Rosenberg's entire premise amd writing style have changed.If you are a reader who likes political thrillers, this one is probably not for you. if you are a reader who enjoys 'end of days' novels, you wil love it!I have read my last book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real live human-type people in this book..","review":"You would have thought that by his third book, Joel Rosenberg would have learned something about characterization and scene setting. But he hasn't.I never expected characters of the quality drawn by W E B Griffin or Bernard Cornwell, for that takes a master, but once again, I don't care whether Rosenberg's hero survives. Even when Bennett receives the severed finger of his fiancée, he has no emotional response.The whole plot uses a great deal of action to support what could happen if the Ezekiel prophecies came true. In this volume, no attempt has been made to hide the author's evangelical mindset, including a quotation of the 23rd Psalm in its entirety.I gave it the old college try. I read three of Rosenberg's efforts. I will now return to authors who write characters that make me care whether they live or die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Rosenberg's Triumphant Return","review":"This book is the best of the Rosenberg trio of thrillers. If Mr Rosenberg feels that the prophecies of Ezekial 38 & 39 are imminent, then we should all try to get right with God, since it is widely believe in Christian circles that this is the prophecy that precedes the immediate 2nd coming of Christ.The ability of the author to chronicle the GW Bush presidency during his three books has been uncanny, and this book does not disappoint. All of his political training has paid off and we the reader are the beneficiary. Truly, Mr. Rosenberg was born to write this material - to warn us all of what's to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Rosenberg, you ruined my weekend!!","review":"What a wild ride...I was hooked from the first sentence.

It's not as easily digestible as his debut. I think his songwriting is an improvement and his guitar playing is as good as on the first one. The playing here is more soulful than firery, and it's aslo more in the service of the song.

Luis Bunuel has influenced many great directors, including David Lynch and Pedro Almodovar. The bonus feature included in this DVD, Slice of Bunuel, is excellent. Juan Luis Bunuel (Luis's son)sheds some interesting light on the film, his key point being - I believe - Un Chien Andalou was meant to defy interpretation.

The frame was severly cropped at the top (some scenes feature actors lopped off at their foreheads). Contrast was boosted to the point where significant detail is lost. As if this weren't enough, there is a wide unsightly glitch running horizontally across the screen that lasts for 5 or so frames. Despite the interviews with Bunuel's son which are the only things worth the time here, I would avoid this disc. The film itself I think is great. It's a shame that a staple of art cinema has been handled so poorly for DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, horrible DVD","review":"The video is geometrically distorted, interlaced, has blown out contrast, almost no detail at all, and horrible sound. TransFlux Films should be ashamed for putting out such poor quality work, yet including a featurette on the cover designer.Everyone should avoid this DVD and go for the BFI double feature with L'Age D'Or, which has a watchable Un chein andalou for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Years Later...","review":"WOW! Where do I start with this one? Here is an absolutely brilliantly realized film that doesn't even try to follow a coherent plot. It's the most insane film I've ever seen, and I loved every second of it. It's tough not to look past the images for what they are, though, because your mind tries to fill in the blanks and write its own story. Scenes will change their mood suddenly and without reason, creating an utterly shocking experience. I was surprised to see such sophisticated technique in such an unstructured film. Un Chien Andalou is a masterpiece of the absurd, and I strongly suggest anyone with a taste for the weird see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this DVD at all costs","review":"I am in complete agreement with aging punk, who writes \\"The Facets DVD of Un Chien Andalou is a disgrace.\\" The BFI DVD is better, and may be omoing out on blu-ray. The BFI print is cropped and highly inferior to a restoration made in 2003 in Spain as part of an exhibiton entitled Un Chien Andalous 80 Years Later.\\" Search under books as the DVD comes with three excellentbooks from the exhibition (in SPanish). This DVD is not cropped and has two soundtrack, one the 1959 with tango music, and the other all Wagner's Tristan und Isolde timed better to the image and supposedly what Bunuel and Dali intended. (I love those tangos though.) It's not clear whether the BFI will release a new DVD or blu-ray of this excellent Spanish restoration or of the much poorer one they used for their DVD. The BFI is also bringing out Bunuel's L'Age d'or on blu-ray and DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Extreme, Bizzare, Fun,","review":"This is the Granddaddy of all expermental avant-garde films. It is a must for all film-buffs. And, it will definitly make you say HUH????"},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"It seems like this film is not my cup of tea, or maybe I'm missing something, am I? I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but this beholder couldn't find any beauty in this film. I try to be open minded when it comes to art, but I also think that there's a fine line between art and rubbish, and to me this film classifies as the latter one.The reviewers can talk as much as they want about surrealism and Freudian stuff, but to me Un Chien Andalou is nothing but a pile of nonsense, a complete waste of my time. It lasts only 17 minutes, just as well! I loved Bunuel's Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie and that's the reason why I picked this film. I should have known better, Salvador Dali is part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album a High Point for Band","review":"This was my first introduction to Add N to X several years back and I remember being amazed by its incredible production, eclectic structure, and consistently excellent melodies. In my opinion this is their best album and is required listening for anybody interested in \\"electronica\\" (i use the word cautiously since one word cannot describe the breadth of styles of bands as musically diverse as Mouse on Mars, Add N to X, Aphex Twin, Manitoba, etc). A must buy and an excellent addition to any music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, amateurish","review":"I tried this out on the strength of Loud Like Nature. I wasn't completely sold on it, but thought that it was promising. Unfortunately, Avant Hard nowhere near as good, and it's hard to believe it is by the same group.It sounds like the work of someone who has just aquired a synthesiser, and is making the amateurish mistake of piling all sorts of \\"cool\\" effects on top on each other, and hoping that the resulting mess will stand up as art.There is simply no conception behind the pieces, which come over as just mishmashes of effects. Worse still, many are with larded over with irrelevant push-button sounds. It sounds like someone was playing an arcade game in the next room, and it somehow ended up in the mix.Buckminister Fuller is probably the most satisfying track, but Ann's Eveready Equestrian is really terrible, with some of the worst keyboards I've ever heard.Clearly, the album has its fans, but I'm sad to say I'm not among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner for sure","review":"I normally don't read romance but I did this one.

The focal point is Rwanda and the genocide of 1994, grim reading in places. Not only did he observe at first-hand and report - he talked with those involved and so earned the respect of the UN and French commanders and especially the RPA. The epilogue needs careful reading to appreciate the lessons learnt on offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"they suck","review":"I will be honest i could not wait for these movies. Ive been a horror movie fan sense i was a kid & i can get into some pretty weird movies but these really suck . I mean i didnt think any were good not even the one that took so long to come out. Please do not waste money or time dont even rent. In fact if i ever run arcoss the people who came up with this idea i would love to jump kick them in the throat. thanks and beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I had hoped for","review":"I remember seeing previews for these movies when they were being shown at movie theaters and they looked pretty good. I know they wouldn't be the best quality films, but I had seen one on TV and it was decent, so I didn't expect a problem from buying these 7.First of all, I was bummed that they didn't give you all 8. Why did you have to leave out that last movie? Was it really that much of a problem? That issue aside, these were mostly pretty lame movies. The story lines were interesting, but most of the actors ruined it. I can deal with cheesy low budget effects, but if you have that AND poor acting then there's no hope.I didn't find a single one of these films \\"To Die For\\". Not even a single moment of any of them was scary. Maybe next time they'll have higher budgets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"I can't begin to explain how completely unscary, non-gory, and boring these movies are. I love almost all horror fimls, especially the corny older ones but these movies were on a whole new level. While some(but few) may have had a decent plot, they lacked anything even remotely scary. The blood and gore was almost non existent. These were honestly the worst movies that I've ever seen. I think that the directors had a contest to see who could make the worst movie on the lowest budget. I watched them one after another praying that they would get better but they actually got worse. I wouldn't watch them again if they were free. I've watched films shot with a home video camera that were better. LONG AND DRAWN OUT, NOT SCARY, NOT GORY AT ALL!!! They should have called it crapfest."},{"rating":"2","title":"gore fest","review":"i love this box set i thought it was a little steep in price but you get what you pay for i liked all the movies but my favorites were the gravedancers unrest and reincarnation for the ture horror lover its worth checking out"},{"rating":"1","title":"was disapointed","review":"I was very excited to see this one.

They all have the same premise and it's starting to get really old. This was another dull horror fest film. It had a few creepy moments, but definately not enough to make it worth buying. I have seen just about every horror fest film and have been let down everytime. Don't bother with this one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy them individually...","review":"Amazon and other retailers/e-tailers sell the individual titles at $14.99.$14.99 x 7 = $104.93.$14.99 x 8 = $119.92.Box sets should cost LESS THAN the same products bought individually.

They do not seem to me to be any scarier than any of the horror out there now.I purchased these because I thought they were done well with some serious BOO factor. I will admit that I rented them before actually buying them.Having seen so many horror movies in my time I found these refreshing. I was a little disappointed that the newest one I've seen, \\"The Abandoned\\" was not part of the seven.If you love horror you will enjoy these.KD"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best in Asian horror","review":"This is one of the best Asian horror films that I have seen.

What a let-down!!! These movies are horrible and only one small step up from men-in-rubber-suits costumes and 1970s FX.

Don't waste your money or your time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reincarnation","review":"I'd seen Shimizu's \\"The grudge\\" and so my expectations were pretty high on this supernatural horror film.It's nowhere near the scariness or originality of the grudge but that bein said, it's not too horrible as far as japanese horror flicks goes these days. The trailer was actually a lot scarier than the actual movie.The special FX are probably better than other stuff I've seen recently in b-type movies.Bottom line, I was expecting much more out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHUCKY GOES EAST .......","review":"Dreadful mix of the \\"Chucky\\" series meets \\"The Shining\\" - this one becomes so confused at the end you're not sure which is which : \\"If the movie within the movie and the present plus the past are one?????Confused?

What the hell kind of name is hed (p.e.)? I had to check it out, and I'm sure glad I did. These guys just take the whole rapcore thing to a whole new level. Rarely will you find a band that combines so many different styles together so well. Some songs are just true crushing hardcore songs, some songs are more hip-hop flavored, some songs are just straight up funk, some songs are all of these in one, and throughout the whole album it just sounds like hed (p.e.) and no one else. I really hope these guys gain the recognition they deserve real soon, because a band this good can't stay underground forever. If you like Snot, Incubus, Ultraspank, or even Limp Bizkit, check this out right now, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Help Earth Develop) Planetary Evoulution","review":"One of the greatest albums I've ever heard.

Once you hear them you'll think to yourself \\"Why did I buy that Limp Bizkit CD?\\" THIS is true Rap/Metal and probably one of the best cd's I own. They combine a lot of different types of music, everything from Funk to Rap to Metal to Reggae. They are 100 times more creative than Limp Bizkit, 100 times heavier than Kid Rock and not as stupid as Slipknot. Songs like Firsty, Serpent Boy and Schpamb are typical angst anthems that everyone will be able to relate to. The best song on here is the opening track, P.O.S., which hides a bit of an Incubus-esque sound in it. T.O.S. (Tired of Sleeping) is as laid back as it is heavy and has a GREAT Bass line. If you like this band I highly reccomend Crazy Town, Snot, Cypress Hill or Psycho Realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"HED PE OWNS","review":"hed(pe) is the best band to come out in the last 5 years.
