The cellist very rarely (that's being generous) decides that BALANCE is an important part of ensemble playing. The fundamental sounds of the instruments never blends, not atypical to other Emerson recordings... Another Emerson recording where poor personal aesthetics interfere with the true musical gestures of the piece (if you're not sure what I'm on about, check out them doing the last movement of Bartok's 4th string quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best recordings of the 8th 4tet","review":"Yes, its only a 20 minute disc but for 7 bucks its well worth it because the Emerson 4tet does such a great job on the performance! You can hear all the parts very clearly (I've heard some recordings before that were a bit muddy). The play it with a lot of depth. The sadness & the irony is all there as it should be. I've heard four other recordings of the 8th & this is by far the best recording technically (on engineering as well as performance) & emotionally. Very good liner notes (an interview) as well. If you want Shostakovich's 8th 4tet, you cannot go wrong with this excellent recording!

It was in a box and I didn't think I needed to pay the $25 assembly fee. Got home, my daughter opened the box and notified me that there was grass intertwined throughout the parts and the parts were out of the bag and just thrown in the box. We thought, oh well, someone must have returned it. She started putting it together and realized that parts were missing. I called Home Depot and the lawn and garden manager informed me it was the last one in the store. I asked him if he could exchange it for the display model and he said, \\"We don't sell display models.\\" I replied,\\"Well you could clean this one up, find the missing parts you'll need in your store and put it up for display.\\" He said in a louder voice, \\"WE DON'T SELL DISPLAY MODELS!!!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a small lawn?

I just HATED dragging out the big noisy gas mower for the front.I am still a bit taken aback at the price on reel mowers... but after using it, I understand.This is no flimsy hunk of aluminum and plastic. This is a nice heavy chunk of metal. The blades will stay sharp for years. It made short work of my lawn and was NOT tedious to push around. The reel spins smoothly and is pleasant to listen to... compare it to the din of gas mowers.I've already had a neighbor ask me where I got it.I gave this mower only 4 stars instead of 5 because:1. The T handle was difficult to attach to the reel. I had to whack at it with a hammer to get it into the correct position on the reel.2. It does NOT work well on taller grass. Anything too tall just gets rolled over. (Incentive to keep the lawn in check.)But these negatives do not outwiegh the positives.Overall, I'm glad I got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small yard regularly mowed","review":"My patch of grass is barely 1,000 sqft, so a gas mower would be overkill and an electric mower too pricey. The 415-16 pushes easily and leaves a reasonaly even lawn. My rationale for choosing 16-inch, over 18 or larger, was easier manuverability and less pushing resistance.I found the drawbacks, as others have mentioned, to be that it leaves the occassional stray blade (as it doesn't have lifting action and won't do taller grass or grass that hasn't been mowed in a while, one would need weed-wack first). In my application it also leaves about a 6-inch edge, since that's as close as I can get because of a fence.But now that the lawn is well managed, regular mowing (every 4-6 days) produces short clippings that work as mulch for lawn.(The 415-16 seems to be sturdy and easy to maintain. Since this is my first push mower, I can't offer any comparison to other brands.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"This is the first \\"in-depth\\" book I have ever read on Ms. Staton, and while it gets me slightly familiar with the person behind the soulful voice, there is a much more to be desired. I thought the book was poorly written and edited. The information contained in this book could have been summed up in a two hour interview. There are no dates given throughout the book, not to mention the little mention of her song catalog- her hits and the stories behind them. She even failed to state her birth name and birthdate. I think greater justice can be done to Ms. Staton's legacy if a biography was written incorporating this book into an expanded, in-depth look at the life of this soul turned gospel legend. I would suggest, in all love, that Ms. Staton grab the microphone before reaching for a pen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you wake up tomorrow","review":"As the song recorded by the author asks, yes, the reader will want to forget ever reading this book. Although it is the self-told story of a phenomenal rise to fame and an anti-climactic decision to focus on spirituality, it gives little insight as to the events surrounding the author's life and talent other than the series of misfortunate interactions with men that seem to mirror the story told in chapter one of her father. There are opinions espoused about just about everyone, and some may find them offensive. The writing style is juvenile and often tedious due to its lack of chronological continuity and a strange interjection of commentary from the writer and her spouse in the last half of the book. The book transitions abruptly from the story of a gifted, dirt-poor child to a sermon by the last chapter having little to do with the story being told. This is proof that one can wake up tomorrow and 'forget all the things you said tonight.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic parts, not like original","review":"A friend had one of the old versions of this.

When it finally I arrived, I was disappointed. This book is primarily aimed at people wanting to open a DVD authoring business and spends much more time on business models, work orders and project work flow than on the technical details of creating DVDs. The included DVD is a planetarium-style slide show of astronomical information.

I was dissappointed by it's contents. Despite the title there is very little information about how to actually produce a DVD. It concentrates more on the business aspect.A shame considering the authors experience.

Bob Sessions brings a wonderful depth to the role of Batman; you can literally feel Batman's utter exhaustion as he fights to restore order to Gotham City.I've never read any of the comics that inspired this audio drama, so I can't comment on whether or not this production does the original storyline justice.This audio drama assumes that the listener is somewhat familiar with Batman's history. However, even the casual Batman follower will find the story relatively easy to follow--and highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable (for kids only)","review":"Batman sounds like Van Helsing's Hugh Jackman and Bane sounds like Bela Lugosi Dracula. Azreal voiced by the guy who voices Batman and during the third disc sounds like Darth Vader. Joker is annoying and the other villains sound like wannabes. Alfred is the only enjoyable voice acting and that's because Michael Gough (Alfred) from Batman and Batman Returns.At times the music reminds me of the original TV show. Don't listen to the boneheads reviewing this, this is really bad and it goes to show you that 90 percent of a making a movie (in this case a audio track with music) casting is the most important element. The script is also rewritten for children can understand.Fans of The Batman will eat up. Fans of Batman: The Animated Series will loathe it. Read the darker comics that inspired this flop instead.

If the lines are inticate and smooth while the rhythm underneath is sparse and and very simple----you have joe soloing. If the soloing has bluesy but in a pentatonic sense (kind of sophmoric playing) with killer rhythm underneath, then Herb is soloing. They complement eachother nicely, but Joe really stands out.Herb does some humorous stuff like playing percussion on the git. Joe says \\"No mustard, No mustard\\", and RB says \\"play something fast\\" before Seven come eleven. A few jokes and nice quotes in the solos, especially Charlie Christian.This is a top Ray Brown album in my book. I transcribed all the lines for every tune. This is how bass should be played. Jake Hanna does a sweet job throughout. One of the many great Joe Pass albums made, complete with spontanaiety and fun. Very musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herb & Joe Are Good!","review":"Herb Ellis And Joe Pass do wonderful jobs each soloing and complementing each other. They have some great songs, and solos as well, though at times it is hard to distinguish between who is playing what. However, their styles and their tone change contribute to us knowing who is playing. This is Seven Come Eleven with another cd, however, it is not hybrid. The solos are great. Unfortunately there is not a song player set up here yet, but I assure you this is worth your money if you like trio jazz kind of stuff.

The size is nice as well, it can easily fit in the palm of one's hand. However, this MP3 player uses a lesser known type of media card. It is available, but I'd highly suggest a player with a CF/CFII or sD card slot. If youre not going to use more than 128 megs (which is alot for most) then don't worry about that. Also, this technology, comparatively speaking, is outdated. For $50 more you can get a much nicer player and more memory expansion options. But, for most this player will do it.

I've bounced it off the floor several times without apparent harm. The software works okay for me under 98SE, though I don't change the music selection that often. Added a cheap smartmedia upgrade no problem. The display is clear and the menus make sense. I don't use the headphones that came with it, so I can't really comment on those.

However, if you sweat while working out or running, this is not the player for you. It keeps shutting down. Then you have to take out the battery and hold down the button until it reboots; definitely annoying while on a run. The belt clip does not secure it well, and it will fall on the ground if you bounce around. And carry an extra battery, it's a bit power hungry. Customer service was fine and the memory upgrade gives you plenty of songs for 3-4 hours.If they make it water-resistant, include a good AM/FM tuner, supply decent headphones (the supplied earbuds always fall out), and ensure it clips on securely, this would be a great, great unit. It was a gift, so I can't complain too loudly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good player, doesn't like sweat.","review":"Good player, it's taken a couple of drops and keeps on playing. Only one problem though: Try not to sweat when you work out. A flaw in the design allows moisture to follow the earpiece wire into the jack in the top of the player, creating intermittent problems. It works again in a couple of days, but I'm sure there's long term damage. Maybe they'll move the jack to the side or bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Product","review":"First experience with a MP3 player. Wow, was it ever easy. The only thing I found confusing was remembering to rename the music files before I copied onto the Nomad IIC. When copying different songs from my CD's, some would have the same track number. Nomad IIC doesn't recognize the difference. When I renamed the tracks to the name of the song. NO PROBLEM. But I had to erase and start over. Once I figured that out, the downloading of songs was real easy. Very durable and portable. The headset that comes with it is okay, but I'm using another pair that I had that I like better. I was very satisfied with the quality of sound. It would have gotten 5 stars if the instructions for downloading included renaming files before downloading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an Ipod, but a great player!","review":"This is my first MP3 player, but I have used others beforeI just got this Mp3 player, and it was player my favorite tunes in just 5 minutes. I have to say, that the software is much easier than I though it would be, based on the reviews, but all you have to do to get songs on your player is to click on the song, and click transfer, and thats not hard at all!Also, the headphones aren't that uncomfterble, if you wear them correctly.The one thing that could improve is the belt clip, but that's not incredibly important to me, but it would have been nice with a better clip.All in all this is a great beggining player, and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent player","review":"This is a great player.

I suggest that you price shop, i bought this a week ago... anyway, i think so far that this player is a great value for it's money, it's hard to find an upgradeable mp3 player with 128 mb for this great price.

However you do need to keep the level of water on the reference end at the same point. I find renting an auto leveling rotating laser to be much faster when the job requires making multiple measurements, as in establishing a level plane. But the technical simplicity and accuracy of utilizing water levels is unmatched.

While it is of nice, solid metal construction and has some interesting features, the actual sprinkling area is about half of what is depicted in the promotional materials.

Various models seem to have something different break on them, but they *all* seem to stop oscillating (some after as little as a few hours' use!) and the connection from the sprinkler body to a hose is very fragile. It breaks so easily it has to leave you wondering how much more cheaply this part could have been made.

His report on the concert was very exciting, and I can't wait to go see Lightfoot, myself, in November when he appears in Springfield, Mo. Lightfoot's voice has improved with age, like fine wine. I have recently purchased five of his CDs, this being one of them, and the later ones are far more melodious than his early cuts.

The range is pretty good, most noticeable part to me was more the clarity, while I may not get the base response I get in some speakers the sharpness of the sound is great in these.I do a lot of re-keying and bpm alternation on music and often times the algorithms you use can cause glitches or pops in the music. Often times this is not noticeable until you use a large system. These are the first small, low cost speakers I have used that have allowed me to notice glitches that I can't even notice in my headphones. This prevents any potential embarrassment when using larger systems.If you don't have the cash to fork out for real pro equipment these are perfect for low cost studio speakers, they even have various inputs including optical.

I thought maybe I got a bad set, so I exchange them for another...Same problems. It is nice that these speakers have the inputs that they do, and the dual volume knobs.

It is fine to try to have a romance set in Cuba or telling the story of life in Cuba through a love story but in the end, it felt neither here nor there. I have not been to Cuba and so I can't comment on the authencity of the author's description of the country. As for the love story, I was not entirely sure what Richard and Lourdes saw in each other to fall in love. Their so-called love felt a little superficial and unconvincing. Richard always seemed impatient to have sex with Lourdes. He just appeared to me as someone not sure about what he wants and afraid to confront what he wants. In comparison, Lourdes was pretty single-minded about what she wanted. The ending was up to anybody's interpretation, was it a sad story or not? Maybe the tragedy was about Lourdes' hope that love could overcome any obstacles and Richard's skepticism about love and trust, just disillusion and regret in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok...","review":"An interesting peek into modern life in Cuba, but the actual \\"love story\\" was weak and hard to get in to.

Not only the very catchy tunes of the 20s but the sound quality is excellent! The reason for the great sound quality beside it being a Jazz Oracle CD is that the original recordings were on the Edison records which used a diamond tipped needle thereby giving a better sound quality. The restoration work is sowell done you'd swear it was just recorded. The bands are great and very representative of the late 20s dancing music. The quality of the tunes vary a bit, but I recommend this to anyone who loves the early jazz and dance music of the 20s like I do!

What a big disssapointment. The bump trimer head is worthless and unreliable, and it is impossible to remove, and there are no universal heads that will fit it. Initially, the head was assembled incorrectly and would not feed line at all. When I turn the weedeagter sideways to edge my yard, it quits running because the engine can't get gasoline from the gas tank because of the poor design. My recommendation is don't buy a Troy Bilt weedeater. I'm going to take mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Don't waste your money, line spool capacity not good, replacing line difficult.

The carb on the Troybilt is so temperamental and will gum up, stall or will not work at all, I have spent $60.00 on repairs, this weed eater is only used sparingly and my yard is not that big!

Whether the trash man took it or someone else did, I cannot say, but I know that I've since moved on to a model from Hitachi and my life has been sunshine and roses ever since.Original review:I purchased this as a complement to my new home back in 2006. It's been a poor weed trimmer from the very beginning. As another reviewer said, it's very finicky about orientation: when you turn it a certain angle it quits because the engine can't get gas from the gas tank. The sad part is I bought it on the recommendation of a very popular consumer reviews magazine and website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"It worked well initially, but problems started as soon as the first spool of line ran out. Every time I need more line, I had to shut off the trimmer, unscrew the bump head, and manually pull out the line. Now it isn't running at all because the fuel line fell off, then after putting it back on, the fuel ran out of the carb and didn't get to the spark plug. I have been tempted on many occasions to toss this thing into the woods. I'm very disappointed with Troy-Bilt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voices from the 1930s - 1960s","review":"Many of the tracks were just as I remembered and were needed to add to my repertoire of great music.

Fans of the Punisher are well-aware of these facts. Re-telling and repeating the same with some changes in facts and trivia is just bad, bad story-telling and not innovative.The Punisher concept works best by being removed from the world of superheros. Garth Ennis understood this. It had a hardcore and edgy film noir style that is hard to beat. Here, when the Punisher interacts with Peter Parker and the Daily Bugle, it removes that intense personal world of violence that the Punisher operates within.Finally, the very crude drawings and colouring really do not help this story along. Besides the awkward anatomy, the pacing and panel arrangements are not well done. The colours are too bright and not suitable for representing the edgy world of the Punisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves it","review":"My daughter loves this book as her other priddy books.

There are people complaining here that this book doesn't offer deep technical information or insight on how to provide content or help with audio programming and that's true. Maybe the title could have been clearer - it's more an idea of what game audio is about and what it's like to work in that field.

After adjusting the antennas & circle in every position imaginable the channels were still not viewable. The picture colors were off & it showed double images. The sad part is I recently moved and couldn't find my old antenna so I decided to go by a new one instead of searching for the old one.

This recording should be enjoyed without playing the game of comparisons to other masters. Certainly Dr. Karl Richter is the foremost J. S. Bach interpreter, as I would suggest Karajan is the foremost of Beethoven. The masterpiece itself is the pure art form, and it is a true masterpiece.

So much of what little is out there is too old.Prior to this book I had read \`Analysis of Panel Data' by Cheng Hsiao, Andrew Chesher, Matthew Jackson but that book was more academic, and dealt more with traditional panels, and \`longitudinal panels' (data that follows a given sample of individuals over time).Andrei Postoaca's book on the other hand is more relevant for the other 95% of research, which is more often than not conducted Online these days with dynamic panels.

We all know the real facts about the first performance of Beethoven's ninth ( or perhaps we all think that we know).

As they learn to work with and appreciate each other, we see how true genius functions. Worth getting if only to see the sensuous teamwork between Beethoven and his copyist while conducting the final movement of the 9th (the chorale)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating character study","review":"Ed Harris did a wonderful job portraying the character of Beethoven. I found the story line to be accurate as much as we know about the man today. It made him very real to me, as a spiritual being - an artist creating with sound, and his love of the effect of sound. The movie was interesting and inspiring, all the way through.Though it was not thought provoking, the movie had a deeper spiritual aspect that cleared up misconceptions I had about Beethoven, allowing me to enjoy Beethoven's works with enriched understanding of the man himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty for the Gullible","review":"Great unappreciated artists of the world, drop your drawers! It works every time, judging from the cornucopia of gaga reviews given to this awful movie. (1) I found the distortion and speculation in this film insulting. (2) Mr. Harris's portrayal of Beethoven was embarrassing to say the least. (3) The musical examples performed on camera in the drama itself (as opposed to in the background soundtrack) often had never been played in that context historically. And one of the pieces heard in the drama only existed in manuscript during Beethoven's lifetime. One ought to honor great artists, not smother them in the mundane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A deeply disappointing effort","review":"This film is so disappointing that my wife and I would have given it zero stars if we could have done so. We stayed with it as long as we could and finally just switched it off. The feminist premise and the plot are ridiculous -- a beautiful young woman is not only Beethoven's muse, she rewrites his work and improves on it -- and the acting is, at best, pedestrian. Ed Harris's uninspired and uninspiring attempt at Beethoven makes Gary Oldman's depiction of the troubled genius in \\"Immortal Beloved\\" look like the work of Olivier or Richard Burton. Sadly, this effort is just a stinker. You'd be better served by going back and watching \\"Immortal Beloved,\\" even with its flaws, or better yet sitting in a quiet room and listening to Beethoven's magnificent 9th, and leaving it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris plays Beethoven; Beethoven loses","review":"Those of us with an aesthetic bent always hope a film about a great artist will add to our understanding of that ineffable something which explains the transcendence that can arise from among us. This movie ain't it. Ed Harris, so brilliant elsewhere, is hilariously miscast. The script is a one-day-pass to Beethoven World.

And the frequency and length of commercial units was extremely distracting. They also included factoids about Beethoven on a 3rd-grade level.The much vaunted Beethoven's Ninth segment was destroyed by the vicious insipid cuts of the music. Ouch and ouch.The story is of course total fiction, which is not in itself a criticism, but had tender moments, though it was often just dopey. Beethoven is presented in a way that was actionable. And his quotable quotes were nonsense.However if you love Beethoven and are interested, you can at least see how he dressed, where he might have walked, how lighting and transportation were handled and to a lesser extent, ablution. Those are why I watched. The actress is adorable. Ed Harris' Beethoven is, dunno, I did not buy it--not his best work but not awful either.

Americanisms and American slang as the language of early 19th century Vienna are out-of-place. The acting is poor; Ed Harris is supposed to be deaf as Beethoven, yet he responds to questions and conversations as if he had perfectly normal hearing. The music, of course, is grand, but I can listen to Beethoven anytme. And Diane Kruger as a copyist who helps Beethoven conduct his 9th Symphony is not believable. We get 10 to 15 minutes of the 9th while watching these two interact; it has no credibility.

The 28-105 range on the Rebel is equivalent to 44-168 on a 35mm camera. The wide angle is a little lacking on a 1.6 crop camera but most of the time you can take a step back if you really need to. The ring-type USM provides fast, silent and accurate focus. Full time manual focus means you can easily adjust the focus without having to mess with any switches. The quality of the lens is way better than the EF-S 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 kit lens and for the money, it can't be beat. You have to step up to L lenses to beat the quality of this lens.Make sure to get the 28-105 f/3.5-4.5 II and not the cheaper f/4-5.6 It's definitely worth the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the Price","review":"I was given this lens after my Sigma 28-135mm lens broke. While that lens has been fixed, I haven't used it since attatching the Canon lens on my camera. The Canon 28-105mm may have a smaller zoom range, but other than that is clearly a superior lens in every respect. It's sturdy, fast-focusing, sharp, and has good color. In short, it's what you hope to find when purchasing a consumer grade lens. There are other cheaper lenses on the market, like Sigma's lens or Canon's f/4-5.6, but this lens is worth the extra $100 for its reliability, sharpness and overall usability."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ok lens","review":"Pretty decent for a zoom lens.

I bought it as a walk around instead of buying a point and shoot. It's much better then any P&S camera I've tried, and cheaper then most of the good ones too. For the stuff I really want good IQ on I use my primes. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't use it as much as my other lenses, and it is a little cheap feeling.

When you consider price, image quality, and its range of uses via the zoom range available, it's hard to beat.The image quality is hit or miss. Mostly, it's just average or slightly above average. Again, though, I recommend this lens mainly because it's flexible in its zoom range, not terribly expensive, has USM focusing, and takes respectable though not superb pictures. That's a pretty good package of offerings if you want one lens to do a lot of different things within an attractive zoom range of 28-105.Of course, if you have an APS size sensor, as opposed to a full-size sensor, those zoom ranges are effectively 44 - 168mm. So, be aware that your \\"wide\\" end of 28 is not so wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens for the Price!","review":"This lens is a great upgrade from the kit lens from Canon.

General Irwin (Redford) lead his men through building them up before he was sent to jail and he tries to lead the same way once incarcerated. Every man in the place, including the guards and warden (James Gandolfini) look at Irwin with respect, he has earned it through his legendary performances in combat. The warden is a colonel who has never seen combat. This is where the difference begin, not end.These two strong willed military men battle for the control of the prison, the mens hearts and minds. One trying to lead/control by fear, the other trying to lead by example.Throughout the movie you are constantly wondering what Irwin will pull out of his hat next, where he is going with his line of thought. The final \\"battle\\" scenes for control of the prison are very entertaining. Lots of action and the mind games play on throughout. It is like a chess game, move, counter-move.An outstanding movie that should be added to anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic battle between Good and Evil with shades of gray.","review":"Starring Robert Redford as a three star general that has been sent to military prison, and \\"The Soprano's\\", James Gandolfini as his warden/keeper. Tension is high between the war weary General and the warden who has always been behind the lines, a watcher of battles never a participant. The warden rules with an iron fist, and not always by the rules; all is not as it should be in the Castle.The Castle refers to the Prison, which stands with a history of years past. There is some intense strategizing and battles hard won that make for a wonderfully entertaining body of work that will keep your attention and raise the hairs of indignity on the back of your neck. The end comes to you with patriotic overtones that will make you want to stand up and cheer. I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Earn What it Seeks","review":"I rented the DVD. I liked the idea of the movie. I didn't care if it was going to be predictable or cliched or a bit far-fetched. I was ready to feel good about heroism and leadership and good guys triumphing over oppression. I was disappointed. The filmmakers evidently thought they could deliver what I wanted by stringing together feel-good moments using contrived, cheezy plot details. What happened? Did they give the paragraph plot outline to an amateur to fill in? I did enjoy some of the acting, especially James Gandolfini as Colonel Winter, the warden. I did not find Redford compelling in his role as General Irwin. Maybe this was another shortcut - no need to develop the character, after all, its ROBERT REDFORD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic a must have for every DVD collection","review":"I am a movie \\"junkie\\" if you will and am very critical of movies but The Last Castle is an absolute classic. nothing short of a perfect movie.

An understandable argument may be, \\"Lighten up, it's just a movie.\\" But I say film (fictional or non) is a very, very powerful medium, and filmmakers should be conscious of what they're putting into the heads of people worldwide. Besides the message, the dialogue and events in this picture are just downright silly. The prisoners, unbeknown by every guard at the prison (obviously), have constructed a large catapult that they've hidden somewhere in the prison yard.

I understand the need for dramatic license to drive a compelling story but what aggravated me about this film is that it dishonors the memory of the overwhelming majority of 19th century New Yorkers, both natives and immigrants, who worked their behinds off in legitimate trades and professions. In reality this city was built by extremely hard working people that lived decent lives grounded in faith. They don't exist in this film. Of course plenty of crime & corruption existed but the vast majority of people struggled honestly to improve their lot.

The trailer shows it to be a tremendous film, the movies this year have been very bad, Miramax is producing which will insure an aggressive marketing campaign, and finally, if nominated, the Academy won't make the foolish mistake they have made three times already (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas). Scorsese considers this his best work in years, which is an astonishing feat considering the quality of his films.

It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not believable, it's not clever, it's not exciting, but it is totally ludicrous. However, it takes itself so seriously that you can't even laugh at it.Leonardo DiCrappio gives another crappy performance. He really is a one-note actor, and his attempt at an Irish accent is pathetic.I'm a fan of Scorsese, but I turned off this turd after 30 minutes.Those people who think this is a great film can keep the Jim Jones Kool-Ade to themselves; I'm not drinking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically unacurrate tripe from Hollywood","review":"Amazon.com reviewers never cease to amaze me. the worst of the trio is easily Gangs of New York.

Leonardo DiCaprio really can't act very well and he proved that yet again in Gangs of New York.

The movie was so flawed it made me sick. How bad can one person screw up our nations history. Um, well, according to this movie. REALLY BADLY! Half the main characters were not that way in history, and Day-Lewis' character was a composite of 3 people over a 50 year span of history.Not to mention for all you conservative and well mannered people the idea of \\"violence is okay because our country was founded on it\\" may really rest uneasy for you. I found this movie to be so sick and twisted that when it was over I could have gone and watched Se7en, and felt like a normal human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Very Long","review":"This was a good movie on the gangs that ran in New York during the Antebellum period.

Naturally I wanted to slap her. How dare she give her low key opinion. I trust Mr. Scorsese did his homework to give us an accurate film based on the gangs of 18th century New York. Daniel Day-Lewis is quite a presence as Bill the butcher. I've never seen him play someone so evil. No doubt an Oscar nomination for his stellar work here. Speaking of Oscar nods, there is much potential for..best director, cinematography, costumes, sets, screenplay and best film as well. I love Scorsese whether it be the violent \\"Goodfellas\\" or the elegant \\"The Age of Innocence\\". \\"Gangs of New York\\" is an over the top addition to the filmography of one of our finest filmmakers. The cast includes Leonardo Di Caprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz & Henry Thomas just to name a few of the familiar. I don't care if this is fiction or non-fiction. It's an amazing piece of filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"think about it. . .","review":"There's a reason why \\"Gangs of New York\\" came up goose eggs at the Oscars. At first I liked only Daniel Day Lewis' role as Bill the Butcher, but now I hate the whole film altogether. Even Leonardo DiCaprio, who was phenomenal in the groundbreaking masterpiece \\"Titanic,\\" can't save this hot mess. And getting Cameron Diaz is the worst casting decision I can think of. I mean, I was having these \\"There's Something About Mary\\" flashbacks whenever I saw her face. But worst of all is that Scorcese big time dropped the ball on this project.

Great performances, visionary direction, and an interesting storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gorgeous history lesson outweighs the weak story ...","review":"I was delighted by this movie. I've been a history buff since childhood, and I found myself immersed in a movie that really shows what it was like to live in the past. It wasn't glossy; it was gritty and real.Unfortunately, the revenge storyline has been done too many times. Also, while we're supposed to be hating Daniel Day Lewis' Bill Cutting and rooting for underdog Leonardo DiCaprio, I found the reverse happening. Lewis was so captivating and DiCaprio so lifeless that I couldn't help hoping for Amsterdam's failure in his mission to kill his father's murderer.For me, the storyline was just something to keep the movie going while I watched history unfold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Best Picture of 2003","review":"Gangs of New York is by far the BEST movie of the year. People who hated this movie or thought that it was to far fetched or fictionous must not have read the book or reasearched the time period. It is telling the story of Amsterdam when he was growing up in the \\"New York Underworld\\" it is based on a true story we are not sure of the persons names however the gangs in New York we could find actual names the gangs actual titles were: The Plug Uglies, and The Dead Rabbits.

Troublesome both for NY and for the country. I was pleasantly surprised to find that much of what was dramatized is accurate. I am a native New Yorker and have always been interested in the difficult strife that describes these times. It reminds me that nothing is new under the sun, although many minorities today seem to think that they are. The hope, as hinted at in the film, is that things will get better in time and we should not lose that hope. Certainly worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtle, it ain't!","review":"Any time you notice someone acting, it's not necessarily a good thing!

This to me is not perfect acting. If it had been, I wouldn't have noticed the \\"actor\\" at all. Don't get me wrong, DDL is still the most entertaining aspect of the film, but that's more a testiment to the film's failure rather than DDL's brilliance. I have loved Day-Lewis' past screen performances, but this one is best suited on stage where subtlety is not really a requirement. I never thought I'd live to witness a subtle, introspective Jack Nicholson (in About Schmidt) and a flamboyant, scenery-chewing Daniel Day-Lewis in the same year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dittos: Nihilism + Revisionism + Goth","review":"I totally agree with the previous reviewer (science fiction). I walked out of the theater feeling like I wasted my money and time. And worse yet it left me depressed. By its gross distortion of reality and history, this deconstructionist movie embodies director's worship of evil and hatred for true heros.When I got home we did some research into the time period and found that a lot of the history was inaccurate. For example: The Irish poor hated the Negroes and feared that emancipation of the southern slaves would cause the blacks to take Irish jobs. This was the main motive for the Irish poor opposing the Union cause and the draft. One of the main buildings attacked by the Irish during the Draft Riots was an African American church and orphanage. Furthermore, the main character, Vallon, played by diCaprio, never existed. Nor did diCaprio's acting talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous and boring","review":"No plot; overdone in all respects; poorly cast; ahistorical; rediculous survivals; but most of all utterly pointless.

I couldn't see any point to this movie, especially with the \\"fast forward\\" trick at the end to bring us up to a present day NYC skyline in which Scorsese delusionally decided to include the World Trade Center towers.Oh, and since when did a performance that barely made it to \\"Captain Hook\\" Cartoonish level warrant any praise at all?The ONLY part of this movie that was interesting/compelling had nothing to do with the prurient sex and violence. It was, instead, Boss Tweed, and his nonchalant quips about getting bread and soup out the docks the morning after the murderous draft riots because, \\"We're losing a lot of votes here tonight.\\"THAT is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot to chew on...","review":"Well, I'm a big fan of Scorsese's work. And while this film has a brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, the film as a whole is a tough one to enjoy. It's far too long and aspires to be a sort of historical document to this period in New York. The core story - the relationship between Bill the Butcher and Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) - is very promising, but Scorsese seems willing to take up every available tangent and in the process delivers a tiring, disjointed film. Even as the film reaches it's climax we find we've got another twenty minutes to go. Scorsese is one of the finest filmmakers of our time, but he may have been too close to this story.This is arguably the best work from actor Daniel Day-Lewis and the film may be worth watching on that basis alone. But I'd have a hard time sitting through it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Scorsese, eh?","review":"There are many notable things about this - a powerful movie, by a very adroit person called Martin Scorsese behind it.But the most important thing to note is that, this movie places the emphasis on the camera work, which creates a real effect suitable to the nature of the script. Compared to this, the cast is pushed behind, and the force of the tale is really spellbinding.Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis were terrific.Don't you miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I was really excited when this movie came out. Instead what I saw was a three hour waste of time. The stellar cast did well enough with what they had, but the script was not well written. The movie jumps from plot to plot, with many unneccessary scenes. And just when you think we've settled into a plot line for the rest of the movie, bam! The actors are off with some new unplausible story. The ending stretched for far too long, and was not a satisfying conclusion to the movie. The elements were all there for movie of the century, but it didn't come anywhere near expectations. The critics were so wrong this time. You're not missing anything if you pass on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Buy in Blu-Ray","review":"I'm still not quite sure why, but this has been my favorite movie for years now. My 10th grade teacher, Mr. Reyes, once suggested I watch it and when I did. I loved it. There's not much I can say expect, see for yourself the magic of history. But you must buy it in Blu-Ray.

Tremedous in every way.","review":"The movie is GREAT, the way it was shot, the camera work, the exceptional action, the story-lines, everything! The masterful story developing when it goes through waves to culmination is mesmerizing.I can't speak about this work otherwise as in superlative terms and it is why it had 10 academy nominations.The story is incredibly deep, the dialogs are unbelievably smart and trough to life. In every shot, angle, camera movement, music there is so much of cool, artistic interpretation and sophistication. My humble description can even remotely capture the splendor of this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost complete junk","review":"Daniel Day Lewis should run away with this film, but even he is not fast enough. He remains an absolute master of his craft, and almost surmounts the dreadful script and supporting cast. I MUST make an exception for Leonardo Di Caprio, who has greatly improved as an actor since the appalling Titanic. The settings truly evoke old New York in the Civil War era, but that's where it ends. WHY did they waste Liam Neeson on a role that's over before the credits begin? As for Diaz...one can only ask Why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar For Lewis","review":"Very entertaining movie. I think those of us who read the book got a lot more out of the movie. Daniel Day Lewis WAS Bill the Butcher, what an outstanding performance, his part in this movie was on par with his performance in \\"My Left Foot\\". Although Leanardo DiCaprio is a very good actor I found him to be a little \\"soft\\" for a part like this, it seemed that Johny Dep or a young Sean Penn would have been a better fit (the bad boy thing) Leanardo is better suited for Catch Me If You Can and Titanic type movies.

I also took a senior level course on the History of NYC in college taught by Thomas Kessner (who just released an excellent book called Capital City), so I would consider myself qualified to comment on this movie. The movie packs about 30 years of history into 2 hours (or into the 16 year span of Amsterdam's life featured in the film). In terms of historical accuracy, the movie is off on many aspects; however, I think it does an excellent job of capturing the essence of what life in the infamous Five Points was like during this period in American history.

Is this film about gangs in New York? Sort of...but not entirely. Is this movie about a love affair between an angry young man and a cute pick-pocket? Sort of...but not entirely. Is it about revenge, is it about the history of New York during the late 1800s? Sort of. Lots of stuff is kind of covered in this movie, but none of it goes into much detail,If you're going to make a 180-minute long movie and expect us to invest ourselves in the lead character, why not show more of his anger and thirst for revenge (see THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO for a great example of this)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointed","review":"The story and setting had enormous potential but the casting left a lot to be desired. DeCaprio looks too much like a boy to play the role of a tough guy raised in a 19th century reformatory; poor dental hygiene aside, Oliver Twist maybe, Amsterdam Vallon never. Not enough Liam Neeson in the movie and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Bill Cutting was a little over the top. His character seemed better suited to the role of villain in a Batman movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing lack of historical accuracy","review":"This film omits a crucuial portion of the history of the 1863 draft riots. The riots largely targeted African Americans and included both the destruction of their property and the lynching and killing of African Americans. A number of children were killed when a building where Afircan Americans lived was torched. In an attempt to make the characters look sympathetic, the film ignores disgusting actions taken against a powerless minority.As an aside, this is not being PC. All histories of the draft riots include these accounts, including those of conservative historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting in awful movie!","review":"This movie was an utter disappointment. It's bloody content with seemingly no sense made me wonder how people can complain about violent video games. The acting in this movie was stellar and every actor deserves an Academy Award. But the actual story and plot were awful and flimsy as paper. Any moral message the movie might have conveyed was destroyed by a stupid and unsatisfying ending. I don't know who this movie was written for, older people will find the violence appalling and younger views will be shocked and horrified by it. Being 27, I found the movie a waste of time. The dramatic performances were dim lights in this awful historical mess. The fact that SO MANY critics loved this movie makes me wonder about their sanity. It was an absolute waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fasle Description...","review":"I ordered this product expecting the remastered version of the Gangs of New York blu-ray. Although this is labeled to be the MIRAMAX remastered version of the film which if you read on the web has a significantly better picture transfer than the originally released movie. I would noramlly not be so suprised to receive the wrong edition of the film if i were buying from a thrid party distributer, but this was ordered directly from amazon.com, very disappointing. I will now be much more hesitant when reading descriptions of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"turkey of new york","review":"Saw this film on TV. Didn't care much for it.Acting average. Costuming and scenery superb. Fight scenes splend especially the final one with Union Soldiers marching in to put down the draft riots.Otherwise, this film was nothing but thugs wielding knives and naked whores. None of the characters were likable or even sympathetic. The only one close to likableness was Cutting.The last scene of the movie pretty much matches my view of it in its entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I saw Santa Trap with Robert Hays on tv, and then the older movie Airspeed with Elisha Cuthbert; then at a theater a worthless movie: Gangs of New York. It had enough interesting material for a 15-30 minute slide show on history Chanel. Why are these people supposed to be interseting? Do I feel empathy and compassion for them? Hardly. Day-Lewis may have been historically accurate vocally and in costume but he seemed to have escaped from Popeye starring Robin williams. Cameron D. was not attractive here."},{"rating":"1","title":"They deserve each other","review":"Di Caprio and Diaz deserve each other. I saw this at a screening. Who gave them a license to act? Children,,,what they know about acting. TERRIBLE MOVIE. NO MERIT, NO SUBSTANCE and NO SOUL! 86 it, trash it, burn it. It has no value. All it did for me was think of these two-bit actors as looking for attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Egregious Scorcece Film","review":"After having seen the phenomenal GoodFellas, I would have thought that Gangs was going to be a great Scorcece film. I WAS WRONG! The movie was boring from beginning to end. I fell asleep many times and so I just started to freak on my girlfriend.JK. Leo DiCaprio is a horrible actor. He should not make anymore movies in his career. Daniel Day-Lewis appears to look like a toothpick on-screen and his performance in this film was worse than DiCaprio's. The only highlight of this film was Cameron Diaz. She is an extremely sexy actress and brought some much needed life to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is, if not the worst movie ever made, then probably the worst movie ever to receive a bunch of Academy Award nominations (10!). It's excessively violent and ludicrously overacted throughout. Daniel Day Lewis hams it up shamelessly. Leonardo diCaprio and Cameron Diaz can't even have sex without violence. It would have been a real shame if this atrocity had won Best Picture. Maybe the Academy gave Scorsese all these nominations because they felt guilty for not giving him enough awards for his genuinely outstanding achievements, i.e., Raging Bull and Goodfellas. It's a shame to see really talented people come up with such trash. Scorsese couldn't have done worse if he had collaborated with Oliver Stone on a sequel to Natural Born Killers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real","review":"I am laughing at the guy from \\"Athens Greece\\" who knows NOTHING about the United States or the Civil War .. the so called Draft Riots were not , they were Irish led Race Riots and 500 people were killed by the rioters including Blacks (the main victims) Protestants and Business men and women.Yes US troops had to come in under arms but there were NO \\"bombardment\\" of NY .. only by the English during the Revolutionary War.Obviously this guy from the good old boy south (not Athens Greece) is still upset over the Slavery crimes of the south.Read a fine book called Black Blue and Gray by Jim Haskins for the FACTS.This movie was a Leftist revisionist MESS without fact or historical relevance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gangs of Sound Stage 6","review":"I agree with those reviewers who've seen through this movie. Under the period costumes and the periodic bursts of graphic violence, \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a set-bound bore. Bad dialogue, worse accents, and a cliched, spaghetti-Western plot. But, Gogol, if you're going to diss \\"Once Upon a TIme in America,\\" as innovative a gangster movie as \\"The Godfather,\\" at least blame the guy who did make it -- Sergio Leone -- not a guy who didn't -- Scorsese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gangs of nothing.","review":"Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese could easily be his worst epic ever! I could never get into this bloody, violent film. Cameron Diaz looks so out of place in this film and that horrible accent she tries to pull off, jeez she belongs in a romantic comedy! There's no doubt Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are gifts to the acting world but even these talented guys can't save this slow, boring train wreck. If you want a great Scorsese film then see Raging Bull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"This movie is needlessly bloody, poorly scripted and not particularly well-acted. Leonardo DiCaprio was stiff and Daniel Day Lewis hammed it up (and looked ridiculous with his clown costume and sillly moustache). Character development was virtually nonexistent. Don't waste your $ on this one; critics are being kind to it based on Scorsese's past work."},{"rating":"1","title":"bootleg video","review":"I was sent a bootleg copy of this DVD. If I would have known that it was a bootleg I would not have ordered it. Very disappointed, poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Hours of pure hell","review":"What a truly terrible film , poor acting except from Daniel Day Lewis and an awful script make for a truly terrible film , no wonder it didnt win any oscars. If you want to see a good oscar nominated film see The Pianist or Chicago or The Hours because this is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Scorsese, take what you can get","review":"Any new film by Mr Scorsese is cause for celebration and Gangs of New York is no exception. True - Ms Diaz and Mr DiCaprio are well and truly out of their depth and cast for their \\"star' quality on the likely insistence of producers - but they are a minor distraction. The cinematic wealth in this film is considerable, not least the mis en scene, writing, direction, costumes and editing. But the exceptional cast of actors is quite special including the wonderful Mr John C. Reilly, Mr Broadbent and many many \\"minor\\" roles which add up to a delicious mixture of society as viewed through the prism of Mr Cocks et al. The film is, at the very least, a potent social portrait of mid-19th century New York. The praise for Mr Day-Lewis is well earned as he gives a rivetting, sustained and memorable portrait of Bill Cutting. The extras especially those involving Mr Scorsese are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay movie...","review":"I watched this the other night, and I was impressed, partly. It wasn't an astounding movie, one that I believed deserved any oscars, but it was good. One thing I couldn't get over was how fake-looking the opening fight scene was. And if something looks fake in the beginning, it's hard to get a feel for it. The acting was OK. Daniel Day-Lewis was ok, but Leo and Cameron were much better. You could actually feel their roles---a little. All around, it's good to watch for historical value, and I now know why Roman Polanski won the oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed...","review":"I think that this film was lacking....a lot. There was little depth to the characters even after the first 90 minutes. Who are these people? The quick flash of introductions of gangs left no time for absorption. The romantic aspect with the female was boring to say the least and I didn't see any reason for that character to be in the film. It just dragged the film out about an extra half hour..maybe longer. I wish Speilberg had directed this film or Kevin Costner even (with a better script). Like Shindlers List or Dances With Wolves, I think it would have given me a more dead-on feel of the times. Maybe I could have cared about the characters instead of just watching them run around punching and cutting each other. Then there was the awkward flash to the rich folks...where they talked about what was going on - as if they were narraters. Sorry, it was just too hollywood and I learned next to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"By far, this has to be the worst movie I ever saw. How it was nominated for awards is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a tremedous sucking sound during the first scene","review":"of this movie. Yeah, it's because this flic is more fiasco than Felini. It is a very very confused wanna-be epic with a diffused theme and catoonish characters. The actors, rather than appearing like quirky iconoclasts come off more like bit players from Pee Wee's playhouse. Save your money, it'll be on TBS pretty soon and then you can nod off when you watch it for free without the remorse over what the DVD cost you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a plot? This is not the one for you!","review":"If you want to see a film which shows what New York City was like in the 1860's, the background scenery is for you. History buffs might like it for that reason. But the plot--if it can be called that--very quickly descends into one long, bloody, gory beating. Granted, mindless violence is quite popular these days, but I think filming a boxing match would have provided more of a storyline than this epic actually managed to churn out. The only parts I found remotely noteworthy was the portrayal treatment of the Irish immigrants in the turbulance of the Civil War era.So, in brief, the only way I could see this picture even being considered for \\"Best Picture of the Year\\" would be if the only other contenders were \\"Ishtar,\\" \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" or anything else by Ed Wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think of Diaz, Think of Diaz, Think of Diaz...","review":"Leonardo DiCaprio was prettier than Cameron Diaz. As a heterosexual, I find this fact deeply disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"part of the gang of epics","review":"Like Gladiator and Braveheart, this one's to be loved for its sweeping epic scenes, stunning landscapes, solid cinematography and a few stand out performances - namely Lewis.'A dark mood is effectively captured as is a real sense of the adventure and danger of settling this country. Suspending some critical judgment is always good with pictures like this. Simply go with it and get swept up in its grandeur.For me that is the real magic of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"After watching \\"Gangs\\" I was left feeling overwhelmed by it.I felt as if I had been transported back to 1846.The film is a true epic and New York itself is wonderfully detailed.The acting is superb.Daniel Day-Lewis is the true star as William Cutting,while Brendan Gleeson,Liam Neeson and Jim Broadbent are all excellent.Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diazare avrerage with unconvincing Irish accentsScorcese does an excellent job.He brings alot of energy to the directing.The opening battle is unforgettable.It is the best piece of film-making I have seen in years.Scorcese deserves thisyear's oscar"},{"rating":"1","title":"violent, ugly film, just so disappointing","review":"This was pushed as THE film of the year. Since I love history, and this is based on historical fact, and it was loaded with a powerhouse cast, I thought wow...Then I saw it and I said wow...but with a different inflection.This film was brutal, an ugly film that was an exercise in wallowing in violence with nothing to redeem the film. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio are miscast, completely. Diaz's role seems so unclear, like they said hey, let's stick Diaz in here for star power. DiCaprio, usually a very talented actor, looks like a little boy trying to play big boy and worse, his performance was so dull as if we walked through the whole film. At time, his efforts are near comical. Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a stunning performance, but nearly stomach churning at times. Liam Neeson, another fine actor is there for a thankless near cameo role.Sorry, for the money that went into this film, it's such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Drama","review":"This is a film that I regret watching until the finish. I am the kind who CANNOT stop a movie no matter how bad. I just have to finish it to see if it will redeem itself. This did not happen. I was expecting historical drama mixed with fiction as well as some violence. But, this was just unnecessarily bloody. It was obvious that the envelope was being pushed here just to grab response. I find that's usually required if there is not enough of a storyline to compensate. The actors did well. The storyline had so much potential, but too much emphasis on trying to create a \\"realism\\" which comes across as just being plain gory and hard. I thought Bravehart was a gory movie, but good. This is no Bravehart."},{"rating":"2","title":"its good","review":"I like the movie and all but there are some flaws to it. Cameron Diaz's accent wasn't that fantastic. Neither was Leos but over all a decent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unknown New York history!","review":"I happened to be in Rome when \\"Gangs of New York\\" was being filmed. The set was unbelievable!I just wish the editing didn't cut some scenes important to the story, which make it difficult to understand therelationship between the characters.Daniel Day-Lewis was incredible as Bill the butcher. Di Caprio and Cameron Diaz were perfectly cast and very convincing.Martin Scorsese directed this movie and, as always, was just superb. The detail in each scene is worth seeing the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dead Rabbits...","review":"This is a great, strong movie. Acting, plot, and everything. I'm not gonna tell all that it was about. \\"Some of it I remember. The rest I took from a dream.\\" That's exactly how the movie starts. But it took place in a time period from like 1846 to 1863. Many immigrants were coming to New York, and especially Irish. More and more people were getting off the ships everyday. They were trying to draft for war and so on. We really get a look at how many Gangs there were in lower Manhattan. Dead Rabbits, Swamp Angels, Nighwalkers, Tammany Hall Boys, The Natives. Street wars went on for who would hold power over the 5 points. I'll stop right there. But I'll say that there aren't many actors as convincing as Leo. Boy can act. He knows what he's doing. Check out this movie. It's worth all your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Flick","review":"I have always felt that Martin Scorsese was a very overated director, but this film was so bad it was hilarious. The acting was amateurish and the storyline so ridiculous and unbelievable that I felt I was watching a spoof. It played like an old fashioned melodrama. No wonder Harvey Weinstien flipped when he saw this thing. You have to give it to Miramax and their marketing acumen; that they managed to get six academy award nominations for this junk is impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw mine away.","review":"The look on my face from beginning to end was; waiting for the movie to start. When I finally snapped out of it, I couldn't help but think what ugly imagery, and the charachters are so unrealistic..I can't believe 135 \\"TOP CRITICS,\\" called it one of the best films of the year. I'm equally stunned by the 10 academy award nominations. How did that happen? I'd rather watch 'my body guard,' or 'streets of fire,' from like 1980. Beastmaster was a better film!! If you haven't seen 'gangs of new york,' you're better off keepin it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of flash, lots of action, and ... ?","review":"I know the point of this movie was to 'educate' the public about early US history. But to justify millions of dollars of effort, the millions have to not just recreate a time, but also express something really touching within it. Actually, the latter is much more important.Scorsese didn't find anything touching. And I really think he was looking in the wrong place -- a very 'hollywood' place -- finding or forging big characters and contriving a big story.I have a hope, that long after we're all dead, the majority of the population will see the first 100 years of movie-making as very clumsy and misguided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral: \\"White Guys Can Be Gangstas, Too.\\" Give Me a Break!!","review":"The entire purpose of this big-budget three-hour movie was to reassure white boys that they can be gangsters, too, and in fact the entire gang culture in New York originated with them.What an honor...NOT! BIG friggin' deal! I am NOT impressed. Since Eminem exploded onto the music scene, it's suddenly cool to be immoral gutter trash.This is historically inaccurate, plotless, chaotic MESS is the most OVERHYPED movie of all time. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven movie","review":"Like it was already mentioned in some of the reviews the first 2/3 of the movie is great. Very powerful, stylish, logical. It's Scorsese in his best. The rest of the movie seems to be created by different authors. It is totally out of the rhythm of the movie. It does make an impression that the movie was cut and all the cuts happened in the end. The end of the movie leaves you very disappointed. So why four stars? The main reason is the first 2/3 of the movie plus the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis, which is incredible. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz were adequate (I was pleasantly suprised by Diaz, which is quite organic in this movie). This and very interesting subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best work for scorsese","review":"I was disappointed and confused with the plot. No direction, or real story line. Just to gangs who want to rule New York. Wopty Do."},{"rating":"2","title":"of course it will win oscars!","review":"This is by far the most anticipated film of the year, and I have been following it since last April. It was shot in Rome Italy, and Scorsese really did a marvelous job as far as location and actors, with such bohemians as Leonardo Dicaprio, Daniel-Day Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. If you miss this film, than you miss history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"The only thing entertaining was the costumes of the Irish. Which were those plaid colors and big top hats.Decaprio Father was a terrible role model. You have to pity any person raising up his child on gang fights. I can't believe it was that hard to survive getting off the boat. New York was probably the worst place to settle???? And all those brothels in NY.The big surprise is finding out Daniel Day Lewis is the main star... a blood thirsty crook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund, please???","review":"...Can't believe I paid good money for this atrocity. A huge fan of Leo and Daniel-Day, I disliked (the nicest word I can write) them both intensely in this violence-filled mess. I spoke with a young man who recommended it to me (telling me he had seen it THREE times!!!) Maybe it's a \\"guy thing,\\" because I could barely watch \\"the whole thing.\\" This DVD is going in a box to Good Will!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction Yes History NO","review":"This movie is the usual overblown attempt to try and rewrite history by using MEGO tactics not fact.First of all the so called \\"Draft Riots\\" were RACE riots led by the Irish against the Blacks whom they despised. Of the 500 people killed in those riots 100 were Black and most of the rest were business people and Protestant missionaries.Furthermore the \\"hands that built America\\" is a joke.This nations economic, political base were established long before these folks came here fleeing the oppressions of Europe and wanting to take ADVANTAGE of our oppertunities. Period.As fiction this is passable as HISTORY it is a laughing stock except to Socialists.Real Hard core American history? HA!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacle in Film Making!!","review":"I dont understand why people can criticise this film. This film is a \\"Spectacle in film making\\" If you are a fan of Martin Scorsese's pictures this film will most definately appeal to you. As for Daniel Day- Lewis portrayal as \\" WILLIAM CUDDING AKA BILL-The butcher you cant get any better. He is a fine actor and and at his best in this motion picture. His outstanding performance keeps this movie on top.This film will attract many viewers since it is:THE BEST FILM IN YEARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gangs of New York","review":"As someone else put it, this film has no soul. It would appear from the detail in the sets and costumes that a lot of money was spent. But the film was too long and the plot roamed around aimlessly. I came away not really caring about any of the characters and then at the end of the film as it finally lurched to the \\"final\\" confrontation between Bill and Amsterdam. Bill is essentially killed by shrapnel from cannon fired from the harbor. Except for the great sets and \\"atmosphere\\", the movie was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and thought-provoking","review":"I didn't expect to be impressed by this movie but was. The feel of the times was successfully brought out by the scenery, costumes and acting. Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely fantastic as Bill the Butcher, the leader of one of the major gangs. I expect to see him nominated for an Academy Award. Other performances were also good but not at the same level as his.The downside to this movie is the stretching and, at times, ignoring of historical fact and the violence. Granted, the times were violent but I feel that the movie focused more on the action than on getting across the story, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.What I found particularly powerful was the portrayal of the variety of prejudices rampant at that time and how few of them our country has successfully eliminated. It's rather sad to realize that we have not progressed more in the 140+ years since the New York Riots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth One's Admiration, Sympathy or Pity!","review":"You'll need a strong stomach for this one. No doubt there was a deep seated prejudice against the Irish immigrants in the 19th century, there was crime in New York, anti-Lincoln feeling, and race riots occurred there also. But this movie made one think that there was nothing but hate, poverty and riots in Manhattan. Don't believe it!It is hard to know what the movie was trying to say. Was it a social statement or a Hamlet-like tale about revenge. Everyone was shown as corrupt including the Mayor and his people, the leaders of the gangs, the police and the armed forces, the outstanding newspaper publisher in the City and the protagonist and his love interest. How did the City ever get to the 20th century?The movie had little focus, lots of violence, mostly unnecessary violence, and there was no one worth one's admiration, sympathy or pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved this movie, mostly because i am an irish catholic. I thought that Leo had a great irish accent and that the acting was incredible! My all time favorite movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Movie","review":"I just recently veiwed the DVD version of the film and I thought it was really cool. The movie does tie in well with history without getting too boring. My favorite character was Bill \\"The Buther\\".

I really recommend checking this movie out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double disc disaster","review":"The movie is awesome!! I give the movie 5 stars.I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was a little disappointed. I guess I didn't see where it said that the movie is on 2 disc.

Great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and especially Daniel Day Lewis. I really enjoyed it and so did the family. I highly recommend it for mature audiences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five STAR BLU-RAY. No doubt about it!","review":"The sound and picture of this blu ray are absolutely excellent! On my system there is a particular upgrade in the picture quality when watching blu-rays as opposed to DVD's. I'm gald I didn't experience any of the faulty versions of the incredible movie. I watched it for the second time over the last three days and it is simply stunning! One last thing, I don't really care if it's historically accurate at all, \\"the Butcher\\" in this movie is one of the all time great evil roles! I'm not sure I can think of any worth comparisons. A must have for any blu-ray collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore Instead of Lore","review":"I HATED this movie! It starts with brutality, extreme violence, bloodshed and plays that theme over and over again throughout the movie. The killing is drawn out and overemphasized. The costuming for the first scene was also outrageously stylized and inauthentic with too many people wearing them. Nudity and sex is also overdone. Breasts all over the place, triage, women hanging on men over and over again. Too much of everything, except story. The only two positive things I can comment about this movie is that Daniel Day-Lewis put in a wonderful performance as \\"The Butcher\\" and that I learned that Five Points was abysmally poor, a violent and iniquitous place. I suspect this movie does not fully represent all the population. There had to be poor immigrants who were desperately trying to live honest lives and had some sense of decency. I suspect this movie wants to emphasize the violence and corruption, which it does to overplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Native\\" was disappointed.","review":"I don't even know where to begin. I gave this movie one star because the only thing I liked about it was the fact that there was a movie during the civil war in the New York. That never happens. I'm a history buff. I love period films. I love movies that take place in New York. I didn't like this movie. First off. DiCaprio was miscast bigtime. Should have been Depp or someone else. I have no feeling on Diaz. She could have stayed or left. Whatever. Day-Lewis was good for whatever that was worth. The title was wrong. Yes, there were tons of GANGS in NEW YORK but that was NOT what the story was about! The film was long for nothing. a chunk could have been cut out in the middle and we would have not really skipped a beat as far as the story was concerned. Scorcese was trying to tell too many stories instead of sticking to the main one. Not usually his style. Characters weren't developed. Overproduced. Sloppy. Uggh! I couldn't wait for it to end. I was exhausted. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attrocious","review":"I haven't seen a movie this bad in years. Yikes. You almost have to be doing it on purpose to get it to be this bad.

They have spelled out all the reasons why I, too, was let down by it.I also agree with a previous reviewer who recommended instead the great Brazilian movie \\"City of God\\". That person is right: \\"City\\" is everything \\"Gangs\\" should have been. It brilliantly tells the story of two generations of violent gangsters in a squalid, no-hope slum, and how people got sucked into a life of crime and could never escape. It is an unforgettable movie, unlike Scorsese's recent dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't buy into the hype, this was one of the worst movies of 2002. The acting was marginal, except for Daniel Day Lewis who did a great job. The story line was terrible. The script is terrible. How much symbolism do you need in one movie?

I recommend seeing this, all-in-all it's a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than satisfied","review":"I found the Gangs of New York rather disappointing, especially after the numerous Golden Globe nominations and glowing reviews. Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz saved the film. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was far less admirable than his performance in Catch Me If You Can.The editing was terrible with many of the transitions between scenes rather disjointed and choppy. In addition, the mentions of the Civil War did little to enhance the film. Eliminating the ill explained and poorly tied in portions of the film would have saved at least 30 minutes and the movie.The cinematography left quite a bit to be desired. The scenery was obviously comprised of painted back-drops and poorly designed sets.Overall, I was less than impressed and rather disappointed as I expected far more from Martin Scorsese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Scorsese befallen the fate of Woody Allen?","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of Gangs of New York. I have seen every Scorsese movie since Taxi Driver, and have loved them all. I particularly like the variety of his work, from Kundun to Age of Innocence to Goodfellas. I thought him to be the Sondheim of the cinema.I was very disappointed with Gangs. I did not care for the characters. The plot meandered. Only the last shot with the Brooklyn Bridge lived up to his past work.Diaz and DiCaprio were out of their league. Only Daniel Day-Lewis delivered. He gave a remarkable performance as the Butcher, but that alone could not save the movie.Has Scorsese befallen the fate of Woody Allen? Another once-admired director whose name alone brought me to the movie theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just too long to love","review":"As I said this movie was too long!

I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film With Overdone Stereotypes and Cliches","review":"Tale of survival and vengeance in the ethnically divided burroughs of 1860s New York where Leonardo DiCaprio seeks to avenge his father's killer and gang chief played by Daniel Day-Lewis.Certainly Scorcese brings out the smell of the tensions of the time, however, the acting and backdrops fail to bring any flavor to the story. The latter are too melodramatic and two-dimensional to bring the movie out of its Hollywood stereotype formula. Daniel Day Lewis plays his role well but the script and character is more archetypical than anything else; the characters psyche and motives aren't well explored. With so much of the film focusing on gangs and strife, one wonders why Cameron Diaz' character is included the story. The movie also has serious historical flaws as to events and the prevailing attitudes of the day.In the end, you feel as if you just watched an average blood-fest movie and not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm Not \\"Hip\\" enough for Scorcese Movies [Except \\"Goodfellas\\"]","review":"Too Long... too dark.... cinematography too \\"artificial\\" looking....characters were generally unlikeable....DayLewis over acts... my opinion, movie highly over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gangs of New York","review":"This was a very fun, interesting and violent movie. The acting was good. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio wasnt as bad as everyone is making out... but he did a good enough job to maintain his character in the movie in my mind. Cameron Diaz is always sexy in her movies, she was good to look at, and her character was a very interesting one. The best peice of acting came from Daniel Day-Lewis. He really got his character going the best, which was a joy to watch. The only problem i had with the movie, was that it seemed to lag a bit during the middle stages . It seemed that Scorcese was filling in the time with nothing scenes, but it comes out of the hole with a good ending. All the gangs in the movie are so different, which is cool. I also liked the firefighters :))) A very violent movie, but it doesnt go over the top. Very similar to the violence of Braveheart. Overall a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"Maybe the portrayal of NY in the 1800's was accurate, but still very poorly done. The movie lacks credibility. I had a hard time sitting through it. No one character engages the viewer; and no coherent theme emerges. Chaotic and busy...not one that I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously long and over-rated.","review":"I didn't like this movie at all. It was at least 2 hours way too long and so boring I almost fell asleep a bunch of times. I do agree that the visual effects of the movie are amazing, but that doesn't save the movie at all. I can't believe that this movie earned all the hype that it got. The story is basically Leonardo Dicaprio grows up to avenge the murder of his father which he witnessed. The movie could have EASILY been made into a two hour film - it didn't have to be an \\"epic masterpiece\\". I was really disappointed. I won't be watching it again.

But you watch this film pretty much for Lewis' magnetic performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give zero stars if I could","review":"What a pathetic excuse for a film. Scorcese has re-written history to provide a story that cannot merely be described as unauthentic but purely fictional. Yet usually fiction provides some kind of entertainment value while this is so painfully dull I could scarcely sit through it.Oh. And how about of religious intolerance thrown in for good measure? The Irish Catholics are depicted as a fun-loving, faith-filled group of enthusiasts who support treat African Americans as their brothers and allow women to play major roles in their uprising.

Only dark motivations are portrayed: hatred, vengeance, lust, desire for power. Forgiveness, love, gentleness, nobility--all are missing. (Save for one brief moment for the character elected mayor, and that ends in 20 seconds with a hatchet in his back.) Even the missionaries appear to be deluded fools. The major characters show no sign of personal growth (other than power, skill in murder, etc.).If you want to watch a movie that seeks to convince you that people are animals--that even President Lincoln was the moral equal of a bloodthirsty gang leader, then this is the film for you.If you want a film that shows the redemption of the violent, check out \\"The Mission\\" with Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be KIDDING me","review":"As a fan of all types of movies in various genres and with a taste for historical drama I just can't believe this flick is even considered to be passable. About the only redeeming quality was the expose on the Five Points in the mid 1800's. Insipid plot lines, wacky dramatic acting (are we expected to believe the DD Lewis character is crying over a dead rabbit after dispatching a dozen men at least with various knives, hence his name the butcher...). See it if you must but don't expect to be impressed, Scorcese was out to lunch on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring, Over-rated Movie of the Year","review":"This is the most mind-numbningly boring movie I've ever seen. The only redeeming quality is Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. I don't think I can say much about this movie that hasn't already been said, but it bored me nearly to tears and the ending was disappointing. It's one of those movies you watch and you think, \\"I sat through three hours... for THIS?\\" I suppose it's worth seeing, as it is a very ambitious movie, and it had a lot of potential, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much of A Good Thing","review":"This movie was very boring to say the least!

In any way.I like the actors. DeCaprio is one of my favorites. Lewis is always good, but I have seen this performance before in There Will Be Blood. Total over the top psycho.

Beyond his performance I didn't find much to like about the story or even the overblown \\"historic\\" look of the film. The scenes involving troops during the riots look stilted and unauthentic; a far cry from other films that portray the Civil War period. Scorsese is a complete failure at combat scenes. The love story between DiCaprio's and Diaz's characters are woefully predictable and downright silly. Leaving her on the cutting room floor would have greatly improved the film. Let's face it; Scorsese is way past his prime. Time to retire, Marty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Indulgent and Poorly Acted","review":"The only reason this one doesn't get 1 star is Daniel Day Lewis who is impressive in this movie as he is in all others. Dicaprio and Diaz however are laughably bad in this, and the movie is meandering and often seems lost in it's own murk. I would only reccomend this to Day Lewis fans, Scorsese fans should skip it because it doesn't add anything to what he has done, this one is kind of an embarassment. Scorsese has had his great films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, that's why I've been confused with his recent stuff, The Aviator wasn't that great either. My advice is simple...Dicaprio, DeNiro you are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Had potential too","review":"I can Not put into words how much i wanted to like it but, Scorsese just didnt show how life was like in that period and the movies plot was too cliche. the charachters had no charachter and dont get me started on the accents. the only decent performance(and this may be due to the director) were Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful transfer of a great movie","review":"The movie is a great, but we're talking about the Blu-Ray version of it. This is the worst Blu-Ray transfer I have yet seen. I already had the original DVD version, and expected a 1080p top quality transfer for the Blu-Ray, which this is not. I went back and watched some of the DVD version on an upscaling player, and it was indistinguishable from the Blu-Ray; both were well below the usual quality of a Blu-Ray. This may sadly indicate a growing trend, where an existing DVD transfer is run through an upscaler and put out on Blu-Ray, with the lie that it is a 1080p transfer. Judging from the many favorable reviews on this forum, many buyers' eyes or video system cannot tell the difference. I guess that is what the scoundrels who put out this Blu-Ray were banking on. I've just learned to be more careful about buying a Blu-Ray of something I already have on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker...","review":"This film aspires favourably as the all-time worst movie that I have ever wasted time watching. One big mess of unbelievable casting, acting and action - set in equally untrustworthy locations, with a non-existent storyline. Overall impression: \\"The Pirates of Penzance\\" meets \\"Spiderman\\" w/o the music.The weirdest thing is, that the film is barred of morality. As a consequence, it conveys no feelings to the spectator. There are no villains and no heroes - all characters are \\"bad\\" to some extent. The violence becomes senseless gore without empathy or sympathy, and the \\"romantic moments\\" are reduced to showing of bare flesh in paparazzi style. You're not involved in the action, but are prone to wonder how on earth 2 hours and 45 minutes can feel like an eternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, but a shameful blu-ray release","review":"If this is a movie that you would like to see with blu-ray resolution and color depth, you are going to have to wait. This disk is a mess; it is no better than the DVD release and that was technically poor. I do not understand how a major studio would approve. It is like early CD releases where no effort was made to take advantage of the new format. Many of those early releases have since been truly remastered, sometimes spectacularly, by a sound engineer who knew what he was doing. Let's hope that someone cares enough to do a second blu-ray release for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut- Please...","review":"I admit, I am an all or nothing film lover. 3/4 of this tragic waste of fabulous sets, costuming and acting talent should have landed on the cutting room floor. Of course, should that have happened, Scorsese would not have been able to justify his Epic sized budget to the the studio.

They go against everything that music is today but do it in an easy laid back way. What is rare with this album is the fact that you can hear that the band is enjoying themselves and just focused on making good music. Let's be honest with ourselves and admit that no band today is completely original. Every band adopts characteristics from bands before them. If Dr. Dog chose to emulate any band they chose the best; The Beatles. There is nothing about this album that I don't absolutely love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, not an ounce of originality","review":"I will start by saying I DO like this CD, but these guys need to put away 'Abbey Road' and 'Let It Be' and try to write some original music.

The open harmonies on 'The World May Never Know', the John Lennon-esque screams on 'The Pretender', the McCartney-esque piano lines though the whole CD and the Harrison-esque guitar fills on 'Wake Up', oh I could go on about every song.

It has the feel throughout of a group of first time actors playing medieval dress-up and dragons for the camera. The special effects consist of computer-generated dragons and an extreme overuse of people's backs getting set on fire... that's pretty much it. The plot is also very weak and typical. The fighting scenes are horribly choreographed and the acting is so bad that it looks like first time efforts for every actor except for the two kings and Theldag. Picture Ben Stiller with a slight beard, medieval clothes, and a wig. That's the hero in this calamity of a movie. There's also the typical trite and very poor attempt at humor spattered throughout also. This is definitely a low budget title. It's also in 4:3 full screen only.

But let's face it, if Angel Boris is in a movie, that's a good sign that the movie is going to suck. Not because she is a bad actress, but she's an average actress who probably can't land the good roles. But she's hot, so who cares?The only real reason to watch this movie is John Rhys Davies. He enjoys himself thoroughly playing a nasty, scheming bad guy, and gets most of the good lines in the film.The dragons are done with much better CGI than I would have expected from a Sci-Fi Channel movie, but the film makers must have spent 90% of their budget on the dragons, because the rest of the film is almost comically under-produced. There's like 10 people in the village where the king lives. The lack of budget shows.The acting? The plot? The dialogue? Well, let's say I've seen much, much worse.

Lianne is accused to sealing pricelss jade jewels from the Tang family and it is a race against time, the mafia, and the United States governement to recover the items.

I loved the patriarch of the Tang family, Wen, even though I believe he could have had more faith in Lianne.Some people complain that Lowell gives too much detail, but, for me, it was just right. The way Lowell described the jades made me picture it in my mind and I could almost reach out and touch it.I can't say I liked the character of Archer Donovan at all...he was always doubting Kyle's instincts and complaining that Kyle was thinking with the \\"little general\\" down there.Wonderful book, I didn't think I would like it.

I, personally gave up buying her books after Donovan series. When I checked the attitudes of other reviewers, I realized that this is a kind of trend actually. Donovan series are supposed to be good, however too much info about gemology (obviously she has lots of books on this issue) is really beyond boring. One reader had emphasized that Ms Lowell is either very good or very poor. I completely agree with her. The earlier books (even the naive ones) of Ms Lowell are much better than the recent ones.I could not see any character development in this one. To me the whole story was uninteresting and shallow. Too much cliche! Once again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jade Island","review":"I enjoyed the book but found it to be very similar to the author's other books on \\"the Donovans\\".

At the end of the book you do have a strong desire to read more about the adventures of this family and their risks/rewards in the world of precious stones and artifacts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book ! Definately a must read !","review":"I am relatively new to reading Elizabeth Lowell's books. I read Amber Beach which I thought was fantastic. When I reached the end of Amber Beach I found that Jade Beach had the first chapter included, and I fell in love with it. I found myself constantly checking bookstores for the book. I am a consumer that refuses to pay for a hardcover book but, I could not wait any longer to wait for Jade Beach to come out in paperback. So, I paid $16.00 for the book and found that it was definately well worth it. I found that I learned about Chinese culture and about Jade. And you definately could not beat the romance between Kyle and Lianne.

Kyle and Lianne make a perfect duo.As with the other Donovan books, the detail is a bit excessive and this story takes a while to really get started.As much as I loved Kyle and Lianne, one of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is the strong relationship between Kyle and his brother Archer. Something sadly lacking from Pearl Cove.The ending is a bit rushed and leaves the reader feeling vaguely dissatisfied. Otherwise, a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lianne and Kyle Donovan now.....","review":"\\"Jade Island\\" is a book in which you either liked it or you don't. Compared to \\"Amber Beach\\", I thought this was a great book. Yes, it may have rambled on about jade but I LOVED the hero/heroine of this book. I thought it was great that Kyle was in his own story and Lianne wasn't a bad character either. She may yearned for her oriental side of the family's affections but she was a self-sufficient, independent female and I liked that about her. There's no doubt in my mind that Kyle is my favorite Donovan sibling and that is one reason why I enjoyed this book stupendously. Maybe the ending was a little disappointing but overall, I've enjoyed this book a great deal! I have \\"Pearl Cove\\" but I've only skimmed through it. Kyle and Lianne are expecting twins!

The story is richly entertaining, and the information is wonderful, you can tell that EL really did alot of research for this one, I loved Amber Beach but Jad Island really takes the cake, I can't wait for the next one (hopefully it's going to be about Archer) I love the whole plot and theme of the story, a previous reviewer said that all the Jade information was boring but it's not true because it brings out the plot and makes the novel seem more exotic. Those people who skips over those parts might as well just not read the book. But all in all this is a wonderful book, and I'm checking almost every week just to see if the new one came out yet.

This product was basically useless to apply alone because without being combined with something else, it was as if I wasn't wearing anything. When I came home at night my armpits (and my clothes) would smell putrid. I'd have to wash everything after wearing it only once. Perhaps it was because it was unscented, I don't know. Also, you can't reapply it throughout the day--this will do nothing to get rid of body odor and will also contaminate the stick with your smell (hence the \\"only apply to clean underarms\\" directions on the label.

It has an adult theme - not too bad, I'd say most teenagers will get what's going on, but some people are going to freak out a little - let us say that human rights are NOT one of the antagonist's strong points. The Protagonist is fairly strong but not unbelievable. I found the book to be a pretty good and lively read once I got into it. Once you are about a quarter of the way thru, you might as well give up and read the whole thing, because it really picks up around then. The book deals with slavery and has some heavy overtones in that direction, but not as bad as a Gor book, for instance.

It is rich in detail, evoking a real sense of being there. The customs and mores of a very different non-western culture are laid out magnificently. Unlike more traditional detective stories, this novel is less about \\"figuring out\\" who the murderer is, and more about observing how Sano figures out what happened. On the way we come to know Japan better, and perhaps human nature also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling page-turner exposes feudal Japan","review":"The author's imagery worked very well for me. I quickly connected with Sano Ichiro's humility-tempered persistence. Though his misplaced loyalties and devotion to Bushido lead him deeper and deeper into the tangled web of the paranoic, machiavellian shogunate, his iron will, sense of rightness, and remembrance of promises made, lift him out of certain doom and into the good graces of the shogun himself. Will Sano's promotion be the well-deserved ending we hoped for? I can't wait to read more! Laura Joh Rowland has given us a new hero worthy of a hopefully long and prosperous series. Thanks!Note: I picked up \\"The Samurai's Wife\\" for a quick read. After a few chapters, I simply had to go out and find Shinju to start at the beginning of this enchanting series . . .

However, she has gone too far. She has infused the story with sensationalist descriptions of various perversions, whether to make it easier for the reader to loathe the antagonist, or who knows what. After a fashion the story irritates the sensibilities more than it entertains. I quit reading with less than 100 pages to go. My wife was reading Bundori as I read Shinju, and she came to the same conclusion independent of any input from me. Try again, Ms. Rowland.

His Arthurian ideals sustain him when he discovers a cover-up and risks all to reveal widespread corruption and a plot that threatens to topple the shogun.

One could not ask for a more complete text on building a custom electric. I got into guitars and found that the beauty of the construction was something that I had to learn more about. This book gives instructions on how to assemble your own custom axe from popular manufacturers' assembly-ready guitar parts. And even if you aren't going to make your own, buy this one to learn all about how the different parts work, from standard pickups to humbuckers, from tremolo and tonal controls to passive, noiseless pickups. The advice he gives also helped me choose specific components for my guitar, and then told me how to put it all together. Although it is out of print, try to order it through Amazon's Out-of-Print service, which has helped me in the past. A must for a guitar lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"About The Dark Trail","review":"Quite simply, an excellent Western novel.If Elmore Leonard collaborated with Dashiell Hammett to create a Western novel, it would look very much like Ed Gorman's Dark Trail.The characters are very well drawn. The writing is terse to complement the overall noir tone of the story.The climax is stunning.If you like Leonard's Western stories--and they are excellent--you will probably like this novel as well.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random, noisy and bizzare.","review":"I bought this ablum based on the description and on good reviews I had read elsewhere. However, this album did not live up to the hype. I was expecting melodic, futuristic, ambient music like artist Zero One. However, cyberCHUMP just seems to combine random, noisy and bizzare sounds that gave me a headache! I listened to the CD twice, to see if I would enjoy it more the second time, but I didn't. If you like your ambient music noisy with little or no structure, then this is for you. Otherwise skip this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate subtitle","review":"This 2001 book recounts the Marilyn Sheppard murder, the trial of her husband, the reversal of his conviction by the U.S. Supreme Court. the second trial when he was represented by F. Lee Bailey, his life after prison, and his death in 1970. I found the first two-thirds of the book told an interesting story in non-scintillating prose, but the final section, when the Sheppard Estate sued the County, was boring and showed that the the subtitle of the book is hype, not too accurate. The author makes at least one egregious error, when he says FDR appointed Harold Burton the the supreme Court, showing a lack of basic research on the part of the author. I am not sure the time I spent reading this book was well-spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and thorough","review":"Mr. Neff certainly did his homework on researching this case.

I had to skim over the chapter on the last trial, but otherwise, it is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent journalism, gripping style","review":"James Neff took over 10 years to gather facts and to compose \\"The Wrong Man\\", and it's well worth your own time to read this book. His engaging style effortlessly incorporates important details into the narrative. We are transported back to 1954, back to the era of post-war prosperity and the rise of the suburbs.The story of osteopathic doctor Sam Sheppard, who was convicted of his wife Marilyn's violent death and who served many years in prison before being released, re-tried and acquitted, is widely known. Neff's probing reveals that many people still hold misperceptions about the case.In true Perry Mason style, Neff introduces us to the real perpetrator, and provides an in-depth look at his troubled life. Using scientific evidence as well as psychological insights, he leads us to his conclusion about how and why Marilyn Sheppard was murdered on that Fourth of July nearly half a century ago.Neff's book is a first-rate true crime tale, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrong Book","review":"\\"The Wrong Man\\" examines with depth the tangled web of characters and theories surrounding the endlessly fascinating case of Dr. Sam Sheppard. However, having read widely on this subject, few of the theories presented in The Wrong Man are new. In particular, a great deal of research-based data concerning Richard Eberling was compellingly presented in \\"Mockery of Justice -- the True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case, by Cynthia L. Cooper and Sam Rees Sheppard, published in 1995 (hardback) and 1998 (paperback). Unfortunately, much of the research done by Ms. Cooper for her book now appears in \\"The Wrong Man.\\" While I am glad to see that writers continue to delve into this tragic case, there is little new in this book, and I enjoyed reading \\"Mockery of Justice\\" a great deal more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't have said it better than an expert did...","review":"I tried to write something great about James Neff's The Wrong Man: The Final Verdict on the Dr. Sam Sheppard Murder Case, but decided instead to use the words of one of my favorite mystery writers, Les Roberts, who writes a detective series starring Cleveland private eye Milan Jacovich.

She very successfully taught us to read and write Devanagari script, but we were all struggling with how to learn grammer and with beginning to speak with understanding.

It's refreshingly different, in the sound, and varied too. This album is one of my favorites. Though i dont think she has released her best songs yet. There's hip hop, rock, soft rnb, vietnameese rythmes, and eaven an indian kind of sound. My favorite tracks are:get the party started18 wheelermissundastooddear diaryjust like a pillfamily portraitdon't let me get melonely girlmy Vietnamcatch 22That's 10 of the 15 tracks.

Her next cd will probally make it on top of the charts. Pink had a very good cd in 2000 called Can't Take Me Home with her hit single Most Girls. Then she sang a song with Christina Aguilera, Lil'Kim and Mya which was on a soundtrack that could of had a better movie. Now she has a new cd which she is making very good progress with it since 2001 with her first hit single Get the Party Started. Then got of with that disco song and had another great single called Don't Let Me Get Me which I don't think was as good as Get the Party Started. Then two more hot singles called Just Like a Pill and Family Portrait. I think she is ready for her next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"plink punk pink","review":"I have to tell you that I had no intrest in Pink's 1st CD, but when I heard how she stalked Linda Perry it caught my eye. I was astoundingly suprised. What starts out as a very cool party CD (and I do mean VERY COOL!) blows up into a bluesy and intensly melodic groove thing. Good Golly! Somehow I think that Pink doesn't even know what she's capable of and all the better for us listeners. She is profound and believable; the real deal! Anyone and Everyone should give this a try. PINK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why don't I like Pink?","review":"Maybe it's because the actual music in her songs is the stalest, blandest bubblegum rehash that's dominated the airwaves in ages.

Gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"I promise you...I'm not crazy","review":"This CD isn't good. It is all about sex. And drugs...who needs to here about that? Avril Lavinge is AWSOME.

She doesn't color her hair pink anymore. Furthermore, what's up with that cover of \\"Going to California\\"? Plant and Page would be spinning in their graves if they were dead. It's horrendous and she gets the lyrics wrong too! Avoid this album if you're going to buy it thinking there's an excellent Led Zep cover on it. This album is as bloated as Pinks' beer belly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I bought this CD because I like the song \\"Let's get the party started.\\" But, frankly, it was a waste of money. The CD is horrible. The lyrics are harsh and full of language I wouldn't want to blare. Big mistake. I wish \\"Let's get the party started\\" was on a single - then I could sell this CD & just get the single. \\"Pink\\" (the gal) has an attitude and I hope some day she gets rid of the mean attitude - it shows in her music, and that's NOT a good thing. GOOD music is born out of love - not hatred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"The album is for (stupid) children.

Gone are the funky R & B street sounds from her first album, leaving only a mediocre effort to move into the genre of \\"girl rock\\". Why would an artist who showed such promise with her debut change everything for the sophomore effort? I don't \\"undaztand\\"! My suggestion is to wait and see what the next cd brings. If you absolutely have to buy this one, look for it used. I'm sure there will be plenty of copies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink shouldn't have gone 4 Non Blonde!","review":"I tried to listen to her new cd objectively and not to compare it to \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" since it has been made clear that it was not going to be the same style.Well, Linda RUINED Pink!!the words may be good but, i just cant sit and listen to this cd over and over like i was looking forward to doing. Only about half the songs are worth my time. the songs had no soul to them. no anger! no angst! no love! no GRRRL power! just passive lack of emotion.Please, Pink!

These are my favorite songs Don't let me get me (I swear she is talking about me), Just like a pill(some relationships are like that), Get the party started (Like it), Respect (A very good song, Ladies you need to listen to this!), 18 Wheeler (a good fighter song), Misery (Duet with Steven Tyler oh yeah!), Numb (Angry song yeah I like it!!)As you can probably tell I really like this c.d. To me this is the best of Pink!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missundaztood-Not anymore!","review":"Pink debut album wasn't that bad, but wasn't the best either.And I am so over all these ppl saying\\" What about her R&B?\\" I think she still loves it, but she's not recording what \\"L.A. told {her}...\\" anymore.Pre-\\"Pink\\" days she sang in punk/ pop/ r&b,& gospel.It's the release of \\"Missundaztood\\" where she shines. She shows how versitle her voice is. I think \\"Family Portrait\\" & \\"just like a Pill\\" are creative & they're not your typical realtionships gone bad songs. I also love \\"Misery\\" w/ Steven Tyler. @ this point I think Pink can sing anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Switch for Pink..!!","review":"I've been a fan of Pink ever since the first word of \\"There you go\\" hit my ears. Missundaztood is a huge leap of genre for Pink...From funky hip hop to easy fluid infectious rock..The whole Cd is freaking awesome!!!!My faves are : Like a Pill, Numb, Goin To California, and My Vietnam.By releasing this album Pink puts herself on the same wavelink as most every young adult on the planet..We all look for someone who has been through the same things as we are going through or have been through, and she perfectly portrays that by not being afraid to go through the rough times as well as love herself in front of the whole world!If you are looking for a cd that has a song for every mood. Then, Missundaztood is the CD for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion....","review":"If i could i would give it 7 stars. I just love the cd. I was surprised when i found myself loving the cd because i was expecting to hear sounds more like her single \\"get the party started\\" which i liked when it first came out but quickly grew sick of it. the cd's sound is much different from that. only 2 other songs i would consider to be in the same relm as that song. its so great and really has a song on there for everyone to connect to. pink is wonderful and hopefully she will be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awesome! And very textured","review":"You won't find a single disappointing on here! The best songs in my opinion are M!ssundaztood cuz its the kind of upbeat pop song you listen to at the beach during summer, Just Like a Pill 'cuz it lets people know how confused she is about her relationships, Respect feat. Scratch from The Roots because it reminds me of the songs on her first album Can't Take me Home with its hyper beat and hardcore feel, Misery feat. Steven Tyler cuz their voices blend very well and sound nice. I think anybody who loves real music, and not teen pop, should get this. Pink has proven herself, she really has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great C.D.!!","review":"This is a very good C.D.!! I recommend that you listen to it. My favorite song \\"Get the Party Started\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG Pink rocks!","review":"Pink is the greatest singer ever! Get this CD NOW! That last reviewer is the stupid one for saying this CD is for \\"stupid\\" kids.Anyway, this Cd is just AWESOME! All the songs are good but i really like Respect, 18 wheeler,Don't let me get me, and Lonly Girl.BUY THIS CD NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh?","review":"This is a bad cd. Its really messy. All the songs sounds messed up alittle. Except maybe her singles. But i mean...California? Thats a bad song. And My Vietnam? GOd? What was she on when she picked it? Well i'm not sayign its an all bad cd. I really do injoy ' Get the party started' and ' Missundaztood'. And ' 18' wheeler. Thats about it... i suggest u jus download the songs. Alot easier n cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get The Cd Started","review":"This CD was very good. It mostlikely would hae recieved 5 stars but there was this one song that i just can't stand. I thought the CD was very outgoing and is a good follow up for 'can't take me home'.Get this party started was my favorite song. I thought it was sweet how she add 'My Vietnam' to the album (she and her father used to sing it when she was little). The songs sort of had the same vibe, but not the always so recognizeble vibe but THE vibe thats the perfect fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, it doesn't suck","review":"It doesn't suck. I think that Pink is pretty cool and I love her philosophy and the fact that she loves Britney Spears and N'sync, the best people around! I also love her song 'Get the Party Started' it is cool, but overall I wouldn't buy the album. I know she doesn't think she's pretty but she is. I don't totally hate it. It's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"Unlike Pink's last CD which was mostly R&B she has grown. It's a rock, rap, R&B record with less R&B then her last. She is talking about real stuff in her songs. Divorce, Patriouism, being Misunderztood. Its a great CD for any girl. At first you may not enjoy it or at least i didnt but the songs grow on you. if your looking for a different kind of sound this is it. Unlike her first released song \\"Get The Party Started\\" no other songs are like it on the album. Its more rock and real life songs that i really enjoy listening to at least 6 times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Essential","review":"This is the German import of M!ssundaztood, it includes the exclusive track Catch 22, an R&B dance track that fans of her first album (Can't Take Me Home, 2000) will absolutely love. If you liked Get The Party Started, you must buy this album. Check my reviews (December 19,2001) for a full review of this record, but believe me when I say it is one of the best of last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Rocks!","review":"I've liked Pink from the start and although I was aware of the changes in her music I didn't realise just how much it had changed. Compared to her first album which was solely RnB this album rocks! It's a totally unique style and i think it really suits her voice I'm proud to say I'm a Pink fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe change isn't always a good thing. . .","review":"I must say I was feeling the first album, \\"Can't Take me Home\\" however, maybe she flipped the script a little too much too soon with this second go'round. Don't get me wrong, I really like Pink, just the old Pink. I don't know the reason behind the change but perhaps there is a lesson to be learned: Change isn't always a good thing. There are some tracks that are enjoyable on the album but the first album I could listen the whole way through and like every track. Not this time. If you are an R&B fan, this really isn't that type of album. Maybe she'll go back to the original her on the next one. The only change I like was her look. She looks really good. She seems undecided on what music category she wants to be in. The title suits the album, because I sure \\"Missundaztood\\" what she was about. Come on Pink, you had a good thing going, don't mess it up now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink is about as real as Avril Lavigne","review":"Pink is another pop artist whose music and image I loathe (alongside Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton). There is nothing tough or \\"punk\\" about this twit. Her hair color is about original as Avril Lavigne's attitude. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is just about the stupidest song title that any artist come up with (except for Aaron Carter's \\"The Clapping Song\\"). I swear if I hear \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", \\"Just Like a Pill\\", and \\"Get This Party Started\\" one more time, I am going to use my stereo as the sacrificial lamb for a voodoo ritual to try to make my local radio stations stop playing her godawful music incessantly. I can't stand her new song \\"Family Portrait\\". Any wonders why I can't stand listening to artists [whine]and moan about their personal life without any form of redemption or hope. \\"Missundaztood\\" is just a vile piece of work that should only be used as a coaster or as a frisbee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Pinkness!","review":"Great cd, she's such an amazing singer. I love the fact that she can sing any genre of music! I definitely recommend this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge on its own merit","review":"This was a very good CD. The more I listened to it the more I liked it. True this album is different from her first, but different isn't always bad. In fact, this CD proves that Pink has a broader range than people give her credit for. She can sing the heck out of R&B (my personal favorite), but she's just as good at soul, pop, and alternative rock. After reading the other reviews, it was obvious that the people who were polarized to solely one kind of music or the other (R&B or Pop) couldn't fully appreciate this album. There isn't a song on the album that's hard to listen too. I'll let you decide for yourself which ones are your personal favorites. Personally, If Pink can keep turning out albums like this regardless of the music focus, I'll keep buying. I give it two thumbs up! My big toes too."},{"rating":"2","title":"paint the world p!nk","review":"I fell in love with this CD. I love the fact that she writes from her heart and her experiences. Anyone can relate to her songs because they're real. My favorite songs are \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Misery\\" [where she does a wonderful duet with Areosmith's lead singer, Steven Tyler]. Everyone should own this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THis was an OK Cd","review":"This CD's first 6 songs were really good, but it just went downhill after that. Missundaztood, Don't Let Me Get Me, Get the Party Started, and 18 Wheeler were definetly the best. The ones at the end are all very slow and boring and are not worth the money. But the beginning certainly is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one Pink","review":"I give this 4 stars because there is some songs on here I don't like. Otherwise, this CD is worth it to keep forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink rocks!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a very good CD! Pink made a comeback with this one! Even though \\"Cant take me home\\" was better, \\"M!SSUNDAZTOOD\\" still stands out. \\"Don't let me get me\\" and \\"Just like a Pill\\" are my favorites. BUY THIS CD! SUPPORT PINK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big step from \\"Can't Take Me Home\\"","review":"\\"Missundaztood\\" proves that Pink is indeed different from many of those other young female artists, and that she's more than just a hair color. She's got her own unique style. Linda Perry was an excellent choice for a producer! She gives it the rock edge that most pop needs now-a-days like the catchy \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Numb\\". Yet, there's still a little pop/dance moments like \\"Get This Party Started\\" and the girl-power song \\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\\". Her raw emotion shows greatfully on tracks such as \\"Family Portrait\\" and \\"My Vietnam\\". I can feel her sense of loss and childhood pain.If you're looking for pop music with a ton of edge, this is the one. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. If you've listed to \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" a million times, you may have to listen to \\"Missundaztood\\" two or three times to appreciate it, but you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUNK PARADISE & SUGARLESS! Can it get any better than that?","review":"This cd, contrary to a review by rich26, is DA BOMB! It's rich with punk and hip-hop, and has really catchy tunes similar to those of Sum-41 and Blink-182. One of the best things about it is that it isn't all about romance, and isn't *sweet & sugary* like some singers, like...Myra, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore...don't get me wrong, I love all these singers, but not everybody sounds good singing pop and sweet bubblegum stuff. It would also get very boring if all the singers sang about romance, and were all pop singers. Please! It wouldn't be called music anymore, but back to my main point...this new cd of Pink's was a smashing hit, at least to me, and has honest and truthful lyrics, and some great rockin', and plenty of good songs. If you don't have this cd, I really encourage you to buy it! Believe me, it won't give you a toothace from too much *sugar*...in fact, this cd (thank goodness!) is, technically, *sugarless*!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Language alert","review":"I bought this CD for my daughter's 8th birthday as she is a pink fan. She hears one of the songs on the radio and really likes it. Before I gave it to her, I opened it so I could see if the lyrics were included. They were, and I was horrified. I thought warning stickers were placed on CD's for language content. In any case, if you're buying this for a child you should know the language in some of the songs is pretty low class. I don't know about you, but I don't want my kid dropping the \\"F\\" word into conversation thinking that's acceptable because she heard it in a song."},{"rating":"1","title":"st!nk","review":"Same old manufactured pop puppet.

I've heard 'My Vietnam', 'Family Portrait', 'Just Like A Pill', and the worst song of the millenium 'Get this party Started'. Are you the next Vince Niel!? Stop singing about partying, that trend died in '91! And Vietnam was a terrible time in US and world history, I bet if Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains heard that song you'd be in a morgue by this time tomorrow, because people like Jerry know how bad Vietnam was, considering he lost his FATHER there, you selfish b***h!

Her songwriting is comparable to poems that 5th graders write. In the somber, cry-for-me hip-hop cut \\"Family Portrait\\", Pink sings \\"I promise I won't spill the milk at dinner.\\" Please. And she's got so many songs on here that make her sound like a whiney high schooler who just wants to party all day: in \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" she basically sends the messege that you should never respect adults and be selfish. In \\"My Vietnam\\" she whines, \\"I never liked school that much, they tried to teach me better.\\" Ridiculous. She has a voice that will get her far, if only she can find good material and lyrics to use it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"the faded color pink","review":"Pink (more so than Brittney) is the utmost example of the pupetteer business of having a record deal. Pink has a good voice, but the \\"no one likes me, no one understands me\\" act is irritating and tiring. She tries so hard to be different, that it comes off as a pure ACT. Wasn't she R&B before? Don't tell me she's another Mariah coming out of her \\"True\\" shell.She name-drops too much, but I give her credit for effort in writing lyrics that TRY to be controversial. If one is indeed so original and controversial, she wouldn't have to try so hard, and it would show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I couldn't have been more disappointed. Here's a classic case of there only being ONE good song on the entire CD, \\"Get the Party Started\\" which was released first. I wish I would have bought the single instead. Don't get me wrong... I LOVED her first CD. I played it to death! I was holding my breath for her second CD. I've used 'Missundaztood' as a drink coaster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As It Originally Seems","review":"The first time you listen to this, you might think, 'wow, she's really turned it around, talking about drugs, and broken homes.' But then you hear it again, and begin to realize that, yes, she's got the balls to talk about this stuff, but she's really not doing it all that well. Pink has no insight to offer into any of these scenarios, and leaves you wondering if she's speaking from experience, or trite, cliche, bad movies, and those info-mercials that try to be cool (\\"tobacco is wacko\\", for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling!","review":"One of the other reviewers said if you want to expect R+B and Hip-hop you will be disappointed, and boy was I! It is full of pseudo-Bon Jovi rubbish. Check out the schmaltziest lyrics in the world on 'My vietnam'. At least Britney and Nsync have the integrity not to pretend they're something they're not. This isn't rock music (it just really wants to be), this isn't pop music, and (unfortunately) it isn't R+B (I bought the album without listening to it first on that mistaken impression). Yeah, 'Get the Party Started' is great. That's why it's the first single...it's the only good one on the album...and guess what? It wasn't written by her!!! I've wasted my money on this...and I strongly advise you not to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst analogies ever!","review":"To be fair there are some very good songs on the CD - about 4 or 5 in my opinion. Not nearly as good as the first album.But the rest are hard to tolerate. The lyrics are childish and worse - hard to block out while still listening to the music. I find myself skipping to the middle of the CD and stopping it before the end.I should have downloaded the songs and deleted the ones I don't appreciate..."},{"rating":"2","title":"P!nk...","review":"this cd is cool and pink seems to have a gift to write cool lyrics, her voice is cool and strong. my favourites songs on the album are: \\"Eventually\\", \\"Misery\\" which is a duet with steven tyler,\\"Numb\\",\\"M!ssundaztood\\", \\"Just like a pill\\", and \\"Respect\\".this is a cool cd and you should buy it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missundaztood","review":"The album I choose to review is Pink's Missundaztood. The reason I choose this album was because I like her music a lot. Her songs are really good. The words in her songs have a strong meaning in them and it represents who she is. That's one of the things I like about her music is that she writes about stuff that means something to her. Some of her songs represent what her life was like growing up.As you all know she sings pop, and that's the kind of music I like to listen to. And if you like pop music then you will love Pink's Missundaztood. My favorite songs on her CD are \\"Missundaztood,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Get Me,\\" \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" and \\"Get the Party Started,\\" are really good songs. And if you like any of these songs then you should go out and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Fun","review":"I'm 42 years old and have been listening to music of all varieties for longer than many of the other reviewers have been alive. I love this album. It's fresh, energized and soulful. Pink has a sense of self and awareness that doesn't usually come until much later in life. She's an extraordinary young artist; I congratulate her on her initial success and look forward to much more from her in the years to come. P.S. My kids love this album too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Made Me Red","review":"I don't understand the hype surrounding Pink. Her first album was wwwaaayyy better than this mess she calls,\\"Missundaztood\\". The only songs I like are:Get The Party Started18 WheelerMissundastoodBut the rest of the album bored me to tears. But lets give credit where credit is due, at least her \\"punkness\\" is more real than Avril."},{"rating":"2","title":"autobiographical","review":"Pink's new cd is really doing great....going triple platinum after only 2 singles so far....the singles are great which relly help the cd, but her autobiographical disc..her music reflects whatever u can relate to...my favorite track on the disc is 'JUST LIKE A PILL' AND '18 WHEELER'.Hearfelt music that is sure to reach the masses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best album","review":"This is her best album, the lyrics are good, the beats are so catchy. It's better than 'Can't Take Me Home' and 'Try This.' And kid who said this is all sex and drugs (????!!!!?!?!?!), have you even actually listened to this CD, you retard??!! Not a single song here even hints at either one of those things! God I hate when people write utterly random BS here. She does say 'I can go for miles if you know what I mean' once in \\"Get The Party Started,\\" and the symbolism in \\"Just Like A Pill\\" might confuse a few people, but trust me, this is pretty damn tame when you compare it to other stuff out there. Anyways, ignore the obviously wrong haters and BUY THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than i expected","review":"I knew that I would like at least one of the songs but i did not expect the onslaught that awaited me...The chick can definately carry a key and kept my attention long enough from pressing the eject button.I dont believe I will get bored of this album thankfully because the radio has not killed any particular song..I think family portrait is an abosutely powerful song with strong lyrics and beautful harmonies. Waiting to see what she can come with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"the faded color pink","review":"Pink (more so than Brittney) is the utmost example of the puppeteer business of having a record deal. Pink has a good voice, but the \\"no one likes me, no one understands me\\" act is irritating and tiring. She tries so hard to be different, that it comes off as a pure ACT. Wasn't she R&B before? Don't tell me she's another Mariah coming out of her \\"True\\" shell.She name-drops too much, but I give her credit for effort in writing lyrics that TRY to be controversial. If one is indeed so original and controversial, she wouldn't have to try so hard, and it would show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"I really liked the singles I heard off the radio from Pink's new album, so I was extremely excited when I got it. This album is very much like a journey into Pink's past, with songs like \\"Family Portrait\\", \\"Dear Diary\\", and \\"My Vietnam. I like most of the songs, which include \\"Lonely Girl\\", \\"My Vietnam\\", (though I know Pink can write better songs than that!) \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", and \\"Get the Party Started\\". Some songs did get annoying because Pink sounded very whiny. If I had to choose, the best song would be \\"Get the Party Started\\", and \\"Misery\\" would get the trophy for worst song on Missundaztood. Mostly a terrific album, and many people will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!!","review":"As the amazon.com reviewer points out, this CD is NOTHING like Pink's first. If you loved that one, as I did, you most likely will NOT love this one. Her infectious dance/R&B songs on the first disc were a whole lotta fun. This time out, Pink wants to be a rock chick, and her efforts in that regard do absolutely nothing for me. That doesn't mean you won't like the new disc; just try and hear it before buying it so you don't make the same mistake I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This album is 100% better than her first one. This one has better tracks such as 'family Portrait' that is personal and lovely. 'Get the party started' is incredibly catchy and a great dance song. 'R.E.S.P.E.C.T' is a really cool song that has a good beat about it. I love all the songs on P!nk's albuma nd think that she is an talented singer that just does not care about what other people think about her!!! I think that her voice is.... fab!!! I am so happy she was discovered as a artist because i would hate to think of her as a undiscovered talent that only sings at talent shows and in her bedroom!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Hey I love the songs on this album! P!nk is very easy to relate too and she sings about actual life not phony stuff. My three favorite songs on this album-3. Like a pill2. Family Portrait1. Don't Let Me Get MeAwesome songs that dig right into you. I recommend this Cd to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love almost every song on here!","review":"When I got this album I was in love with it and after a year I find that there are songs on here that I would consider some of my most favorite songs ever.This album does have it's bad spots, Family Portrate (horrible single choice) being one of them. But I feel that the great songs stand out more then those. 18 Wheeler is by far the best track on this album, it's a powerful angry song that just makes you wanna be stronger, Numb is also good, Just Like A Pill, Get The Party Started, Don't Let Me Get Me, and the tital track are all brilliant songs. I reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's of 2002","review":"This CD was so great! I don't even know how to put in words how wonderful it truly is. If anyone gets a chance to see Pink in concert, she is better then on the CD! I saw her this past summer and it is what prompted me to get her album. She was Terrific!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice of music","review":"Let me be honest with you. The music on this CD is NOT good. NONE of the music nowadays is good. The songs on here don't have interesting melodies. Songs of genres like rap don't even have melodies. And in all other genres of new music (e.g. pop, R&B, rock) the melodies of the songs are either boring or ugly. If a song that is popular these days has a catchy melody, it's a catchy UGLY melody. Melodies have to be nice to be enjoyable, like in classical music. Here is a simple rule: For music to be good, it has to first of all HAVE a melody, and second the melody has to be catchy and NICE (NOT UGLY)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Who?","review":"This album was horrible. I wish that I had never bought it for my sister. When we first put it in to listen in her car we made it through the first two songs and out the window it went. If you were driving down Highway 101 and accidently got hit with the worst album ever created we're sorry you had to be in it's presence. She has to be not only the worse performer of all time, but one of the worse \\"pop\\" singers of all time. When it comes to vocal talent I'd give Pink a 3 out of 10. When it comes to knowledge of music she get's a 0 out of 10. When it comes to physical beauty, well we can all agree she looks like a man. When it comes to pop music, she doesn't know what it means. She needs to learn that she isn't accepted by any facit of the music community. Her 15 minutes are up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.. No thanks...","review":"ah pop. i completely loathe pop. it takes no talent whatsoever. pink is not a \\" punk rocker \\" like many of the little teeny boppers think she is. I'm sorry to say that pink is sadly unoriginal. while she is 10x better than britney (and i emplore her for that) she is still not all that she is cracked up to be. sorry hun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"Pink's CD is a great! She shows emotion and energy. I totally recomend this CD for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Irritating","review":"When will artists realize that \\"Nobody understands my pain. Nobody likes me. I am so misunderstood and unapreciated\\" is not a good act to try to make a career out of. Pink is just trying to sell the rebel rocker thing too hard here. The only song I like is \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" and don't ask me why I even like that. Her first CD was so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get yourself a gun,hun!!","review":"This album is a serious let down on what i was expecting. Maybe my expectations were too high but apart from 'get the party started' this material just gives me the impression that Pink is heading for a very expensive rehab clinic very soon. No mention of Robbie Williams here but at least he did it with style. Pink goes from on track to the next with new miseries in each new track. The only praise i would give her is the touching track 'my vietnam' which reflects how her personal war relates to the one her late father fought in. Her first album was a massive hit with me but i think her change from RnB to Pop will only benefit her financial as i will think twice before buying her next material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious","review":"People say Pink goes against \\"society\\" and is a bad ass. Any idoit can go around in public drunk. Furthermore though, her music sucks. There is nothing that sets it apart from any other mainstream moron. If you buy this CD you might as well be throwing your money in a fire"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and blue all over...","review":"I liked the first Pink album. I think she's a beautiful person with a very strong attitude. I enjoyed the first single off this album and the video. I bought this CD and [didn't like it]. The lyrics are absolutely mind numbing to where i was embarassed listening to it, AND I'M NOT EVEN FEATURED ON IT! This is an embarassment to Pink. This isn't rock, or pop, or anything other than bulltripe on wax. I would rather listen to a Slipknot remix of Britney Spears' \\"Slave 4 U\\" than listen to this... from beginning to end. The beats are wack. The lyrics are wack (and we wondered why Four Non-Blondes didn't last long), and the whole vibe is wack. If she hopes to heal after the cut this is gonna make she'd better call in Timbaland, Missy, JD, Swizz Beats, and The Neptunes for the next album. As much as I hate all of those people it's the only way she'll survive..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TREMEDOUS WASTE of Money","review":"I bought this CD, thinking it would be a good CD because I liked the song \\"Don't Let Me Get Me.\\" The rest of the songs are awful, rife with curse words and have no beauty to them at all. Beautiful music should be HUMBLE and yet have a divinly beautiful message. This is awful and slanderous to music. The words are just an example of what America has done to its children. Even the song respect is not very respectful to people who want to hear clean thoughts.This CD is just awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Stinks","review":"There's very little that's endearing or enduring about today's musicial artists. Popular music is more disposable than ever, just like most other things in our culture. Most so-called \\"artists\\" are just creatures of the music industry's massive marketing machine. Precious few have any staying power beyond a song or two. Pink is certainly right in the middle of this unremarkable pack. \\"Get the Party Started\\" is the most shallow, uninspired, stupid song I've heard in a while. For the 5 people still watching videos on MTV, Pink's visuals are as memorable as the drive-though at McDonalds. A year from now she'll be calling radio stations to request her own songs. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is missundaztood!","review":"Ok there are only a few songs that are good on this album. I don't even know what style of music this is. P!nk could have done better than this. \\"Dear Diary, Numb, Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like A Pill\\" are the only good songs. And most of the songs have bad words in it. This cd is really missundaztood. I'm glad that she changed her style of music. This is like rap, pop and something else that I'm not getting the point of. A lot of P!nks albums and songs are good, but this one is not all there."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a class of her own","review":"I love this album. Several of the songs are on my personal list of all-time faves (\\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Just Like A Pill\\"), and all the songs are interesting and well put-together. Her songs range from awesome dance tracks (\\"M!ssundasztood\\" and \\"Respect\\") to funky car-singalong jams to honest and heartbreakingly personal ballads. Her sound is original and instantly recognizable, and she always stands out from the crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"P!nk CD is pretty cool","review":"i like the pink CD a lot, but not all the songs are great. My favorite song is the popular \\"Dont let me get me\\" Others I like are M!ssundaztood, Just like a pill, get the party started, respect, 18 wheeler, family potrait (sad), lonely girl, and my vietnam. So I like 9 out of 14, which is pretty good. I would recommend people to buy this CD, but just dont expect to like every single song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Pink?","review":"I loved her first cd,with the R&B feeing through out the album.This one is different. it is mostly rock based and some of the songs didn't really fit the album nor her style. i know she is trying different directions in music but this is not pink. \\"Can't take me home\\" album has more emotions rather than all that junk britney stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!!! A must have!!!!!!***","review":"With songs like Respect and Get This Party Started, Pink Missundaztood is sure to be a big hit.

Buy Pink today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip Hop Diva or Rocker Chick??","review":"So is Pink rap or rock?

The beats are annoying, the singer is annoying, just everything about this is annoying! First off she complains about everything! Secondly she NEVER will be Britney Spears or Christina!

It sounds like some wanna be ghetto girl acting cool. What do people see in rediculous lyrics and stupid radio songs like \\"Get this party started?\\" There is absolutely no depth to these songs at all. Some variation would have been nice. There is nothing to be mizunderstood about my review: this cd is pointless and irritating. Pink is on her way to Tiffanyland, if you catch my drift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey [...] cant i give this 0 stars?","review":"Thats what Pink and this album deserve. Hey Pink werent you that R&B girl a while back? I didnt know that you were a Punk rocker Pink? Oh maybe thats because you're a poser. She gets into the music industry as an R&B girl so she gets fame that way and then turns around and expects people to believe you're punk the next album. Sorry Pink but REAL punk rockers dont sell their soul to record labels. They make music on their OWN terms and have no apologies for it. Dont buy this album and save your money for the new Joey Ramone album. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this cd","review":"This is a graet cd.Pink has a voice that can't be match.I love all the songs but my favorite's are Don't Let Me Get Me and Family portrait.Both give a personal glimpse into Pink's life and let's us see we all have problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who'd have thought?","review":"I liked Pink's first album well enough (not well enough to buy it), but didn't think that she would go the distance. What a shocker to hear this album. It is nothing short of amazing, quite a turnaround. I hope that people are able to embrace this for the great pop disc that it is. She comes across like Sheryl Crow in one song, then channels Klymaxx in the next. Many of the songs have a confessional quality and maturity that Britney couldn't even approach in all her panting about being a woman. Pink also has more importantly, a sense of humor. There are R & B tinged dance tracks for sure, but even they are pop songs in the classic sense. After the death of Aaliyah, I felt that there was no hope on the pop landscape. This sophomore effort by Pink is full of promise. Only flaw I found was the end was a little ballad heavy. Bravo as well to producers Linda Perry ('What's Up\\", indeed!) and the very versatile Dallas Austin. Get this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing New Sound","review":"I've actually had this CD awhile, but I've just now gotten around to writing a review for it. I also own Pink's debut CD, and the songs on it that I liked I loved, but too many on there bored me. However, Missundaztood is an amazing album! She's developed a totally different sound and her lyrics have gone to the next level, giving more thought and more importance to her songs. There's isn't a song on this CD that I don't enjoy (and that's a rarity...the skip buttons are my best friends, usually). I recommend this to anyone who liked her old sound, and I also recommend this to anyone who just wants something fresh that's not in the same category as Britney and Christina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't too shaby for a chick with Pink hair!","review":"I have never heard of this artist before; I bought it for one song but ended up loving 90% of the disc!

I bought it mainly for Just Like A Pill and found that most of the songs on her appeal to me.

Just enough for extra flexabliity. I'm sure the more I wear them, they will stretch out a bit.. It's the perfect walking shoe, casual, the most comforable I've had.

In the past, I've had problems with lengths -- a 10 is short, while a 10 1/2 is long. Even with thickly cushioned socks, this shoe is far too wide. And it's not even that cute.

That is very difficult to do because this book is so slender-perhaps they were thinking we would put it in our pocket?

The story of a would-be spy and second class everything, the driving point of this novel revolves around a broken love affair. This should be called a \\"novel of dissimulation\\" instead of a spy novel, but that category doesn't sell very well. Very much in the Le Carre tradition of \\"ordinary men doing ordinary things and calling it adventure\\" the author can't decide whether his character is an antihero, or just a failure. Probably both. There is actually some excellent writing, and wonderful observations of \\"the games people play\\", but not enough to redeem the book.

There was no action, no spying, no suspense of any sort: just self-absorbed drivel up to that point. Characters and events hinted at, but poorly. Perhaps the book gets better, but you know what, I am 41 and I was once told to subtract your age from 100 and if a book doesn't grab you by that number's page, move on.

The pacing was so awkward that it felt realistic, which perhaps makes it not awkward at all. Alec Milius is not terribly likable which, again, plays to the verisimilitude of the book. And then there was some clumsy plotting, particularly towards the end. I'm afraid that this did not lend itself to anything at all-- except, perhaps, to identify this as a freshman effort.But, still interesting. I liked it enough to read a second by Cummings.

Indeed, Mr. Cumming is a wordsmith and I admire an author with good command of the written word. I kept waiting to like someone...maybe the main character's best friend Saul was the most likeable character but that's not saying much. The main character, Alec, is a miserable, weak-willed, whiny, self-obsessed pathetic excuse of a man.

'The Reign of Richard Lionheart' tracks nearly eight hundred years worth of wildly different, parallel interpretations of Richard's history. Historical fashion is as much the topic here as this controversial king's achievements.\\"Do not mistake this book for a straightforward biography of Richard III. Rather, it is a study of many interpretations of the man. Depending on the age in which they wrote, historians have suffered severe mood-swings: they either loved him or reviled him, his warlike career interpreted either as a badge of honor or of shame (while he spent a fortune on war and neglected other aspects of his subjects' care).By Robert Fripp, author ofPower of a Woman.

The theme provides a phenomenal opportunity to explore the nuances of children who are raised in a dual culture syndrome. Failing to take this opportunity, Subash Ghai settles for less than mediocrity.The performances are lifeless,concept of editing is lost, the direction fails to tango with the script and the music is a mishmash of Anu Malik's past scores.This film does not hurt your sensibilities simple because it assumes you have none.Not a film, I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do like it, but cannot compare","review":"YAADEINI do like it, but is not one of my favorite, however very well play by all the artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in purchase","review":"I purchased this dvd hoping it would be a great copy and it wasn't.

In this novel, Mark Z. Danieleweski tells a haunting tell of love, loss, and darkness. This story alternates between the narrative of Johnny truant, and a text called the Navidson Record, a book that analyzes a film that does not exist, even in the world of the novel. The book contains numerous footnotes, some of which reference works that do not exist. Danielewski uses typography to convey different emotions throughout the text. Reading this book is more than just a passive activity, it is an experience. Probably one of the best things about this book is that it means different things for different people. Where one person sees a horror story, another will see a satire, or a love story. House of Leaves is a must read for anyone who wants to be immersed in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"But not for me","review":"Bought this after a friend on Facebook commented that this was one of the scariest books ever.

It is not a book for people who want a page turning thriller (although it will keep you turning the pages if you let it hook you). It is not easily explicable, but \\"a horror story about literary criticism\\" is a good start. That premise is inherently Lovecraftian. That said, it's not the simplistic kind of metatextual horror where it's all about \\"what if what's inside this book kills you because it's actually real?\\" It's about the horror of realizing that it doesn't matter if a text is true or not, it's about what the text does to you, and how the ideas it contains change you.Basically, go into it with an open mind or it won't be scary - but once your mind is open, it's a truly affecting experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Leaves is an ultra-promising debut","review":"In all the crazy fuss surrounding this novel--much of which it deserves--something has been lost: a sense of history. This book fits comfortably into a past defined by the work of Pynchon, Alasdair Gray, Nabokov, and others. Very few of the devices used by the author are unique, although he does use them well, for the most part. His use of footnotes, however, is often out of control, to the point that he begins to annihilate his own central narrative--a narrative that, despite the horror aspects, is really a love story. This is the strength of the novel: the central relationship between the photographer and his wife.I'm a writer and, to be honest, I could not tell whether my irritations with the narrative were because I wished I had actually written the book or because the book does have some flaws. Regardless, this is great stuff and I can't wait to read his next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I found this book bother over- and underrated. I liked it an awful lot--it offered some genuine chills, and the academic approach to the main story was both refreshing and rewarding. On the other hand, there were times when I found myself wondering why I couldn't just read the story myself or watch the movie. Still, I think this approach worked very well, and all the extras gave me quite a bit of bang for my buck.

It's similar to Joyce's 'Finnegan's Wake'--self-indulgent, cryptic scrawls and references lacking in true poetry but designed to keep an otherwise unemployable group of English professors, 'literary theorists' and critics working. It is meticulously designed, researched and written, lacking in soul and substance.If you enjoy puzzles and frequently pat yourself on the back for your depth of classical or literary knowledge, you'll enjoy this book.

To those of you who love to be challenged in reading, this book is a joy.

What got me was the endless footnotes referring back to made-up sources, and the constant breaking into the story so an \\"expert\\" can explain what this character or that character meant by folding their arms at a certain time or refusing to be hugged. Come on. I enjoyed the parts of this book that were actual STORY. I liked hearing about the house and the expeditions. But I eventually had to skip everything else, and that includes the pointless outside narration by the tattoo artist.

It is tremedously creepy and could possibly make the unprepared quite afraid of the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmares","review":"I used to have nightmares about my grandparents' house having a trapdoor into a second part of their house that you couldn't see from the outside but was extremely huge. This book takes that nightmare and expands it 10-fold to disproportionate measure. The style is slightly patchwork-y but if you like texture and dimension, the typography will be welcome eye-candy, the psychology will be enjoyable mind-torture, and the secret codes and \\"possibilities\\" left unsaid will drive you to sit back down and read it all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cult status and great literature","review":"there is a difference between a cult novel and great literature. A great cult novel is JG Ballard's Crash, a great piece of Literature is James Joyce's Ulysses. Where is this book? definately on the cult side, but leaning towrds the literature side. The most elusive piece of beauty about this book is the layout, like a severe bout with a pyschotropic drug, it pulls you in, where there is suspense, there are few words and lots of withe space, causing you to read and turn the pages faster. And unlike any stephen king book, it scared me. made even Lovecraft seem like the muppets. Best book I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Cards","review":"What is all the hype about? This \\"first novel\\" is a derivative, contrived muddle that tries frantically to appear clever and original by tediously exploiting every known postmodern ruse but which at nearly every turn consistently fails to deliver, leaving the reader with the same queasy and unsatisfied feeling as if indulging in too much cheap junk food. The unoriginality and ponderousness encountered in this book are on the same scale as the rooms and passageways in the house it describes. I was bored to tears by the obviousness and clumsy moral earnestness of it all. The final subtext of this book--if you follow all the footnotes--is desperation, the result of someone trying like hell to pull the wool over your eyes for fear of revealing the only truly grim realization of this horror story: it isn't written very well. The publication hype is as shallow and faddish as the book. Save yourself 20 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDS A NEGATIVE AMOUNT ON THE STARS","review":"I like all kinds of books.

After trying to wade through this mess I finally decided that I don't care what happens to these people. They can stay in there huge dark pit and no one would ever miss them, or care. The headaches I got trying to figure out this massive mistake for a novel just wasn't worth it. What's with all the swirls and backward paragraphs and even two seperate stories on one page? I tried to like this. I really did. I kept telling myself, \\" It will all come together, it will all be worth it with a fantastic story, these people will really begin to matter to me...\\".

This \\"book\\" is full of appendixes, footnotes, and \\"anyalitical critiques\\" from \\"outside experts\\" commenting on what is suposed to be the main story. If there was a main story here, it went way passed me. I purchased this book for a new experience in horror fiction. The only thing horrific about it was the $20.00 I wasted on buying it. If you feel you need to read this book because of how interesting the reviewers make it sound, take my advise, check it out from your local library. Makes for an easy return."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book to hold my attention in a long time","review":"This book lives up to the hype here on amazon and elsewhere in the literary world.

For the first hundred pages, the story was truly frightening and interesting, but the shifts between Zampano's and Truant's accounts, and the endless footnotes, were way too much for me. The story of the house probably would have been much better if written in a more traditional manner, as would the story of both Truant and Zampano if written on their own.I think this book is a good case of an author trying too hard, and would like to see the author try again. Next time the attempt should be a little less \\"trendy\\" and should just try to relate a strong, interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I loved this book! It is original and very spooky! This is not your 'ordinary' spooky/horror book. With Danielewski's book, the reader must 'think' (what a concept!) about the characters and plot and twists and turns. A very worthwhile read! I recommend this book to everyone I know - whether he/she likes 'horror' or not. If you like the unordinary and to be challenged when reading a book - this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decade later and still re-readable","review":"I first got ahold of this book it was over a decade ago. It gripped me then, and it still grips me today. Even in this ADD internet age when I find most of my reading time devoted to \\"whatever's new on Cracked.com\\", when I read most books once and then never again, I still find myself going back to House of Leaves over and over, at least once a year. And it's always a little different each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This book will take you on an amazing adventure that only the very brave and late-nite readers can stay up long enough to finish it. Mark Z. Danielewski created this interesting, action-filled story with so many twists and turns that you will be too confused to speak! This topsy-turvey story is great for anyone who likes mystery, history and the completely weird and strange. And durring this ordeal you must ONLY listen to Poe- she will continue to explain things that you might miss in the story, not to menton rock your world! so overall- READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately, just a first novel","review":"All young writers should have good editors. The book is, like most first novels, fresh and interesting, but ultimately self-indulgent; replete with author intrusion, self-congratulatory cleverness, and a whole lotta time wasting. Character development is virtually nonexistent and the plot doesn't so much advance as trail off into some unexplored corner of the house of title fame.People posting reviews who compare this book to Nabokov or Borges really should go back and re-read some actual Nabokov or Borges, either of whom can say more in a page than this writer can say in a hundred.It's a nice try. It has some decent ideas. Postmodernists will probably like it, 'cause it's all so avant garde doncha know. But it really isn't a novel so much as somebody's writing journal accepted for publication. Read _Pale Fire_ or one of JL's parables, and save yourself a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crock Of Leaves","review":"A rather interesting little story has been buried under enough post-modern trickery to ensure high-school study halls will be abuzz for years. Danielewski goes out of his way to be very very very very very innovative and daring, and ultimately just gets rather tiresome and dull.This has all been done before, and done better, by writers from Stephen King to Alasdair Gray to Edgar Allan Poe to Shirley Jackson to Jorge Luis Borges. I can't fault Danielewski on ambition, just on execution.Ultimately, some cool things, but not enough to save a book that sinks under its own postmodern post-literary weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Structure, Built of Leaves","review":"For those of you who've pored over White Wolf's 'Borderlands' anthologies, finished every last Tanith Lee, Clive Barker et. al. book you can get your hands on; for those of you who've heard whispers and, maybe, had a little taste of the new trend in horror, 'imaginiative fiction ...' for everyone who seeks, afraid of what they might find but aware the entire time of the futility of the search ... for those hungry, desperate, and just plain looking for a new good scare ... House of Leaves. Danielewski has prepared for us a vast and crippling epic of horror, more intelligent and incredibly more enjoyable than anything else published to date. This work is simply incredible, and I highly expect to hear much of Danielewski in the coming months and years. Thank you, Mr. Danielewski, for giving us House of Leaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Debut","review":"A riddle wrapped in an enigma surrounded by a puzzle. \\"House of Leaves\\" is creepy fun. Take your time and enjoy this one (you may have to), but it's time well-invested. I first saw bits and pieces of this book on the net, and couldn't wait for a fully bound volume. Danielewski fills pages with random notes, puzzles, backwards and upside-down print, poems, letters, photos and collages that all add up to a story about a man driven insane by the discovery of a monograph about a non-existant documentary, which just might have awakened an ambigously evil force. The characters are very real, the puzzles and notes fun to decipher and the obscure references fly faster than an episode of MST3K. It was refreshing to find that an experimental novel could be so much fun. I can't wait for Mr. Danielewski's next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Novel","review":"The people who gave this novel only one star make me laugh. They are describing the exact reason why this book should be read and why I enjoyed it. Was it work? Well, yes but it was also a lot of fun. Read this novel to be challenged, frightened, intrigued, and entertained. This is a truly amazing and unique piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different","review":"I enjoyed this book and the unusual ways that the story was told. The footnotes told a very interesting story. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read something \\"different\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this man an editor.","review":"When I took creative writing in the 8th grade, my teacher passed out a study on writers who used Macintoshes vs. writers who used PCs. The verdict: writers who used Macs spent too much time on formatting the appearance in a creative way and less upon the writing itself. This directly applies to the fifty pages of spiraling text. If you put the text in a single paragraph... is it really that interesting? If Danielewski had skipped the hundred pages of footnotes that are useless (why read fictional footnotes? 3 pages of fictional names?) and cut Johnny Truant (can anyone argue that this character is believable? he was not charming enough to follow through with his sexual escapades, even his name is ridiculous); the story is readable. Worthwhile though? There are 15 haunted house stories that surpass this."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time, paper, space","review":"I tried to find something positive to say about this novel and can only come up with: \\"The cover's nice!\\" I guess the idea is clever enough, but the gimmicky nature of the text is just overbearing. A friend of mine took one look at the blurbs on the back cover, including one from \\"writer\\" Bret Easton Ellis, and told me not to bother. I should have heeded his advice. I found myself ripping through the pretentious bits, the footnotes (my God, the footnotes!), and even the secondary story about the guy who finds the manuscript and is caught up in the horror of it all, to find out what happens with the house itself. Definitely not worth the time and energy. If you like tricky, read Eco, read Borges, read Pavich... but don't live to regret reading this mishmash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Star is Actually a Little High","review":"Wish I had read the customer reviews before I bought the book; the story of a man's psychological reaction (a story in itself) to an analysis of various other analyses of a non-existent home video. So filled with analyses of psychological reactions, philosophy, mythology and filmmaking, along with unnecessary scientific data and annoying literary visual effects that it is difficult to hold the thread of the main story. Since the author doesn't believe in using a small word where a large one will do, unless you have a greater than average vocabulary or enjoy reading with a dictionary handy, I wouldn't recommend it. If you do attempt it, I would suggest reading the main story (if you can find it) to the end, then returning to read the footnoted story. Not for straight horror buffs, but not bad for big fans of Umberto Eco."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"The concept of House of Leaves is an interesting one, but the execution is extraordinarily poor. The writing is horrible, the characters are paper-thin, and some of the paraliterary conceits (or whatever they are) are so sophomoric I was actually embarrassed for the writer. Very much like the house in the novel, this book is a huge, sprawling mess with exactly nothing at its center. Do not waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this novel is uncanny","review":"I just finished reading this twisting, mazelike novel and have say, I'm impressed.. not only with the overall multiple-take perspective of the story, but also with the innovative layout, which does an excellent job of matching the story's pace. (you'll have to read it to understand) .. I also enjoyed the way it prompted interaction.. near the end of the novel, I started joining in the fun and adding my own layer of narration, adding fictional footnotes to Johnny's and the editors as well as an additional chapter at the end... sounds odd? well, it is. It asks big questions in stunningly vague ways.the best way to describe the book is, well, uncanny. :pI give it 4.5 outta 5 stars on my \\"must read\\" Scale.. well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually 1/2 star","review":"Don't waste your time trying to decipher this supposed novel.

It reads like a textbook, which I think it's supposed to (great idea, really great). No character development, story, plot, climax, or anything remotely interesting. I would rather be a gerbal on Fire Island during an Elton John concert than read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"When an author doesn't understand the difference between \\"should've\\" and \\"should of\\", \\"could've\\" and \\"could of\\", and \\"would've\\" and \\"would of\\"... Well, that's just retarded. I first thought he was doing it with only the character of Johnny Truant, which would've been bad enough, but then it showed up in the writings of the old man, which was unacceptable to me. This book had some great ideas and I was mildly enjoying it, but then it started to insult my intelligence, and I had to cast it aside... Be gone with you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome","review":"This book really cracked me up. You really have to have the right sense of humor to enjoy House of Leaves, one of the most amazing literary practical jokes ever written. It is touted as a horrifying tale of terror and mystery, but there within lies the joke. Danielewski will have you decoding letters, reading footnotes 3 pages long, and staring at evidence within multiple appendecies. If you make it through to the end, you are in for a treat! Turns out this book is a comedy, NOT a horror story, so horror lovers, you may want to skip this one. Danielewski has you hunting for a terror that quite certainly does not exist within these pages. You will, however, find entertainment in the fact that you have just read a novel about a book put together by a crazed tattoo artist about notes written down by a blind guy on a documentary that may or may not actually exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"For 14 year-olds going through their \\"rebellion\\" phase.","review":"This book is convoluted for the sake of being convoluted and allows pseudo eccentrics to continue bolstering their own nihilism.Oh my goodness, I had to turn a page upside down to read it... So scary. Give me a break.If you bought your kid a Toyota, and he/she complains that his/her life is ruined because it's not a BMW, they will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here to see.","review":"Utterly predictable and full of cliches. If you are scared when the inevitable cat jumps out in to the screen in the movie theatre, then you will love this book. Similarly, in the movies one always wonders why the victim just doesn't get out, one must wonder that here too. What passes for good literature these days is depressing. While it is true that this book is wildly popular, so is meth, rap, and scientology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Predictable and banal. Jumps on a dull, tired bandwagon for geeks. Don't bother, just head straight to Edgar Allen Poe - he wrote this story a century or so ago and a hundred times better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent example of form over function.","review":"It's a shame the house on Ash Lane wasn't in New York, as it could have been leased for millions.Seriously, this is some of the most awful tripe I've ever had the misfortune of reading. The multi-level narrative, when done well, is a literary device meant to keep a reader's interest; however, in this case it only prolongs the banality of the novel. I mean, how many times are you going to be fooled with Truant's hallucinations? After reading \\"But none of this ever happened\\" for the nth time, all I could think of was what if it never happened that I plunked down 20 bones for this trash.And then the footnotes! Just one headache after another contributing little or nothing to the story.Lord preserve us from erudite pseudo-authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and eerie!","review":"This book can bamboozle you and I'm not sure exactly how they got the printers to do some of the intriguing page layouts! However, I don't think it's the story that you should focus on too much, especially if you're looking for a typical beginning middle and end. It's the eeriness of it that should be experienced. This is a real original classic for those willing to open their mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel, but something's missing","review":"This book was very captivating. Don't be fooled by its length, however, because there are a lot of extras, such as an index and two appendices. The typographic layout of the book is revolutionary, though it wastes a lot of paper. I must say that this book really exercised my mind. I felt intrigued throughout the novel, but at the end I was disappointed there wasn't a more objective answer to the Navidson's house of the paranormal. I would, however, recommend this novel to anyone looking for something fresh and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Horror Story","review":"IMO the best horror books are those that don't directly expose the creature or fright. This is one of those books. It leaves you on edge, however, wondering what is going on and what is going to happen next. Even when things are calm, you wait for the next event.As others have said, it is also a story inside a story. You could probably read the main story and enjoy it, however, if you want to stretch your imagination and test your reading skills, go ahead and read all of it, including the voluminous footnotes that comprise the \\"outer\\" story.The author does an excellent job of painting the characters- I can see Johnny Truant and even feel his turmoil. The term \\"horror\\" book can be applied to books that feature supernatural or unexplained beings or it can apply to regular (well, almost) human beings who live or subject others to a state of horror. This book accomplishes both.The book is a challenge, but a fun one, and one thatshouldn't be read just once. There are too many nuances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeatable Book","review":"I read House of Leaves over a period of 4 months and I have never been the same. It took me an additional three months after reading the book to fully process the incredible, unconventional, and sometimes disturbing aspects of this book. Quite honestly, this book has made every other book I have read after it seem dull. I have spent the last 4 months trying to find another \\"House Of Leaves\\" and the closest I came was \\"The Raw Shark Texts\\". This novel has changed me in ways I cannot comprehend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange book","review":"House of LeavesThis is an unusual book. The story is a thriller or a horror, it depends. The most important characteristic of this book is \\"how it is written...\\" you can find: blank pages, pages with only a word, upside down pages, coloured words, landscape oriented pages, mirrored pages(!) and so on, very very unusual and amusing way to write a book. I love it, it is so strange.....and mysterious. You will enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential, but stumbles and never recovers","review":"The writing itself is beautiful and Danielewski certainly has a great measure of talent. However, underneath the footnotes, pages containing only one phrase, secret codes, etc. is an old story that is not being told in a new way, it is just being shuffled, reorganized, and splattered across the pages. This book could have been excellent-had Danielewski actually written something original. Consequently, it comes across as pretentious, and the characters and the novel itself ultimately are like the hallway and the house- devoid of anything, really. Read it if you have too much time on your hands, too little imagination, and love cheap 'psychological' chills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clever for its own good","review":"As a dedicated fan of the ghost story in its many incarnations, I expected great things from this book. Perhaps that was my mistake, expecting a \\"story.\\" Instead, I found that the many annoted footnotes just detracted from the overall effect. This is a brilliant concept and the extreme attention to detail lends some credibility to the genre of overlapping reality and fiction. But the constant distraction of looking here and there at footnotes, half of which are for effect instead of information, made it seem like a thesis, not a novel. And as to the story itself, there's not much there. A great approach theoretically, with potential, but its basically a concept piece and not too engaging a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully postmodern","review":"The book's premise is intriguing and I enjoyed it at first. However, it's pretty hard to sustain interest when you're writing a book about a book about a fictional documentary about a house. Too much attention is given, in my opinion, to the layers of text and too little to the plot. As fascinating as the idea of the house is, you get very little 'pay off' through plot development. The text itself--the arrangement of words on the page--becomes the entertainment rather than the text's content. Large sections of this book are parodies of academic writing, but for anyone who dropped out of graduate school these parts may seem far too close to the real stuff to be entertaining. It's certainly an ambitious book, but I don't think that it is--or is even really meant to be--an enjoyable read in the way a good novel usually is. Danielewski apparently concentrated his efforts on playing on tedious postmodern ideas about texts and not on actually producing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"This book has gotten a lot of good reviews in the media (Newsweek, NYTimes Book Review, etc...)but it is a colossal waste of time to read it. The writing is dull and puerile (Johnny Truant?) , the plot is stolen almost directly from the \\"Twilight Zone\\" and you will be bored stupid from the infinite footnotes. I think its hype in the media is just a case of a literary emperor with no clothes on, there is nothing of substance in this book; if someone asks you to read it, say no, put it down and walk away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Held my interest and then became ridiculous.","review":"Wow.

The writing style is an art form in and of itself!At first, the footnotes are a bit disruptive. However, very quickly the reader learns that a big part of this work ARE the footnotes!Definately NOT a \\"fluffy\\" read!

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique find","review":"This is a great book. One of the best things about this book is that you won't find others like it. The style is eclectic and draws you in from the beginning. Not only that you will learn a lot about an assortment of subjects (i.e. mazes, echos,...) Plus the description of the \\"film\\" in the book is very interesting and will leave you wanting to know more.It is a good book for those that don't mind non-sequitors and unconventional storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unworthy -","review":"and I should run back to Stephen King? Oh really? I am of the number that finds Crock of Leaves elitist, irrelevant and so unoriginal it's gut crunchingly funny. The patronising readers of this book, who feel that us ordinary mortals are not worthy of \\"The House\\", should consider it time they left their High School geekiness behind and go \\"vivify\\" themselves.

I like scary books.\\" Well, I don't see where she got the idea that it was so scary.The first 50 pages of this book are lifeless. I was completely bored. Then there was a five page thing describing an echo. It was like I was reading an extremely boring textbook for school.There were a few ok parts, and some of the Johnny Traunt stuff was kind of funny. I gave it 2 stars because of the use of different fonts and how they placed the words on the page for a cool effect.Oh, and whoever said you need a mirror to read some of the pages, they were just too dumb to realize that the \\"mirror-image\\" writing was actually just the same thing written on the page before, as in it had gone through the page, or whatever.Don't waste your time. Read Stephen King instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept But Not Worth The CONSIDERABLE Effort It takes To Get Inside This Novel","review":"I tried to read this novel from cover to cover, gave up after three hours and skipped around to what I hope were the good parts in the remainder of the book. The plot about the exploration of an apparently evil house that is larger on the inside than on the outside sounds interesting, but the disgusting details inside the plot itself, the mean and worthless characters, and the sheer weight of this deranged, non-linear, hodge-podge book combine to require more effort than I was willing to invest for the pay-off this work promised. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project are inaccurate and I feel are an effort to cash in by linking to what is a much better movie than this is a book. Might've worked more if it had been presented less radically instead of in a format of notes, lists, diary entries, narratives, and scraps of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"It wasn't scary.

I picked it up because of the raves - \\"scariest book I've ever read\\", etc - and can only conclude these ravers haven't read very many books at all. After reading it, I come back and look at the 5 star reviews here and note that even they caveat that they don't really understand the book and are giving the stars based on things like \\"ambition\\" (ie \\"A for effort\\"?)A footnote on p149 pretty much sums up what I think of the book: \\"Other times I am sure it's just one big f***ing train wreck.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, what the F?","review":"How many people out there can get into this book? 3.

If you want that, I recommend INFINITE JEST instead. Sections of inspired prose, but too much pastiche of academic media studies. Deliberately hard to puzzle out: There is some erudition, but more often the difficulty is simply the layout (mirror writing, e.g.). Frequently more attention is paid to the layout than the prose. I read SF/F/H. Stripped of the gimmickry nothing is new. Hodgson's HOUSE ON THE BORDERLAND and Lovecraft. BLAIR WITCH, POLTERGEIST, and HELLRAISER. I read the whole thing to find what happens, but found it not worth the effort. Ending is anticlimactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Important Writer of the 21st Century is Here.","review":"You'll be hearing a lot of hype about this book and its author in the coming months. And believe me, it's all true, and more. Danielewski is a Pynchon for the 00's, if not a Laurence Sterne for our times. The book is as brilliant as you may think, and goes light-years beyond anything else being written these days. As a first novel, it's nothing short of spectacular. If MZD writes nothing else for the rest of his life, his reputation is secured with this opus. Brilliant, unsettling, macabre, the book is fully worthy of all the accolades you will no doubt soon be hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This is truly one of the worst books I ever read. It was boring, pretentious in its obsession with annoying, petty, visual wordplay (which the author seemed to prefer over \\"plot\\") and not especially well written. If I could have located the receipt, which mysteriously disappeared (perhaps the only truly \\"mysterious\\" thing associated with this \\"novel\\" other than the fact that it has been highly touted), I would have returned it for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Space For Rent","review":"You know when you read a book and say, \\"hey, this would be an awesome movie,\\" even though you have no idea how it would translate? House of Leaves redefines that inclination, proving that some stories just need to be left on the page where the author can drag you, kicking and screaming, through the depths and annals of his imagination, at his own brutally slow or breakneck pace. HOL is a four-course literary meal served by Hitchcock, David Foster Wallace, and the Blair Witch. One part academic study, one part fast-and-loose first person narrative, and one part horror story, House of Leaves is far and away the most complex and terrifying book I've ever loved. (for more reviews like this, visit http://www.voidmagazine.com/twocentreview.html)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"Yes, the book is long, and parts of it can get boring. But if you read it a little at a time you will really start to appreciate the originality of it. The difference between this book and many other horror stories, is that you read this for the experience and not the story alone. Allow yourself to believe that \\"The Editors\\" and Johnny Truant, the man who claims to have written the book, exist and the footnotes will have more meaning. Read the apendices, the poems, and the letters. I think that if you take this book at face value- a basic story of a maze inside a house- it will not affect you in the same way as if you take in every piece of the story (storIES, I guess) and make it real for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Leaves","review":"Very enthralling.... make sure to have nothing important that has to be done for several days when you read this book....

And for someone who has written quite a few papers... well, I laughed out loud at some of Zampano's conventions (especially the footnotes - how many of us have made up a few to identify some imaginary research of our own??).

Sloppily plotted, poorly edited, way too long and just not particularly innovative compared to all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest waste of seventeen bucks!","review":"Quite possibly one of the most annoying books ever published, House of Leaves would have Gutenberg suffocating on dirt in his grave. Yes, I do understand that this is supposed to be art, but it seems to me to be nothing more than a sophmoric attempt at publishing something 'different'. Nevermind that the plot, as the esteemed NY Times Reviewer, Mr. Robert Kelly, noted was as silly as the Blair Witch Project, but I think even that would have appeased me were the book not as annoying to read as a latin manuscript read with a flashlight in a car with no suspension traveling down a bumpy road. I think this book would be a perfect hiding place for someone confined to a mind devoid of sense, structure, and stability - and more people have those things than one might think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Things About House of Leaves","review":"1.

Not at all. I understand why the typesetting was messed with, but I don't think it added much to the book, other than increasing my annoyance. I think better written passages would have conveyed much more. Turning a book upside down and sideways does not equate to good literature. The typesetting and footnotes are used here to spice up a fairly dull story. It's not awful awful awful, but I've read better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure if it's genius or pretentious","review":"I read this on the advice of a friend, and am glad that I bought it, if only because the layout is so weird.

I rushed through it the first time and have regretted it. Half of the fun in the book comes from tracking down references and quotes.

An excellent first book that is well worth the extra effort that it demands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First Choice","review":"This is perhaps the best recording of THE CREATION in the catalogue. Hengelbrock's conducting of a fine period-instrument orchestra is the most exciting since Bernstein's '60s recording; nothing is dainty or underplayed. The burst of light is truly thrilling, and all the descriptive passages are played for all they're worth (listen to the great bronx cheer from the brass at \\"Den boden druckt der thiere last\\"). The chorus is very good, if not quite in the class of Gardiner's Monteverdi Choir; but whereas Gardiner's recording had some casting weaknesses, here all the youngish soloists do good work, particularly the Uriel, Steve Davislim. The sound is mostly excellent, though once or twice the engineers seem to have trouble coping with choral climaxes (no distortion, though).For a recording of THE CREATION that really conveys how new and exciting this work must have seemed in 1799, and a recording with no serious weaknesses, I can't think of any recording that is preferable to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned about ethanol in gas","review":"This was my second gas trimmer purchased to replace the electric trimmer that wore out. In both cases they worked for the first year and quit. I trashed them both - an expensive experiment. I have replaced the gas model with a Ryobi electric \\"Power head\\". This accepts standard tools and I have used the head with string trimmer, pruning saw, hedge trimmer and sidewalk edger. The 12 amp head has plenty of power for these applications. If you can stand pulling the cord arround, this is an excellect choice.

Great service from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troy Built Product and Customer Service","review":"I bought a Troy Built weed eater last summer. It is total junk. You spend more time fixing the line than actual weed eating. I would go 15 yards and the line would be gone and you'd have to take the head off and redo the line. The cap is very hard to remove. Plan on weed eating for 5 minutes and 20 minutes getting the head off and getting the line redone. Customer service is as bad as it gets. Mine had an electric starter to use when you didn't want to pull the cord. It died the 1st summer. I will never buy any Troy Built products again. I am going to give mine away and get a Stihl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest piece of garbage ever","review":"After about 4 hours of use, one of the clutch dogs broke in half, (bad casting), so I called Troy-built and was told they would not send a new clutch, and I had to take the trimmer to an authorized repair shop which was Eagle River Small Engine Repair in Eagle River, Alaska. Eagle River is about 200 miles from where I live. I took the trimmer to the repair shop, and the owner, John, told me he did not work on trimmers and refused to even look at it. I called the Troy-Bilt customer service line again, and Al, the idiot I spoke to told me I needed to make an appointment with a shop in Wasilla, AK that is not an authorized repair shop.I would recommend buying any other brand than Troy-Bilt, because they do not honor their warranty.

This book features details on culture and history, recent events (summarizing the H modules), foreign relations, cities and ruins, races and monsters, dungeons, famous personages, 8 outlined adventures, and more!

I wanted good things for them and I kept rooting for a happily ever after finish even though it wouldn't have been a truthful telling of the story. Fortunately the author stayed truthful and the characters were allowed to live out their destinies.

I recommend this book, highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph of the human spirit!","review":"If you loved Gracelin O'Malley, then Leaving Ireland is a must-read! Fleeing an Ireland full of pain and suffering, tragedy and broken dreams, Grace journeys across the Atlantic to build a new life in America. The plot is action-packed from the start and, in my opinion, much more uplifting overall than the first book. Familiar faces return and new friends and nemesis are made along the way as Grace continues her struggle for survival and her fight for a better life in a new world. Through it all, Grace perseveres with courage, dignity, unwavering faith, an indomitable spirit, and a heart of gold (thank you Ann Moore for creating such an inspirational character!). Although Leaving Ireland is a wonderful novel in itself, I recommend reading Gracelin O'Malley first. You'll find your enjoyment of the story even greater having met the characters before. Grace seems to be on the road to happiness and I eagerly await the third installment of her story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving Ireland","review":"Ms. Moore's portrayal of the passage from London to New York was real. One could feel the torture and pain of the characters portrayed. I wanted to reach out and help poor Liam as he watched his mother and sister die to the fever. But he was oh so lucky to have found the brave soul of Ms. O'Malley who had herself experienced the lost of the one man she truly loved.Upon their entry to America, though they were afforded the basic needs of life such as food and clothing, they still lack the higher needs afforded to those who did not have the stigma \\"Irish need not apply\\".I found myself a part of these characters wanting so much more for them, for it seems those who have suffered so do deserve so much more. I hope Ms. Moore creates a third book which will reunite her with her son, and with the man man who truly loves her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great second book in series","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as the first Gracelin O'Malley.

It features two different sessions, one with Eddie Taylor on guitar, the other featuring Jimmy Dawkins and Pinetop Perkins. Every track smokes, most notably the instrumental \\"Sad Dreams\\", with its wonderful interplay between Bells harmonica and Dawkins guitar. There are three other instrumentals and they all sizzle with the band clicking perfectly. The versions of blues classics \\"I'm Ready\\" and \\"Last Night\\" are very fine as well, and most of the other songs are Bell originals that are played terrifically.If you are new to Carey Bell, this is a fine place to start your collection.

Solos are not that inspiring, it's just a regular night by three top notch players. There's not magic in this record. I can't never reach the end of the compact... every time I fall asleep! (just a joke) And I have to say that I completly disagree with the guy who talked about Montgomery in his review saying that Martino is better in this recording.

Sorry Pat, hope your next one will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is King.","review":"What a hyped cd this is. The genre of guitar, organ, drum trios is filled with dozens of better cds than this. My particular beef is Pat Martino's habit of playing a riff line again and again in the middle of every solo until he's totally destroyed any kind of continuity with what his solo started out to be. What happens..does he run out of ideas?....does he think this is a crowd pleaser?...is he trying to wake up Billy Hart (I don't think so!)This is the slow triumph of the mediocre over the real thing.

I have stripped it down to see if it was a carburettor problem but it is a very simple carb that had no obvious problems. It is not worth taking this to a repair shop.

If you follow the manual you won't be able to start this puppy. The manual describes a two position switch on the engine when actually it is a three position swith.

Manual says to push primer bulb 10 times!!! On taking it to service center tech pushed bulb twice (10 times will definitely flood engine) and then started and manually moved lever to third (run) position. Manual says lever moves atomatically to run position not so. Tech also says that this is actually a Ryobi that Troy-bilt has put their name on and that it is mass marketed for internet and that it isn't a very good machine.

When the delivery company called to arrange a time to drop it off, I said I already told Amazon that I would refuse delivery so send it back.

If below 10, like childish games get a Game cube. But if you are between 10 to 20 yrs old, like all types of games, and want to play DVDs on your console, get a PS2. Belive me you wont be sorry.

It's a shame that people flock to the latest tome, and checkout uncredentialed books for direction in diabetes or any other matter. We can truely trust doctors, but we don't need the latest self-help book that's patched with a Type II Diabetes hook to do that either. Stop buying these overly-hyped books and start seeking your medical doctor. I know all the rock star \\"medical authors\\" are the stars of the health movements of our day and highly recommend these, but you can have shelves loaded with this stuff and it will do NOTHING for you. A much better option is \\"Diabetes and You: A Comprehensive, Holistic Approach\\". You will realize that due to the book's aggresive medical standards, you actually need a brain to read through it successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis (Chicago)","review":"This book scared me to death. Described how I had to measure my blood sugar with a kit. I was under the assumption that Type 2 diabetes could be controlled with pills. Other books confirmed this, and it is working for me. I also didn't appreciate, the arrogant, over-the-top writing style of the author. The American Diabetes Association Complete Guide to Diabetes is much better written and more informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the newly diagnosed","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon shortly after I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. I found it well worth the price, and an excellent introduction to the many different treatments and diets. I especially liked the first sections for the newly diagnosed, an overview of the disease and the lifestyle situations that exacerbate it. After that we are ready for the more detailed examination of medications and treatments that follow. I recommend it highly as a 'first book' on diabetes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I am recently diagnosed with Type 2 and this was the 10th book I read on the subject...and the only one that was depressing in tone. The author herself admits in her forward that she has issues with food and it shows - she talks a lot about never eating her favorite things again, which is not the case as long as it's done in moderation. I was handling things well until I read this book, then hit a downward spiral for 3 weeks afterward. The info in this book is presented in other books like Diabetes for Dummies and Everything You Need to Know About Type 2 Diabetes without the bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read on Diabetes Type II","review":"When I was diagnosed with Diabetes Type II as an adult, it really threw me for a loop. I found this book about 6 months into the first year, and I wish that I'd found it sooner. Written by a fellow diabetic, not a doctor from \\"on high,\\" it speaks in a language that the layperson can understand, and demystifies the condition in plain language based on scientific research. In my opinion, this is the best book on the topic available at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to put everything in a context","review":"I think unlike a lot of the reviewers of this book, I came across the book after already attending a number of diabetes education classes. I was simply thumbing through books providing information on type 2 diabetes and when I read a few random pages of this book I was hooked. The book is an enjoyable read, practical, informed and relevant. I had great diabetes education classes, however, this book allowed me to put all of the great information I learned in those classes in context. Becker's descriptions and explanations, from the various lab tests, to the role of exercise and diet, was informative, balanced and most of all pragmatic. I recommend this book to anyone who has been recently diagnosed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I haven't read through the book completely, but I really like how she writes - it's just like she is talking with you one on one. I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and I have had enough of people talking over my head or acting like they have to sloowww down to explain things to me. I'm not in the medical field, I don't know the lingo, and I just want to know what I have to do to get this diabetes thing under control!

It does not pull any punches. Diabetes is a serious enemy and those of us who even have the potential to be over-taken by it are in a life-long battle. That is why this book is our friend. It gives us the tools for us to be the winners. Information is power and The First Year is full of the practical information necessary for taking charge of our own health."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Diabetics Need to Know","review":"This is the best book for information I have found for people who are just starting on the journey with diabetes. It doesn't sugar-coat the truth, but explains in detail what you have to do to find the right path for managing your disease. It should be the first thing a doctor hands you when you are diagnosed, and it is from someone in the same boat, who is dealing with the disease. Gretchen Becker has been there herself and made the changes she needed to make to take control of the disease. Because you should control diabetes and not let it control you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best resource available!","review":"I don't understand why doctors don't recommend this book to their patients. My mom was diagnosed with Type II diabetes last year. Since mom took care of my dad (who was diabetic for 25 years) she felt confident that she would be able to control her disease without too much trouble.Wrong! Within six months mom confided to me that she could understand why dad had such hopelessness concerning diabetes. So much misinformation and myths abound, and the diabetic diet is more confusing than it needs to be.So I bought this for mom and she loves it. In the last month (since reading this book) she is feeling positive again and feels much more in control of her own life and health. She has information to take to the doctors with her and understands the different treatments, etc.Since I am a candidate myself, I'm buying a second copy to learn what I can about preventing diabetes and how to be more supportive of mom.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Year Type 2 Diabetes: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed","review":"If you have been recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, this book is the only one you need to read.

I was diagnosed in May, 2012 and bought this book at the suggestion of a co-worker. It reads like hieroglyphics. The author jumps from one subject to another, no form, no reason, and I find she doesn't CLEARLY state her thought, using too many analogies. That may be acceptable in story telling, but not for this.I was expecting a clear, concise \\"how-to\\" manual - this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"This book is so lame, I cannot believe it got such good reviews. I've learned very little from it and I find the author uses a condescending tone. I am recently diagnosed, but not ignorant. Other times, she gets so complex, that I find myself skipping those parts. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you know absolutely nothing about this disease. By the way, I do not profess to know everything, because I don't by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Year Type 2 Diabetes","review":"Since I had just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I didn't know anything about diabetes I orderd this book thinking it would help me begin to understand what diabetes was and how I needed to handle having diabetes. This book helped me begin to understand diabetes and helped me begin to prepare to live with diabetes and to control it. Most of all the book taught me that I am in charge of myself and how I handle diabetes. Diabetes can be controlled and with the help of information received from this book and the many other diabetes resources we can live a very productive and normal life.Joan Tubbs"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have Type II Diabetes, this is the book you want.","review":"This book has finally replaced my old, tattered \\"The Diabetic's Book\\" by Biermann and Toohey. Becker has done a remarkable job of covering all the bases regarding Type II. I especially like her moderate, reasoned approach to controversial topics such as diet and the use of herbs. She deftly lists the pros and cons of various diets and medications and objectively serves the reader without jumping on trendy bandwagons. The author's understanding of the biological foundation of diabetes is impressive, but she also explains difficult material in an easy to understand manner. She has a great sense of humor (which never hurts if you have been diagnosed with diabetes), and obviously knows what it \\"feels\\" like to be a diabetic.

This is a very very good flick, that ties everything from the series, 'Firefly' together. It truly is better then the series, and the series was great!This is one of those few Sci-Fi fantasy flicks that is so much fun to watch, that you wish there was no ending. Very Very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"In Joss Whedon's vision of the future, a hybrid superpower known only as 'the alliance' dominates a solar system still ravaged by a war long since done. Settlers occupy the outer rim, facing a literal final frontier as they battle with the hardships of poverty and technological breakdown and raids by cannabalistic humanoids known as 'reevers'. Amid this chaos add a ship full of brigands who harbour two fugatives on the run from the alliance, one of whom may be the most powerful weapon known to man.It should be run of the mill space fantasy but Whedon's strengths as a writer and first time big screen director hone this movie into a rewarding experience for the viewer. The dialogue effortlessly flits from wiscracking humour to social commentary. The action set pieces more than justify a round of applause.Once an axed TV show now Serenity is a 'leaf on the wind.' Watch how it soars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got everything!","review":"Joss Whedon has a wonderful imagination. This film will entertain fans of the Firefly series and those who have never seen the original.Great plot and story telling, acting, photograpy, special fx, sound and music. Can't wait for the next Whedon extravaganza!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity is top notch","review":"I was unfamilar with Firefly. The flim has sold me to see the old TV series. The quality of the Blu-ray is top notch and leaps off the screen. Overall, an excellent pasttime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"Serenity takes the series Firefly to the next level and without the constraints of television censorship a grittier, darker and far more graphically violent universe is the result. Although it's a science fiction genre the movie like the series before, is a bit of a western in space which isn't a bad thing.Serenity expands on much of the premises of the series filling out the foundation of the Reivers and bringing River's character to it's fullest extent. The storyline is excellent, with Mal, his crew and his passengers conducting shady dealings like payroll heists but, true to their pasts idealists as well.The movie is great fun and certainly one of the best science fiction films of the last few years. Now only if Farscape could emulate the same jump from series to the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"After a quite confusing beginning (I had not seen the firefly series), I eventually got into this movie and really enjoyed it. Good sci-fi is hard to come by: the scince has to be plausible, the fiction has to be fascinating and it has to somehow make sense as a possible future or alternative reality. So much science fiction falls short in one fo these three categories, but \\"Serenity\\" succeeds on all levels. The cosmology is credible, the story is gripping and the carachters are very enjoyable. It also leaves the door wide open for a sequel, as it seems obvious that there are more adventures to be had in the world of the Alliance, with its many planets and many moons. If there is a sequel I will be first in the queue to see it.Good gripping sci-fi. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"Plenty of action, acting was excellent as always. But I thought the movie fell short of the series, Disappointing, I ordered this DVD and the sound had better be hq or it will go back. The sound streaming was poorest I have ever encountered. This is not encoded HD. I don't think whoever did the encoding had a clue what they were doing, it's that poor. Loved the series, but didn't think this was a noteworthy end."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 5!","review":"An absolute must for any Firefly fan!

This answers your quetions. Guys with the blue gloves? Check. Reavers? Check. Why in the hell is Summer crazy? Check. And darnit- will Kaeli and the Doc *ever* get together? Check. This film gives us what we, as fans, really want. It also is a really good film. I went to the advance screening with a few people who had never seen the TV series- and they loved it as well!Own This Movie. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS! HIGH QUALITY MOVIE!","review":"I wish I went to see this in the movie theater. I recently got done watching the series it was based off of, Firefly, which I bought because it was phenomenal.

When some much needed downtime came up I bought the series because so many people were saying how good it was. They were right. However, the movie was even better than the short-lived series. Do yourself a favor and invest the 2 hours or so and watch this. If you like sci-fi or just fun movies watch this. In a world of remakes and lack or originality Serenity was a breath of frest air."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie earned a new convert to the series","review":"I rented this movie, because I had heard a bit of buzz about the show, and was intrigued by the preview shown in the theatre. I was in the mood for a bit of good SF. I got more than I ever could hope for.The beginning of this movie brings everyone quickly up to speed with the Firefly universe, so even if you've never seen the series, you won't feel left behind. The action is great, and the characters are wonderful. After now seeing some of the series, I see that the movie pulls many of the characters in directions fans might not have expected, but it also adds depth to these characters. Either taken on its own, or in its place in the Firefly \\"verse\\", this movie is well worth a watch.I set out to watch this movie for an hour or two of entertainment. Instead, it made me a convert to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way To Miranda","review":"I've yet to see a single episode of the 'Firefly' television series but I will soon now that I've seen 'Serenity.' Plain and simple, this is a wonderfully enjoyable sci-fi, action/adventure film. It has everything you could ask for, intelligent plot, strong chemistry between cast members, excellent special effects, great fight sequences with that blithe little dynamo River (Summer Glau) and lots of cannibalistic zombie-like creatures called Reavers to keep you on your toes. Add to the mix the very sexy Inara (Morena Baccarin) and you've got a big hit on your hands.The cast also includes: Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite (my personal favorite), Sean Maher, Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Krumholtz as Mr. Universe.All and all great fun to be had in front of the T.V. set. So get your popcorn and soft drink and you're good to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad they had an ending","review":"I'm glad they made a movie to tie up the loose ends but I still wish they could have continued the series. Definitely watch \\"Firefly\\" first if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome show","review":"Where has this show been all my life? Many people have recommended it to me, but I finally got around to watching it, and this movie really ties up the series quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"Very good movie.

The complex characters and interesting dialog that made the series great are expertly recreated in the movie thanks to Joss Whedon's focus on the acting over special effects. While Mal and River are the main characters in the film the others do get a chance to shine, although I would have liked to see more of the lovely Inara. Jayne did get some classic Firefly lines (\\"gee, wouldn't it be nice to have some grenades right about now!\\", \\"you can never have enough guns\\")that helped liven things up. This movie was worth seeing and hopefully will lead to another movie or maybe a return of the series, although that will be hard to accomplish all things considered..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sci-fi movie ever","review":"I was late on the Firefly/Serenity bandwagon. I had a hundred dollar gift certificate to Best Buy, saw the Firefly DVD, remembered seeing a preview of Serenity, thought it was cool, and bought the DVD. I watched all the shows in a week and was hooked. I had high expectations for the movie and it met them. Fantastic movie that I believe worked on every level. Buy the DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"TO anyone that loves scifi this is a must. We watch because in our minds this is the the life that we want to live.

Highly recomended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth waiting for","review":"I loved Firefly and recently re-watched the entire series on DVD. It reminded me how many questions I had - many of which were answered in the movie. It's fun, full of action, and compliments the tv show beautifully. I only wish there was more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Serenity Please...","review":"Thanks a lot Fox Network for screwing up Firefly on TV. Who knows what might have happened if you showed the episodes in the right order, and gave people a chance to love it? *sigh* At least we got 14 episodes to set the framework for the movie Serenity. If you haven't seen FireFly set, you should watch all 14 episodes before you watch Serenity. - Too bad this series didn't get a fair chance, it might have taken off. The characters are lovable, the dialog is brilliant, and the rest just works. Joss Whedon's vision is unique, and beautiful. Serenity and Firefly are part western, part sci-fi and a must-see if you enjoy either genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie! Check out the Series!","review":"I wish the movie was longer because the story was very good and the characters were very well developed. It was too entertaining to be only a couple of hours. They should bring the series back on T.V. The returning serie's ploit should fill in the story plots between the end of the original series and the movie. Then show the movie, from then on have run the new show on NBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity--the Final Firefly","review":"If you liked the series \\"Firefly,\\" you'll love the movie, \\"Serenity.\\" It is supposed to be the final episode of the short-lived, but immensely popular series.I highly recommend it to all sacience-fiction and western fans. It's a very well done combination of both. Well-acted, well filmed, well-produced--WELL DONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the Firefly Movie- it can do no wrong","review":"The \\"Firefly\\" movie \\"Serentity\\" was made about 2 years after the series ended.

I wanted to be entertained as he has done for me over the last 7 years at least. He exceeded my expections and I was thrilled to be entertained with Serenity's action, off the wall comments, heroism, and suspense. I congratulate all involved with Serenity's production. May this movie bring out a new group of Science Fiction enthusiasts to see it and raise the stakes for more new scripts in movies of Joss's great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sci-fi movies to come out in years!!!","review":"Whether you have seen Firefly or not, I think there is something anyone can enjoy about Serenity. I actually saw this movie before watching the Firefly series. I was so intrigued by the story I wanted to see more and believe me, I was not disappointed. Firefly is now one of my favorite TV shows of all time with Serenity being on of my favorite movies.If you have seen Firefly, there probably won't be any need to tell you how good this movie is. I'm sure you will buy it anyway. But if you are a hardcore fan, there are more extras in this collector's edition that I'm sure you won't want to miss.For those of you who are just looking for a decent science-fiction film, look no further. This movie has great action, humor, and special affects and it truly cares about its characters. Please please please see this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity DVD","review":"Great action and adventure, with a different spin on the greater good creating an unspeakable evil. A star in the vast morass of mud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect follow-up to the Best TV show ever made!","review":"Serenity is a brilliant movie. I know a few people who saw it in the theater who loved it, but I was not fortunate enough to see it before it was gone. I only recently became a fan of the show, and seeing the Firefly series before I saw the movie made it even more fun. I believe it is enjoyable no matter what you know (or don't know) going into it, but getting to spend fourteen episodes learning about nine crew members each with brilliant history and dialog makes seeing them in a great film a wonderful experience. This movie had all the infectious humor of the TV series along with the same great visual effects, solid narrative and brilliant dialog. Do yourself a favor and buy Serenity and the TV show it was based on, Firefly. I'm confident you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"serenite, serenitas, serenus... Bliss","review":"I'm a fan of Firefly, so I'm biased, but I took a friend along to see Serenity who hadnever seen the series and she loved the movie.

I would imagine many people I don't know felt the same way and didn't bother to watch it.I will admit that I'm a browncoat, own the DVD series, and had a pretty good time at this movie, already knowing the backstory... went three times, in fact.I'd like to see this DVD do the same as the format did for the series. If not, I'll have to settle for fanfic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"I saw Serenity on opening night, and many more times after that. Joss Whedon has done a great job at creating a western feel movie set in the future. His attention to detail in the film is excellent.If you were a fan of the TV show, Firefly, this movie will certainly increase your love for the ship and its faithful crew. And if you are one who has never seen the TV show, after watching this movie, I guarantee you will be back to Amazon.com, placing the series in your cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storyline not always fluent but an engaging movie nonetheless","review":"First, I must say that having seen Serenity before the series a few years ago & then after the watching the series recently, one really ought to see the Firefly TV series before seeing Serenity. The characters & their plights are continued from the too-soon canceled series. Granted, the story line runs thin at times and some of the characters seem a little overdone. So what if one can tell what's CG in certain screens. Serenity is action-packed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A View from a non-Scifi genre fan.","review":"Serenity is obviously loved by those who are meant to see it. I think it's good science fiction, just not great science fiction. If you haven't seen the show Firefly (I've seen bit and pieces) the first half of the movie will probably come off as confusing and a little dopey. I think the last third of the film is a blast. The story is good, though not without problems, and the acting is good. The special effects are fantastic. I don't concider this great science-fiction like Minority Report or Blade Runner, but it will satisfy any genre fans for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, average upgrade","review":"Serenity is, quite simply, one of the best sci-fi movies I've had the pleasure of seeing. The characters and their interactions are somehow witty and realistic at the same time, and the writing and directing is top-notch. I therefore purchased the (original edition) DVD the week it came out. If you don't own this movie, I recommend it highly, and would suggest getting this edition; it costs less (as of now) and has more special features.If you already own that DVD, however, this new 'collector's edition' isn't really worth upgrading to. The additional features are nice, but nothing mindblowing. If you're a die-hard fan who insists on having both copies, try to find this one at a decent price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Move You've Never Seen","review":"This is definitely the best movie you've never seen. Joss Whedon is incredible, the cast is incredible, and the sound and special effects are awesome in the HD DVD version. I rarely write reviews, but I like to think that by writing this review and supporting a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, I am helping to bring about a sequel to Serenity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Star Trek Episode","review":"For all you out there, this is really NOT Science Fiction, the great literature we sci fi fans love to read (and sometimes write). What this was was a bad Star Trek episode, and I mean from the 60s. Sure there were some decent special effects, but what about story, plot, character, etc. On second thought, it was a bad Battlestar Gallatica episode. Sorry trekkies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Production Values","review":"I couldn't sit through the whole film because of the poor quality of the DVD -- poor picture and sound quality. Why are manufacturers making such low quality DVDs now? One more thing, so many of these reviews are merely judgments of the fans of the movie or the series, or of Joss Whedon himself, with nothing about the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"I bought this movie without seeing it because I'm not one to dislike many movies - actually, my friends like to say that I am a big collector of bad movies. This is one bad movie that I am going to have to agree with my friends on that I have added to my collection. This movie was that aweful that I am probably going to try and sell it on Ebay for whatever amount possible. The acting was terrible and the cheezey lines were even worse.

I am a US citizen but currently I'm in the UK at grad school and I went on amazon it allowed me to rent the movie pay for the movie and NOT watch it. I really wanted to watch the movie. I normally never have issues with amazon but they shouldn't have let me buy it if I couldn't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"Virtually everything I loved about the \\"Firefly\\" series is missing from the movie. The storyline of \\"Serenity\\" is only tangent to the \\"Firefly\\" narrative; the movie actually loses ground gained in \\"Firefly\\" when it comes to mutual trust, affection, and respect. \\"Serenity\\" also lacks the easy western pace and humor of \\"Firefly\\", to say nothing of the good lighting and always audible dialogue of the TV series. In short, \\"Serenity\\" most nearly resembles a video game. Much shooting and hacking and stabbing. Two of my favorites from among the original \\"Firefly\\" crew members die (although they are all favorites -- part of the strength of the series) and even the spaceship Firefly is finally smashed to pieces. I've watched the DVD of the TV series four or five times now and gave it to half my friends for Christmas in 2005. Would not consider giving the movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somnolently","review":"Don't bother with the Firefly film; it's a piece of floating space debris in comparison to the TV series. All the elements that made the series interesting such as the dialogue, humor and character interaction and evolution have been thrown off the ship and what's left blown up (literally) into an archetypal Sci-Fi B movie. If you've spent too much time watching the series then this movie is the antidote that will cure you of any curiosity. This is one only the fan boys (who I see mindlessly mark down any negative review here) could love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retarded jr-high kid geek movie","review":"I rented this from blockbuster because I'd heard lots of hype about it being a cool movie. It is not. It's retarded.

There is no creativitiy in the set, the acting, or the script. This rental was a total waste of money. In fact, I turned it off and didn't bother to watch the end. Save you money and rent something else for a real evening of entertainment,"},{"rating":"1","title":"The trailer was better than enduring the movie","review":"I was led to think that in this movie, a great deal of myth and magic met science fiction. I was obviously wrong in the endeavor and realized that it was a bunch of throw-away danger and one oddball psychic girl that trances out and becomes a killing machine. The dialogue sounded rather rehearsed and uninspired. The really great action happened far too late and disappointingly too little. As for sci-fi pictures involving a governmental coverup, the climactic reveal in this movie came as a melodramatic revelation. I certainly hope that the show this film was based off had a better fanbase, because I thought the movie was a lackluster stinkbomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it!","review":"Don't buy this should-have-stuck-to-the-small-screen movie.

She completely and absolutelydominated every scene she was in with a presence and intensity that brought you to that reality. It is a shame that the TV series treated the character of River almost asan aside.

I watched every episode when it ran on TV and purchased the DVD set. So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered that they were making a movie. I am pleased that they didn’t cheapen the sets and just try to capitalize on the fan base to make a profit. Instead the ship and crew all looked the same as in the series and had the same spark/chemistry between each other. I really liked the movie.Don’t worry about getting lost in the show’s history if you never watched the series.

The movie industry puts out way too few really good sci-fi flicks each year. The shear number of horror movies dwarfs the handful of good sci-fi movies available to rent. I wish the industry would try to do more with this genre. I keep my fingers crossed that some brave, brilliant producer/director team will come along one of these years and dazzle us with a new magnificent journey beyond the stars that shakes us to the core, disturbs our sense of reality, and trivializes our silly politics, religion and self-centeredness. We need a new breed of writers and directors who will raise the bar and present the viewing public with an experience to make us cry, laugh, think and learn something new. I'm still waiting...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity, great sci-fi","review":"I watched the t.v. series first (in DVD), and I got hooked with the story. Then I bought the movie, Serenity. I really recomend this movie. It's an excelent movie, not just for the visual effects but because it's a very well told story. Every character is well developed in the story and the suspense mixed with a very clever sense of humor keeps you sitting without blinking. It's a great movie for us, the lovers of sci-fi.

It answered many questions from the series and made the movie even more enjoyable. They pushed scientific possibility a bit far - but you're so busy enjoying the story and numerous surprises that you'll only realise it much later after the movie.

The story is unoriginal. Characters are paper thin. Action is underwhelming (the space battle sequence is less than 3 minutes). Humor is ill attempted. Serenity makes Phantom Menace (a rather weak episode in Star Wars saga) seem like a grand masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Firefly..","review":"But this was awful. For those who don't know, Firefly failed miserably because it was aired out of order by Fox, moving the airing days and times around, so it never built an audience. Serenity is the movie to \\"wrap up\\" what was started in Firefly.It's awful. Firefly was Joss Whedon's dream project, and it was cancelled. Joss Whedon, apparently, threw in the towel and made a movie expressing his crushed dreams instead of a two hour Firefly finale. The characters are changed, (Simon goes undercover...? since when?) to the point of contradicting the TV show, and Joss expresses his emoness over his show being cancelled by killing off two of the main cast. The Reaver plot is decent, and probably would have come out in a Firefly episode, but the rest is awful. Look it up on wikipedia if you want an explanation of Reavers, and spare yourself the pain of watching this movie.I personally view this as a very well done fan fiction, so it doesn't taint the amazingness that is Firefly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I am one who bought into all the hype that this is actually a good movie-it isn't. The acting seems robotic and I don't think the characters are supposed to be robots. (Heck, Lance Henrickson's character Bishop in the Alien movies has like double the personality of any of the characters in Serenity and Bishop is a robot.) I don't know if this is attributable to bad acting, bad directing, or both in Serenity.The whole movie plays like one of those bad Saturday afternoon movies that you start watching because nothing else is on, but then fall asleep to. I don't really have a problem with the way the actors look, the women (and maybe the men) look sexy. Also the visual effects are not bad. The story and premise is completely lacking. Why would the crew of Serenity continue to keep River on board once they know she is a weapon? They complain and whine to each other about it but never do anything about it-doesn't make any logical sense.Also the 2nd A.D. work in Serenity is really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Husband loved it","review":"Totally violent and graphic. With Joss Whelen's sense of humor. All the men in the family loved it. But I just couldn't handle it"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! That was NOT a 4.6 star movie.","review":"This movie is nowhere near its 4.6 rating. Acting and dialog were mediocre, character development was lacking. If you compare it to movies like Mad Max then maybe 3 stars, otherwise if you are not a fan or this series, don't waste your time. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is awesome, but don't buy from this company ever.","review":"I waited for over 2 weeks to receive my order. Once in hand, the DVD would not play in my DVD player for HD, and it won't play on my computer, nor my husband's computer. It's a dud. What a let down. I don't recommend buying the movie through this company ever. I love the movie itself and wanted it in my collection, but now, I have to find another place to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT TRAIN LONG TIME NOT COMIN'","review":"Just based on what's here, it's a waste of money. Run time is identical to the original release; no extended or additional scenes restored to the body of the movie so why bother. Just talking heads. If it turns out otherwise, I'll update my review.Oh and I loved FIREFLY and SERENITY, I just want more of the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Into This One","review":"Not having ever watched the TV series, I walked into this one with no preconceived notions. As an HD DVD, the picture and sound was phenomenal. But...I stopped watching about half way through it because it was boring. There was a brief glimpse of action when River morphed into a Trinity-inspired kung-fu master (Matrix reference). Other than that, I found this to be a Star Trek inspired knock-off. My understanding is that the TV series was cancelled. I now know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Followup to a Great Series","review":"Okay, I know I'm in the minority here, and how blastphemous it is to say that something the great Joss Whedon did was sub-par, but really - this movie was NOWHERE near the quality of the series. The direction was sloppy, the script was overstuffed (clearly he was trying to force every idea he wasn't able to do on tv into the movie), the characters were treated poorly. And in the end, the swashbuckling element of FIREFLY was completely lost. For me - and again, this is my opinion, and I realize it's not everyone's - what made FIREFLY great was utterly abandoned. I felt like Whedon was pissed off at his creation and wanted to savage it.Not that the idea for the film was bad. Quite the contrary - the Reevers were one of the best things about the show, and getting into their story should have been great. But ultimately, I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cult film?","review":"I am a fan of science fiction, but I can't see what this film has that generates such high ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad movie.","review":"watching this movie in a theater was absolute torture. my friend hated it & walked out midway through. it was at the alamo drafthouse, so we still had to pay for food. i was angry at him so i just stayed and watched it all the way to the bitter end. even a couple of beers couldnt make this movie tolerable. I am a sci-fi geek, and generally love any halfway decent sci-fi flick. i figured that this would be right up my alley. instead this was the worst movie experience since pearl harbor. what is the deal with all the fans of this movie? i know some smart people who love this movie & the tv series. it is really beyond me. i just dont get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek Movies","review":"It Stinks and does not portray Human Civilization in a good light.

If however, you like REAL Sci-Fi (Alien, 2001, War of The Worlds, Predator, The Time Machine, etc.) where the focus is on the story and the action involving monsters/aliens and not on a bunch of \\"emo\\" crap, then you WILL be disappointed. I hope that \\"sensitive\\" types go back to the drama arena where they belong and stop polluting the SciFi arena with this kind of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh, blu ray. Made one of my favorite movies more real.","review":"It's such a kick blu-ray is becoming so affordable, and Serenity was one of my first notices for br movies. I love all things Firefly (blu-ray there was an improvement) so Serenity was a no brainer. The lovely story that completed the wrongly-left-hanging Firefly series is a masterpiece in Sci Fi. The original premise was such a kick, and the movie continues, but also gets pretty serious sci-fi intense. Love all things Nathan Fillion now, and watch Serenity over and over and over..... Never get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great - Series pilot was better","review":"Overall, this movie is good, but not great. I was a huge huge fan of the series, having just finished the DVD collection. The first two episodes were incredibly well done.The movie picks up, sorta, from where the series left off. Watching with my wife, who hadn't see the series, she was a bit lost, while I was a bit bored.Some of the dialect was somewhat out of place, as they didn't seem to go fully into the tounge like they did in the series. There were random moments of alien and western dialect that seemed out of place when there was so little of it.The actors seemed to be playing the same characters as the series, but were older, and perhaps better actors - which made the acting seem ...odd.If you liked the series, the movie is worth a watch. Don't get too excited though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"ive been looking for this film for a while now. wasnt hard to find once i remembered what it was called. Beautiful case and some interesting extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie","review":"The combination of good story and solid acting makes this movie very enjoyable. This one belongs in my collection. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity isn't really Firefly...","review":"Before I knew anything about \\"Firefly\\", I watched this movie. I found it to be a fantastic journey with a more realistic outlook on our possible future through the lives of the crew of \\"Serenity\\". The story line is excellent, the cast is outstanding, the special effects are perfectly \\"simple\\", and the plot wasn't predictable. The obvious mixing of \\"old west\\" and \\"sci-fi\\" is definitely different.Now, with that said... I purchased and watched all of the episodes (released and non-released) of the series \\"Firefly\\". I then watched the movie \\"Serenity\\" again and found the movie to be rushed to educate the masses to the \\"Firefly\\" universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss Rocks","review":"Pretty much any work produced by Joss Whedon at this point deserves a look. Most of what he puts his name on is worth watching. \\"Serenity\\" was an excellent last episode too a series that ended years before its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...simply awesome","review":"I am continually saddened that \\"Firefly\\" is no longer on the air. We came to care for the finely drawn characters, and \\"Serenity\\" is an awesome sort-of ending for the series. Sit down, get comfortable and be prepared not to move or blink for the entire length of \\"Serenity\\" because it moves fast and furious to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"The movie was just as great as the series. Even if you had never seen the series, the movie was great by itself but if you had followed the series. it help complete the illusion.One of the best parts was having the original cast back as it made the continuation of the story line more completeA must see for anyone but especially sci-fi fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"bringing things to a close","review":"The firefly series, in my opinion, is some of the best television i've seen. Unfortunately it was cancelled just as you begin to really care about the characters. I see the movie as an attempt to bring all the loose ends to a close. Another two or three tv series's would have made a better job of this, but that didn't seem to be an option. There is so much in the way of back story that was crying out to be told. A movie could never cover all this ground, but it did a pretty good job with the time it had. I'll just have to live with not knowing the preacher's story, or the many other questions not answered. I would not recommend seeing the movie unless you've watched at least the first few episodes of firefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SF movie since Star Wars","review":"I will start by confessing to be a huge fan of the series where I think Whedon had done a phenomenal job on the character development. You really know and care about these people so I will admit to the movie being more enjoyable to fans of the series. What a surprise. I do think the movie holds it's own as a separate entity however. To anybody that says this movie was predictable : could you please email me tonight's winning lotto numbers. I haven't been this entertained since the first time I saw Star Wars in 1977. I would love to see another one or the series brought back but if this is all I get I am extremely grateful for this. Everyone in the theater I saw it in applauded at the end and you don't see that very often. For a movie with this much entertainment value to only do 25 mil at the box office is beyond me. You can only blame the promotion people and certainly not the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"Really fun entertaining movie and I had to buiy the DVD when it came out. the DVD was great too with LOTS of extras. I was not even aware of the Firefly series until I bought the DVD and now I have to get that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Collector's Edition","review":"A Must for \\"Firefly\\", \\"Serenity\\" fans! Over an our of extra bonus features. This is probably gonna be it for this great cast and Joss so why not get it all! Seems most of this bonus footage and features were done in 2005, same as the ones on the single disc version but they just couldn't fit it all. Somehow, the movie looks even better. Also, I should mention, all the bonus features on the single disc are on this set as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, unoriginal, corny and cheesy","review":"Serenity is a movie that apeals to the geekiest of geeks. The dialogue is lame and the storyline whilst having potential is ruined by corny and cheesy attempts at comedy, not to mention the substandard acting.Considering the fact that the firefly series was a failure on Fox, it is no suprise at all that Serenity was also a failure at the box office. The only suprise is how bad Serenity actually was even compared to the failed firefly series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Despite all the hype, this movie and now the DVD haven't really lived up to the already low expectations I had of this franchise. I figured a movie based on a TV show that was cancelled half-way through only half of its first season would have done better at the box office, but oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this turkey.","review":"You know it is bad when it is released on DVD like 9 weeks after it is released in theaters! Talk about huge turn-around.This film is based on the Firefly TV show which failed miserably on network television. So some genius decides to make it into a feature length film with a huge budget and guess what... the film also fails miserably! Did the dingleberries not learn their lesson the first go-around?The part that is really frightening is the rabid fanbase who acted like a pack of lunatic hyenas trying to get people to see this. It seemed like the word subtle was not in their vocabulary and the end result was it kept even more people away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"I saw this movie in the theater with some friends of mine and while I was watching it I was so bored I thought I was going to fall asleep during the movie. I wasted nearly 2 hours and $6.50 that I can never get back! If I could I would give \\"Serenity\\" zero stars. My friends all liked this movie. I must have been the only one that didn't like it. Well that's all I'm going to say about this boring film. Gosh did this movie suck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it, but you will hate it","review":"I saw this movie in theaters and i wanted to die.

If this was based on the TV series, I am glad it got canceled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catastrophe","review":"Unfortunately, I have seen Firefly/Serenity and it is awful. It is good that the series is canceled because it is an insult to SciFi genre.Whedon, just like Paul W.S. Anderson should be fired, and forbidden to write another script by law!Whedon decimated an excellent Alien series with Resurrection, and Anderson dumped it to the toilet after with AvP!I don't want to even mention Buffy or Angel - I don't know who watches that?So, lets go back to the Firefly/Serenity. Its awful, how can it be a SciFi if you: 1-don't have aliens, 2-don't have the technology, 3-have cowboys?!?!If you really want SciFi they you should watch \\"Star Trek\\", that WAS, IS and WILL BE the SciFi at its best.Unfortunately it seems that overall viewer intelligence drop sharply in the last few years, and now people watch Firefly/Serenity-like series.Muppet Show is more intelligent and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow of who they were","review":"These are not the characters from Firefly, especially Doctor Simon Tam. On top of that there are other inconsistencies between the show and the movie. The movie is a solid 3/5 stars for people who have never seen the TV show, but a 2/5 stars for people who like the the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"It not Fire Fly","review":"It's too bad they had to finish the Fire Fly series with a Horror Movie. It's great for a Sci Fi, blood and guts movie, but it destroys the enjoyment of the Fire Fly series. Watch Fire Fly. It is great. This does a great job of finishing the master plot of Fire Fly, but it has too much horror bagage with it. If a well edited version came out, then I'ld recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"5+ Utterly Fabulous!","review":"I had never seen the show before going to see the movie, and let me tell you, it made absolutely no difference. This is one of the best movies that I have seen in many years. The originality is stunning (western in space!). Also, the characters are so believable, not stiff like in the Star Wars movies (new ones). The battle between Summer (River) and the cannibals is totally brilliant. It is brutal art, a monstrous dance. Bravo to Joss for casting a dancer. However, perhaps most impressive, like on Slayer, is Joss's ability to make the viewer care for these \\"far-out\\" characters. He somehow makes them seem like the people next door. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!!!Go see it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity ROCKS","review":"Before going to see Serenity we spent a lost weekend with the Firefly DVDs, and I'm so glad we did. Serenity stands on its own as a tremendously enjoyable action movie, but falling desperately in love with the characters and the ship made the experience of the watching the film deeply moving. It's funny, it's exciting, it's scary, it's heartbreaking, and above all, a really good time. I absolutely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure???","review":"There are so many TV shows getting canceled regardless how good those shows are.....Firefly on FOX network was one of them. Instead of just terminate the production, they made a future film called Serenity......This movie futures none A-list movie actors what so ever. I recognized Adam Baldwin, Nathan Fillion from 90's sitcom Two guys, a girl and Pizza Place!? but it didn't stop to make a great film here. All characters were well developed and all actors contributed their A games to this film. The film has little bit of everything such as Western, kung Fu, Japanese Anime, we recognized from 70's and 80's throw back space battle scenes from Star wars. The script is very serious and intense, and yet Fillion and Baldwin delivered some what goofiness and humors. Yes, this movie barrowed so many aspects from other type of films and yet turned into something very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Amazon Name Says it All","review":"Really no need to review except to be another Whedon sycophant.

It was like a delicious and deserved reward for fans who hated to see the series gone. Here's hoping Nathan can take a break from the wonderful CASTLE series to film another FIREFLY/SERENITY movie, or two, or three. It's a good edition to anybody's FIREFLY collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Film","review":"Anyone else notice how a lot of the negative reviews here fail to explain just why they didn't enjoy the film? There's a reason for that; because it's an excellent film that pleases both fans and nonfans alike.Following on from the television series, \\"Firefly\\", \\"Serenity\\" is set 500 years in the future where a crew of people aboard the serenity ship try to make a living while avoiding the clutches of the totalitarian government alliance.Things are complicated when a girl with psychic ability boards the ship; who is valuable to the aliance.This film is particularly well written, manages an ensemble cast well with witty one-liner dialogue and tells a unique storyline with a space-western feel to it, whilst enabling itself to explore political and powerful concerns important in today's society.This is one of the rare good films to have been released this year and certainly worth keeping on your shelf at home next to the original star wars collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"One of the more excellent films I have ever seen.

Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to watch it after the series","review":"Firefly was cancelled prematurely, so it never had a chance to deliver a series finale (ala Mash, Friends, Sienfeld, etc.) This movie acts as that finale.Be sure to watch it after you watch the series.I suspect that people who watch it cold will have mixed feelings about it. There is very little preamble for the uninitiated. The writers wrote it with current fans in mind and simply used the relationships and characters they had built during the series.That said, if you watched the series, you must watch this to see how they summed it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super duper film!","review":"I loved the TV series, and this film was a fitting cinematic production for it. In many ways, it felt like an extended length episode--it retained the intimacy, humor and, of course, the action of the show--without losing its sense of proportion. Beautifully done and a joy to watch, whether you've seen the series or not.Now please: BRING BACK THE SHOW...or at least make more movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Re-watchable","review":"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was very exciting and very good, but I didn't think it was great. Then I read numerous professional reviews, including one by noted sci-fi author Orson Scott Card, calling \\"Serenity\\" the \\"best sci-fi movie ever made\\". I was skeptical. Certainly it was better than all of the Star Wars prequels, but that's like saying filet mignon is better than hamburger. So I went to see it two more times. Then it clicked. This movie is so full of subtleties and significant small details that make it so much more complex than the usual blunt-force sci-fi movie of recent years (or any years, for that matter). If it's not the absolute best sci-fi movie ever, it's certainly right up there with the best. The key to understanding that is to watch it several times. That, of course, makes it an ideal dvd purchase. You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but grow to appreciate it more and more every time you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SERENITY RULES","review":"One of the best movies of the year:Hands down,no doubt,can't deny,love to hear you try,buy it now,you'll be glad you did,this movie rocks,THE END"},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEFINITE 5 FOR THE MOVIE--BUT LAME SPECIAL FEATURES!","review":"I bought the original Serenity, and it became my favorite movie of all time, spawned by the great series Firefly.

I was in no way disappointed. It flows perfectly, follows continuity, and keeps a great balance between action, humor, and drama. If there is any flaw, it's that some people who did not read the \\"Serenity\\" 3-issue Dark Horse comics did not know certain things. The comic book trilogy bridges some of the events from the t.v. show to the movie, such as what happened to the blue-hand men, Shepherd Book, and such. I believe it is released in a trade paperback now, so you should read it. It helps flesh out this beauty of a film. Then watch the movie (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"Good movie just as the series was. A lot of action and although a bit sad it gave an ending to the series that was abruptly cancelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"If you've seen the show that this movie is based on, then it's worth getting. It ties up a lot of loose ends left by the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...Better than Star Wars!","review":"Loved this movie, total Blockbuster. It has everything, action, comedy, drama and when you hear about the story behind this film being made, you have even more drama.Not like any other Sci-Fi movie I have seen, its actually believable and you get totally immersed in the Serenity verse.I recommend this to anyone who loves action, comedy and of course Sci-Fi, you won't be disappointed. Also check out the series which is a prequel to the movie called 'Firefly' and search online for the fan websites, the story behind it is heartwarming, although tearjerking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Shiny","review":"Most of these reviews are probably preaching to the choir, but I just wanted to play my part (however small it may be) to help sustain the Firefly universe. For those of you who haven't seen the TV series, please do. The movie becomes more rich because you better understand the characters and their relationships to one another. But Serenity definitely stands well on it's own. Great storytelling, and a cast that gels very well together. And I don't think you have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this movie since the writing is so good. And there's plenty of action to keep you entertained.I just hope DVD sales are strong enough to warrant a sequel. Looks pretty good so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun movie","review":"If you're a fan of the Firefly show upon which this film is based or not, you will enjoy this movie. It is action-packed and humorous, without being silly and trite. The characters are interesting and the new un-polished view of the space travel of our future is refreshing. It's what we love about the old Star Wars films, wihtout copying their formula. There's no pretentious Jedi or awful Hayden Christiansen acting. The main characters, specifically Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) are quite likeable, even without the backstory. In fact, what I liked best about the film (and the series) are the characters. They are some of the most relatable characters out there. Despite the futuristic setting, the struggles and relationshps the characters have are easy to follow. You'll love it if you love good movies. If you like crappy movies, may I suggest something from the Lindsey Lohan collection?"},{"rating":"2","title":"We may experience some slight turbulence and then explode","review":"When a movie starts with \\"We may experience some slight turbulence and then explode\\", well, you have to see it through, right?I never watched \\"Firefly\\", but bought this on a whim because of a tiny \\"Wired\\" magazine review. Thank God for tiny \\"Wired\\" magazine reviews, as this is one of the *GREAT* sci-fi movies I own.It's high-tech and human, with (ambiguous) saints and devils, and some of the great sci-fi lines.

Want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liking it","review":"I took the advice from my coworker to watch Firefly(the TV series) before Serenity. I did, and i'm glad that I did. The characters, stories, and humor is very well writen and acted. Firefly was so good I felt my heart drop knowing that i'm watching my last episode of this awsome series.

The characters are well developed and the story is entertaining and engaging. Sadly, this was the last installment after the TV series ended. I re-watched the entire series Firefly and then this film Serenity.I highly recommend this movie and the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie was great, Amazon service was OUTSTANDING!!","review":"I had already previously owned a copy of this movie, this was a replacement for an old worn out home recorded copy.Amazon went above and beyond with customer satisfaction. My order placed with regular mail shipping got hung up in Philadelphia for several days, missing the orignal delivery date. When I used the 'where is my order?' inquiry, to perhaps get a revised delivery date, I expected some song and dance about delivery dates being approximate only etc, but my reply from Amazon blew me away. Email from service apologized for missing the delivery date, and informed me that they were shipping a copy, overnight UPS, at no extra charge, and if my original order showed up to just refuse and return. I got my movie, which is one of my favorites, and eventually did get the original USPO mailed order, which I returned as instructed. Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Enjoyed this movie after just recently being introduced to the Firefly season. Too bad they didn't make at least one more season. Or explain a thing or two in the movie, left over questions from the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie I've seen all year","review":"...and a great ending to the Firefly series. Tired of the ever more artificial futures from galaxies far far away ? Did you perhaps watch the latest big budget movies and were disappointed ? Then Serenity is the right cure for you.Great scenario, wonderfull acting by Nathan Fillion & co., lots of action and plenty of that special flavor of humor that made Firefly so enjoyable.While Serenity is great by itself, I recommend watching it after Firefly for maximum effect. It's very rewarding to see River fulfill her unexploited potential from the series and everything else makes much more sense this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few movies I've watched multiple times.","review":"I watched the movie for about the sixth time today, with someone who had never seen it. He loved the story, the humor, and the visuals, and I enjoyed all of that once more. It really is a very entertaining movie, with great characters. I still get thrills from watching Summer Glau's amazing martial arts dances, and from some of great dialog in the movie.If you've seen the movie only once, watch it again. And if you haven't seen it and you like a good action, science fiction, or suspense story, go buy, rent, or borrow this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi with a human touch","review":"What a concept. Exploring space with a group of people looking for new frontiers and with some good old capitalistic savvy. I first watched this with no idea who these actors were, with the exception of Adam Baldwin, and grew to love and appreciate each one's rolein this western in space. Great adventure, wonderful dialogue anda interesting concept of the universe. It's definitely one of a kind. Mr. Whedon, more please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable for all","review":"Although many of my friends ar Firefly enthusiasts, I've only seen a select few episodes of the series; however, I still enjoyed Serenity for itself, although I acknowledge that there're probably many things I'm missing.For its slim budget, they came through with some pretty impressive graphical effects, and is definitely a quality action movie in addition to all the other things it is (\\"space western\\", \\"opera\\", \\"comedic drama\\", etc).Some of the subplots may not be as developed as you'd hope, but there are several interesting deleted scenes in the special features that you'll just have to see for yourself.An enjoyable movie for Firefly fans and non-fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the series","review":"Serenity was as good as the series, but with more action. The only thing I would recommend is that you watch the series first, then watch the movie. It will make so much more sense.

You messed up by not standing up for the series Firefly, the basis of Serenity. The only saving grace? I can watch the series over, over, and over, and over, and over again. You guys missed the proverbial boat by not advertising the series initially, and then not renewing it - remaking it - making MORE FIREFLY! Hmmm. Perhaps someone bright will start writing the series anew...hmmm. Makes a person conjure a mite, don't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Glau Rocks","review":"It's funny, touching, weird and silly. I have a total crush on Summer Glau since Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles.

Just let your head go and watch the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie if you are a Firefly fan","review":"Any fan of the show Firefly that ran on the SciFi (yes, I know that is the old spelling of the network) for one season will appreciate this movie. It answers questions that were in the show. The old cast came back and did a great job! I really loved the movie. Now, when I have one of my Firefly marathons I can complete it with the movie Serenity"},{"rating":"2","title":"mind-blowing and gripping movie: PURE JOSS WHEDON","review":"I have seen the movie (advance screening), but I'm not giving any spoilers. It's not something you tell, it's something you live. It's the best work I've seen of Joss Whedon... yet: it's funny, it's smart, and it's heart-breaking. It's 2 hours long, but 6 hours would still have gone by quickly. For those who haven't seen the series Firefly, don't worry, meeting the crew of Serenity and caring about them is easy. Stop caring, that's just *NOT* possible. Thank you Joss :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie trust your boyfriend on this one","review":"I am one of those girlfriends who was dragged to see this movie because her boyfriend loved the series. I have been forced to watch an upteeth number of episodes of Star Treck, (I do on the other hand love the ORIGIONAL Star Wars.) I didn't really go to this movie with an open mind, but it was fantastic. I watched the piolet and only the piolet of Firefly so i did not have the backroud to the show.

Being a fan of the series, I didn't miss the Collector's Edition release. I was slightly disappointed. There isn't much to watch in the extra disc. If you're not an avid fan, you probably don't need to purchase this edition. The regular edition should be enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, even for non fanatics!","review":"My wife is a big Firefly fan. Not being a tv watcher or any kind of \\"evangelist\\" personality, I just never took the time to watch it. As a present, I took her to see the special exclusive pre-release screening.The movie blew me away..seriously. It wasn't perfect..what movie is? But sitting here now, I couldn't list those imperfections. What sticks with you is the epic story line, the powerful character archetypes, the feeling of continuity between the characters. I didn't know anything about the series before I saw it, and I didn't need to in order to get caught up in the story line.Within a week after seeing it, I saw the entire TV series I'd missed on DVD. Then I went and saw the movie again. Some things were more clear, and some things were more poignant, but I think the movie was great the first time around, too. I've already pre-ordered the DVD. I guess you could call me a convert."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound wont work","review":"I dont know why but the sound wont work for me with this movie!I have other blu-ray movies and my sound sytem works fine them, I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie, maybe only for diehards?","review":"I came into this movie brand new to the storyline, never having seen the TV show it's based on. I had been told the film was libertarian-themed so decided to give it a shot. I won't waste more space here than need. The acting is bearable at best, often atrocious. The incredibly contrived script doesn't help much, either. However, perhaps where this films struggles the most is in the vagueness of the plot. 45-minutes in and neither my girlfriend or I had really any clue what the story was supposed to be about. Needless to say, we didn't finish watching it and considered it a waste of our time and money. Maybe this film is just something for diehard fans and nobody else, but honestly I don't understand how anybody can respect such poor film-making. To each their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, i didn't really care for this","review":"I never saw the TV show, but i never much liked Whedon's Buffy either, and this movie (and the tv show too i presume) had the same level of humor. The whole Western/Sci-fi theme, while fairly unique, just didn't work for me. And the little skinny girl going ballistic on Reavers was completely ridiculous, not to mention Reavers being able to pilot sophisticated starships when they're supposed to be some kind of irrational madmen!This was just a silly TV movie somehow - SOMEHOW - elevated to feature film status. It wasn't bad per say, but i really don't want to see it again. At least Phantom Menace had some cool lightsaber fights..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCI FI Flop!","review":"Having brought this DVD expecting an exciting new SCI FI flick I was bitterly disappointed. Having never seen the Firefly series and being advised by friends that I should, I went on to buy the DVD to see what the fuss was about. Big mistake, the acting was wooden and the details of character were so bad you didn't really care if the good guys won but worst of the entire plot was appalling. I would not recommend this film if you have not already seen the Firefly series, in fact I would not recommend this film unless you were born with a paper bag over your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"The movie script makes use of psychobabble and talk of behavior modification which at times is unique for a sci-fi movie. The acting and plot is lacking in enthusiasm or creativity. I found this movie to be boring. I am a fan of Lynch's Dune, Bladerunner, and Farscape in case you were wondering about my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"must be a cult film","review":"I'd heard good things about this one. I stuck with it for almost an hour and gave up, which is very unusually for me. I then read the Amazon reviews again and was convinced by how strong they were to give it another chance. I stuck it out till the end, but I caan't recommend it to anyone. Its hard to follow, and frankly boring compared to other sci-fi flix. I also found a few scenes suprisingly unsporting, e.g., when the hero shots badguys out of the blue. Not even a late night filler film for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the five star reviews?","review":"Did we see the same movie? Talk about cliches.

Shame on you Joss..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!","review":"Anybody want a used copy of this bummer? I have it listed here for $13, and only played once. Very boring. Lame, and hard to follow. Anybody who rates this as an excellent movie-----Well lets just say it doesn't take much to amuse them. I love a good sci fi, action/adventure.

That's like saying you voted for Bush because you don't want a rich man to be president! Better than 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY? BLADE RUNNER? BACK TO THE FUTURE? THE TERMINATOR? ALIEN? ALIENS? STAR WARS EPISODES I, II, III, IV, V, and VI? Well, maybe EPISODE I, but not by much.I could also say that maybe he thinks SERENITY is better because because it shamelessly steals from many of those films.Don't believe anything the Browncoat fans tell you.

I do have to agree with some of the other people who reviewed this movie, the beginning was good, but the rest was terrible. I watched the first hour and fifteen minutes, and then i shut it off because I was about to cry on how dumb this movie was. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because there are millions of better movies out there. My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made. LISTEN DIRECTORS: THIS MOVIE WAS A PIECE OF TRASH, AND IF FOR SOME LUDACRIS REASON U DID MAKE SEQUALS, THEY WOULD BE JUST AS BAD, IF NOT WORSE, THAN THIS ONE!. I would much rather stick my finger through my eye, and swirl my brain around than have to sit through the first hour of this movie.

What I don't like is how they recycled the original DVD and added so-called \\"extras\\" in this version and are charging full-price for it. The \\"extras\\" are not worth it - as you watch them, you'll notice they use the same footage over and over again. The case is nice, but they really want to suck your wallet empty by inserting a sales flier listing \\"official Serenity\\" merchandise you can order - that's all this version is about - bleeding you dry. I was very disappointed in that I was expecting to see alot of unreleased/raw footage and this was not the case. What a shame - a blown opportunity to provide fans with a truly memorable collection - the only memorable thing about this version is the lack of material and the full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really new in this edition","review":"I eagerly awaiting receiving this DVD and then was completely disappointed. I don't know why they needed a second DVD -- they could have fit it all on one. There's really nothing new here except the same content re-edited over and over into 3-4 minute segments, a 21 minute segment that aired on SciFi, and River Tamm stuff that was already online. The movie itself is exactly the same (with the addition of DTS).

Purchased in mid-November and let's assume Christmas present as intended and let's further assume that since Christmas and New Year's are busy times, how would one take advantage of the digital download at this busy time of year???

The numbers for both the series and the previous version of the show were really high and with this new collector's edition coming out there has been some serious talk about a sequel to Serenity. So even if you already own the movie, but would like to see a second installment, buy a copy, or get one as a gift for your friends, cause this is the last shot this show will get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Released at the right time!","review":"I guess I'll start with saying I have never seen Firefly so I had no expectations.Simon (Sean Maher) rescues his little telepathic sister River (Summer Glau) from the Alliance, but something makes her turn against the crew on Serenity and Sean decides it's best for them to leave. After watching the tapes from where she attacks the crew find out she's saying \\"Miranda\\" before she goes maniac. The captain takes them back on and is determined to find out who/what Miranda is and why the Alliance is after River.This is a great sci-fi movie and came out at the right time. The movie is whole and no scenes are wasted. There are witty lines all through the movie and you do not wait for it to end. I am already hoping for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What were those FOX tv executives thinking?

The movie was made for newcomers who would may have knew nothing about the show firefly.

I can't complain about what has already been done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but...","review":"I love the TV show Firefly. It was such a unique take on humanity's future with the combination of space travel, intermixed with the morals of the Old West.It seems to me that science fiction fans (and I am one of them) are very loyal and aware of the history of the characters and the rules of the environment (see Light Sabers in Star Wars). Sadly, Serenity changed some of the events of the TV series. Although I am not happy about the changes I am a big fan of the movie.While I hope all Firefly fans will buy the Collector's Edition to support more tales of the crew of Serenity, there is nothing truly new on the second disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity widescreen","review":"Movie was awesome; so was the TV series.

I enjoyed it so much that I immediately watched it again with commentary by Joss Whedon.For me the standouts in a fine cast were Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau. Glau's fight sequences were astounding and surprising considering that her character spent most of the series in a catatonic state. There are also some surprises that will shock fans of the series.Finally I was very impressed with the cinematography and lighting. I highly recommend the Whedon commentary to gain an even greater appreciation of some of the intricacies of this very fine film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awsum thrill ride...","review":"This movie is, to me, the perfect follow on to the tragically short lived TV series.The same characters play the same parts in the movie as in the series, which makes continuity a breeze.The characters get a cjhance to stretch a little more, and none of them let us down.

Someone actually made a movie from a series that didn't even make it on television? YES Universal did.... And with any hope there will be many more to come.This movie can be enjoyed as a follow up to the series \\"Firefly\\" or on its own. It is an amazing adventure you can watch over and over again. The story hits hard and fast, soon after introducing the wonderfully deep characters. The story will leave you enthralled, inspired, and in shock. Though the actors names are not yet well known on the big screen, they are the next up and coming big stars in my opinion. Do not base your decision to purchase this movie on the fact that Tom Cruise didn't play the main character...I highly recommend both Serenity and Firefly to everyone!Buy it now.... and while you are at it... get Firefly too!You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"way cool","review":"I have to say I love this movie.

I blame myself for being a dumbass for not watching this movie/firefly series sooner. When I initially saw this series I was like \\"Space cowboys? What a dumb idea I am not watching this corny crap.\\" 2008 and I finally watched Firefly for the first time and I was blown away. The acting, the special effects and stories was excellent. I watched the entire series straight and rushed out to get the dvd. Holy crap!!! One of the best Sci-fi movies ever!!! It's because of stupid people like me that the movie didn't do well at the box office.I am sad that there are not more episodes of Firefly, it should have gone down as one of the best TV series of all time, if only more people gave it a chance, but I have noone to blame but myself. Please, give the series a chance and you will feel the same way as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Serene","review":"What can I say? Serenity is not your average Science Fiction movie. For starters, it's a movie spawned from a huge fan movement (Browncoats) of a (undeservedly)cancelled television show by Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel). In my opnion, it's a movie made specifically for the fans because of all the different references to past episodes but that doesn't mean some guy who's bored on a Friday night won't enjoy it. While the graphics aren't the same as LotR or Star Wars (New Trilogy) but the story is still compelling and even though the dialogue sounds a bit awkward at times (it's still better than the new Star Wars trilogy at any right), it stays true to the universe. The acting is good, you can get a sense of the characters and their developement over the course of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just....wow","review":"An amazing gem in the sea of mediocrity that is Modern Film the Film from start to finish has everything humor drama action. i can recoment this to any sencient being.

This is one of the nicest dvd packages I've ever seen, and the Bonus content is fantastic. If you've gotten as far as this review, you've surely read others telling you what a great film Serenity is. There's very little I could add, except to say that it's not just \\"another sci/fi movie\\". It is so multi-Genre... an Action-Packed Comedy/Drama set in a Sci/Fi environment with Western overtones, as well as Film Noir, and on top of all that... It's a Mystery with a Social Message! :)Something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying a second time.","review":"I was a bit hesitant to buy the Collector's Edition of Serenity as I'm getting a bit tired of the \\"rereleasing\\" trend that has come about. If you've got the extras put them on the first release. If you've got deleted scenes or extended scenes put two versions of the movie on the first release as well, the theatrical and the director's cut. Come on, people. Why do you think so many people are just downloading movies. Anyway, enough of my little rant.I'm a huge Firefly/Serenity fan and a huge Joss Whedon fan in general so I got the collector's edition. It has all the extras from the first release (good job, guys!) and lots of new stuff. My only real issue is I would have liked to see a second version of the film included that had all the extended or deleted scenes put in. But I can't complain too bad. This is really worth the money. Also if you haven't seenFirefly - The Complete Seriesyet, I recommend checking it out first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow oh wow...","review":"Awesome movie, now in HD...

This has everything you wish Lucas had provided in the prequels: great acting, kicking action, moving characters, and a great plot. The feel is gritty but with great heart. He has a message but will not preach to you. Surprises, love and a message about humanity make it complete. If you ever wished you could find a Sci-Fi movie on the big screen that you could love, do yourself a favor and give this movie a try. You will not go away unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serenity / Firefly","review":"I got this movie and the Firefly series since the review were soooo good. My husband is a huge Si-Fi fan and so I thought since I am a Castle (Nathan Fillion) fan I'd get this for some together time on the couch. We watched the first episode of Firefly and weren't impressed in all. That's why I have not watched Serenity yet. I will try to get into it when I have more time. But right now I rather watch Castle when I have a moment to watch TV than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity Now !!!","review":"This is a great Sci-Fi movie. I strongly suggest that you go ahead and purchase the tv series as well. You get a better feel for the characters, plus every episode is great. As many others have stated they would like to see the tv show come back, I wish it would too. So get the tv series & Serenity, you will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, if slightly derivative, space opera!","review":"The show \\"Firefly\\" that spawned this theatrical feature had aired and been subsequently cancelled before I saw a single episode. Thus, I viewed \\"Serenity\\" with no preconceived ideas about character, plot, or setting.That, without a doubt, was an advantage.I found Joss Whedon's creation to be well made, with the right balance of humor, action, and situations. The mostly unknown cast (I only knew Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass) acquaints itself well and adds to the \\"freshness\\" of a storyline that, at times, is reminiscent of genre films that have come and gone before.What with \\"The Federation\\" (\\"Star Trek\\") on hold, \\"The Empire\\" (\\"Star Wars\\") having bit the dust, it might be time for Whedon's \\"Alliance\\" to take its place in the minds of sci-fi fans, hungry for the next franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"What can I say...... it's \\"Serenity\\"!

There is a degree of story tie ups required from the TV show firefly that is incorporated into this. It moves a bit on the slow side but it needs to.

It will get you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Favorite movie of all time!!!","review":"I Love this movie there are so many things happening in it that replay value is high. The story is well thought out the acting is top notch. Special effects are awesome. With every thing this movie has to offer what sold me is the dialog & dynamics between the actors. It was ashame that the TV series Firefly for which this movie comes from was cancelled. I truly believe that the series Firefly would have been what the Star Wars fans would have wanted from Mr. Lucas if Star Wars was ever made into a TV series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Space Sci-Fi","review":"Having only seen only one of the Firefly TV episodes (not going in with much back story) this was a fun generally family appropriate Sci-Fi movie. Careful with the extras as they contain several F-Bombs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity collectors edition a must for die hard fans","review":"The Serenity Collectors Edition is a must have for the die hard fans of Serenity/Firefly. The sound quality is great. The special features are great for fans. There are way more special features with this then the original dvd release. This is an incredible movie. It's too bad it didn't do better in the box office to warrant more movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good ending","review":"Once I finally found this show, I was really saddened to learn that it was already cancelled. When I discovered the movie, I was thrilled that it tied up most of the loose ends but still left it open enough for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"best looking hd dvd that I own","review":"I would have to say that even though I do not care for the cover this is the best looking hd dvd that I own. The graphics are great and the sound is supurb. I really hope that one day (not too far off) they will bring back the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"A great movie for anyone who likes movies, Serenity has action, adventure, comedy, and some superb writing and acting going for it. The action sequences are intense, tight, and have to be seen on the big screen - DVD just won't do them justice. That said, I know I'm getting the DVD as soon as it comes out, so I can finally hear the lines I missed because the audience in the theater was laughing or gasping."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love SCI-FI this is mandatory viewing","review":"Calling all nerds and nerdettes- if you didn't get enough of the great series \\"Firefly\\" then you need to see this film. The blue ray is breathtaking. The story is fun and well written. The effects are cool. The ship is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"serenity","review":"I was enthralled by this movie. I have become a very late fan of Firefly and was enthusiastically waiting to see this movie. It was exciting and sad but it showed how one must have that desire to continue on despite adverse experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity now...","review":"Great movie. I'd never seen the series but didn't need to in order to enjoy this movie. In the days of remakes and stupid movies it was nice to find an intelligent but down to earth movie. This one actually seemed to have been written by someone who knew how to write. I'm so sick of 80's remakes of what were already bad movies or series. They just seem to have run out of ideas haven't they? This one was fun and original. I have a soft spot for westerns as they're the real action movies I grew up with. This movie had great dialogue and good and sometimes strong acting. Considering the budget (I read somewhere it wss made quick and underfunded) I was pretty impressed with the finished product. Can't imagine what they would have done if they'd had a big budget. I rented this on netflix and liked it so much I bought it. That tell you anything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I had not a chance to see the \\"Firefly\\" television series, but I did enjoy Joss Whedon's interpretation of the X-men comic series and so I thought I'd give this movie a try. I like Whedon's use of dialogue to build and relieve tension in X-men, and he maintains his ear for good witty dialogue in \\"Serenity.\\" He also does an excellent job of developing what are essentially comic book characters, and making us care about them and so that when this movie reaches its climax our muscles tense up as we root for our heroes to make it against overwhelming odds.That said, the special effects are really cheesy -- I suppose it's a homage to the campiness of Whedon's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the replacement cost","review":"The movie, like the series, has a gemlike quality - polished and perfect. It's almost alarming to see the extended scenes and realize how much worse they are. The final versions are a real tribute to the power of judicious editing. And I would buy the entire series all over again if Nathan did the commentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"I never knew of the FireFly series until having seen Serenity on DVD. I am not much of a TV fan but I do see movies often. I did not see Serenity in the theaters because quite frankly, I did not recognize any of the actors and stayed away.I had seen the DVD out for a while and one day picked up a copy. I am here to say that I feel bad about not having seen the movie in theaters. Then when I seen how the box office did, I felt real bad. I would have easily paid to see this movie a couple times at least. If they ever make a sequel (man I hope they do) I will be there the day it opensAfter seeing the movie I picked up the series and it was great. This is TV that I would watch. If they ever brought back the series I would tune in for sure. Here's to hoping they make a sequel at least!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss is a genius!","review":"If you are a Joss Whedon, this is a must see movie. No, make that a must \\"own\\" movie. My family has watched it over and over. As usual, the dialog is amazing. I find myself quoting the movie all the time! It doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally affordable","review":"I've waited for this movie on Blu ray forever. I went to the movies to see it, and w/ my home set up now, it's the cats a$$. I've kept track of all the actors, and many of them are doing well, especially Fillion. I've seen it so many times, my wife won't watch it w/me anymore !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good continuation/explanation of Firefly","review":"While it is a shame that Firefly only made it through one season, this movie does a good job of using the same cast and \\"jumping\\" to a decent conclusion for the series. If you are a fan of the Firefly series or Stargate type flicks you will probably enjoy this movie as well.5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and good special effects","review":"Great story and good special effectsGood chemistry between the characters and an interesting and fast moving plot. Enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Acting in a Space Saga","review":"Any time a movie is made based on a television series, the production faces an additional dilemma: how to bring new viewers up to speed without boring series fans to tears. \\"Serenity\\" manages to do a fine job, those new to the Firefly saga quickly learn the essential backstory while hardcore fans are still entertained during the formative part of the film. This is no mean feat, given the size of the ensemble cast.The element that sets this movie apart from all the other tales of space and sci-fi on film is the acting. Taking the well-formed and interesting characters created by Whedon, the cast really makes them appealing and identifiable. You feel like you actually known these people and you understand their actions and emotions. Hopefully the surviving cast will have the opportunity to reprise their roles in a sequel or two or three. Much like a couple of other space flick franchises, only better. Much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining sci-fi film.","review":"I did not see the TV series that this was based on (Firefly?) but a friend tipped me off that it was a good show and I saw it, even though sci-fi is not usually my cup of tea. But it was a very entertaining film. The action was fast-paced, flowed well and there was not too much of it. The story line was intriguing and kept you guessing. The acting was pretty good (some better than others) but overall a very decent job. It was a sci-fi film with a western feel to it. Recommended for anyone in search of a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have movie if you liked Firefly","review":"Serenity was what season 2 of Firefly would've been had it been made. If you own the Firefly DVD series then do yourself a favor and buy Serenity as well. It's a fast moving movie and ties together a lot of loose ends from the Firefly TV series, which is also a must have DVD set. It's simply one of the best written TV shows in the last 10 years. There are also soundtracks for both Firefly and Serenity that are thoroughly enjoyable to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"what can I say","review":"Great follow up to Firefly. I thought the bonus features were entertaining as well. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Delivery was prompt as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Watch the series first! The movie is great, but the untimely cancelled TV series was some of the best TV ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"This movie, from the series Firefly, is (like the series) the best sci-fi ever produced. The series was prematurely killed and the movie did not get the attention it deserves. I really hope that the dvd earns enough money that Joss and the studios will be encouraged to make at least two more movies and bring the series back.The characters are so real, you can identify with them immediately and I'm pleased to say that they all stayed \\"in character\\" for the movie.We bought the series dvds and have watched them at least a dozen times without ever tiring of the show - I know the movie will be watched over and over again at our house.The only negative aspect of either the series or the movie is it ends too soon...the movie does tie up loose ends left by the premature cancelling of the series, but I still want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"My children have been raving about this movie and after I saw it, I could see why they are Brown Coat Fans. I guess I'm one now, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite all time movies!!","review":"This has got to go down as a classic. I had never seen the firefly series, but of course went out and purchased it immediately following the viewing of this spectacularly wonderful movie.The Mandarin language mixed with gun slinging astronauts is just brilliant. The characters are well written and portrayed.Hooray to Joss Whedon for another success!!! I love the Angel series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scifi ever!","review":"I learned about the show Firefly on an online forum for Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles and then watch the TV series on Hulu. I loved the show so decided to get the movie. WOW, this is just like the TV show but 100 times better. Best Scifi movie of the new century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"The mash-up Whedon has done with the wild-west and sci-fi is one of the greatest things to come to TV and the big screen. Through Firefly and Serenity one gets to see unique characters, deep and poignant stories, excellent music accompaniment, and creative writing all inter-mixed. Sit down and let this spectacle take you away as you feel for the characters, the situation, and everything else in this great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show, movie was pretty good.","review":"So the movie is not as good as the movie but it answers questions and a good wrap up for the show \\"firefly.\\" anyway, I received this movie really fast and for a fair price. I think I paid about $8-$9 and shipping and handling. The movie was in excellent condition, it was almost as if no one has ever touched it. The case is pretty cool, not your normal DVD case and its Collector's edition which is a plus. I have not gone through the bonus features or anything yet but will soon. O"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"If you're a Serenity/Firefly fan, I'd recommend making the purchase. There are no new features, but the quality of the picture makes it work the price for me -- especially if you can get it on sale.

I love having it on Blu-ray and regular DVD so I can watch on any TV in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly series","review":"Firefly was one of the best shows on television that was canceled due to the corporate suits that know little about good art. The series and the movie Serenity are a joy to watch, great acting, directing,writing, and producing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best (and Most Overlooked) Film of 2005","review":"Slightly different in tone and details from the Series Firefly, on which it was based. This in no way deters from the film, and makes it accessible to both new viewers and fans of the Series, a ground breaking, genre-busting program that was cut down before it could begin (Curse you, FOX!). This film, Serenity, has it all: Action, Adventure, Mystery, Drama, Comedy...It's unfair to just call it \\"Science Fiction\\". It's an Action-packed Comedy Drama Western-themed Science Fiction Film Noir Mystery...A MUST see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"The show is very action packed though the story is somwhat disjointed at first. Definetly not for youngsters or those with weak stomachs. Very well shot & presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense. Compelling.

The action is quite exciting and I felt very tense waiting to see how things would turn out in the end. Full of heart. Some sad bits, but very good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, Serenity is really that good","review":"When I first saw Serenity I had no idea it had been made after a cancelled TV series. Fortunately the movie stands completely on its own. Extremely well written, acted and directed, this was what I had been waiting to see for a long time in the realm of Sci-Fi.Needless to say I was immediately addicted and became a fan of the series too.Everyone who still wants to see how great moviemaking can be, should watch this at least once in their life. Or twice. Or every week..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity! Loved the Movie!","review":"Great movie!

Go see it many times!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too damn funny","review":"There are just not enough good things to say about this movie. Yes, there are some plot quirks that are a little distracting, but on the whole it is just what the 'doctor' ordered. And Kaylee's (Jewel Staite) lines are HYSTERICAL!! No spoilers here; you'll have to see it yourself.Don't swallow a bug. See this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - and very intense","review":"The movie is very good, just like the TV show Firefly.

This is about the most interesting science fiction concept that I have found on TV or movies. I recommend it to anyone who loves speculative fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"A great follow up -,original series prematurely terminated - this closed the holes - Watch the anniversary show on cables- science network"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Serenity and Beyond!","review":"I did not see the TV series before I watched this movie so did not have any pre-conceptions (other than I like Josh Whedon's stuff and was a big Buffy fan).The movie is extremely good and well worth watching. The movie and it's plot have all been described in great detail by other reviews and I won't repeat them here. My only problem with the movie was difficulty understanding the dialogue sometimes. The characters have their own patois that was hard to follow at first (nothing like speaking in Klingon, but enough where it threw me off occassionally). I had to turn on the captioning to make sure I understood what was being said until I got the hang of it. It didn't bother me: I thought it was original and gave another futuristic flavor to the movie.If you are looking for a good movie that will stay with you longer than the butter on your fingers from your microwave popcorn, check out Serenity."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll like it better if you saw Firefly first","review":"I just finished watching all 14 episodes of Firefly and tonight I watched Serenity. Yes there is a lot of situations that could have happened to Han Solo, but George Lucas never brought them to the screen, so here it is Firefly and Serenity. And thank you, thank you thank you! I'm a big fan of westerns (Hell on Wheels, Lonesome Dove), SCIFI (Walking Dead, Sarah Connor Chronicles, Star Wars), this is all that and more. I can understand people watching Serenity alone not connecting with it, they needed to see Firefly first to familiarize with the characters and the story. I loved it and wished more Firefly seasons had been done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity Now!","review":"I wish firefly had kept going. I am a big fan of Joss Wheaton I only discovered this show on Amazon. I wish I had seen the episodes for this show while it was on the air. I have a strong feeling that this cast and story line would have been as big a hit as Star trek in its time. If only there had been a way of getting it launched biggeer into the public eye. There are so many people who love Buffy,Angel,Doll house and watch them repeatedly as strange new fun. The color, picture and volume though out was great. I enjoyed it all I will not spoil the delight in watching this movie for anyone else but its worth owning and sharing with friends on movie night!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invest the time","review":"If you saw Serenity without seeing Firefly (the TV show) first, go back and do your homework. It's a story that really can't be told well in 2 hours...it requires more time.Serenity was made for the people who saw Firefly, a really fantastic television show, apparently not made for today's audience...not made for the folks who prefer \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" or watching people eat bugs. It is an intelligent, fresh approach to space science fiction, a genre that was full of stereotypes, faulty physics and improbable aliens. Whedon's vision of the future feels true and relevant.So bravo, Joss Whedon, for some really great work! We hope you can continue your story someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"The outstanding quality and success of \\"Serenity\\" proves that cancelling \\"Firefly\\" was the worst decision FOX could have possibly made.

Firefly fans will notice that the story they depict in the movie of how Simon got River out of the Academy is different in Serenity than how he describes in Firefly, but nonetheless, great movie. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swashbuckling, space-monkey fun","review":"Why is this so great, and why are all the recent Stah Wahs flicks so lame? It's all in the characters, Mistah Lucas...all the relationships are so carefully delineated in \\"Serenity\\", that you actually care what happens to all the denizens of the old junker firefly...that, capped with great dialogue, thrilling action and stunts and plot elements that don't all center around board meetings, makes for some mighty thrilling, whiz bang entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great end to a great series","review":"Fantastic movie, classic Firefly humor/pacing. After 14 episodes I finally got to see River kill, well, everyone. Just, all of the people. Amazing. Even now, we get more depth of the characters. If you watched Firefly, it's a must. If you haven't, you should give it a try. It's worth the effort.

It wasn't until the last couple episodes that I really became indignant that there were no more. Too many ends were fraying. Of course I had to watch the movie!

Recommend to anyone from the Star Wars era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Star Wars should have been","review":"With very little budget, a no-star cast and very little publicity, Joss Weddon has produced a great film with strong characters, cool SFX and a quick and whitty script. It makes The Phantom Menace look weak and over hyped. Buy It!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to watch at night","review":"Before this year, I'd never heard of 'Firefly' or 'Serneity', until my Dad bought the 'Firefly' series and we spent the next month and a half watching 'em over and over again. My view on that:FANTASTICWhen I saw Sernity, the Reavers, battles and humour were brilliant. The loss of two brilliant characters - for those who haven't seen it, I won't say who - was upsetting and Mal's rather harsh way of getting his plans across left me somewhat... awestruck. An unexpected ending filled with blood, suspense at every bend, I strongly recommend this for everyone, even if you din't like the series, you'll love the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect cast & perfect cinema","review":"WOW! I'm not a push-over for any movie...I usually find myself overly critical on many aspects (acting, cinematography, story, effects), but this movie had such a chemistry, all expertly spun by the director...I was blown away. Not overly campy, not too serious & preachy...just good fun with good friends. This is probably on my top 5 list with the likes of Forrest Gump, Heat, Bourne Trilogy, etc. Got the series after seeing the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it also. Hoping for more someday?

He sets the bar higher for all of us writers. He has shown how truly outstanding movies and television can be.I saw \\"Serenity\\" on opening night and was engrosed. Returning to these very three dimensional characters was of course exciting. One thing that truly impressed me was how the movie was written to be easily understood by newcomers to the verse, and to offer so much to existing fans.\\"Serenity\\" is to 2005 as \\"Star Wars\\" was to 1977. SEE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"I went to see it the day it came out not knowing what to expect. I hadn't seen any trailers or any commercials. I thought it was awesome. It won't win any awards or I don't expect it to. But it was enjoyable and I really cared about the characters... so much so that after the movie I barrowed the series from my friend and watched it all in the next 72 hours. There are some jokes that I get more know that I have seen the series. And it is better having seen the series, but the movie got me into the series. So it isn't just a film for fans. Just kick back, have no expectations and you will enjoy this movie. Also I found the trailers after I saw the movie... I felt they misrepresented the film, so don't base your opinion of the film off the trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Continuation of a TV Series","review":"Hahaha... I don't think there is much more I can add to the title of my review. As a movie that was made because of the uproar of fans, Joss Whedon did an amazing job pulling together all the elements of the tv show, trying to tie up some of the loose ends, and making a great run of it. Granted, by watching the series first, you're a little more drawn in by it, but even on it's own, it's an amazing movie. If you want something a little more intellectually stimulating than Star Wars, this is the film for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action sci-fi, but I liked the TV show better","review":"For Firefly fans, this movie is a must watch. I thought the Blu Ray picture and sound was very good. The movie is action packed and has the edge-of-the-seat suspense that keeps it moving along, as the TV show did. However, right from the beginning it doesn't have the same light-hearted feel of the TV show, which I missed. This movie, perhaps the final chapter in the story of the brave Firefly captain and his gallant crew, is more violent, serious, and humorless. I wouldn't watch it again, but I will watch the original TV series again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"This film is a great wrap up to the series \\"Firefly\\".

I bought Serenity because it is by Joss Whedon. I had not seen the Firefly TV series, but am a fan of Buffy and Angel. Serenity offers Joss Whedon's wit in a \\"realistic\\" sci-fi world. The repartee among the ensemble cast is so enjoyable, I've watched it multiple times just for the dialogue and the laughs it brings. Then I bought the Firefly series. More wit; more laughs.

This is a generally fast paced film with a variety of plot threads and characters to keep things interesting and good dialogue.

I loved the movie and also loved the series Firefly (sadly cut down in its prime bu unimaginative network marketing morons, which I had to order on DVD because we don't get to see much that's good here in Australia). The western and space elements are well blended and are only silly when they're meant to be - quite an achievement. The characters are great and the drama and humour are mixed with a skill that Hollywood usually cannot manage. In places it's like Mad Max (Road Warrior to Americans) in space, when the Reavers turn up to terrorize everyone. Joss gives us tough guys and mercenaries and rebel geniuses and space battles and air battles and brawls and assassins and hackers and love and tragedy and humour and rebellion lost causes and lots more. If you don't see this movie you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, please come back to TV......","review":"I didn't discover the TV show until they re-aired it on the SciFi channel before the movie came out. What a great show. My wife, who has a pathological aversion to all things science fiction and fantasy, actually liked both the series and the movie. I think the thing that really sets both appart is character development. A lot of material in this genre is focused on the fictitional \\"universe\\" created and character development is secondary (or tertiary or nonexistant). The characters in Serenity and Firefly are the primary focus and they are real, interesting, and funny. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray won't play","review":"The DVD plays just fine; however, the Blu-Ray won't play.

It has a wonderful balance of drama, suspense, comedy, science fiction, and action. But more than that, it just has \\"heart\\". I can't really pin it down more, but if you watch it perhaps you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Money","review":"The first word that comes to mind is pathetic. If you are a true science fiction fan,I'm sure you will agree. Good special effects does not equal interesting characters or good storytelling. The acting too leaves one to wonder if anyone except Mal even knows how to act.There is no tension in this movie. Nothing whatsoever to make you care about the fate of the world. I laughed at almost all of River Tam's parts, because she is given nothing to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPE!","review":"Oh my God what is wrong with you people? 4*?!

Bad audio, couldn't make out what they were saying which says volumes about the poor production quality.No name actors can sometimes rise above, but not this time.Ho hum story and the revelation near the end about what River knows and why she is being chased is a bit of a let down.You would have to pay me to see this movie again. Can't believe what passes for a \\"great\\" movies these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positive reviews fooled me","review":"I wasn't going to watch this. Joss Whedon had a huge loyal fan base for Buffy: he abandoned his fans at the end, giving us about a year and a half of ruination of what had been a really good story. I swore I would never watch a Whedon production again. But it has been a long time, there was nothing else promising available, and the reviews looked good. Boy, did I get suckered.This movie was not only poorly scripted with plot holes you could drive a Semi through, but it was also a thin propeganda film. The major plot point, around which all the others revolved, was a young woman begging to be forgiven for trying to make people better. Oh, please, Mr. Cowboy, save us from the nanny state.As to Joss being a feminist, puh-leez. He 'creates' stereotypical male charecters and then puts boobs and long hair on them. He wouldn't recognize feminist epistemology if it bit him on the nose.If you MUST watch this sorry excuse for a movie, please rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firmware Trouble Strikes Again","review":"This is NOT a review of the movie itself. The movie is great.I am not sure how the producers of Blu Ray expect us to continue like this. I have owned my Blu Ray player for a little over a year now and I upgraded my firmware twice due to not being able to watch a new release movie. I just upgraded the firmware last about a month ago. Now, one versioni later was released mid December and I can't watch this new release. My Sony player starts the loading process and then powers down and restarts again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alone in the Verse","review":"I hated this movie. What had been a show about Mal and his crew became a movie, River the Reaver Slayer. At the big fight scene, I wish everyone had died and just ended the stupid movie since to me Firefly was dead. Yes there were a few good moments and some great lines but that was at the beginning of the movie. Jayne (Adam Baldwin) was terrific as usual. I saw the movie at an advanced screening and refused to see it when it hit theaters and would never ever waste my money on it like I wasted my time seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Grade Sci-Fi","review":"I really can't understand all these rave reviews giving 5 stars and saying that Serenity is the best movie ever. It is the sort of movie that you would expect on something like the Sci-Fi channel, certainly not something that I would expect to see at the cinemas and it is clear from the box office results that most people agreed with my view.I was actually a fan of the firefly series, but Serenity was a huge disappointment and it felt like something that Joss Whedon had done in desperation, as firefly was not at all the sort of series that was made to be a theatrical release.In reality I would probably give Serenity 2-3 stars but I thought I would give it 1 to counter all the ridiculous 5 star reviews.Also be careful when looking at the dvd cover, as it doesn't at all represent what happens in the actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good god, I hope no one let's Whedon direct again!","review":"Dont waste your money or your time. A total waste of time.The movie was the worst i ever seen in my life. The direction was the worst ever!

Here are things that I did not like about the film:Spoilers!1. The dialog in this film was just terrible!2. Good guys just went back and forth from the same planets.3. Girl name River was annoying and walked around like a zombie. Also, she sometimes went into some martial arts moves and killed off all the deformed looking bad guys.4. Ending was laughable!I don't have much time to write this, so I hope that my review was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Horrible film. The characters are shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom. What's missing from Serenity is genuine vision and seriousness--without which, the humor is just sophomoric smalltalk, so formulaic that you can set your watch by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get any worse!","review":"I liked how the movie started and that's about it. I could not believe just how boring this film was! The reviewer \\"Can't believe some people\\" should not have critized others like the way she did. My friend, who is an english major pointed out that they were lot of errors in her sentences. She should have just made her point and left at that. Bottom line, you may like this movie if you liked the t.v. show Fire Fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"FX Flat Iron Shining Defrizzant","review":"I purchased this product because I was looking for a new/different product to use to straighten my hair without frizz and to prevent damage from using a flat iron.

On the one hand large corporations offer us lots of benefits in the way of products and services, on the other hand, they are the greatest element in the increasingly offensive disparity of wealth.I was not expecting the insight that this book offered on Disney and I was most pleasantly surprised. It is an intelligent, honest book (I know I have friends in Celebration) and it presents compelling evidence of how big corporations, in this case Disney, exploit the environment, workers, and ultimately their consumers.I was also engrossed in the chapters that dealt with the school because these chapters brought up arguments relevant to anyone who has school age kids or cares about it.The writing style is quite fun and Ross provides wonderful anectodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare!","review":"A windy montage of extemporaneous rambling. This book is neither concise nor interesting. Dr. Ross must have one of the largest vocabularies ever known to mankind, or else he has somehow programmed his word processor's thesaurus to replace every adjective with the counterpart containing the largest number of syllables. The definitive history of Celebration remains to be written. I will use this book as an example of what occurs when book lacks judicious editing. Recommended only for those who understand the concept of theoretical bricolage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the money!","review":"I read this book after reading Celebration, USA by Douglas Franz and Catherine Collins. The Celebration Chronicles is not worth the money. Mr. Ross has written a \\"scholarly\\" work which manages to examine Celebration at arm's length. Mr. Ross obtaining an apartment in Celebration, a community he clearly has no vested interest in, does not qualify as being a truly involved resident of a newly created, struggling community. Franz and Collins give much better insight, mostly because they have invested in a home and are truly involved in the growth of the community.For a historical, sanitary view, choose Ross' account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Read about an elitist community","review":"Reading this book was like watching paint dry....I moved to Celebration in 1998. At first I was charmed by the Disney connection, distinctive house designs (for florida anyway), the nice, well kept streets.Fast forward several years....Celebration now has a -- TERRIBLE -- reputation in the central florida area for being snotty and elitist.

The movie is almost laughably bad. The plot has potential but it is not realised because of the terrible miscasting - eg the second in charge of the gang looks and acts like a junior university lecturer - the bad and inconsistent acting - Helen Mirren and Bob Hoskins seem to be in different movies most of the time - and the punishingly slow pace. It comes close to the 'so bad it's good' category."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may as well call this a BEST OF album","review":"So many solid songs on this disc. Great metal album. If only the band had more like this in their catalog. Truly deserves a place in every metal fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece By The Masters Of Metal","review":"I got this album in 84 after hearing the song Balls To The Wall on the radio show Metal Shop (anyone remember that show?). I own over 1000 cds and this album has always been in my top 10! Udo's vocals are a bit rough and may not be for everybody, but I will take real emotion and good vocal melodies over some pretty boy singer anyday. Wolf's guitar work is biting and superb. His solos bring tears to my eyes, especially HEAD OVER HEELS. Wolf is up there with Michael Schenker as one of the best European guitarists ever. Stefan (drums) and Peter (bass) help give this album it's BALLS. I think we are all heavily influenced by the first album we hear from a band (sentimentality), but this album IS their BEST! Followed closely by Restless and Metal Heart. GOD BLESS YA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"their best SONG ever! ...","review":"This album contains Accept's only good song: the title-cut. And what a song it is! Simple, hypnotic, exciting, pure, unforgettable; just brilliant! It still sounds fresh even today. In spirit, it belongs on either Metal Heart or Restless and Wild. BTTW has nothing to do with the rest of the material found on this album--their darkest and what \\"sounds\\" like their best. The production is also the best of any Accept album. \\"Except\\" for this song, I'm not a fan of this band.

Originally had this album on cassette but it has long ago been missing. Also who uses cassettes anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"Incredible how a band full of accomplished musicians as guitar player Wolf Hoffmann, bassist Peter Balter and drummer Stefan Jaufmman could be led by such a dreadful singer as Dirk Scheneider, whou can write great tunes but just can't sing at all! Anyway, this record is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the quintessence of 1980's metal.","review":"All the jokes have been made; 1980's metal seems to continue to come under fire, but, it may well be my imagination, as bands such as Nirvana seem to, with their very use of crunching guitar, mock heavy metal and its unbridaled passion, sensuality, and exhileration. Accept are my personal favorites in this genre, and I've probably heard over 90 songs, and, though some are better than others, I like them all, from the recordings of the late seventies on through today's recent releases. This particular album is their magnum opus, a seething mass of passion and furor yet unmatched. Check also Russian Roulette, Metal Heart, and Restless and Wild. Their are few bands today who continue to wave the banner of eighties metal, something of a passe proposition today. ASKA, a marvellous band from Dallas, Texas, continue to wave the flag today and are, in this day of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, my greatest hope for some sort of metal renaissance in the nineties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early 80's Metal Go(o)dness","review":"When listing classic 80's metal albums, this one has to be at, or near, the top of the list. Continuing their heavier, if not faster, attempt to out \\"Judas\\" Judas Priest, BALLS TO THE WALLS is a superior follow up to the decent RESTLESS AND WILD. The guitars are louder, vocals are grittier, and the homosexual innuendos more apparent. The standout tracks on this album are the early MTV hit \\"Balls to the Walls\\", \\"Fight it Back\\", and \\"Love Child.\\" There is really not a bad song on the album. (You might consider \\"Winterdreams\\" the only weak song.) This is a worthy purchase be it new or used. It's hard, It's fast,...It's metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT !","review":"This was the last \\"acceptable\\" albun by Accept. Full or riffs, melodic solos by Wolf Hoffmann and the usual grows by Dirkschneider (I like his voice, but the band should have had another singer, because his voice needs accostuming). The songs are great, the ballad \\"Winterdreams\\" amazing, the title track using a piece from Wagner, \\"Love CHild\\" leaves you with no room to breath. After this CD, Accept was gone for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with a name like Udo Dirkschneider","review":"A small little German guy in a camouflage outfit with such a growling voice it would scare to [stuff] out of Mariah Carey, backed up by a furious guitar driven gang doesn't sound like something attractive. But it is! Accept (a rough, raw and unpolished version of Scorpions) made some great heavy metal albums, and this is perhaps their finest. \\"Balls to wall\\" is a very good album featuring traditional heavy metal, and although Udo Dirkschneider is no David Coverdale it works just fine. Guitar player Wolf Hoffmann is capable to combine the hard and fast with the heavy and melodic, and in my opinion he's far more interesting than many of the so called guitar heroes usually praised (John Sykes for example). Crank it up and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the wall of forgetfulness.","review":"As a remastered version of a legendary metal album,this is complete success,bringing back to the attention of contemporary audiences a great band.Accept have always had a powerful sound,mixing AC/DC grooves with a fast and precise guitar attack and an amazing rhytm section;with their charismatic lead singer,they conquered entire arenas throughout the eighties and the nineties.\\"Balls to the Wall\\" is a worthy testimony to their great talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor in information,not useful if you already have the breed","review":"Add a few pages for the breed,with other common information about dogsand you churn out books like this.No real life information about show grooming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to read!","review":"I'm not sure if you can truly critique a book I haven't finished, but whew!..this was tough to read.

The characters are so LAME! I never got the feeling that Maggie and Nick/Aiden were \\"true flames\\"! I can't believe that I actually paid for this book! If you want a really GOOD time travel romance, I suggest reading Lynn Kurland. For the ULTIMATE book in this genre, then read Diana Gabladon's \\"Outlander\\" series! Lynn and Diana knows how to develop the main characters in their books. They make you fall in love with them and want to root for them to get and stay together.

I'm soooooo sorry to say....","review":"Previous books I have read by Constance O'Day - Flannery were excellent. Though I haven't quite finished this one I am finding that I have to force myself to continue on. I just cannot seem to \\"get into\\" this book. I find the heroine's behavior bordering on obnoxious to the point that I actually found myself cheering on the bad guy today. YIKES! This book is definitely an exception to the rule with Constance O'Day Flannery. Her previous work was touching and captivating..... I look forward to her next book and a return to excellent stories with endearing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it in my fireplace!","review":"I really wish I had read the reviews on this book before I bought it; then I would have saved my money! I normally dislike time travel romances; they're awkward and unbelievable, but I decided to give this one a chance because it looked interesting. Was I ever wrong! Maggie was obnoxious and Nick was the classic hero, blond, strong, and gorgeous, but lacking any endearing features. The \\"eternal love\\" they claimed for each other throughout the novel wasn't evident to me. The whole book lacked substance and depth, and I kept putting it down before I FINALLY got through it. All in all, a huge reminder why I don't read time-travel romances all that often. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time(and money! )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully romantic!","review":"Like all of Constance O'Day Flannery's books, this one is very romantic and spiritually uplifting. I really liked the Elizabethian setting, and the hero is the knight in shining armor of dreams. The time travel element is totally believable, with the heroine disappearing through a maze into the past. I only wish Ms. Flannery's books came out more frequently. No one does time travel like her."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STORY!","review":"Wow. I am really surprised by the intense feelings generated by this book. Obviously, you really love it or hate it. I'm one who LOVED IT. Even though the Renaissance Period is not one of my personal favorites, I found it easy to read and I really identified with Maggie and how she was overwhelmed by her life and everything that seemed to be going wrong with it. What I got from the book was taking your life 'one day at a time', not planning your whole future and worring about it, but recognizing the joy that is Life. It inspired me to go out and live my life and go for my dreams, because it could all be over tomorrow and all I would have is a pile of bills that consumed me and a dream that died. Bravo, Constance O'Day-Flannery, for getting another great message and story out there. For me, this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent romance","review":"Like most of Constance O'Day Flannery's books, this one had an intelligent, thought provoking theme along with a great romance. How many of us have faced a mountain of bills, feeling like we are worthless and not living up to the American dream?

Well, I'm sorry to have watched this pathetic excuse for a horror movie. The story features Elizabeth Moss as a college student, Emma who begins to have strange visions after moving into her new home. She begins to retreat into herself, and feels like she is losing her grip on reality. Jason Lewis portrays a detective who attempts to help her.The acting is lackluster and except for Moss, most of the other actors seem to be just going through the motions. The effects are terrible, and the scares are non-existent (the usual appearing and disappearing specter). The movie also suffers from trite dialogue and poor direction.

I would certainly apply the adage to this book.In all of his \\"biographies, according to David Bret, every (deceased) person in the movie industry; male and female, from the lighting technicians to the highest paid stars and the movie moguls themselves; the single and the married as well, were all either, bi-sexual, lesbian, homosexual... or wish they were. Mr. Bret offers no proof except what apparently exists in the fantasy dream world of others or his own imagination... and perhaps wishful thinking.It makes for titillating reading but unless the author can back up his claims it is all fiction and the reader should take it with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Nonsense!","review":"This is the second most discredited bio of Valentino, in my opinion, trailing just behind Kenneth Anger's funny but spurious \\"Hollywood Babylon.\\" The author claims to be in the possession of Rudy's private diary and quotes from it episodes of passionate homosexual love. Long ago that \\"diary\\" was proven to be a fake, written by a distempered mind. The French-Canadian author, Jeanne de Recqville, carefully explored every sentence of that so-called diary, and demonstrated its numerous mistakes. Let the buyer beware!

This is probably the worst book I have ever read on Valentino and contains so much destain and paints him in such a horrible light I wonder why Bret has such an ax to grind. Considering Valentino died 75 years ago, Bret writes as if he was privy to intimate conversations that took place between Valentino and individuals who are no longer alive to be interviewed. Brets revelations that Valentino was a raging homosexual, who had table manners worse than a pig and a temper and destain for women could only be motivated by himself and the publisher of this book attepting to make money off the gay male population who unfortunatly will believe this poorly written load of sensationalistic and vulgar nonsence.

And he delights in this. Truly sick.I came across this book recently, and it's more of the same nonsense. What was factual has been written countless times before, and better. Beyond that he seems determined as a biographer to do little else than give credence to the ancient rumours of Valentino's sexuality.Skip this and find something more reliable, like \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" or the National Enquirer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH A CENT...WASTE OF TIME & MONEY..DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR","review":"My father has a saying: DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ OR HEAR AND ONLY BELIEVE HALF OF WHAT YOU SEE...Please don't waste your money on this book.

It was nice to hear other's stories and perhaps get an idea of what is still to come and try to avoid making mistakes in relationships just because of one event. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is close to a motherless daughter just because it so closely relates to what that person is going through and give them a better understanding.

Her topics touched on various themes and points in a woman's life such as: grieiving the loss of the mother, changing family dynamics, growth and independent identity, lessons learned from mother's death, etc. Especially how this relates to growing up without a woman around to help you learn things in society. Even how it influences and effects relationships with other males and finding a mate. I found it eerily similar to what I've experienced and felt when my own mother died when I was 15. It's a must-read for even significant others too if they are willing to understand their wives, girlfriends and fiances better--I strongly recommend it. In essence, motherless daughters are an exclusive sorority--not many people know what it's like to live the rest of your life without your mom there to guide you.

I like the fact that it looks at both healthy and difficult relationships between mothers and daughters. I feel we've all had great mothers and at times those mothers can be less than perfect. It really helped me deal with the difficulties my mother and I had. It also helped me celebrate and remember the good times we shared.

The beach music vibe was there on about half of the tunes. I have a feeling that this music and these bands sound much better live, with a cold beer in your hands in a club at ocean side.

It appears the stator burned out.So far Hitachi has not responded, and a little research shows the stator is a $135 part (I paid $99 for the compressor).So I have a large paperweight.I've purchased several Hitachi tools, some are quite good. But there's lots of good brands out there, and if Hitachi (or Amazon) won't stand behind a clearly defective product, they won't be seeing any more of my money.It's sad that the concept of customer service has little meaning, and making excuses is the order of the day.I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor factory quality control","review":"The unit arrived yesterday.

This well engineered 24-track compilation features material that appeared on the label and its subsidiaries from the mid-'60s to the mid-'70s. Most of the featured acts on this disc are only known to serious soul mavens... The Wallace Brothers, Kip Anderson, and Mava Whitney to name a few. Many of the cuts have an old-time negro spiritual feel with a serious bluesy overtone. Frankly, it's just what you'd expect from a label that has such a proud heritage.

This case and armband is perfect for just this purpose. The case snugly fits my iPod, and it has velcro on the back, so it may be attached to the armband (perfect for jogging and other activities) as well as the belt strap.The only improvement to be made would be the velcro.

I couldn't put the book down and when I did, it was only long enough to grab a quick nap. Then I was back in the story. I loved it... cover to cover. The supporting character Brent Forester was another plus. Noble, supporting and sacrificing... with a sex appeal that stole my breath away. Side by side with Emma Lemieux, his female counterpart, Brent steals scene after scene. In the end I can't wait for the next novel in the trilogy. I'm drooling for its release.

Kids are deemed to be so unimportant and stupid that parents are encouraged NOT to communicate with or explain things to them. Punishment in this case is severe. For instance, for the child who escapes a \\"time out\\" in the room, the book doesn't acknowledge that this child might need a different appoach, and counsels a parent to LOCK THAT CHILD IN THEIR ROOM. From where I'm standing, that's starting to look a lot like abuse, and is certainly NOT going to \\"teach\\" your kids so much as train them to be thoughtless, obedient, fearful automatons.

There's something stange about calmly saying \\"Thats 1.\\" to a child who is engaged in intentional misbehavior. It's like saying \\"You have three more warnings before you have to stop.\\" I also think that kids need to learn from their mistakes. Saying \\"That's two\\" doesn't teach anything.

Also, what about more severe situations? If my son is hitting his brother in the face with a toy truck, I certainly shouldn't be standing there saying, \\"Kyle, that's one!\\" I found other books to be much more realistic and practical, such as: Perfect Parenting: The Dictionary of 1000 Parent Tips. Because I want my kids to listen to me without my having to threaten them with a time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids Misbehave For A Reason","review":"This book may work for some children, but it's main fault, like so many other discipline books, is that it doesn't address what to do, when the method doesn't work. If the child doesn't stay in time out, what do you do? Lock them in their room. I'm not comfortable with that. The book suggests in that case, the family should consider counselling, which means that we look at the need of the child which is behind the misbehaviour. I could have done that from the beginning. I would recommend a book such as Parent Effectiveness Training that does address \\"what if the method doesn't work\\". Kids misbehave for a reason - usually a need that is not being met, and kids are not the best at asking for their needs to be met directly, so they choose annoying indirect ways that we label as misbehaviour. This book addresses the symptoms, not the underlying cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all kids","review":"This system was implemented in my son's 3rd grade class and I frankly fail to see what is so \\"Magic\\" about it.....although it did magically transform my happy, excited about school little boy into a puddle of tears at the end of each day because the check marks were given out in front of the entire glass and he felt mortified. I didn't realize we are now parenting and teaching our kids via public humiliation...seriously?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An endorsement of Dr. Phelan's appraoch to discipline.","review":"1-2-3 Magic is just that, Magic. It takes the stress out of discipline. It helps everyone keep calm and allows us a much needed time out. Instead of shouting matches that noone can win, and only teach how to scream, 5 minutes of quiet to regain control. After the five minutes most times the situation has handled itself. Parents need to be consistent in their approach to handling children, and this makes that job easy, no favorites,no tug of war, everyone is on the same page. It is so effective,school teachers can use it with your child so he/she receives consistent reinforcement of unacceptable behaviors without the damage to self-esteem. Best of all it's easy to learn and implement with the whole family, babysitters too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the True Sounds of the Genre","review":"There are some good songs on here, but the majority of these bands aren't really streetpunk. Streetpunk is fast paced punk music with an oi! spirit. Bands like Anti Flag, Bouncing Souls, and Swingin Utters aren't streetpunk at all. While I do like some bands on here, such as the Briggs, Defiance, LCB, Toxic Narcotic, Unseen, US Bombs, The Virus, and a couple others, I cannot say I enjoy this, or reccomend it. Not the true sounds of streetpunk at all, you'd be better off getting \\"Pure Punk Rock\\" or \\"Punx Unite: Leaders of Today\\" for a streetpunk sampler."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious & depressing","review":"I can't think of one good reason to see this film. The characters are unformed, uninteresting and, if they had not been played by beautiful actors, probably highly unattractive. The problem is that it is artfully made, and yes, the actors are good looking, so one is seduced into thinking that this is something one should be paying attention to. If you met people like this in real life, your natural reaction would be disgust and to turn away. They probably don't smell very well either. The main character starts out as a petty thief, involving small boys in his crimes, and it goes downhill from there. Way downhill. There is no moral, except perhaps that \\"crime does not pay.\\" Didn't we already know that? Is there any good reason for making this film? Did it illumine the human condition? Was it beautiful in any way? No, no and no. Self-indulgent drivel on the part of Les Dardennes. I used to be a big fan of French films but I think their moment has passed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it deserve an award at Cannes just because it's French?","review":"Absolutely not! I am a BIG fan of international films, everywhere from Cannes, to Bollywood. This film absolutely does not deserve any of the good publicity it recieved. I've had tooth extractions done that I would rather have been to rather than watch this again. It is slow, immature, and uncaring. The concept had so much potential, and this story could have been so much more. But something got lost in translation, that something is a good storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated films in recent memory.","review":"This won the Palme D'Or? Absolutely ridiculous. I would call it a pretentious bore but there is nothing even artifically high-minded about the story so I would it an unpretentious bore. The main character is completely devoid of any trait that might compell us to root for, hate, empathise, admire, relate to or understand. Bruno (protaginist) is a bad boyfriend, horrific father, inept thief, bumbling con artist. Who cares what happens to him? The baby in the movie is a rubberlike being that never cries, poops, laughs. It's absolutely annoying to watch the young couple interact with such a lifeless prop. The only saving grace is Deborah Francois, who puts in the ony believable performance in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amoral behavior and then, the search of redemption!","review":"After Rosetta in 1999, the brothers Dardene regained the coveted Palm D'Or in 2005 with this bleak story which undoubtedly is strongly inspired by Robert Bresson's Pickpocket.As a matter of fact, the semiotic codes are given according to the model of a work of Dostoievski (Think about Crime and Punishment). And the excessive handling of the camera (cinema veritè)accentuates the minimalist atmosphere of this terrible drama because it emphasizes the documentary aspect, making and dyeing to work together a more theatrical, more intimate where the viewer can even snet breathing charactersAn actual drama with awful and predictable consequences, but above all, it's worthy to be applauded that Bresson had served as spiritual guide along this excel movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totaly overrated","review":"This movie is not a good movie. Besides it's very very depressing. Also haven't a good art. No good music. The plot is going from one side to another. The sum of the parts is equal to the whole thing: a boring, depresing and a mediocre acting movie.Don't understand how many people think is good. Be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form Follows Software","review":"\\"History of Form*Z\\" is one of the first attempts to place design software in the context of history. Pierluigi Serraino, both a theorist and a designer, is able to offer a unique perspective into the theoretical implications that software plays in the world of design today and its historical significance. While it has long been suspected that computer software may affect or dictate design decisions, this book offers a glimpse into the academic and practical implications, effects, and repercussions of such possibility. Rather than simply describing the pros and cons of a software package, Pierluigi attempts to take a step further and address the phenomenon of \\"formziness\\" and its effect in the built form, a courageous and pioneering effort. Highly recommended for students, instructors, and practitioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools Make the Man","review":"Computer software to assist architects in their design processes has been commercially available for more than twenty years, yet few architects give any serious thought to the ways in which their use of software as a design tool and as a medium of expression/representation influences the design product (as well as process). Pierluigi Serraino, a USA-based practitioner in the European tradition of \\"architect as public intellectual,\\" has undertaken such an analysis in this slender but provocative book. Don't be put off by the product-specific title -- this study is not about software so much as it is a book of profound insight into the relationships among man, machine and \\"D\\"esign. Highly recommended. -- Jerry Laiserin, Editor, The LaiserinLetter(tm)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant and entertaining","review":"I have received Montana for the last three years.

I expected it to be more...concious...sounding, and a little heavier (there's quite a lot of acoustic/clean guitars). To the point: Ride, Animal Machine, Winning Days, Evil Town, Rainfall, and F.T.W. are the best tracks. Everything else is...well...boring.

Because I have obviously not heard what they heard. While \\"Highly Evolved\\" was a fun, rocking album, \\"Winning Days\\" is a little bit of a meandering mess. It actually managed to bore me the couple of times I listened. I was really expecting the album to have a lot more songs like \\"Ride\\", but to me that was the best song and the rest of the album didn't come close. There are too many slow, kaleidoscopic songs. Not as trippy and cool as they apparently think. I hope the Vines can remember what made \\"Highly Evolved\\" a cool album."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds like heaven","review":"My favorite album of the 21st Century by far. This album will blow you away. The harmonies are incredible, I cannot even describe it. Really, don't waste anymore time reading this review, go listen to THE VINES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Genius is not too strong a term","review":"I thought the Vines' Highly Evolved was the best debut CD since Led Zeppelin and Winning Days only carries the band's talents forward. Craig Nichols' sense of melody and harmony may just usher in the return to Pure Rock and Roll of the legendary 60s, sweetness and angst with a strong backbeat. The depth and breadth of the CD selections offer as much as some bands can deliver in 3 CDs. I'm thinking a nouveau Magical Mystery Tour is not far off for these guys.I hope Craig can stay alive long enough to crank out a long and esteemed body of work--his stage presence is alarmingly over the top when it comes to chemical enhancements. His mother must be very worried--and proud of his musical achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning Days is great cd!","review":"Talk about superb second album syndrome! When The Vines released their superb debut Highly Evolved two years ago, they were quite simply the most exciting rock band in the world. Their psychedelic punk buzzed with a manic energy, while their lead singer Craig Nicholls was so out of control, there was a sense that he was capable of anything. All of which makes this follow-up one of the biggest success of the year so far. Nicholls and co have charisma to burn, and if they make more good songs, they are going to be massive stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Days","review":"This second effort from The Vines is an excellent one... I think that the reason some people aren't liking Winning Days is because this time around the music is more mellow than the first. This album just shows a different phase than the first one, but of course, you still have your stronger more 'rocking' songs like Ride, and Animal Machine... while others have a combination of both melodic and that usual Vines guitar like my personal favorite TV Pro. Craig's voice is still great.And to response to the review prior to mine, if Craig Nicholls is a middle-aged record executive, then you're completely right... as he wrote all the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic and Magic Story","review":"I learn many things of my life by reading thisnovel.

I have read Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which struck me as the inspiration for The Da Vinci Code, and which Olson and Miesel also analyze at length, and found it interesting until it revealed itself as just another of those \\"Jesus didn't rise from the dead\\" books.The Da Vinci Code is different since it merely claims to be fiction. Yet, because so many readers read it as gospel, someone must answer the mythinformation. That would be Olson and Miesel, who counter the Code point by point, tackling its arguments and factually answering its assumptions. Along the way they reveal the secret facts of history which, as the popularity of the Code shows, really are unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but 300 Pages of Garbage","review":"This book is nothing but 300 pages of two angry Christians ranting about how upset they are Dan Brown wrote a book about Jesus. Anyone who shows interest in Brown's opinion or agrees with him is portrayed as fool hearty and idiotic and those that agree with them are level headed respectable people. The Da Vinci Code is not meant to ruin Christianity and was not a way for Dan Brown to fight the Christian faith but you would never get that impression by reading this piece of lethargic whining. I could probably write a book on the problems with THIS book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting - not convincing.","review":"This book is, at best, an exercise to boost the author's faith in their version of history after it has taken such an obvious hit.

Moreover, they use the fact that Brown (author of DVC) uses \\"Da Vinci\\" instead of \\"da Vinci\\" or \\"Leonardo\\" as an attack on his credibility, which is weak to say the most.If these arguments aren't convincing, then this book isn't for you; it is disappointing and non-debunking.

The amount of books similar to the Da Vinci Hoax that have been published in an attempt to discredit Dan Brown's work is hardly suprising, as his views are against everything that the people of the world have been trained to believe. There are definetly truths in his views, however, and it would be good if people could just deal with the facts instead of blindly rejecting them before they have fully explored them. What if Jesus was married? All the people who have followed Christianity over the last two centuries have been living a lie. While that is hard to accept, it is obvious that the religious in our world need to have open minds, and stop trying to rob an author of money just because they cannot handle the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for what it is.","review":"It simply lays out the facts and rebutes the Da Vinci Code book.

I also remember catching it when I was in my twenties at the end of long night of drinking with friends. It wasn't so scary, but fun nontheless. When I watched it recently the DVD last week my initial opinion was that it was a horrible transfer to DVD. Cheesy Videos also released Day of the Triffids (which is a good monster plant movie and it too looked......ehhhh.) Insofar as the actual quality of the movie is concerned, the story is challenging (in the sense that it makes no sense), the acting is jaw-droppingly bad, and the ending is devoid of any excitement whatsoever. If you want to see a bad movie, there are a lot of them out there that I would choose before this (such as Madmen of Mendoras [aka, They Saved Hitler's Brain.]}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"Both of these films were extremely poorly made. The acting, directing, and technical work are all very bad. The VHS version I saw was of a very poor, grainy quality. Mamie Van Doren was a very sexy looking woman in her prime. However, neither film does her much justice. Not that Mamie could act....

They were both alive when these abominations were loosed on the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned: 'Cheesy Flicks' DVD is a blurry VHS-dupe style mess","review":"So I was all excited to see this, but this release from a bunch of clowns called 'Cheesy Flicks' is strictly public domain dreck at a premium price. On Alpha DVD at $5 this might be worthwhile, but not at $10 or whatever... unless you have to have it, like I guess I do. It looks like they just bought some graymarket version at a horror convention and just used that as a source print - colors are washed out, image blurry, VHS streaks... the works! Beware... take care!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raddi's Rating","review":"I have always loved these awful flicks being a horror movie lover since I was a kid. I had looked very forward to receiving this movie in the mail, but when I watched it, I was terribly let down. The color is washed out and the movie is just plain out blurry. I have a VHS tape of this movie that looks better. Thumbs down to \\"Cheesy Flicks\\". They should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such detestable quality work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I never understand why this movie gets such low ratings","review":"Even though it was made in the mid 60s, to me this movie as an above average example of a 50s monster movie (plus it's in color). The script is fairly literate, Anthony Eisley makes a stalwart, but not always right, leader of a group isolated on an island, and Walter Sande makes a great wise old doctor/scientist. Even Mamie van Doren plays her role of nurse pretty straight. The happenings have a mysterious quality about them that maintains tension. Admittedly, people wander off into danger perhaps a little too often, but hey, it's a thriller! And too much time is spent off the island with the higher commanders, who mostly seem to be acted by amateurs...Still, if you like 50s monster movies, I recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Movie - DVD looks Ruined by Monster Plant Acid","review":"Only thing that looks good is the cover art. Beware.Cheezy Flicks must hate monster plant movies. Their Day of the Triffids Disc was pathetic as well. Navy vs. Night Monsters is a fun monster flick from the mid-sixties well worth checking out, but the transfer is one of the worst and fuzziest I've ever seen and from a beat-up print to boot. Very disappointing (as was the Triffids release). I cannot believe the film was given such rotten treatment and looks like the plant monsters half devoured the movie. It's that bad!Gave 2 stars because I really have a soft spot for the film, but as was said by others, the VHS tape has much better quality than this wretched DVD.I hope a Man Eating Plant sprouts in the Cheezy Flicks Offices - Shame on you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geared more toward the professional.","review":"I got some hints out of the book but it is geared more toward the professional.

But rather than beginning with a cohesive introduction, development, and conclusion of the topic, it is a collection of research papers.It is geared towards health care professoinals who are frequently encountering people with hypermobility syndrome, rather than towards the affected medical patients themselves. There is an emphasis on describing JHS patients to help doctors recognize them, rather than suggesting treatments and hopeful recoveries.The vocabulary employed required me to have a dictionary at hand while reading this book.

However the skills covered are very relevant as master Kim provides insight and experience from a lifetime of Taekwondo practice.As a blackbelt I was able to glean plenty of wisdom, drills and strategies from watching this DVD.

We found ourselves lost for three hours in the center of Limerick searching for the hostels listed, only to find out they had all gone out of business. It also calls for bringing your own linens -- all hostels in Ireland now provide a blanket, sheets, and pillow. Pretty much the only linen under your own discretion is a towel.

I've used both this scent and the fresh ginger.The only downside to any Thymes product is the price. This is a premium product at a premium price. I buy my Thymes products on ebay and, even with shipping costs, I typically get it for $9-10 a bottle. I still think that is a bit high (half off) but I love the product and nothing works better.

There was no suspense as the villians were revealed in the first chapter. That being the case, one would expect a well crafted storyline, characterizations and sense of place to carry the burden. No such luck. The characterizations were one dimensional and irritating! The plotting and dialogue were erratic and extremely annoying. The only marginally admirable aspect of this entire book was the sense of place; Key West itself was the most engaging character in the book, although that's not saying much. If there's anything I hate more than wasting money on a book, it's wasting my precious reading time on a wall thumper such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery/Suspense-NO WAY","review":"I thought this was going to be a Romantic Suspense Novel, but what I read was Romance (i.e sex) and not much suspense, not even a really good plot. The Cops and PIs did not follow any of the accepted rules of investigation-follow the money, look for the paper trails. Sonnie is not a heroine I'd want to look at twice. This book left a lot to be desired, unless you enjoy reading about bed hopping. The ending was predictable, the characters two dimensional and no plot to keep me reading. Bad bad bad. Thank Goodness this was my first, and now my last book for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Stella Cameron Fan","review":"I am about 3/4 of the way through this book and debating aboutfinishing it. I found the writing to be confusing, as with otherreviewers I thought I kept skipping pages. Totally could not get into this heroine. I keep wanting to slap her, how stupid could one woman be. I too figured out ALL of the bad guys from the very first. This book was too obvious. Ms Cameron does reveal some of her villans quite early, but usually there are some twists and turns. I recommend you find some other romantic suspense to read, and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key West - a sad and mean story","review":"A disappointment. Although it has an attractive Key West setting and a potentially interesting plot, the story wandered and never made much sense. Overall the book has a rather nasty and unpleasant atmosphere, a result of the author's throwing in just about every rotten thing she could think of, including: the physical, sexual and psychological abuse of women, murder, arson, child abuse, kidnapping, drug and alcohol problems, infidelity, thievery, actual and implied violence, insanity, sexual perversion and torture, voyeurism, harrassment, extortion, legal and medical malpractice, homophobia, cruelty to animals, automobile accidents, physical disabilities, hurricane warnings, bar brawls, terrorists, the Mafia, you name it. Ugh! What's the point, and why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't plan on sleeping till the end!","review":"Sonnie and Chris have a lot of baggage but it makes the story tense from start to end. You fall in love with both of them. Sonnie is so brave and she doesn't lose her sense of humor even when she has to deal with people who want her out of the way. Chris is strong, but Sonnie makes him stronger while he gives her more courage. All the characters in the book are alive. Some of them you love and some you hate, but every one of them is interesting. I really like Roy and Bo--and the guys at the bar. Sonnie's sister is creepy!

Soon situations arise which leave Sonnie questioning her sanity or is something more sinister happening? Now it is even more urgent for Sonnie to discover the truth with Chris' help before they both lose their lives.WOW! KEY WEST is an action packed tale that is romantic suspense at its best. Stella Cameron transports the reader to steamy Key West then takes us in a roller coaster ride as we try to figure out what happened to Sonnie and who was responsible. We are also introduced to a secondary character and his \\"barbie mobile\\" whose story will be told in Glass Houses, a July 2000 release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time!","review":"I would give this book a negative if I could. It was without a doubt the worst book I have read. It started okay, but after the first chapter or two, it went downhill fast, and never redeemed itself.

But under no circumstances should anyone read this mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Suspense-Predictable","review":"I enjoy romantic suspense novels, but this doesn't really qualify. The guilty parties are revealed early in the book and the one plot twist is predictable. The romance between the main characters is not very believable, but the secondary characters at the bar are well-written. The sad thing about this book is that the reader wanted the secondary characters more fleshed out and the main character of Sonny to just go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Not only was this book boring, I found it extremely difficult to read. The paragraph structure has the reader jumping from one thought to another in every sentence.

He approaches the subject with even-handedness and without agenda. In the Utah Historical Quarterly, Sondra Jones accused Peterson of being too biased in favor of Black Hawk at the expense of Brigham Young. On the contrary, Peterson shows Young to be a well-meaning, but flawed human being. He points out the relative level of peace that Young was able to maintain in Utah (when compared with other territories at that time) and does not shield the reader from the atrocious violence perpetrated by Mormons, gentiles, or Indians. This will be the standard for scholarship on the Black Hawk War for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read 4 those interested in American West history...","review":"A fascinating read, especially for people with ties to Utah and for members of the LDS Church. How unfortunate that this story has remained largely untold until now. There were sections that could have used more solid references.

Tremendous demands are made on the viewer: unless you know a great deal about the Wonderland murders, you'll simply be on the wrong foot for virtually the entire film.Unfortunately, if you DO know something about the Wonderland murders, this film has little of interest to add.What's really great about this DVD, though, is not the film itself, but rather the feature-length documentary that comes on the second disk: \\"The Life and Times of Johnny Wadd.\\" This is so well done that it alone is worth the price of admission: it will tell you all you ever wanted to know about not only John Holmes, but the Wonderland murders as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and Confusing Look at Graphic Murder Case","review":"I had read a few things about this bizarre case before seeing the film but \\"Wonderland\\" basically goes nowhere fast. The story is presented in two versions - neither of which make a lot of sense. This is an ugly story of drugs, sex, and blackmail that revolves around the totally unattractive but well-endowed porn king John Holmes (Kilmer, in a dizzying performance). The supporting players range from a tattooed and over-the-top Dylan McDermott to Josh Lucas and Eric Bogosian doing their standard sleazy guy routine. The best performance in the film belongs to an uncharacterically subdued Lisa Kudrow as Holmes' suffering wife. This film reminds me of Al Pacino's ugly \\"Cruising\\" and it is'nt better."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Boogienights...don't be fooled...","review":"This film tries way too hard to be cool but ends up luke-warm.It truly does not succeed on any level. John Holmes is the \\"star\\" of the film, but he is the least interesting and most two-dimensional character here. I did not find myself engaged in the story or caring about any of these characters. An attempt at tension or dramatic suspense just fizzled for me.What is of interest here are the extras on the DVD, including an unbelievably graphic and grisly crime scene video. Now that was engaging... There is also an interview with Dawn Schiller, Holmes' then teenage girlfriend. Even though she seems to be cashing in on her connection to the story, it is always interesting to hear from the real people.Forgettable as a film -- somewhat intriguing as true crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Plodding and Uncertain, It's Bad on Many Levels","review":"Val Kilmer plays a drugged-out, bottomed-out John Holmes in this loose retelling of 1981's brutal Wonderland murder case. In presenting a number of competing perspectives on what exactly led to the killings, including several mildly different interpretations of the same scene, the idea is to leave ultimate judgment to the audience. Instead, the lack of conviction just results in a hazy, jumbled, inconclusive mess of rumor and uncertainty. Kilmer is miscast as the shady, self-serving loser at the end of his rope, and keeps trying to turn on the charisma when he should be cowering and sniveling. His big-name supporting cast only produces similarly phoned in performances, while a glut of gimmicky after-effects gives the whole picture the kind of sparkly, overproduced sheen that's usually reserved for car commercials. A drab, ambiguous, morally-vacant jumble that rides its barely-famous subjects' coat tails for as long as it can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but no big deal ....","review":"OK so the movie pushes the concept of Holmes and his fame as the premier porn actor but that's not what you are going to get... What you do get is his sordid and very very sad drugged out life story presented to the viewer in almost a dyslexic and disjointed late night news program ....Out of respect for Val's acting skills I gave the movie 2 rather than the 1 star it so justly deserved ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"a complete understanding of John's life","review":"The movie is good, not great.However, if you want to understand and inform yourself about John Holmes,this two-disc set is great.The second disc is a documentary that explains John's life through interviews with the people that knew him (manager,wives,co-workers,etc.).It is extremely interesting and honest.It runs close to two hours.I suggest watching this disc first and then the movie.Otherwise, you see only the Wonderland murders part of his life in the movie and not the whole picture.One of the special features on the first disc is the actual police crime scene footage of the murder scene.It is lengthy and quite gruesome.I am surprized that this was released for public viewing.This set runs for about five hours and if you are interested in the life of John Holmes,this DVD is superbly informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few Actors Better At Real Life Roles Than Kilmer","review":"Though \\"Wonderland\\" has its flaws...I am a sucker for period pieces and I will say this is a superb movie..mainly due to the strong performances of Bosworth, McDermott(I dare you to identify him w/o help), Kudrow, Lucas, others and of course Kilmer...This guy plays real life roles better than anyone!! The story of the gruesome, and they are gruesome Wonderland murders is told in Rashomon style but this movie grabs you and doesn't let you go...Superb music from the late 70's and early 80's as well..if you also look hard enough you'll notice a cameo by filthy rich princess Paris Hilton...This movie was very underrated in its theatrical release but now it should get its due on DVD...buy the DVD...you get like 5 hours of total footage..including a very graphic LAPD crime tape...very graphic...The Johnny Wadd Documentary...which is priceless..Deleted Scenes..Trailers..Interviews....Commentary..man it's got it all...check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I love this movie! Val Kilmer is so good as a strung-out junkie and the rest of the cast performs just as well. The plot of the movie is shown from at least 3 different perspectives over the course of the movie, with the end result being a beautiful tapestry of drugs, sex, betrayal, and murder. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING DVD Set!","review":"This DVD set is great. I had seen the movie \\"Wonderland\\" when it was in theatres back in Oct. but the release of this two DVD set with all the extras like the LAPD crime scene video and the documentary WADD:The Life and Times of John C. Holmes has tremendously enhanced an already great movie!Great job Lions Gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Look At Johnny Wadd!","review":"This movie is a look at the life of John C. Holmes after hisstar had lost it's luster in the world of porn.During the 1970'sand 1980's Holmes was called a legend in the world of porn.Thismovie shows his cocaine addiction and the unflattering state of his life.The star who demanded and got paid top dollar for hisstarring roles in porno movie had become a deadbeat dopehead.Hewas keeping the company of thugs who had a strong desire fornarcotics.This group robs a notorious hoodlum named Eddie Nash.Holmes helps Eddie Nash break into the living quarters of thegroup that committed the killing.Holmes is tried for murder andfound not guilty.He died of aids in 1988.This was an interestingtale on the Wonderland murders.John Holmes was not the king of porn in this movie.The role of hid wife was also well played.Watch this movie.It is very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderland","review":"This DVD came with a bonus DVD.

I love how the director does both sides of the story of one if LA's most notorious murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you get the 2-disc set!!!!","review":"There are two different releases of this out there. One is the movie (with, I think, a few extras) on one disc; the other is a two-disc set which includes the documentary \\"Wadd: The Life & Times of John C. Holmes\\". Watch the documentary FIRST, as \\"Wonderland\\" will make a lot more sense and be ten times more enjoyable if you do. That said, \\"Wonderland\\" is a fantastic, gritty film that I can count as one of my all-time favorites! Val Kilmer is so good as porn star John Holmes, you won't believe it. Lisa Kudrow, Kate Bosworth, Dylan McDermott, and EVERYONE in the cast is outstanding! Watch for a cameo by Paris Hilton as well. Everyone chews the scenery in this realistic film that went unnoticed in theatres but is becoming a cult classic thanks to the magic of DVD! I can't recommend it any more highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent End to an Impressive Trilogy","review":"I am sad to finish this trilogy, as I've enjoyed my time with the Vaidens over the past few weeks.The trilogy began before the Civil War and continued through to the first post-reconstruction generation. Watching the South fall, rise, and fall again, all through the perspective of one family, was interesting.

The load times are horrible and you cannot download roster updates or the system will frequently freeze. The game is fun and I would like for EA to release an update to fix all of their bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as actually playing","review":"this is a great game by EA sports. some of the only problems of the game are the fact that it doesn't have any rookies from the draft, so teams like Chicago don't have Patrick Kane or Jonathan Toews. also, playing in the all-star or superstar mode can be very frustrating. a simple bump by another player can cause you to lose the puck, but it is not reciprocal. you end up having lopsided shots on goal (one game i had 18 shots to my opponents 72!!) and very few minutes on the attack. my advice is to play in pro setting and change the game settings to more difficult. this gives it a more balanced game.other than that, there is very little to complain about. the graphics, gameplay, sound, and AI are all incredible. this is a must for any hockey purist or hockey fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, one of the best CD's EVER!","review":"Ever since I got this CD, I haven't been able to stop lisneting.

For anyone who apprieciates good music and a good time, I definitly recomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have of any collection of great recordings","review":"Judy at the top of her form. A wonderful variety of songs, done to perfection. If you do not know about this singer, this is THE recording to hear and to have. When Garland was good, there was none better, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go To My Head","review":"I can't add any superlatives that haven't already been said. This is a must-have recording. I just want to correct a bit of misinformation concerning Judy \\"messing up\\" the lyrics to \\"You Go To My Head\\". The so-called flubbing of a line of the original lyric (\\"I forgot the goldurn words\\") was not a mistake at all but an intentional bit of show biz \\"shtick\\" Judy was fond of repeating when she performed this song. It was like other apparent bits of \\"spontaneous\\" stage business that were actually planned or scripted in advance (like the kicking off of her shoes before sitting down and singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\" on the lip of the stage) and was probably intended as a sly commentary on Porter's wordsmithing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful CD","review":"The CD is a recording of the songs in the play The Beautiful Game. It follows a Catholic boys soccor team in 1969 Ireland. The story has wonderful songs with lots of excitement surrounding a winning season of soccor and the turmoil of the day. The lyrics on the company songs are a bit hard to understand and the dialect is sometimes different, but the CD is wonderful! The album jacket can help with the storyline and it is well worth the effort. I highly recommend this CD,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Show with Amazing Music","review":"I saw this show in London firsthand. The music amazed me with its beautiful sound and message. I thought the show could run for years, but unfortunately, it closed rather quickly. However, the music is still available and I encourage one to purchase this wonderful soundtrack, you will NOT regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off His Game","review":"Even Andrew Lloyd Webber's lesser shows have an occasional song that is sweetly beautiful (even the rather dull Aspects of Love and the disjointed Whistle Down the Wind) but Beautiful Game seems to be lacking in even one song to grab on to. The lyrics by Ben Elton are pedestrian at best and far too repetitious (perhaps he was spurned on by the music). The performers themselves seem to be quite able, if not particularly distinctive. It does not seem the work of someone who has spent over three decades in the theatre. Lloyd Webber seems completely out of his territory with this material and only very briefly in the song If This is What We're Fighting For does the correct note of passion creep in but by then it is far too little and far too late as the listener's attention will have drifted by then. One can admire the composer's attempt to try new things but this should have been stopped before it reached this stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product, great price","review":"not a lot of $ for a great set of bits! got them fast and they work just as good as bits costing three times as much. im impressed. and u will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price on a set!!","review":"Been searching for these for some time, particularly the longer depths/widths and am very pleased with these bits!

The band tries to attempt \\"bugglegum punk-pop\\" but fails miserably. Basically, the singe can't sing and the songwritting is on the same level of a bunch of 13 year olds in garage rock band. If it wasn't for a great manager these guys wouldn't be anything. Check out bands like Bowling for Soup, Simple Plan, and Sr-71 if you want some real good pop-punk.

After reading the (auto)biographies of such wrestlers as Lou Thesz, Freddie Blassie, Roddy Piper, and larry zbyszko, i felt downright cheated by Bruno's lack of honesty as to the real workings of Professional Wrestling. When events in his book have been documented in other books with an entirely different approach (breaking of the wrestling omerta - called kayfabe) - either Bruno refuses to admit to the reader that decisions were pre-determined - or that wrestlers cut themselves for blood - or perhaps he has convinced himself that things never happened to him - in that case he needs psychiatric help.

I admit to minoring in history in college, with a focus on British history, but I've learned all kinds of information that I never fully understood before. (The author also has a PhD from Oxford.)

Worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Amanda Foreman is a star. She has written a perfect biography of a woman whose story captures the spirit of an age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up half way through.","review":"Even though I am a big fan of historical fiction and non-fiction, I could not get through this book. Too much politics. Not enough romance. My consolation was watching the movie, which took up far less of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Biography, Disastrous Life","review":"18th Century is not my favorite period in the history... Georgiana is not the type of person whom I respect and admire...

Full of tid-bits of the ups and downs of her life and times. Excellent for research into this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I have to say that I watched the movie before picking up the book but the portrayal of the Duchess in the film was but a taste of what you get from reading the book.She lead such a interesting and complicated life that it definitely would have been difficult in choosing what to add/exclude from the feature film.The book was very politically heavy and even though it didn't really detract from the story,some of the passages tended to be long winded and a little dry.There was almost too much detail in some of the explanations about political parties and relationships and how they worked.I myself was more captivated by the passages that highlighted her personal home life such as the birth of her children and relationships with her immediate family/friends/husband.I also found the added personal correspondence of the Duchess to the various people to be an insight into who she was as a person and an added bonus to the narrative.Overall an interesting and recommended read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Biography from the 18th Century","review":"Amanda Foreman wrote that she became obsessed with Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, during the course of her research. Her obsession is understandable; the Duchess was and remains a compelling, dynamic, multi-faceted, tormented woman who was able to ignore convention and engage in \\"masculine\\" activities, all in her own style. Ms. Foreman does the Duchess justice by recounting her story in such a captivating manner.The caveat is that you find yourself emotionally invested in the Duchess' life and react to her triumphs and tragedies as if they were your own. If nothing else, you take away not only a deep regard for this woman, but also an understanding of the consequences of the choices we make daily. The Duchess of Devonshire inspires me to step through my own fears and risk failure and success."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored out of my mind....","review":"Normally I love biographies and anything historical. I bought this book after seeing the movie, The Duchess. I was fascinated after seeing the movie and wanted to learn more about this woman. However, the book was wordy and my mind kept drifting. It was like being in school and reading a boring history book. I really did make an effort to get through it, but after the third chapter I put it away. It just didn't hold my attention. I'm giving it two stars for the illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Duchess","review":"The item was in excellent condition and arrived quickly.

A truly remarkable biography about a truly remarkable person. Georgianna and her posse make Steve Rubell's posse look like pikers. I mean. Running up $6 million in gambling debts! If she were alive today she would be trailed by the paparazzi. Her life reads like a recent Vanity Fair profile.And how in the world were all the correspondences saved?So good, I bought Tom Jones for another perspective on 18th century English dissipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"you might not like her, but you'll root for her","review":"I am currently obsessed with Jane Austen, came across a glowing review of \\"Georgiana: Duchess...\\" in the New Yorker, and couldn't resist reading this story of Regency England. Unlike Austen's heroines, the Duchess has a very dark side - she's a gambler, adulteress, liar, drug addict...I found myself wanting her to be happy (and to win against the evil Bess) in spite of (or because of?) these qualities. In the end, her charisma, beauty, fashion, gentleness, vulnerability, wit, privilege, and political engagement endear her.I loved the book, the story, the characters, the history, and the politics. Unlike some other reviewers, I found Foreman's writing incredibly engaging and easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating portrayal of a spirited woman","review":"Foreman really draws the reader into the interesting life of Georgiana, one of the most influential women in 18thC society. This is a very well-written portrait and makes for great reading. It contained a bit more about the politics of the time than is of interest to me, but for those interested in such things I imagine all of that was entirely riveting. I was most interested in Georgiana the woman and what motivated her, and here Foreman did not disappoint. An excellent biography and an eye-opening look in to the 18th Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to know about Georgiana and her personal life, about the events in her life and her history.. but what I found here was mostly her associations with Politics.

I wish there were other biographies of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Camera!","review":"I've had this camera since 2006. I've used it for all my work. It paid for itself in 2007.

Customers have asked me how I get the colors so beautiful. I tell them that it is the camera's ccd sensor. It is too bad that they are not continuing their Pro Line of cameras. The Fuji S5 Pro was the last model. But, this camera is still operating and giving me fantastic images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie? No. Great fun?

As far as campy fun for those of us from South Dakota, there are some serious nostalgia factors in play.Without giving all the locations away, let's just say if you are familiar with the northern Black Hills you will recognize several spots.

This same theme needs further expansion and I hope the filmmaker continues in this direction. Although it could be more expensive and polished, besides being a documentary with a broad significance and unique subjects, it is done artfully and has a mesmerizing effect. I'd like to see a long series on these subjects from the same filmamker.A+ for Unique, well-organized and well-researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconherent","review":"A melange of mumbo-jumbo that is esentially unwatchable and unbearably boring. Adds little or nothing to our understanding of the Unabomber or the emergence of the internet. In addition, this film does not provide captions or subtitles when English is spoken, and this may be a major deterrent for viewers who rely on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Reference Book.","review":"This is not a story, but rather a collection of very short stories on each of the American presidents. Every author is a member of the Society of American Historians, and each chapter is written by a different author. These micro-bios average only 5 pages. The second half of the book is filled with transcripts of important speeches, including Inaugural Addresses, and much is devoted to campaign memorabilia. The book then is more of a handy (albeit limited) reference work, most suited to coffee-table duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby loves it, I loved it","review":"While you can't expect a book to cover every aspect of a person's life, especially a president, this book really put forth a lot. It's addictive, really holds your interest. My husband keeps it by the bed and reads bits and pieces every night. He just loves learning about the presidents and his view is that this was a great Christmas present. There are lots of pages, nice quality, good cover, lots of information and tid-bits you probably didn't know!If you wanted to give this as a gift, I would say totally go for it! It's impressive in size and the cool cover looks good on the coffee table. Five stars! Now if I could just get more time with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"While the bulk of the book is spectacular (the essays about each of the 43 presidents written in an almost poetic but informative style) the product itself was manufactured improperly.

Sameness does not equal trance. What we have hear is what 90's raver kids are now creating that they are \\"adults\\" - moribundly repetitive loops without style or soul.

This does not compare to the previous excellent albums, which had quality feel good tunes and excellent mixes.

I've put around 100 miles on it so far, and it seems to be just fine. It came with a master link, which is a plus for me because it can be a pain to connect a chain using a normal link. Seems strong and well made for the cost. I would definitely buy another.Update:I bought a second chain to compliment the first. I alternate them every 3-4 weeks on the bike, to keep one clean and ready to ride. Between the two I have a little over 4,000 miles on them. The older one has just stretched enough to need replacing. I am very satisfied with it. The only problem is that the second chain didn't come with a master link, so that's done double duty.

I could understand the wrong picture being posted with the item description and have seen it before. I order a considerable amount of bike parts mailorder and this is the first time that I have ever seen only the picture used and the item information and description ignored. I returned the item and received a refund of $7.44. Returning the item USPS First Class was just a little less than $4, so combined with the original $6.69 shipping, this fiasco cost me about $3.

The tiny pocket would only fit a license and maybe 2 keys. However, it was comfortable, the head cut out was the perfect height, and there was a clip on the inside to attach to the dog's collar.

Take medication if you need to. Personally, I have found a strict Paleo diet to be helpful. It works so well that I hardly ever need medication. Every now and then you are bound to slip up, either accidentally or just because you give into a severe craving. When that happens, I need meds to get me back on track.

Lorrie has such a pure distinct voice that it's a shame she is without a doubt one of the most underrated country singers of all time. Sammy also has such a distinct voice and I find the two are able to pull off an amazing duet. So good, that a CD chocked full of duets was no problem for these two. 'He Drinks Tequila' obviously steals the album as far as the 'fun & fast' song goes while 'I Finally Found Someone' holds the 'slow ballad' of sorts top spot. Other lead songs include 3 Seconds, 29 Again, Sad City, Big Time, & Sugar. Overall, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars simply because Sammy's voice seems to be lacking in a few of the solo songs.

I originally spent years looking for a copy of the O Hotline, finding it in a used bookstore. It captivated me. I didn't want it to end and when it did, I thought it clipped off a little too quickly.Having said that, its easily a five star and it is the science fiction novel that all others will be judged against.

The actual condition of the book was satisfactory and the price was good and shipping was timely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very compelling well-written collection of stories","review":"The main characters of Walbert's book are colorful, refreshing and very imaginable. A continuous flow of descriptive metaphors keeps the reader yearning for more. I very much enjoyed her carefully woven stories of Marion, intertwined with both humor and sadness- a combination that captures Walbert's sensitive thoughtful style of writing. She is a very talented writer. I'm looking forward to reading her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chasm . . .

The content is good as I was looking for a book on this subject. It just feels like an editor didnt do his job properly.

The result is some pretty poor quality recordings.

It covers mostly basic self-defense, however there are some rather dire moves that you would only use if someone were about to try to kill you. Not sounding too basic now, is it? I loved the Taijutsu section and the historical references. I didn't like the weapons section very much; I think they missed something in refusing to put in the Katana swords and Shuko climbing claws. For these (particularly the Katana) I recommend Mr. Hayes' other book, The Mystic Arts of the Ninja."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!!","review":"There has to be something better out there.

It's definitely a lot easier to use this seat in a car with just a lap belt, but it can be used with a shoulder belt with a little time, patience, and a locking clip. We have been able to get a tight fit of the seat to the car, and our daughter to the seat. I wouldn't use this as an everyday or long distance car seat, but that's just because it isn't as comfortable as, say, a Graco or a Britax - there are no side walls for a child to lean against and sleep/rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work -- but a good idea","review":"I bought two of these for use at my mom's house in another state to prevent me from lugging our regular seats on the plane, etc. Seemed like such a great idea for short-term, occassional use! However, in practice, my daughter (4.5yrs and scrapping the top of the weight allowance) found the straps too tight (with no extra to let out) and the shoulder straps too close together, causing irritation to her neck (and she's rather on the skinny side).

I struggled for long periods of time and finally decided it just didn't deliver the ease and convenience from the desciption.

The eyecups twist out and are very convienient. The dioptor adjustment is on the right eyepiece and is a ring and not easily bumped out of focus like many models that let you turn the entire eyepiece. They offer a surprisingly good picture at this price point. Better than the equivalent Steiner's in my opinion with more user friendly features.

Thus, the question arises of how the authors know what is best. What is best in diagnostic instrumentation is what is most reliable.Conventionally, the reliability of a diagnostic instrument is determined by measuring its false negative and false positive error probabilities. However, this mechanism is not available in this case, for ISI violates an axiom of probability theory (see \\"Erratic Measure,\\" in NDE for the Energy Industry 1995. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, NY.) Then how do the authors know the reliability?This reviewer gathers that, when ISI was developed, its developers assumed probability theory. With this assumption false, the work's recommendations are invalidated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Carmichael Fans","review":"Here is a fantastic collection for any who appreciate one of the very greatest musician/composers this country has produced.

Michael Joseph Lisner's striking art, incomparable symbolism and dialogue, provocative enough to startle, enhance the epic. Darrian Ashoka lives in a surrealistic New York City where the lower class is left to its plundering and filth by an elitist church who have moved to the city's outskirts. During a weekly Saturday night riot, Darrian is approached by Dawn, an enigmatic feminine deity, who invades his bed and provokes his intellect. On their next meeting, Dawn gives him Lucifer's Halo, remaining from his days as an angel. It is a dangerous bridge between Heaven and Hell and Darrian soon finds himself hounded by both sides in a bid for it. Darrian's fight to keep his gift is one of fright, confusion and reckoning. He must overcome fear and anger towards the other side and look deeply into his human soul for strength, truth and the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonics Revealed","review":"David Hamblin's style is very accessible in this complicated branch of Astrology.

If you want to learn this technique and understand it, without loosing in depth, this book is a very good place to start. I really liked it. Lots of case studies to play with, lots of interesting observations on the mathematical nature of the chart, on aspects and even on the application of harmonics to synastry.As a former physicist and mathematician, I love harmonics as this branch of astrology feels very pure and very close to the essence of things...are numeric patterns the underlying language of life?

The tracks range from huanting to ethereal to heart-pounding, bringing back many familiar themes from the Fellowship soundtrack while adding a few more, such as a theme for the Rohirrim, laden ith \\"the sadness of mortal men\\" and the spinetingling theme of the ever-creepy Gollum. The music is a beautiful realization of Middle Earth and the creatures and culture that abide there, from Elves to Men to the Detestible Orcs of Mordor. Sweeping string passages, floating choral melodies, and pounding brass fanfares all contribute to the epic and breathtaking journey that is this CD.

However, through listening to the entire cd, attentively, I have realised and have also noticed by reading other people's reviews that the soundtrack is missing, in my opinion, the most touching and emotional song played during the film. That song would be the song that is played when the Ents were marching to Isengard.And also it seems that the soundtrack is missing another song, which is played while the Ents were with war with Isengard, when they released the Dam and flooded Isengard, but I could be wrong because I don't remember the song from the film too well."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive marketing","review":"the music like the movie lacks the sheer magic of the first movie and its music.i am most disappointed in the package labelling, which refers to \\"this CD...\\" but then says, \\"Plus enhanced CD also contains...\\".

One gets a feeling of potential for yet another Great-America Hollywood flick. This book reminded me of the movie Behind Enemy Lines and came at a time when Chinese president's aircraft was found being planted with American satellite-operated spying devices during its modification in Texas.

The opening six tracks are excellent and display John at top form. Much better than the \\"Live in NYC\\" concert recorded years later. But, and its a big but, why did John let Yoko open her trap?!? She ruins what could have been a perfect live experience by insisting on trying to sing.

But you know the best part is coming when John tells the audience, \\"Now, Yoko's gonna do her thing all over you.\\"Yoko breaks into some incredible abstract vocalizations and the musicians do a fine job of creating an atmosphere in which her voice can thrive! Ater I heard this album the first time, I decided that Eric Clapton must be way more cool than I ever thought if he can do such a fine job performing in Yoko's band!This CD is a must for those fans who are really into John & Yoko performing together.

The idea that so many people enjoy Yoko's awful noise is beyond me. Any animal in that much pain should be put out of its misery.

The rookies are better in '08, especially the second rounders that weren't even worth drafting in the previous versions.

His account of the 2000 presidential election controversy is as exciting and absorbing as any fictional thriller by a best-selling author. He presents both sides of the story with remarkable balance: the Bush team's decisive, if ruthless (even vicious) actions; the Gore team's paralyzing ineptitude and bad luck. Toobin infuses the story with compelling human drama and makes the complex legal issues crystal clear. In an updated epilogue, Toobin reflects on the popularity of President Bush in light of the September 11th terrorist attacks, and on the implications of the media recounts in the wake of the election."},{"rating":"1","title":"total bias","review":"I can't believe that he claims to be fair to both sides in this book.

I think not!! People have a responsibility to learn how to vote. I thought this book was pretty stupid and very biased towards making the republicans out to be a bunch of crooks. I also don't believe Blacks were stopped at checkpoints to be prevented from voting.

I wish I'd had the benefit of the earlier reviewer's remarks--I'd have saved a few bucks and enjoyed a trashy mystery instead. Toobin's research is shoddy and he clearly began this polemic with the premise that \\"Gore Won\\" and worked backward from there. There are many factual errors, many opinions presented as facts, and much that appears to be taken directly from DNC talking points. Very disappointing since Toobin's prior work has been pretty informative and entertaining. This is a stale story anyway. If you must read it, pick it up on the remainder shelf where it will be shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased writeup of history...","review":"This could have been a much more interesting book had the author presented a much more balanced view; instead he chose to present everything that the Republicans did with negative connotations, and never challenged the facile reasons the Democrats came up with for their actions. His end of the book demonstrates the conclusion that the author wanted to come up with, and so the information in the previous chapters was selected to try and drive readers to the same conclusion, versus presenting all view points."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Liberal Temper Tantrum","review":"This book is a shameless diatribe to make liberals feel better about losing. Toobins's analysis ranges from heavily biased to outright lying. Facts don't seem to concern Mr. Toobin.

If you want a true account of the democrats dirty tricks and a balanced account to this drivel by Toobin read Bill Sammons' account of what really happened. I can't even in my worst imagination what a disaster it would have been to have Gore as president. One glaring error was that Buchanan \\"mismarked\\" votes were mistakes. Completely overlooking that Buchanan had won almost the same amount in the previous presidential run. The real culprits beginning this stunt was the Florida Supreme Court who intervened (illegaly) without being asked to and tried to swing the vote to Gore.

Unfortunately, from the very start of the book, Mr. Toobin's raging bias in favor of Mr. Gore ruins the presentation of his thesis and the facts supporting his conclusions. Where the facts are not favorable to Mr. Gore (and the author), they are conveniently omitted or made irrelevant.Mr. Toobin's book will surely appeal to die-hard supporters of Mr. Gore and partisans of the liberal left in America. Sadly, readers seeking the truth will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst of the lot","review":"I had high hopes for this author and was sorely disappointed. Though the writing is fresh and compelling, Toobin makes no news and, more important, reveals his bias from the first page to the last.

In the final analysis, Toobin's work is a disappointment because of its final analysis - that \\". . . in any real, moral and democratic sense, Al Gore should have been declared the victor over George W. Bush - in the popular vote, in Florida, and in the Electoral College.\\"It's disappointing because Toobin surely knows that the national popular vote is irrelevant in presidential elections. Were the popular vote the deciding factor then both candidates would have conducted their campaigns far differently. Yes, it appears that a good number of likely Gore supporters voted wrong; so what? There is no perfect election. There were undoubtedly errors in other Florida counties, in other states. In the final analysis, if Al Gore had just managed to carry his home state of Tennessee, he wouldn't have even needed to win Florida."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toobin is a democratic political hack","review":"This book is blatant democratic propoganda.

In the end, however, I was disappointed by his inability to present an unbiased account of what happened. Toobin does an exceptionally poor job of hiding his bias and makes his conclusion, that Bush somehow \\"stole\\" the election from the more deserving Gore, crystal clear. In so doing, he glosses over some of the very questionable tactics employed by Gore and his operatives in their attempt to generate more votes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This book is very expensive for what it is - basically a picture book without much real information."},{"rating":"2","title":"great overview","review":"This is an interesting book with information about the most famous liner shipwrecks--makes for wanting to read more about them.

Fried uses Diderot and other eighteen century art critics' writing to understand how the beholder of paintings is positioned. He uses an abundance of paintings (reproduced in good quality black and white) and citations of art criticism to show the ways in which painted characters ignore the beholder, first by being absorbed in quiet activities, and later in self-abandonment. While the beholder is clearly set apart from the represented world in history paintings, Diderot also writes about entering landscape paintings, stepping inside the world.I found the book very readable and thought-provoking, and relevant to far more than just eighteenth century French art.

I read this book when I was very sick and it was a very poor choice to say the least. I found her writing style thick with euphemisms, abrstractions, and other vague notions. Very little is mentioned about the man Eliot himself! What a ridiculous concept for a biography. She includes far too many segments of his poetry that only make sense in context. She spews them all over the book and leaves the reader wondering aloud, \\"Say what?\\". Though this book has a marvelous, intriguing cover it has nothing but blurry accounts of the man, T.S. Eliot. Find another biographer and you will be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagiography","review":"This is not a biography, but a hagiography. Others have noted that it seems more about his work than his life. There is probably a good reason for that. For a corrective, see Carole Seymour-Jones, Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot. This gives us a better idea of what Eliot was like. I find it hard to understand that a book published in 1998 as this was is so terrified that Eliot was a homosexual. The portrait she paints of his idyllic marriage to Valerie Fletcher is hilarious--a 68 year old famous man finds \\"love\\" for the first time with a 30 year old who worships him. Well, it takes all kinds. Perhaps this author does not believe that gays can \\"love\\" one another. This book does not even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of awful","review":"The biographer is so obsessed with Eliot's enigmatic inner state that she forgets to mention the things that happened to him during his life. Gordon speaks of Eliot's desire to enlist in WWI without ever explaining why; she never mentions his attitude toward World War II; she doesn't say that he was expelled from high school, what he majored in at college, what his income was during his years of fame, what kind of contact he kept in with his family and how they thought of him later in his life, what kind of contions he liked to write under in the early years, why he put so many allusions in his poetry if he disdained allusion-hunting. On the other hand, we do get excruciatingly detailed biographies of women like Emily Hale, Mary Trevelyan, and Vivienne Haighwood. The book tries to bore into Eliot's psyche and present all of his poetry as autobiographical, despite the damage done to readings of both the life and the poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Addition To My UTV","review":"This installation was straight forward, although the pointed end of a pry bar was needed to line up the bolt holes.

Orlo Miller (The Donnellys Must Die - 1962)and Ray Fazakas (The Donnelly Album - 1977) have both done a creditable job of portraying the events and the participants. Any student of history is encouraged to read the latter two books rather than either of Kelley's. Using the accurate maps, descriptions and many photos in The Donnelly Album I was able to locate virtually all of the major sites of the conflict.

Two very worthwhile books are available, both well researched and as accurate as the situation and politics of the area permit. \\"The Donnelly Album\\" by Ray Fazakas is highly recommended as it contains innumerable period photos of the Donnellys and the area around Lucan. \\"The Donnellys Must Die\\" by Orlo Miller is a well researched and balanced account of the whole situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally innacurate","review":"I first read this book in grade ten English class and I still cannot believe they would make us read a book that was loaded with historical inaccuracies.

Unfortunately, most of Canada's knowledge comes from these two books. If you are at all interested in the Donnellys, I urge you to read the books by Orlo Miller and the plays by James Reaney.

Even the sex scenes do not exemply bittner's level of writing and tenderness. \\"The first time you have sex you hurt like hell but you keep having sex and it gets better\\". Having a baby \\"is like the first time u have sex....it hurts like hell\\"......What kind of dialogue is this? What a waste.

I couldn't keep my eyes open trying to read this book. For anyone who thinks on their own from time to time, this book contains chapter after torturous chapter of common sense information, spelling out the most fundamental ideas over painful lengths of text.

I can't say enough good things about it.The sound? Think Psychocandy. Super-cool attitude, feedback-heavy, with a subtle surf-music vibe at times. And unlike other CDs that have been compared to Psychocandy (like, say Flying Saucer Attack or something), this CD is more than just feedback. It actually Rocks!! And has good songs!!And although this could almost be a collection of Psychocandy B-sides (sounding more so than anything off Barbed Wire Kisses), The Raveonettes aren't just copying one of the best CDs of all time. There's more to them than just that aspect, and the music is definitely their own.This is the first CD I've heard in years that gave me that \\"OH MY GOD I\\"M IN LOVE WITH THIS CD\\" feeling. I thought I'd never get that feeling back. I definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they kidding?","review":"This is the biggest joke of an album i have ever heard. if you are one of those individuals who has a huge cd collection that you never listen to, this one will fit into it perfectly, otherwise dont waste the time. if it was possible i would slap each member of the band for making this junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"$8.99 I'll never get back....","review":"I bought this cd on a whim one night at Wal-Mart at like 3 in the morning. Now being the music lover I am, I try to at least give a cd a chance. I tried and I tried and I tried with this cd. It's one of the worst cds I've ever heard in my life. I've never heard such boring, depresing, stuck in the middle of a desert with vultures picking at your skull type music in my life. There was nothing to this music and every song sounded exactly alike. The Ravonettes are one of the WORST bands I've heard in my whole life. I pitty them.... really... I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for each of the songs I liked","review":"I bought this CD knowing what to expect: A mini album with very similar songs in the same tone. I was a little dissapointed after finally hearing it. Don't get me wrong, this is a very original group with a very distinctive sound and I respect any group who will go out and try something new, but this album really didn't move me. Hell, it didn't really even touch me. I bought it after hearing Attack of the Ghost Riders because it is a great and original song, but everything after, with the exception of Beat City, is quite dull. Beat City is a great song which actually gets this cd going. Unfortunately, that kick is at the very end of the cd. I really think they have the potential to make a great cd, they just need to make a longer cd with a little more diversity. I will give them credit in being original and for the two great songs on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"This is an irritating CD for a couple of reasons. Many of the songs have what sounds like a pretty cool guitar riff, but it gets buried in all the muddy lo-fi noise. The songs are sung in an emotionless monotone with some effect that makes them sound disembodied. If one song were done this way, it might be effective, but the entire CD drones on, each song sounding pretty much like the previous one. I think there are some decent songs here that would be entertaining done by another band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vibes are all it has going for it","review":"You only need to look at the title of the song \\"Attack of the Ghost Riders\\" to know what you're in for. As that song title would suggest, this album has a campy, 50s teen slasher flick feel to it. You can almost see the supernatural antagonist riding off into the night on a motorcycle, looking to cause some chaos. Unfortunately, that vibe is all this album has going for it. Most of the songs sound the same, and almost all of them are skip-worrthy. Beat City is good, and Attack of the Ghost Riders is almost memorable, but you'll forget everything else the moment the stereo turns off. This band has good ideas, they just haven't completely developed them yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive, boring, and unimaginative","review":"wow. this whole album sounds the same through every song.monotonous doesn't even begin to describe the unchanging and anoying structure of every single song. i just saw them live opening for the strokes. every song is \\"sung\\" in a monotone boring drone and EVERY song they played live sounded exactly the same. they are the type of band that gives garage rock a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin","review":"This Danish duo won Best Rock Album of the Year at the Danish Music Awards in 2003. Although the new \\"Chain Gang of Love\\" is an equally awesome full-length follow up to \\"Whip It On,\\" I could not obtain a copy to review.An interesting side note about the recording of \\"Whip It On\\": all the songs were recorded in Bb minor, use no more than three chords, and each song is under three minutes.The Raveonettes sound is, according to guitarist Sune Rose Wagner, \\"...The primal single beat of The Cramps, the noisiness and dark feeling of the 80s, Buddy Holly and the simplicity of the 50s...\\"The vocals are excrutiatingly slow, drowsy and monotonous while twangy guitars climb to a crescendo that could make your ears bleed, especially in \\"Cops on Our Tail.\\"\\"Attack of the Ghost Riders\\" sets the release off with a bang as \\"that sultry 60s sound\\" leaves one thinking of go-go dancing.Call me crazy, but I can see Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs) using some of these songs in his next masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best group since Blonde Redhead!!!","review":"On the recommendation of a Built To Spill fan in Aarhus last year, I became a fan of Sune's former band, Psyched Up Janis. I think The Raveonettes will be huge internationally, from Denmark to North America to Japan, far surpassing the success of Psyched Up Janis, because the pairing of Sharin and Sune's vocals make Raveonettes irresistable. Surely anyone who likes Blonde Redhead, Breeders and Sonic Youth will love this band. They have energy, sing in tune, look great and really rock. This is my favorite CD of 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Seuss Pops Up","review":"Love that the book is interactive and the essence of Dr Seuss books.

I certainly expected something better for the price. If an fm transmitter is your only option, look for something less expensive so you won't feel like you've wasted a bunch of money. Be sure to check out all your options...there are a bunch of direct connect kits coming out at reasonable prices...check out circuit city for a couple of models for $100 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"After all the mags saying this thing was the best.

Ipod freq's manufacturers, Sonnet, must have paid the reviewers to give a favorable report. It doesn't compare to the itrip that has its own problems, but better than the podfreq. The podfreq is a freak. Stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappoinment","review":"Did not work with my car FM at all and even when 12 inches from my Home Stereo FM antenna I mostly static.

Very satisfied with the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as advertised","review":"I have an older model iPod, and I wanted something that would let me listen to it in both cars, one of which does not have a cassette player. The Podfreq is very simple to use and works well. I have not had any issues with track skipping or noise.In an urban area, it is hard to find a frequency that never has bleed-over reception from an area radio station, but it never interrupts for more than a second. Only on a few occasions to I have to move the Podfreq to point directly at the car's antenna.The charger plugs into the cigarette lighter, so power is not a problem. It was a good purchase, and works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing Since Sliced Bread!","review":"This is a great device and certainly a lot cheaper than the automotive adapter kits at $300!

To this day, I'm still puzzled why this album didn't get the fame it should have received, even though it spawned three hit singles (You Won't See Me Cry, Give It Up, Flesh & Blood). I continue to listen to Wilson Phillip's music because it's a unique sound that is not only stapled in pop music but will, most likely, never be heard again. This CD is very worth the purchase. Each song is worth more than what was credited. This album did go platinum back in '92, so it's not a failure but compared to their self titled debut, it could have gone much farther than what it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilson Phillips' sophomore effort","review":"Although the tracks on this album are good,it didn't spawn as many hits as Wilson Phillips' 1990 self-titled debut.

The only songs actually worth a listen to are You won't see me cry (though the passing of time hasn't been kind to it) and Flesh and Blood (a song written by the Wendy and Carnie where they pour their heart and soul out in a song meant to reach into their father's heart). The other songs are so boring that they're not even worth mentioning. Wilson Phillips tried to show more maturity in this album, but that's a point that should've been done on the songs themselves and not with the pretty pictures of the girls that are on the booklet. I give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeper, more mature album both lyriclly and musically.","review":"When I first heard Wilson Phillips' \\"Hold On\\" I had no idea who they were but I really liked the song. When I found out who their parents are, I realized it all made sense. Their first CD was great. This one takes the trio in a whole new direction. The songs deal with more personal issues, including family rifts. It shows that they are more than pretty faces with pretty voices. I wished it had done better commercially because there are some killer songs. \\"You Won't See Me Cry\\" is a great hook filled song. \\"Flesh and Blood\\" is a deeply personal, well-written song with their trademark sterling harmonies. \\"It's Only Life\\" also is great. Their voices blend superbly. Take a chance and listen to it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good and very well done","review":"I have this CD and to hear it is to really appreciate how well these 3young ladies vocalize so well together.Neither one of them try to overpower theother wih their singing, it's just thatthey each have their own unique abilityto sing in their own way and that's whatmakes this a really good CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant survey","review":"Janet Lynn Roseman's interviews are an essential look at the living history of dance and will be valued by fans, students, practitioners, and scholars in the years to come.

I am disasppointed to see that he has fallen 'under the spell' of this corrupt administration and is spinning his views along with the other Clinton lapdogs.Shame on you, Mr. Toobin for not mentioning BOTH of the Clinton's lying, or their misused and disrespect of the WHITE HOUSE.

Obviously, those Starr apologists haven't looked at this masterpiece, which believe me, spares nobody, including the POTUS.What the book does for the first time however, is shine a spotlight on Starr's woefully inept OIC, and recount the many errors that he and staff acculumated, as they bungled their way through impeachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, an evenhanded acount","review":"Although it seems there are many Clinton detractors who have posted reviews of this book, apparently without having read it, I found the book fascinating. First off, the account is extremely evenhanded. Jeffrey Toobin is a very talented journalist and has used those skills tounearth the real story behind the Clinton impeachment. Neither side is spared and I guess that is what irks some. Clinton is shown as the weasel he is and his avowed enemies are shown as the zealots they are. The truly interesting thing is how the whole chain of events could have derailed at so many junctures and yet never did. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comprehensive account of a modern day tragedy","review":"Jeffrey Toobin takes the public ordeal that was the Lewinsky affair and weaves it into a first rate political thriller. He never takes sides, never politicizes, and reserves his judgment in everything except the introduction. I couldn't help reading this and comparing the entire affair, investigation, and impeachment to a Shakespearean tragedy. If it wasn't for a series of bad judgments, a few nefarious villains (on both sides), and just dumb luck this entire story would never had occupied a year of our lives.

They trashed and flamed Toobin. This shows his dedication to objectivity and truth.This book is for the millions of us who have resented the denigration of the First Family and the harm to the presidency accomplished by wingnuts over the past several years.Buy it.

Their review is understandable since they were major conspirators in the leaks of Ken Starr, since their writer Jeff Gerth is a complete tool of the right wing.I guess I was naive to expect a fair review.Mr Toobin tells us the facts as those of us who have really searched legal web sites and the works of Gene Lyons and Joe Conason have long known them to be. The right wing attempted to overthrow an elected President. They did so without regard for him and withourt regard for the American people who elected him. These people had no regard for our Constitution or for our Democracy. They gladly destabalized our country, the financial markets, and, to an extent, the whole world for their own ends.

I did not find a single new fact in it on this sordid chapter in our history. Mr.Toobin swallows wholesale the spin of Clinton defenders, and passes it off as his own reporting, providing NO footnotes or attributions. He also, obviously, has stolen whole passages left and right from Uncovering Clinton, the definitive book on this subject written by the journalist Michael Isikoff. Yet, Mr. Toobin has the audacity to portray Mr. Isikoff--an objective reporter who painstakingly detailed his sourcing and ethical struggles in covering the story--in a negative light.

At the very least he provides good color commentary on well-known events (although his section on the actual impeachment trial obviously has the fewest original sources or revelations), and most of the way he actually succeeds in uncovering and making sense of the legal machinations of the Jones lawyers and Starr's office...And where Conason and Lyon bend over backwards to sound objective (at the cost of the humor that dotted Lyon's earlier book), Toobin is happy to greet an especially juicy example of pompousness or hypocrisy (usually Starr's) with a good zinger...END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book ever but in the top ten","review":"There should be a zero star rating - this would certainly get it. This is not the worst book ever written on a political subject but it ranks as one of the most lapdoggy treatments of a significant part of our history. It may not have been written in the White House but it looks like they approved the drafts - even with that it still raises some significant issues about the President's behavior.

Odd that a lawyer would support the notion that private behavior might qualify as contempt of court. This is the logical extension of his thinking but, not surprisingly, he doesn't follow it. If you hold to either of those positions, the other becomes untenable. Reminiscent of many Democratic Senators who fulminated about the personal nature of Clinton's crimes, yet supported censure. Why should congress be censuring Presidents for private behavior? Alas, the kneepad crowd wants to have it both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Toobin's thesis is interesting--that the conspiracy involved the left, the right, and the media, but he fails to develop it.

With this book he hits new lows.Even I, who tried to avoid as much of the Clinton situation as I could, spotted a half dozen or more outright falsehoods in his book as well as conclusion after conclusion which was supported by neither fact nor logic.This is a true work of utter, utter nonsense which only the most ardent (and close minded) Clinton supporter could actually believe. The \\"most powerful man in the world\\" is a victim.

I felt this book was written from news clips. I thought I was having a flashback of the news media. The book sounded like Clinton's lawyers. I hope someone makes a book called the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy because this book would fit. He fails to mention how Bill wanted Monica to tell Linda to lie in court. But in this book I felt the truth did not matter. (who paid him to write this book? Clinton's? )I made a mistake by buying this book and supporting the left-wing conspiracy. This book all-round was nothing but lies and distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"the vast conspiracy","review":"Toobin's insights into some of the \\"players\\" were interesting. Other than that, it was a re-run of everything we heard and saw during the whole dismal affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Apologist At Work","review":"Guess it was about time a Clinton Apologist writes about the \\"unfair\\" attack on Clinton. Save yourself the money, do not buy this book, just go read the Washington Post and New York Times in your public library, to hear their apologies and you will get Toobin's angle as well. Clinton continues to lead the nation with his trickle-down-immorality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isikoff's book is better","review":"There's really nothing factually new here we haven't read before....which means the thrust of this book is Toobin's spin on it all. Frankly, that does not make for interesting reading and it's definitely not enough to carry an entire book. As you can tell from the other reviews, your own personal opinion on Bill Clinton will determine how you veiw this book - love Bill, love the book; hate Bill, hate the book. Still, I imagine even the Bill lovers tired 2/3 the way through this book.I think Michael Isikoff's \\"Uncovering Clinton\\" is a far better book for getting a handle on the whole Lewinsky affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is still too high a rating","review":"There he goes again. In his book, Toobin continues on with the same worn-out excuses to cover Bill Clinton's contempt for the law. The mainstream press will adore this book because it is full of the same propaganda they fed us for fourteen months during Monicagate, but it makes for lousy history. If you are looking at buying this book, I would recommend you spend your money on a good novel or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic witch hunting","review":"Toobin concludes that Paula Jones lied about being sexually harrassed, Ken Starr lied to the Justice Department about his connections to the Jones case, and that Linda Tripp, Kathleen Willey, Lucianne Goldberg, Gennifer Flowers, Michael Isikoff, and virtually all the rest of the President's accusors and tormentors lied, schemed and manipulated.Yet this book is primarily a moralistic diatribe against Big Bad Bubba for how he tried to fight back. Like almost all the rest of his media colleagues, Toobin's bottom line is that even if you've been falsely accused, ya gotta confess all your sins.Isn't this the classic ruse of witch hunters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinton's Good Friend Writes About Clinton","review":"Toobin has admitted he's good friends with Bill Clinton. Be honest with yourself, how biased would you be if you wrote about a good friend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Spin - No news","review":"\\"A Vast Conspriacy\\" is a boring resusitation of the so-called facts, i.e., spin put out by the Lanny Davis's and Jimes Carville's of the world. Clinton and his wife appear to be nothing more than passive players in this melodrama. Nothing is said regarding his outlandish claims of privilege, not knowing the meaning of alone, or is, or oral sex. Neither is anything said in regards to Clinton's management of his defense and what role if any was played by Hillary. This book is an embarrassment. Nor does it address Clinton's propensity to lie and his near total reliance on focus groups to determine positons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Spin\\" Job","review":"Toobin chooses to print the lies endorsed by Clinton supporters instead of the truth. Even a quick review of the facts of the case show the flaws in this book. Toobin is a man who served briefly in a U.S. Attorney's office and stole grand jury documents from Independent Counsel Walsh's office when he worked there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent writer !","review":"Although I didn't learn anything major new in this book about the sex scandal, I enjoy Jeffrey's writing style. He is even-handed to everyone involved in this sordid tale, an excellent writer. Highly recommend his book on OJ Simpson !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof","review":"There is a very easy way to see if this book is biased for or against Clinton: Check the facts. Toobin even misquotes Clinton's own words in his testimony! I lost count of all the lies in this book. One thing for sure though, after all the Clinton controversy has died down, Toobin will be remembered as a corrupt \\"reporter.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"When I got to page 100, I was convinced this book was not unbiased. Toobin made Clinton a victim. It was a disappointment to read. I only wished I had waited a couple more weeks to purchase this book as it is now selling for half of what I paid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vast Malarky","review":"I found this book to be a dreary rehash of the legal briefs and excuses of Clinton's vast coterie of apologists. I did not find a single new fact in it on this sordid chapter in our history. Mr.Toobin swallows wholesale the spin of Clinton defenders, and passes it off as his own reporting, providing NO footnotes or attributions. He also, obviously, has stolen whole passages left and right from Uncovering Clinton, the definitive book on this subject written by the journalist Michael Isikoff. Yet, Mr. Toobin has the audacity to portray Mr. Isikoff--an objective reporter who painstakingly detailed his sourcing and ethical struggles in covering the story--in a negative light. This is an appalling piece of pseduo-journalism that deserves quick oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I reluctantly revise my previous review","review":"As comprehensive as it is, this book has already been revealed to contain several errors, one regarding Isikoff's journalistic practices, another (big one) regarding whether Lewinsky asked Tripp to lie. (Toobins says she didn't; the evidence suggests the opposite.)And there may be more corrections coming.This can still be a great book if the errors are addressed, but I advise readers to wait for a corrected future edition to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lanny Davis Part Two","review":"This book is a waste of your time. There is next to no new information in it and every sentence is laden with Mr. Toobin's bias. Jeffrey Toobin is/was a lawyer and yet he fails to see that it is plain wrong for the highest legal officer in the land to lie.Sex is the name of Tooin's game and by focusing on the trash he totally misses the bigger, more imptant issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lapdog","review":"Toobin is obviously another lapdog for the left. Anyone who thinks Clinton was the 'good guy' in all this is obviously part of the 'left-wing conspiracy' -- you know the one that has most of the media controled opinions/reporting in favor of poor, poor abused Bill. You know, the one that has people like Toobin who works for a liberal newspaper and news agency (ABC). I'd like to see an investigation in the voting records of America's media elite that pretend to be non-biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calumny by Proxy","review":"A tar and feathers piece with pretentions by a James Carville wanna-be dressed in an academic gown instead of the customary sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"What this clown calls a 'vast right wing conspiracy' is, in reality, 'the opposition'. When Mr. Zipper attributed the OK City bombing to right wing talk radio, he earned every diatribe ever thrown at him times a million."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange...","review":"This is a strange and eerie book. The ideas are quite creative. It's believable because of the regular events the characters go through. Recently, I read up on H.P.

My only complaint is \\"Holiday\\"......to commercial for me. If the brother can heat a live show up, he\\"s gonna win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana Black Is Shining Through","review":"The rapper's growling voice is music to the ears of hip-hop fans who have grown tired of the contrived anger that has taken hold of successful West Coast artists and the arrogance that rules East Coast players. A roaring audience is mixed in with bone-chilling, gothic synthesizers while Santana Black's gruff vocals howl double time as his beat eggs him on in what sounds like a battle to reclaim his soul. The lyrics are explicit but tempered to a delightfully dirty dance driven by lean, groove-laden instrumentation. What makes Santana Black seem less like a rap commodity for the music industry to package and sell is his strong tie to the North and South. I give it 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Ill Mil silent secret","review":"This artist is very overwhelming. He delivers hard hitting flows that cut like a knife. His beats are astonishing and his wittiness shows on every song.After several listens this gets better and better every rip. SB has a way he relAYS THOSE superman rymes.

We were so enchanted by seeing all 16 of the kids snuffling flowers, growling, counting fish and yawning, that we decided to get both this book and the equally entertaining 'Hide and Seek with Leo', in the hope that they might work their magic with our little one at home as well. And they certainly do!! The story is a bit short for our daughter's liking ('read it again, read it again!' etc. - once is never enough!) but the puppet really brings it all to life. It's the only kid's book we've found so far that is read every day several times, with no sign of boredom yet! We hope the Weares bring out some more titles in the series, as I'm sure they'll be a hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited capability","review":"I was hopeful the Targus Hub would be able to handle a keyboard, wireless mouse and speakers, but the hub is not capable of keeping up with signals.

Lion","review":"Even though it says it will work with Mac OSX 10.4 and newer, that apparently only applied to 10.4-10.6. So Targus is now selling Hubs that won't work with Lion or Mt. Lion, the former having been out for over a year. I can understand not being able to support all operating systems, but if you can't support the current version, you shouldn't be selling it. I bought two of these and now can't use them at all. Shame on Targus for continuing to sell products that won't work with OS's that are over a year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading - doesn't support USB audio","review":"As a USB hub this is great, however the description and packaging are misleading. I was looking for a a hub that had built in sound. Despite what the description says, this is not what you get. It comes with a cord to plug the hub into your speaker and microphone ports on the computer, then you plug your speakers and microphones into the hub. Not sure exactly what problem that solves. I was hoping to have only one cord to plug/unplug when I wanted to take my laptop and go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good USB hub, short lifespan","review":"While it works, this USB hub is great. However, my first one died within the first month of use. Once it was replaced by Amazon.com, it lasted 4 months. It seems that the culprit is the A/C adapter because when the hub dies no lights turn on at all. USB hubs are meant to last more than a couple of months specially since they don't usually move from the first place you put them at. Because of its short lifespan, I give this USB hub (Targus ACH81US) 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price of admission.","review":"I am very satisfied with this product, have had a few other inexpensive hubs and have never had one that worked perfect until now. At first I was quite skeptical because of price, now having purchased it I wish I would have just bought this in the first place instead of wasting my time and money on the cheap hubs. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect hub to do everything they need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just does not work","review":"I have bought two of these and they both did not work.

The testbed has been runningfor a few years and these hubs have been working great.I use them myself also. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat this hub","review":"I did a lot of research into the \\"best\\" USB hub, and the Targus consistently showed up at the top of the list. I agree. I purchased this for my wife who was having trouble with an unpowered hub not providing sufficient power to a backup hard drive and other devices. We plugged in the Targus, plugged in her USB devices, and all problems vanished. The unit is well designed and does all that is necessary. There are cheaper hubs, but since spending hours diagnosing USB problems is not something I care to do, the Targus represents money well spent. If you're having USB problems, an AC-powered hub is probably the solution, and the Targus is ideal. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB hub works, Power does not","review":"Along with the other reviewers here, I purchased this to charge/connect a few idevices and a blackberry (powered) and connect an external drive or two (non-powered).

I found the Belkin Hub to be extremely flaky. The mouse I had plugged into one the ports kept loosing it's connection so I had to constantly unplug and replug it. The power supply it came with was supposed to supply power to the unit for recharging devices such as cell phones and Ipods- yeah, right. Enter the Targus 7-port USB hub...After doing some research (fool me once....), I decided to go with the Targus hub. I can't say that this is the best hub on the market because I haven't tried them all. But I can tell you that I've had the Targus for over 3 weeks now and HAVE NEVER lost a connection. The hub's two powered ports (denoted by a lightening bolt) supply steady and consistent power to my cell phone and ipod. It takes all of 5 min to go from red batt status to full charge.If you're looking for a reasonably priced, solidly built usb hub, you can't go wrong with the this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAILED","review":"I bought this because it was supposed to be a higher power port and my old Belkin was shutting down about once a month. Well, the Targus shut down repeatedly in the first :30 minutes I plugged it in.

I have read just about everything in this field, as I will have a book to be released in the Spring of 2002 focusing mainly on this subject. This book, along with Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes is a wonderful introduction to the field. The stories provided much insights into how we let psychology impact our investment decisions, most often in detrimental ways.

By 1985, THAT band had apparently been driven insane by their inexplicable lack of commercial success and decided to make a desperate stab at pop radio with this album. Although I can tolerate a few of these songs now that I'm old, the album as a whole is just flat out terrible and embarrassing. I am bewildered by all the rave reviews here, but even pop garbage has its fans. Unfortunately for Saxon, though, their fans in 1985 strongly disagreed with this new direction, and their prestige, along with the status they had managed to gain among metalheads, went in the trash for the next ten years.

It was great hearing all of the albums again with exception of this one and Destiny. This was my least favorite one,of course with Destiny coming a close second. It's not bad when you're listening to the first couple of tracks but as I went further I realized that all of the tracks kinda blend together. Also I found the production of it to be pretty flat. Honestly there is nothing that really stands out for me on this album. If you're looking for some good classic Saxon I definetly recommend picking up The Carrere Years and not to bother with this one or the EMI years all together. Well maybe except for Rock the Nations, I have always had a liking for that one for some reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Excuse for Metal fans!","review":"Saxon's no excuse was one of the best they madeduring the 80's.

Think of the argument in it.Put it into the cold words of everyday.The doctrine is simply this: that the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg sacrificed their lives to the cause of self-determination -- that government of the people, by the people, for the people, should not perish from the earth.It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue.The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought *against* self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\\"--"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 pages of perfection","review":"Two pages of perfection.

He crafts novels that, if they aren't of the highest quality, will at the very least keep you on the edge of your seat. \\"Bite\\" is no exception.

Suspenseful, sexy, scary, with believable characters and a plot so intelligently drawn one can't stay away from the novel.

Being that it was the first of his books I'd read I kept a very open mind. The first 100 pages or so were very good and after that I let myself be pulled along by the story. Really feeling that all of this inconsequential stuff was building up to something. By the last 10 pages I was thoroughly disappointed by this story thinking, \\"What's the point he's trying to make.\\" There wasn't even a climax to this story. Maybe all these folks are right. Maybe Laymon usually is a great writer but in my opinion \\"BITE\\" is a waste of 370 pieces of good paper. I give it one star simply for the effort he gives at seeing this story through. I'll eventually give Laymon another shot. But not anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a vampire book?????","review":"I was very dissappointed in my first read of Richard Laymon.Was this suppose to be about a vampire? Just because there was one in the trunk does not qualify this as a vampire book. I had high hopes as I kept reading waiting for the main characters to get down to business and stop lusting after each other. I wasn't feeling sorry for Cat as a battered wife. And Sam was alittle too whimpy. This one went into the trash as soon as I was done. I wouldn't dare pass this one on to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"BITE (much as I was hoping otherwise) pretty much bites","review":"I was really looking forward to reading BITE after hearing about other Richard Laymon books that are mostly out of print (or simply unavailable) in the US. The writing is rather sophomoric, and the plot is red-herring-ridden. OK, I'll admit I was surprised a couple of times, but only because of what I'd heard about Laymon's other books. I was only expecting surprises that turned out not to be there. Based on what I've heard from friends, I'll probably read other Laymon titles as they become available, but I can't recommend BITE, especially to a first-time Laymon reader. Like me. I know this genre well, and this novel could be used as an argument that the genre is simply, well, weak. And it's not.

A great way to spend a few hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"'Bite' is about the worst book I have ever read. From the first page, the narrator is a pathetic wimp of a man, willing to do *anything* just to be near his long-lost love. The supposed bad guy is a joke, and the multiple misfortunes that happen to the lead characters get boring and unsuspenseful. I didn't even bother to finish this book. If this is indicative of Laymon's talent, Stephen King is a poor judge and should be ashamed to praise this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gory good time","review":"Bite is one of those guilty pleasures, a book you pretty much figure you shouldn't be liking but once you let go of your prejudices and let the story take over, it's like a mad roller-coaster ride into the nasty places of the human mind. Briefly, boy meets old flame who needs him to kill a vampire for her. He does, and they spend the rest of the novel trying to get rid of the body. It's a horror novel, though not one that will scare you much, it's a road trip of the weirdest sort, and it's a comedy that is irresistibly spiteful, skirting the sharp edges of madness. This is not Stephen King, folks, this is the guy who runs the museum full of two-headed sheep and stuffed jackalopes. For lovers of flim-flam, the strange and the absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"For readers of Dark Suspense not Vampire Novels","review":"What can I say? I liked it alot. I am not a big fan of vampire stories (barring the rare exception) so it didn't bother me that vampires existed more in the abstract than the actual. I enjoyed much of the difficulties that the characters went through.Amidst the darkness there is humor.Shows a genuine warmth for the main characters, Sam and Cat, who are flawed but interesting. Richard Laymon also shows a good flair for dialogue. I was fascinated throughout. The ending may frustrate some but I like how it turned out. Will definitely read more. Despite what Kirkus Review says.Porno-violence?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Laymon: electric pace, strong characters & storyline","review":"Bite is a fine example of Richard Laymon's unique writing ability. Like many of his later novels, such as Island, Body Rides and Savage, the story starts at a fast pace, and continues without showing any signs of slowing. Although it may sound cliched, Laymon's books truly are unpudownable. Bite is a terrific variation on the vampire scenario, and succeeds with aplomb at being both original and great fun. It is worth reading for the ending alone! In short, although not Laymon's best book, it demonstrates the strength of Laymon's immense and underrated talent, and should be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're in for a roller-coaster ride with this one","review":"If you haven't read a Richard Laymon book, then I strongly recommend you snatch up every title you can find -- you're missing out. Don't know which one to read first? BITE would be a great place to start.This book demonstrates Laymon's range perfectly with a constant mix of horror, humour, action and sex. And it's an orignial twist on the old vampire genre which keeps you guessing right up until the end. Laymon has a real knack of creating 3-dimensional characters which everyone can relate to. And from page one you want these people to survive.If you want a truly entertaining page-turner, go buy BITE -- you will not be disappointed. You will also want to work your way through everything else Laymon has written...just like I have. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional novel by an exceptional author.","review":"Those that are familiar with Richard Laymon's work know that his style is gritty, fast paced and pulls no punches. This novel is no exception. The writing is tight. The storyline is unlike anything I have ever read. Laymon continues to top himself with each novel he writes. I originally bought this book as a British import and am thrilled to see that it is finally being published in the US. I hope that American audiences give Richard Laymon the attention he so richly deserves. I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting and shocking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bite a classic from THE BEST horror author","review":"Bite is an action packed thriller from one of the masters of modern horror. Anyone who likes Steven King or Dean Koontz and who may not have caught Laymon yet will love his writing style. If Bite is your first Laymon then you will be left wanting more. Buy this book you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was a horrible book!","review":"What a ludicrous plot: Sam's ex-girlfriend, someone he hasn't seen in 10 years, shows up on his doorstep one night in a bathrobe and tells him she needs him to come kill a vampire. He drops everything with hardly a question asked, goes to her house, kills the so-called vampire, and then for some reason they take a road trip with the dead man in the trunk of the car. They want to bury him away from where they live, you see, so they just go off on this jaunt . . . and run into the most macabre set of characters you're ever encountered in fiction. The ex-girlfriend, Cat, is supposed to be the love of Sam's life, but she came across as a disgusting, self-centered, exhibitionistic tramp. The ONLY reason I kept reading this book was because I kept hoping that Sam would WAKE UP and see how horrible she was and dump her in the desert. I enjoyed this author's \\"One Rainy Night\\", but as far as \\"Bite\\" goes, it was aptly named!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreadful Laymon Book","review":"I hated this book. I've read a few other Laymon books that I really enjoyed, such as \\"Island,\\" \\"Traveling Vampire Show,\\" \\"Night in the Lonesome October,\\" and even the \\"Beast House\\" books. I understand Laymon's style and know that he often treads the line between dreadful writing and inspired lunacy. This book is just purely dreadful. It goes nowhere, the characters are horribly annoying, and the story is just dumb. Definitely a misfire from Laymon here. I feel bad for anybody here whose first exposure to Richard Laymon is through this book. Believe me, there are much better Laymon books out there! To anybody who read BITE as their first Laymon book and who now swears they are done with Richard Laymon, I urge you to at least read \\"Island\\" before writing the guy off. He has penned some hugely entertaining books. Unfortunately, BITE is not one of them. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"Although the book kept me reading it was only because I wanted to get rid of it as quickly as possible. The horror and terror in the book are minimal, and the chracters are simple and rather one-dimensional. Some of the twists and turns are interesting, but if you are looking for a good vampire thriller, or chilling horror story look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and tiresome","review":"I agree with Emeric1's review.

As other reviewers have already said, the main character was a pathetic loser. I wanted things to go badly for him.The dialogue was atrocious nonsense.The plot was all over the place and filled with unrealistic nonsense (great books make you believe you shouldn't have to try).The only reason I am reviewing this, is to save someone else from wasting half a day of their precious lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Principles of Feng Shui","review":"For anyone who truly wants to learn feng shui, this is the book to begin with. Master Sang is world renown in the feng shui world and China's most highly regarded Master. My interest in FS began after purchasing several of the many 'new age' feng shui books that have saturated the market. The 'cures' just did not resonate with me. And, they didn't work! I consider myself most fortunate to have found Master Sang's book and Institute. True, it is complex and, yes, it is a life-long study, but if you want to learn the REAL feng Shui, this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but info is not organized well","review":"The strength of this book is that it describes fairly well external features in the environment and how they affect the feng shui of the house. However this only covers eight mansion style, not flying star feng shui. The weakness of the book is that the information is not organized well and is confusing to decipher, especially if it is the first feng shui book you read. When so many other excellent books on compass feng shui are currently on the market there's little reason to consider getting this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow collection of notes","review":"It is obvious that the book is a collection of material that was done for classroom teachings.

Svecnoi is a mile away. It must've been Stolyarnyi (Raskol'nikov's place), and neither place is lenghty enough to have #63 or to be called a street.

It seemed to drive me relentlessly onto the next page and then the next....While certainly, some of the facts aren't truly historical or necessarily accurate, that doesn't really affect the nature of the story. This book isn't concerned with being totally accurate in the details. It is the voyage that Dostoevsky makes internally from his initial knowledge of his step-sons death to his ability to release all the emotions, pain, fears etc associated with it.This is about Dostoevsky (and maybe authors in general). It isnt about \\"the facts.\\"Anyway, I thought it was great.

It does not have as much information as what is expected. It cost too much for the little information it has. If this book cost me $20.00 I still would have been disappointed but not as much, the saying \\"you get what you pay for\\" does not stand true for this book. It has many pictures but none of the house plants I own. You will wonder why it cost so much. It's a good book if you know nothing about house plants and want to spend alot of money. After I got this book I got The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual, it has more info in it. Encyclopaedia of House Plants is really not worth the money. I would feel guilty if is sold this book for or around the price that it is going for. I would really feel like I was ripping someone off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piano at it's best","review":"I have been a piano student for quite a long time, and this album has renewed my enthusiasm for this fantastic instrument. The technical portions of these studies are extremely difficult, yet Maria Corley performs them with tremendous fluidity and skill. Yet, as any student of music knows, it's not technical prowess which allows a piece to transcend its classification and become legendary - it's an underlying sensitivity and beaty. Here this album delivers! I delight in different portions of the album every time I listen to it. This will be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"Maria Corley plays Adams' Etudes with an interpretation that gets to the core of these studies. This is a recording that stays with you; I must have played it some three dozen times so far, and each time I discovered new elements. The work is so concentrated with energy and myriad of details that it's almost too much to take in at once. Corley's technique is really great; she has both power and tenderness in her touch--which is always at a high artistic level. I give this recording 5 stars +. \\"Bravo!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a SLOW Cooker -TOO HOT, TOO FAST","review":"This product should be in a category all by itself, FAST COOKER! It cooks too fast and burns your food. The exterior gets too hot and has the potential to cause burns to anybody that touches it. I've owned it now for over two years and have learned you cannot \\"set it and forget it\\". Don't think you can start it before you leave for work and come home to a delicious meal, you can't!

Since then I have used it a handful of times and only once did it produce what I would consider to be quality food. It typically overcooks and dries food out. Just this week I put together a crock pot egg bake recipe and left it overnight on low, the 10 hour setting. I checked it at 8 hours (knowing that it typically cooks faster) and the food outside was completely burnt, completely ruining the dish as every bite had the same burnt taste. My mother actually has the same crockpot and has had similar experiences, just recently it overcooked her twice baked mashed potatoes, again burning around the edges and drying everything else out. The only reason I'm writing a review is that I'm on Amazon trying to find another crock pot and found this one in my search results. I just threw mine away. It's a complete waste of money and I will not be buying another Rival crock pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect product if it was called a fast cooker","review":"If you use high you might burn down your house.

I bought this model a couple of months ago to replace an older model. I thought by purchasing the original \\"CrockPot\\" I would be getting the best slow cooker on the market. I am sorry to say the quality really seems to have gone down considerably compared to my model from ten years ago. After only a few uses the outside of the stoneware insert began crazing. Now the paint is almost completely crazed on the entire stone crock. The outside of this model also gets very hot, even on the warm setting. I am pleased with the way it cooks but will probably purchase a different brand next time due to the poor quality of Rival's product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns Everything!","review":"I finally got rid of this crock pot, as did my sister-in-law.

I agree with other reviewers that it gets too hot too fast, and tends to overcook food.But that is not my main concern. For me, the biggest problem with this crock pot is that the metal exterior of the pot gets extremely HOT. I mean untouchably hot. I suppose this is the component that is meant to heat the ceramic insert. I have 2 small children, and on the rare times that I do use this pot, I have to put it in a far-away corner of my kitchen for fear that someone will get severly burned if they touch it.I am shopping for a new crock pot that is safer.

Ayuh; it sure is. Furthermore, the engineer who designed it missed the high school physics class where the teacher explained that heat rises! It appears that the heating elements surround the sides of the pot rather than underneath it. The result is that contents burn badly around the top of the pot.

Every recipe I have tried has ended up over done and burned around the edges. I have tried various recipes, meats, veggies and tried using the different time settings. Nothing seems to help! This product cooks way too hot! I thought maybe we received a faulty model where the thermostat is set too high, but after reading other people's experience I think it is just poorly designed.

Since Rival served us well the first time we bought this Crock Pot at a store...without checking the reviews here first.As others have said, this Crock Pot gets way too hot on low. I tried two different recipes and they both came out very overdone. Potatoes near the edge in a pot of scalloped potatoes came out black. I wrote to Rival's customer service about this but received no reply so I returned the pot to the store.Perhaps it is the more recently manufactured pots that have this problem - those that say it cooks fine have been using theirs for years.Avoid this slow cooker, at least until they iron out the problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot","review":"I was excited to get this beautiful crock pot last Christmas.

Some are great (like the discontinued bubble sleeve binders) and some are terrible (like the City Gear). This case has the absolute worst kind of sleeve. The ones with 1) slots that do not easily fit the CD booklets and 2) the slots with the most idiotic design ever invented: a plastic tab at the top that scratches CDs when put in or taken out of the slot.

My suggestion is to avoid this product, unless you really like getting your CDs scratched and scuffed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended!","review":"After put in 40 CDs, I notice it start to bend my CDs. Because the spine wasn't wide enough and all the sheets are stitched together at the middle, when I open it like a book and flip all sheets on one side, it start to bend CD from the edge. Also it's more difficult to insert a new CD into these bended sheets.As the CD pockets became very tight even only half loaded, I won't recommend it for anyone who will access their CDs often. Should be aware that the proper capacity of this product is around 60 CDs.

I'm not sure if I would want to swing it around by the handle but it seems sturdy enough to carry it from place to place with the handle. We put 316 discs into it, so it is essentially full as we have discs on all the pages and it closes and opens well. The zipper is a little harder to pull than when it was empty but so is the zipper on a pair of pants when you put them on rather than hanging on a hanger so that is nothing I would not expect.

The sheets hold DVD's or CD's just fine, but closing it can be a pain in the butt because the fabric doesn't easily align at the top-it tends to flop inwards. The exterior fabric is durable, but that's about it. Don't waste your money on this.

If you're not going to use all of the slots, I would recommend it, but if you planning on filling to capacity, I would check out some other solutions. I'm now looking at some options from Case Logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect mass media case","review":"I have filled this puppy up to capacity and i love it. Really good construction, durable, and the handle is really rugged but still aesthetically pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this case if you're looking to fill it to capacity","review":"At first this seems like a great CD/DVD case: the materials used are first class, the pages are soft, zipper zips smoothly. The only flaw is in the design construction of the pages. They basically stapled a 4-CD sheet in the middle to fold in half like a book. This becomes a problem when you fill all the slots to capacity. It's now too tight to lay flat and there isn't enough slack in the middle to close nicely. You can force it closed but you shouldn't have to! If they're going to bind the sheets to the spine this way there should be more space in the middle by the binding to give it more slack. It's kind of hard to explain but I hope you can understand. I ended up just filling it to 65 discs instead of 80 so it would close nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD/DVD holder","review":"I have purchased 2 of these over the last year and both work excellent.

I read the reviews before purchasing and thus decided to try for myself. Reviewer mentioned it was hard to open. It is but not enough to turn down. If you take care it opens easily enough. The huge capacity makes this case a winner. As far as scratching. No way. It has the felt inside which is as nice as I've seen them. The liners match up to any I've seen. The one negative is the outside could be leather. If your looking for the perfect dvd holder I'd look for a higher quality case like leather or similar. This is a nylon type thus the 4/5 stars. Finally, the holder is excellent making the purchase a good one. I'm not a person to toot my own purchases if its bad I'll tell ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sturdy enough","review":"this case looks fine and the sleeves are ok, but after i packed it with dvd's and picked it up, the handle came offon one side. now i have to hold it in my arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, good price","review":"Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for something as trivial as a CD book, but the only review thus far is from someone who gave this thing 1 star because they were confused as to how many CDs it holds.

Eegads people.That aside, I have 7 other cases and this one is better than most. Sturdy construction, top-loading instead of side (so DVDs don't slip out when you use the handle to carry it) ... not sure what other features make a product this simple worth 5 stars instead of 3 or 4.

The book is grounded in such simple Christian truths that are so often overlooked as we try to appear as though we have it altogether. A real call to authenticity that is so desperately needed in the church. May God raise up more of us in Mike's physical absence from this earth to carry this very true spiritual message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messy Spirituality is good . . . but not great","review":"As always, Yaconelli (like Brennan Manning and others) does a great job presenting the graciousness of the great God we serve. In his book, we are reminded time and time again of the Jesus who ministered to lost people, the blind, the lame, the social outcasts, prostitutes and the emotionally hurt. It is a challenge to every Christ-follower to mimic the love of Christ. I heard recently John Wesley encouraged people to preach 90% law and 10% grace. Now I am not jumping on that bandwagon, but the big thing about grace is it's real only if we understand our total depravity, guilt before a holy God, and eternal punishment if we do not accept the Savior's blood on our behalf. I wish Mike Yaconelli would have reminded us of those truths as well, and the true Gospel is both Law and Grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and too long","review":"The first 25% of the book strongly makes a good point that needs to be aired, repeatedly, today.The rest of the book reiterated the same point over and over and over and over. This isn't a long book, but it was way too long anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antinomianism at its finest!","review":"If you prefer mainstream Christian, feel-good books and not the truth of the Bible, then this book is for you.If you think Jesus was just kidding when He said \\"Be holy as I am holy,\\" then this book is for you (1 Peter 1:16).If you think John was a little off when he said, \\"If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth,\\" then this book is for you (1 John 1:6).If think holiness is just an option and not a requirement, then this book is for you.If you hold personal experience over the truth of the Bible, then this book is for you.However, if you believe that God saves us FROM our sin and not in our sin, if you believe God's grace is powerful enough to keep us from stumbling, if you believe that sin separates us and breaks the fellowship from God, if you believe that repentance is necessary for salvation (TURNING from all known sin), then do not read this book. Read the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Blasphemous","review":"I read this book as part of assigned reading for a class in Community Spiritual Formation and was very disgusted with it. It is the worst book I have ever read. My problem with the book is based on his total distortion of the plan of salvation provided by God through Jesus Christ. He glories in the imperfect and corruption of life and makes that the normal experience for the Christian. This is an example of the false theology produced when ones experience is the basis of truth. When the Bible is quoted is often twisted out of context. On other times is it intentionally misrepresented to support his false conclutions. The words, \\"I think\\" are used to often as support without any Biblical support. I hope no one will buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Everyone Who Calls Him/Herself Christian","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. In my opinion, if you don't \\"get it\\" (the real meaning of walking with and for Christ) after reading this book, you probably never will. Not only is the message 100% right on the mark, but the writing style is very inviting and compelling. I read it a second time immediately after reading it through the first time - I was just too disappointed it ended. Buy this book, it can revolutionize your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring, light, easy read...","review":"...a great book to leave by your favorite chair to pick up and read bits at a time. I loved the book. It reminds you that all of our lives here on earth can be \\"messy\\", but that God loves us through it all. Jesus spent most of his time with the downtrodden, the prostitute, the tax collector, the poor. At times, it's easy to feel you don't measure up.

The first chapter is a bit redundant but after that it gets much better. This book is great for helping you understand that you don't have to wait for the perfect time or until you're completely ready to pursue your spiritual life. It's very much about being non-judgemental about your own and other's path to God. I plan on passing it onto another friend because I think it is so helpful. I will give one warning - if you are a conservative Christian that really believes in following those \\"rules\\" that your denomination lays down you probably won't like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but unkind","review":"Entertaining, but not the way to live your life.

Letting God help us unravel the mess day by day is an adventure and a joy that comes from knowing we don't have to be perfect before we can seek the presence of God in our lives. Mike un-does and heals the damage inflicted by judgmental religious traditions and sets us free to experience the peace of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books about REAL Christianity out there!","review":"So frequently Christian books tell you what to do and how to be a better Christian. Not so with Messy Spirituality! This book tells it how it is, how Christians suffer and have stress and pain and life happens to us just like everyone else. However, Mike Yaconelli pulls it around to a place of awe and wonder by making it all worthwhile and meaningful in God's context. The language and stories he used filled me with wonder in our awesome, amazing, beyond understanding God."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"The sentiment behind this book is good, but Yaconelli's actual points could be addressed in one chapter. I think this would be more useful to someone who is new to the faith. On the other hand, this might not be so great for a new believer because Yaconelli at times comes close to simply condoning sinful behavior (though at other times clearly does not).

First, it is titled as a \\"complete course\\". It is not comprehensive, it is an overview of options trading strategies with a section on volatility. Second it is titled as \\"fundamentals\\". It is not fundamentals. It is an overview of options trading strategies using advanced terms that you are assumed to already know. If you don't understand the technical terms of trading options, you will be lost when you view this DVD. This DVD is simply the author setting up a video camera at one of his seminars and taping it. There is supposed to be a manual that goes with this, but to get it you have to download it from the author's website after providing all your contact information.

It seems like they just videoed one of those seminars put on around the country by the Options Industry Council. That said, this video is a BARGAIN at $13.Contrary to the title, I would not recommend this as a person's first introduction to options. He glosses over the intro stuff more like a refresher. I do a little retail option buying now and then so I know the basics and I ended up taking several pages of notes while watching this. It is a good intro to the Greeks.I found his coverage of bull call spreads very interesting. I knew about them but didn't know that time decay can be a benefit with them. I also got a solid understanding of Gamma and was surprised to hear that, unlike Delta, it decreases as an option gets further in the money.The way I see it, you invest a chunk of change trading options and if you learn one thing from this video it'll probably save you many times the $13."},{"rating":"2","title":"About damn time","review":"Been looking for this CD for a while (doesn't help that I only found the band earlier this year).

They apparently have 2 or 3 new albums out, but I haven't seen them anywhere. Listened to the preview for a few of the songs. Some of them were...out of character, to say the least. Others were awesome. I'd suggest most any song in this album, along with anything before it.On CD: Security label left some adhesive behind, still can't get it off. No biggie, just a bit annoying. The booklet inside the CD case has the lyrics for all of the songs that have lyrics, except for the bonus track, which is a remix by another good Japanese band, Boom Boom Satellites.

It really wraps up the story etc. The only problem was the ending was left really wide open. I have Music In The Night too, and when I noticed that it was about Laura and not Melody, I was dissapointed. Not that I mind. It's just that if they had continued on the Logan Series with what happens with Cary and May and Melody, or with one of Melody's kids, that would have been really neat.

One being that the book has been translated wonderfully. You have to understand that languages cannot be exactly translated. Two is the one picture showing U.S. Special Forces and SAS is not a mistake, if you read carefully, you'll notice two individuals kneeling and another in a prone position. Those two are SAS in 'civvies' (undercover) assisting the American operators.The book provides excellent photographs for all of those who want a superb display of the tactical gear worn by the various Coalition Forces operating in Afghanistan.

I used it for a week on a recent trip, wearing it for 6-10 hours each day and it was amazingly uncomfortable. For a while I let one of my travel associates carry it and after two hours they gave it back!In any case, I do not recommend this bag if you plan on having three professional lenses and a camera body.

This bag is comfortable, spacious, easily accessible, has quiet easy zippers, and if you are a woman, the way it straps across your chest isn't bad. I am petite and it fits me. The lighter colored interior, the safety strap, the microfiber camera cover, and the rain protection make it even better.

This idea appealed to me and I think it is a good one for the smaller versions, but I have 13lb of camera gear to haul and it is simply too heavy for the single strap idea, even with the waist belt in use. This would be a perfect bag with two straps (and the belt) but then it wouldn't be a \\"slingshot\\" would it.If the load was kept down to eight or nine lbs. it would be better, but then you could probably use the \\"slingshot\\" II.

If you keep a regular lens attached and only need to attach a telephoto some times, it gets complicated. I usually have to open the bag almost completely to get one lens that is deeply located and I got scare to have something falling. Probably I picked the wrong bag for whht I had in mind: a bag that allowed me to quickly and safely change lens. I'm thinking about changing it by the Reporter D400 AW, since it seems to be thought for quick gear access.Talking about quality, the bag's structure didn't stand well my camera, four lens and accessories.

The \\"appearance\\" of the ghosts was not a revelation and the fact that some of the travelling party were ghosts, was not a surprise as it was projected long before the reveal. Too much of the storyline was left unexplained....how can one spend so much time with ghosts and not know it? How can one purchase supplies and go for dinner and eat food if one is a ghost? And so on. Yes, I realize this is fiction, but too much of it was left unconnected to make it believable. The ending was not exciting and was left very much unresolved. I never really bought into the whole storyline, since parts were left gaping and unresolved at the end. the descriptions of the ruins were very good and made me think I was there. Character development was good and believeable, but the storyline was just missing too many parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This book is a compelling read. The mix of mystery and storytelling makes it hard to put down. The part I liked the best are that the characters are real.

Sala struck me as a very tough lady, losing both parents and four siblings in the war. She and her sister Dora survived, plus two brothers. One of Sala's dreams was to become famous and work in Hollywood. Both she and her sister married and came to America, her other surviving relatives going to Canada. Sala eventually became a model, working in Chicago and other cities. The style of this book is different, kind of terse and factual kind of the way a reporter might write a story.

A new Mac G5 in your basement is all it takes. What you need is a good story, and that is based on a minimum of two things: premise and charater development. This movie does have a neat premise....and that's where it ends. There is no character development to speak of, and the movie suffers for it. So even if you don't give a hoot about the characters, you at least want to see the execution of the premise. That execution unfurls at a snail's pace, and without any real tension (I mean it is virtual reality right?).

The E.P. they released a while back got me hooked, and this album is just as great. The sound is clean, and is a refreshing change in the current world of music. Interesting song structures and guitar melodies will grab your interest right off the bat, and the songs just get better and better with each listen.

I bet you will come back wanting more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minus the Bear rocks good","review":"Ok, so by now pretty much everybody has in some shape, way, form, or fashion heard of Minus the Bear. Highly Refined Pirates is probably their best album, atleast in my opinion. The thing about the album is even with all of it's absurd lyrics, the music is simply great. The begining of the album draws you into something you never though you'd hear, and the music is amazing. Everybody knows the band has come from all sorts of various backgrounds. Minus the Bear delivers with this album. Absinthe Party at the Fly Honey Warehouse is without a doubt the greatest song ever written. If you get a chance to this spring go see these guys on tour.

Also there was a lot of nice music. However, the film is disappointing in that it is very poorly organized, and many of the talking heads are not properly introduced or placed in context. Also, there is a kind of mean, condescending emphasis on Chet the deteriorated pretty boy. The overall feel of the film is overly negative, and disrespectful.

If you want to know about Rand's life read Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead, or for non-fiction; Capitalism The Unknown Ideal, The Romantic Manifesto, The Virtue of Selfishness or Objectivism:The Philosophy of Ayn Rand. For more reading pick up any of her articles written for the New York Times.It is frightening that a person that has been removed from Rand's life because she discovered him to be without virtue and a liar can then claim to \\"know\\" her better than anyone and that others would want to read his book and take it as Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Refuted","review":"Recent scholarship has demonstrated the complete dishonesty of this work (and its earlier version) and its historical unreliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insincerity Reigns Supreme","review":"This book is painful to read, not because of what it says about Rand, but because of the obvious dishonesty on every page.

While this film is visually dazzling, the earlier film is something of a visual treat in its own right. Unfortunately the sequel lacks the charm of the original, at least for me. While Legend of Zu certainly rivals the special effects ability that we've grown accustomed to from Hollywood, the story seems a bit empty. Zhang Ziyi's role is nearly a cameo--don't expect to see much of her. Still, I found the film entertaining and, if you like Asian cinema, it's worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Anime!!","review":"Not many movies capture the inspiration of a mixture of fantasy and reality to the point that you can't decifer between the two.I like the briliant colors and CGI intergrations, outstanding story line.

But they are the only thing this movie got going for itself. The story was one of the most confusing I ever witnessed. Perhaps some of it would make some sense to a connaisseur of Chinese legends but I was completely lost. Fans of Martial Arts movies will be equally disappointed by the lack thereof. There is only a single and short fight which involves martial arts (between Hollow, Joy and Thunder). All the other fights are resolved by overpowering the enemy with ones magic and are mostly overshadowed by special effects. My guess is that Tsui Hark got a bit carried away by his special effects and in the process neglected the other components of the movie, mainly the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for this movie to end","review":"Featuring an all star cast, this movie should really have been a lot better. However, even these stars could not defeat the horrible script. A nonsensical plot with gimmicky supernatural effects left this feeling more like a children's cartoon than an action movie. Save yourself some time and skip this one.You won't understand the plot -- because there is none. You won't be impressed by the special effects -- unless you want to see people fly through the air (think Superman, not Crouching Tiger) with a blue streak trailing them. The fight scenes are far and few between -- and the fighters often rely more on supernatural weapons than acrobatic kung fu. I gave this movie 1 star, because that's the lowest score available.

Immortals that reincarnate and live in an Olympus style mountain look over the mortals and battle a fallen brother, reminiscing Melkor/Morgoth against the other Valar in the Silmarillion. And sacrifice and wisdom can lead the heroes through sorrowful sacrifices to ultimate victory against the odds.But the director filmed in such an accelerated state that this movie jumps from an action scene to another without pause leading to extremely basic dialogues, paper thin characters and confusing reincarnations. Sometimes there are scenes of exquisite beauty showing strong cinematographic skills by the professionals involved.

Feral tribal elves, a civilization of minotaurs, 'glass ships' sailing fields of obsidian...lots to like here, especially if you use it along with Spelljammer.The downside: It kind of seems like a dumping ground of ideas that just didn't quite make it into other sets. The Roman Minotaurs, the Mongolian Elves...has a certain goofiness. If played by the right group it can be a lot of fun. It also features Krynn 'tinker' gnomes prominently, a subrace I have always had a certain loathing for as I don't care for obvious inbuilt comedic relief races.Overall, some decent material, great maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Time of the Dragon Box set.","review":"This Box Set attempts to expand on the Dragonlance world by introducing another continent to the world of Krynn. Compared to David \\"Zeb\\" Cook's game mastery in the AD&D 2nd Edition guide book and the Forgotten Relms setting, this supplement falls far from the mark. Related to the well known continent of Anaslon primarily in sharing the same pantheon, this should be considered a whole new world that was linked to the main Dragonlance area by a trecherous ocean years before the current storyline. If this were a product that was designed to create a whole new world, it would get 3 stars for the quality and throughness...but it suffers mightily by the atemped link to the rest of the world that's hardly related to by the rest of the source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero functionality and smashing looks..","review":"As the previous reviewer mentioned, it looks really really cool..

The author comes right out at the start of the book and says he is not writing this book for people who want to learn all there is about Windows 95 but is writing it solely for the purpose of preparing the reader to take the exam. I guess it is kind of a shame the exam doesn't cover the subjects more deeply because I expected to see more than just a scratch of the surface on Windows 95.

This is a very good first novel, and I was here in Amazon looking for another book by Heather Lowell to read. In When the Storm Breaks, we watch two control freaks struggle with losing control; Clare whose carefully organized world gets tipped on end and Sean whose caredully controlled emotions and rules of conduct go out the window when he meets Clare. I like the struggle between instinctive attraction and professional or self imposed rules of conduct. The internal dialogue was funny. It was refreshing that both protagonists had equally developed tempers and vulnerablilites and that the tempers didn't turn violent.

I fail to see the value of the purely low-class cheap shots (e.g. on Barbara Bush's looks), the unsupported assertions (e.g. most of the 'incursions' vaguely listed 'we started') or the vapid sources quoted as 'research' (e.g. the Federation of American Scientists, neither a federation nor comprised of real scientists) in developing an understanding of the US position in the world.

The rest of the 150 pages of his book were repetitive, disorganized and contained information that was neither here nor there. The book is not a complete flop but it is hardly what I expeted!

Despite Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandels (the two most publicized), Americans still look the other way when our government blantly lies to us. Gore Vidal's book, though dissapointly short and somewhat fragmented, holds even greater relevance today. With our rights silently slipping away, with our Ken Lay's walking our streets instead of pacing in jail, one cannot help but feel the greatest dread for what the future holds.

Patience is key, as is doing the right type of exercises. If you have painful knees, strengthening the quadriceps is very important. Try going up stairs backwards, jogging backwards.

My advise: save your money and buy some graph paper and a pencil. This is a sketching program only, and it doesn't do it very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT perform as the 'box' claims it will","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. Not only was it the most expensive home product, but it was the largest waste of money. Forget 'designing' the interior of your house! NO paneled doors, no arched windows, no french doors, only one type of shower, no washer or dryer to be placed in the house just to name a few things missing from their 'large selection.' The 'furniture design suite' is not easy to operate. The so-called instruction manual fails to give any instructions. My computer is a Pentium 500 and I have 64 megs ram-the program still would not let me do 3-D walkthrough-it was 3-D standstill. The paint,fabric,floor options were from 1960 (all 10 of them). This program is terrible! I will be purchasing something else for sure! A plus side: lets you scan in a plan and trace it. After you trace the plan, the fun is over. Forget doing anything but outlining you \\"dream home.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay for beginners....","review":"This is the first home planning software I've ever bought. I found most of it difficult to use until I got accustomed to the program. There are some features I wish it had such as more 'undo' options and more home plans. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known beforehand that it only had 20+/- of it's own house plans that you could alter. Several other similar programs boast 100's of home plans that you can alter to your tastes. Regardless, it's a good program if you want to be able to \\"build\\" your home, design the interior, and landscape the outside and fairly simple to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"roofs and walls","review":"I was initially excited at how easy it is to create a structure, and indeed that is this program's strength. But as I used it more, I became more disappointed. Roofs are poorly done. You'll notice that all the samples have the same roof lines. You cannot create true gables. You cannot create anything pretty much out of the ordinary in fact. Try drawing a barn for example. And walls are a problem when you want anything that is not ordinary. Try drawing a knee wall. You cannot specify individual wall height. They have a good concept and an easy api, but ease of use is no substitute for basic features. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a toy; a broken toy","review":"I really hate to be so critical but the thing with Punch is they promised so much and just didn't deliver. One reviewer mentioned that they offer a nice variety of doors, windows, etc. Well, there were three deck shapes to choose from. Is that Variety? And while you could adjust the shapes somewhat, I couldn't get it to accept exact measurements. Now how can you build something without exact measurements? Oh, did I mention I live on a slope? Punch doesn't do decks on a slope. Everytime I tried to adjust the deck to the slope - it started to build a house with a basement. There were only a few stair types and only 1-2 places I could place the stairs. Forget about stairs with a landing that change direction. And all the stairs had fixed heights - which is really ridiculous. This software was time consuming and a waste of money.Let me add, I did not try the scanning feature - so I can't say how that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard!","review":"ok i totally want to be a home desinger/architect when i grow up.

Most of the time is spent telling how a six year old boy is infatuated by the minister's six year old daughter. Other than being bored spitless by the non-happenings related, one can revel in what life was like before cars in an Iowa small town.

This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone intrigued by the potential of human consciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty deep...","review":"I don't fully understand the subject, but thankfully my husband (who majored in Physics in college) does. We read the book together in the car when we are traveling together, and have not finished it yet. However, he is completely enamored with it and loves the science it exposes. We cannot wait to see where it leads, and what the ultimate experiment in our lives will be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough in its evidence, dissapointing in it's utilitarian value","review":"I purchased the book hoping for some insight into the process of directing intention for my personal development. After all, the title includes the very active statement of \\"using your thoughts to change your life and the world\\".But it does not deliver on that front. It spends most of it's time literating the evidence of intention as a testable element within the realm of science. On that front, the book is well thought out and convincing and is an excellent primer for the skeptical or uninitiated.But for those of us who are already the converted, i felt it lacked a firm direction for it's reader past the evidence and into practice. The usable portion of the book occupies the final chapter, which, in my opinion, misrepresents what the title promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver on its' promise.","review":"Apparently, after writing \\"The Field\\" (which, by the way, was excellent), this author had a lot of research left over that she did not use in that book. So, like many authors, she took her unused research and \\"constructed\\" another book. Unfortunately, the subtitle of this book promises that it will teach the reader how to use his \\"thoughts to change his life and the world\\". In this regard, there is only one very short chapter at the end of the book that deals with this subject matter and it does so in an extremely superficial manner. Essentially, the subtitle of this book is merely a pretence. In my opinion, the only reason to read this book is if you have read \\"The Field\\" and you are a detail freak who wants every last scrap of research that was not included in that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This book makes you think differently about your own thoughts and the fact that they CAN have a direct effect on your and others' environments.

There are also so many NEW ideas that I am still assimilating. I am reading the book slowly and go to the footnoted references in the back often. There's a lot to take in so I just stop after some of the experiments and their conclusion to think about them awhile. Thought provoking at the very least and very clearly written so any layman can understand it as well. It's not one of those goofy, \\"self help\\" positive thinking books that are out there everywhere. This is smart stuff and the possibilities of these new scientific revelations affecting everyone's future on the planet are self evident.

What I love about this book is that it is a great tool to get you to a place of \\"believing\\". I personally believe that the efficacy of the power of intention and law of attraction working in your life depends largely on your acceptance, belief and open mindedness.

To be honest, the subject matter is not my cup-of-tea. After a long introduction, the first 200 pages were spent detailing numerous experiments proving how \\"intention\\" can work--much too much information for my taste.

I was looking for something to inspire me to be intentional, but this book was basically on the \\"wierdo radar\\". It was drawn out explanations of how our body acts as a antenna for information.

I have read about 6 books since having read The Secret. All of the the books were by authors who also contributed to the Secret.This book however I could not get into. The reviews I believe were certainly somewhat misleading. It is based on far too much scientific jargon!! After I read about 50 pages, I closed it up and could not read anymore.

As a vegetarian making the transition to veganism, this book not only answered my questions about veganism (such as, will I get enough calcium?), but it also re-enforced my reasons for choosing to go vegan in the first place: to do my part in healing the planet.

Other books I've read on this issue seemed so histrionic and over-the-top that they made veganism LESS attractive, and left me feeling guilty and selfish that I was \\"more interested\\" in dietary health than moral enlightenment.Marcus's book, on the other hand, is very direct and balanced, and he writes with refreshing humility and frankness. His statements simply speak truth, without the typical dramatics or air of moral superiority so often utilized by others.Just sign me Vegan-in-the-Making."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"Of all the book's i've read about veganism this is no doubt the best. This book covers a lot of information and different topics without being over-bearing like a lot of veg. books can be. Marcus clearly makes his points without deliberate emphisis.

Allover Great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read that makes animal suffering all too real.","review":"Marcus makes the intense suffering of animals something real - not just a myth that activists tote around the world. The information covers an amazing amount of material in a way that is both moving and inspiring. The descriptions of suffering and health concerns are just enough to give people reasons to continue being vegan, and others the chance to experience true people, animal, and environmental concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erik Marcus... you did it sir!!!","review":"This book will not tell you the hows, but it certainly will tell you the whys.

The album is part of the IRS \\"no speak\\" instrumental series that spawned a significant number of albums in the late 80's and early 90's. Akkerman is best known as a founding member of Focus. This is another one of those albums that I rarely pull out, but listening to it reminds my why I kept it around. The music ranges all over the place from straight ahead rock, to blues, soft jazz, swing / funk and even a bit of carrabien influenced material that could almost fit on a Jimmy Buffett record. I am not familiar with any of the other musicians who play on the album with the exception of a guest appearance from Chet Atkins. A few of the tracks sound very 80's-ish with kind of a Miami Vice Jan Hammer vibe, which dates the album a bit, but for the most part this is a nice pleasant listen from the former Focus guitar man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellow & Excellent","review":"the general mood of the CD I would say is mellow.

I refuse to buy any movie filmed in greater than 4x3 (ie. widescreen) on DVD or VHS until it is available in widescreen! I really liked this movie, otherwise.

Though visually stunning, the film suffers from a poor script full of holes and bizarre leaps in logic, and direction which shifts awkwardly between camp and a serious period adventure piece. There is no personal connection between the characters and the audience and consequently we don't care about any of them. The one character who should serve as our \\"eyes and ears\\" on screen, Margo Lane, is provided with mental telepathy, which sets her apart from the audience. Overall, as a fan of the radio and pulp incarnations of The Shadow, I was disappointed with the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Movie","review":"Watched it last night with my girlfriend. We both enjoyed it and it held our interest for the duration. I particularly liked the art deco sets, and the 1930's period way of speaking. John Lone plays a great villian. Penelope Ann Miller is stunning as Margo Lane. Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the Shadow and Cranston but I wanted a little more screen time for the Shadow. I still give it 4 stars because it is a faithful representation of the Shadow radio series which I have listened to on occasion. The DTS sound is superb. The DVD does not have anything in the way of extra features so I was let down in this respect. The DVD also should be offered in wide screen format because the movie is actually pretty good. A sequel would have been excellent, since a lot of the framework of the Shadow is set up in this movie. Too bad the studio forgot about this movie. My recommendation is to get this movie and pop a batch of popcorn and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific, underrated movie ... but full screen? Please.","review":"The title says it all.

The cast is stelar! And the idea is basically OK.But sadly, with all this talent, the writers and director put together a script, and insult to injury, direction, that reduced all of these fine talents to cardboard cutouts. Yes, the cast was strangled with piano wire! The only exception is Tim Curry; He is his irrepresable self in this film. Tim Curry doing Tim Curry, and doing Tim Curry to the hilt! Nuf said.The absolutely bigest insult in this film comes in the last few minutes, when Jonathan Winters has the line, \\"What he hell is that?\\" They didn't even show him giveing the line!

From beginning to end, we're constantly (and painfully) aware of the great film it might have been had it been directed with more patience and a better sense of rhythm. As it is, the film simply has no drive, no forward charge to it; it's as if it's standing still throughout the entire running time. Alec Baldwin, in the title role, is as bland as he's ever been, though it's not as if the script gives him anything real to work with. There's nothing plot-like here, and things are not helped by groan-inducing attempts at humor. It's not an utter loss: the production design is marvelous, and the scene where Tim Curry confronts the Shadow in an abandoned hotel has a genuine intensity that you'll wish had been present throughout the film entire. Also featuring Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen (who's largely wasted), Jonathan Winters, and Peter Boyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinkeroo","review":"This movie was recommended to me as being mindless but fun. In fact it's all but unwatchably bad. Horrible. Awful, awful, awful script; wooden, terrible, acting. But since it takes place in the 1930s there are lots of nice cars though. I've seen worse movies than this one, but no worse movie has ever been this bad, it's clear that they had a lot of money to spend, but they put it into the sets, not the plot. Just, wow, I mean, I really wanted to like it too, since I like the magazine stories but... Yuuuucccchhhh. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The SHADOW","review":"I will never be able to understand why THE SHADOW (1994) is so underrated. Sure, there are things I would have changed, but--the acting was convincing, the special effects dazzling, the dialog witty--and it the film was appropriately set in New York.The film borrows from both the pulps and the radio show. The Shadow is appropriately clad with an eerie, echoing voice. Shiwan Khan is properly cruel but humorous (how can a Tibetan have pupils THAT big??)This is not exactly a family movie. There is some language, a scene with scantily-clad concubines. Oh, and the demon-possessed knife called the Purba.Overall, a faithfully adapted crime fighter/superhero movie. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's FULL SCREEN.","review":"Let's say the movie deserves 4 stars at least. It's beautiful and the plot stays true to the original characters. Whatever you may think of Alec Baldwin's acting ability it's still a good movie. But the DVD is an old style, barebones, FULL SCREEN version. It's crap. The only reason you should buy this is that you can't wait to see it one more time and it's cheap...otherwise get the even cheaper serials like the Invisible Avenger and wait for the Special Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is Pan&Scan... what a waste!","review":"If you are a fan of old radio drama's and art deco styling, then you will love this film. Great music and visuals, and a decent story. The problem lies in the DVD print. Here again was a chance to utilize the DVD format to its utmost, but it failed from the start. I have seen more and more titles being released on DVD only to be a poor Pan&Scan transfer. It must just be the studio's trying to cash in on the new technology without having to do some actual work on producing a good product. This seems to be the same video transfer as the VHS version. So if you want to see this title in its best picture quality and in Widescreen format, you have to go with the Laserdisk issue, which is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie hampered by limited DVD conversion","review":"I really liked the movie, even when it got too thin in the script department. The production was slick and maintained my interest during the whole movie. It is relatively short, and would be good at a party. Just don't expect the script quality of a Tim Burton's Batman movie.The downside is that the DVD conversion was not that good. For example, I noticed that the French version had better visual quality than the English version, like during the intro, when the title \\"The Shadow\\" appears. I think this DVD is a direct-from-VHS copy. Not the best of all methods!The features are quite limited. It is not even widescreen. No extra footage...Frankly, you are better of buying the VHS version of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Did This One Slip Through the Cracks?","review":"While so much of what they pass off today as fantasy is nothing more than CGI swill \\"The Shadow\\" is a breath of fresh air. It has fantastic production design and jawdropping effects that actually serve the story. It contains intelligent characters and dialogue.

The artifacts are very visible due to the dark screen and fast actions. It is really too bad Universal had done a great job makeing the DTS version available only to be let down by the poor video. I can not recommend it but if you can live with the poor full frame video, get the DTS version.

The characters were well matched to the actors portraying them [or visa versa]. It is a movie I will enjoy watching again.Penelope Ann Miller was excellent but not as I imagined Margo Lane.

However, characters were very shallow, much of it was serious, then they add a genie. It was like reading a few different stories at once, but no depth to any of the characters. So much more could have been done with this, and the genie could have waited for a different book. I'm really having trouble finishing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"This was the first of many Jill Barnett books that I will be reading.

I look forward to more of the same from Ms. Barnett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"Started off okay, however, it soon turned very strange. Set in the late 1800's, but too many items and phrases mentioned throughout are more modern-day. The 'genie' was just over the top for what could've been a decent historical romance, and I skimmed to the end after he poofed his way into the story. It's sort of harlequin meets aladdin. Not my style, but other's apparently enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine","review":"This book is terrible, wish I could get credit back for this purchase.

So I searched for another, and saw this was so highly reviewed, I thought to try it. Now there is no comparison between the two books, I won't go there. But this book was very disappointing to me, and I know it's an older, dated offering. It just was off the wall, and the lead characters were beyond annoying. I couldn't stand Margaret enough to care, and was vaguely disturbed that a highly educated woman, with money, was so extremely clueless and we were supposed to accept that. I suppose I just do not have the right Imagination to stick with this book, I deleted it before the halfway mark. I wish I had picked something else to try from this author instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 4 stars it currently rates ...","review":"I decided to give it a try since it was free. Good thing, 'cause it wasn't worth it otherwise. Maybe I'm not into the fantasy part of it enough, but there's just too much I can't stretch my brain around. I could have enjoyed the story as much, and potentially even more, without the genie. That was just too over the top. Combining the young children, their trauma over losing their parents in such a horrific manner, and the sexual innuendos was a little too much at once. This could have been a touching tale, and could have been almost fun to read if it hadn't been so over the top with the fantasy stuff. The (human) characters were well established and I really enjoyed each of them for their own strengths - and weaknesses. Anyway, if you're into fantasy and just unbelievable mish-mash, you'd probably enjoy this. If you're looking for a story to remember, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much for Me","review":"I struggled with this book because while the author writes a good story, there's a lot to overlook in the category of believable. I downloaded the book without looking too far into the reviews and finally gave up when the genie in a bottle appeared. I was caught so off guard by his appearance that I read the first couple of sentences of that chapter three or four times before continuing on, certain I'd really missed something previously in the story. So if you want something that could happen in today's world (or even the late 1800s when the story takes place), then you'll want to skip this one.I also wouldn't recommend this book to those looking for a clean romance. Let me just say that the main male of the story is an escaped convict with a very difficult past. While his thoughts, words and actions are within character, they are not for those who prefer carefully guarding what they read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I started reading this book without reading much of the book description and was so surprised when the Genie came into the story.

It was such a refreshing read; I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it--until a freakin' genie showed up!","review":"Got this on my Kindle because it was free, and was thoroughly enchanted by the first several chapters--until a genie shows up! A genie, really?? Why??? The book was just fine without it. So I wound up skipping all the genie parts (and believe me, it really didn't change the story, so that shows how \\"critical\\" the genie was--NOT!).Then the book went totally off the rails. You see, the hero started out a bit like Clark Gable in \\"It Happened One Night\\" (rough, crude, street-smart, more than a little obnoxious, and VERY dismissive of a woman's abilities)--but he pretty much stayed that way. By the time the heroine \\"fell in love with him,\\" I was fairly convinced she had Stockholm syndrome. Yes, he finally changed, but only AFTER the heroine had professed an undying love for him. Glad it was free, and I'll check out more Jill Barnett books, but the genie and the obnoxious hero totally ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"This sounded like a very good book in the preview.

In reading this and many other ADHD books, I agree that for a successful life, one must learn to control one's behavior or be eaten alive by society in one way, shape or form.The strict disciplinary tact outlined by this book has helped tremendously in curbing my 6 year old's impulsive behaviors.

They failed miserably with our ADHD child.Ritalin may not be needed by everyone, but it is a life saver for some such as my own child. It does require active parenting techniques to go along with the medication.I would suggest other books by authors with more balanced views should be read rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than meets the eye","review":"The book over simplifies the issue. Behavioral inteventions are a MUST in treating any ADHD/ADD. It must be diagnoised by a physician with the anticdotal observations of parents and teachers, school counselors, etc. This is a real behavioral issue involving real brain chemistry differences. My advise to parents-being a parent of an ADHD child and a counselor is to use both behavioral interventions and medication--at least try the meds for 6 weeks along with using a schedule, more structure, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profitting from the backlash","review":"Dr. Stein is an idiot and obviously does not have ADHD or a child with ADHD. I had the obligation to endure a public statement made by Stein and his summary point was the parents were in pain, not the child, and that the parents were medicating their children to make the life easier. His book is banal and full of the type of self aggrandizing platitudes that embarass the rest of the mental health profession. In many cases, including mine, Ritalin may not be the answer, but Dr. Stein is not either."},{"rating":"1","title":"An UNPROVEN pratical program","review":"I agree that Ritalin is not the answer, I personally find Adderall to be much more effective. This book is nothing more than pop-psychology that offers no proof. As in most illogical assertions, personal anecdotes are the only proof offered. The sad reality is anecdotes are only useful if the reader WANTS to believe the story.While there is no denying this method could possibly be useful for some people, to suggest it is more effective than stimulant treatment is to ignore the thousands of clinical studies conducted over the last fifty years. I highly suggest that parents who wish to give their child an opportunity at success disregard the fluff of this work. Stimulants WILL help your child. 95% of ADD patients respond to one of the many stimulants on the market. For children, Ritalin is safer than Tylenol. Investigate for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Sensationalist Book from the Flat Earth Folks","review":"I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but this book, and many of its ilk, that claim that ADHD is over-diagnosed (it's not) and that medications are extraordinarily dangerous (they are not) misleads way too many people into not exploring appropriate treatments for their children. There is a persuasive group of \\"flat earth\\" people who still believe that ADHD is not real, that it is an invention of Psychiatry, and that medications are not a reasonable treatment. When they get others to read these kind of books, they do a great disservice to a scientific perspective and the children who count on parents and adults to make fully informed, 21st century decisions.If you must buy this book, do your children the favor of buying another book that gives a balanced, scientifically proven perspective. Don't just be sucked in by the rhetoric of anti-psychiatry fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"great parenting advice","review":"I like Dr. Stein's philosophy of giving kids responsibility and giving them chances to think about and process their own behaviors.

It's just the words these two main characters bat back and forth...it just doesn't play. I don't know under what catagory the author originally marketed this book, maybe that would explain why the book seemed so empty to me.However, if you enjoy some steamy romance, there is a bit of that here.

Think of Van Gogh's painting Starry Night. Then think of some enraptured enthusiast painting a copy of Starry Night for sale to the sidewalk crowd outside the MoMA here in New York. That's what My Favorite is to the Smiths, The Cure, etc, a pretty bleak alternative. The music is listenable and -- as the techo bonus disc also proves -- club danceable, the lyrics are mannered, depressing and banal all at once. On a few cuts the female singer Andrea Vaughn makes more of them than they deserve. Recommended downloads: The Happiest Days of My Life, Homeless Club Kids, Burning Hearts and the Black Cassette.

The movie is bad overall. It's cheesy,but the bad cheese. The film starts out good maybe 30 minutes into the film,but goes down slowly.The acting is overall bad, the casting for some parts is stupid, and even though I love cheesy scenes. Some of these cheesy scenes weren't good.Now, I can't complain because a friend gave this movie to me for free after he thought it was terrible and so I knew what I was getting into.

Oh hunny, buy this flick, it shant disappoint you.If nothing more this movie is worth its price for the witty one liners and unique special effects. Such as \\"I'm a virgin, I'm saving myself for Marilyn Manson.\\" and \\"My brothers going to be the antichrist?

Its cheesey-stereo typical charactors. Its horrible acting. What these people are missing is, thats what made 80's horror such a great thing. It didn't matter if the cast were all your bestfriends. As long as you could keep people entertained it was a good horror flick. I was almost comforted by this movie. Reminded me of how much I enjoyed old Horror \\"B\\" movies. I laughed til I cried in parts and I jumped in parts and for a small film like this thats impressive.

Apparently so. The characters in \\"The Convent\\" are such stereotype, so one-dimensional, they disappear if they turn sideways.

Ahahahaha, you work at the friggin dairy queen!\\" \\"lies! lies! lies!\\" The goth chick Monica is definitely a hoot. Coolio's cameo was too hilarious. Nuns getting blown up! Adrienne Barbeau!

Was the director trying something new with the whole black light effect and the weird moving demons??!! This movie had a lot of funny lines and the goth girl was an excellent actress, she would be hilarious in a comedy, why she picked this stupid movie to be in I have no idea?!

The very beginning is pretty graphic for those of us who actually look up to religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really strange horror movie !","review":"This is not your normal standard type of horror movie. I don't think the writer/director intended it to be either. If you want to spend a mindless break in front of your TV after a hard day's work, then this is for you. I loved the part where the two guys are discussing their virginity while being wheeled down the corridor to be sacrificed; and the weirdo guy says to the other, 'I just haven't found the right one yet'.I think reviewers on this site tend to rate the movie out of it's context instead of for what it really is, a dumb brainless horror movie which was intended to scare you a bit as well as make you laugh now and then. I like to experience those emotions after a terrible day at work in a job that I totally loathe with a passion. If you want to watch a horror movie that's a little more intellectual, then watch Bram Stoker's Dracula.....or is that a love story ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's The CONVENT-ional waste of potential.","review":"I recommend this movie to all who wants to see what BAD movies look like.

It was funny at times (ie one night stand with Joey Ramone, that made me scoff) and I was exepecting a very terrible \\"film\\", but not this bad, worse than I thought. So I have come to the conclusion that it must really be a comedy. In which case it is amusing, minus the homophobia. There are some funny targets here, cheezy wimpy satan worshipers, dumb sorority and frat boys, psuedo goths, sex crazed misogynists (come on now, if you've been to high school you know the earlier mentioned, if you've been to college you know all the rest.)So for that factor, I scoffed here and there.

A horrible 'guide' that will influence future hacks to create their own trashy lazy work at worst. This book promises originality in its title but then goes on to show a bunch of amateurish imitative artwork as its examples. That the author trashes other 'how to draw manga' books is laughable when this book is such poor quality. I suspect that the people giving positive reviews of this waste of money are more swayed by the pretentious and misguided text in it than by the author's actual teaching or drawing talent. Want manga in your own unique style? You are better off studying traditional drawing technique without manga influence and then evolving into your own style as a consequence of being a strong artist regardless of whether you draw manga style or not. You will learn more about drawing better quality Manga through the teachings of George Bridgeman or Robert Beverly Hale than you will trusting an over-opinionated hack artist who trashes other mediocre talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was incredibly helpful.

In reading it I found it had two levels of thinking, it had the wonderful story line for children. And it had a more thought provoking spiritual side for the more adult readers. Myself, being in between those levels I experienced a wonderful mix of some thought provoking ideas and an amazing story. I would recommend this book for all ages. It was amazing reading it and feeling the same sense of discovery that Una was going through. One of the many parts, which I would call my favorite, was the part about the lion. The lion came upon Una and explained courage and the many different lion kings, Una hadn't thought of herself as courageous but this lion came along and posed a threat to her and her journey. She stood up for herself and used her brain and cunning to find the strength to out think one of the kings of the jungle."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be a part of every grade school's library","review":"My husband and I both read Una's Jungle Journey and decided we'd like our kids and grandkids to have it, too.

Not that the dancing isn't phenomenal (Michael rules!), but it lacks soul. Hubby and I like Celtic music --old \\"Shepherd's Hey\\" fans-- and we get to see Celtic dancing locally (though amateur) and we both found this video disappointing.The principal problem is the 'homogenization' of the singing. It is sort of Celtic music for elevators. The second problem is the Flamenco dancer. Having seen a top rank group from Spain at Wolftrap, I have to say that this lady has got no 'attitude' and the music.... please, don't get me started.Two Stars. Could have used a plot.

An example of this is the snide nasty way she refers to men who leave a relationship for a younger woman. But for the women in her examples it is honored and freeing- they got the young buck. Her disdain for men throughout the book is apparent. The whole read, while flowing and easy is set on creating a reality through sketchy examples of women's life stories that seems manipulated to fulfill her vision of how the world should be. There are some empowering nuggets, but taken in context of the whole message and journey in the book ultimately it is simply a sad display that will offer little real help to women and men who will come to realize that this the real world and Gail Sheehy is living in a fantasy world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Executed!","review":"This CD embodies all that I have come to expect from a musician who has worked with such great artists.

Be warned, this book is entirely fiction apart from a few original quotes lifted from Reminiscences. Even Jesse's trading method hasn't escaped Smitten's \\"interpretation\\".Unfortunately there isn't much historical evidence available about Livermore, and to see him being recreated or fictionalized so uncharacteristically through the eyes of an inept writer serves no purpose at all. This is no way to treat a legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE OF STOCKS","review":"THIS BOOK RATES ON MY LIST AS BEING THE ULTIMATE BOOK ON TRADING STOCKS.WHEN YOU ABSORBE EVERY THING IT SAYS YOU REALISE HOW A COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE AND KNOW HOW WILL MAKE YOU A GREAT TRADER."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you sell the same book twice?","review":"Like many of the readers who bought this book, I was at a loss to understand why Richard Smitten would remove some of the original work written by Jesse Livermore. Now we know the reason. He just published another book apparently putting back what he took out the first time. Don't buy this particular edition or you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I was buying just Livermore's book reprinted!","review":"The editing is pathetic as if it was slapped together and thrown out there in rough draft. The book repeats itself over and over as if to fill up pages, p.65 caption refers to charts of INTL and semi ind. with charts of LU and telecom ind. above it, and publisher ads, too. I got almost as much out of \\"Reminiscences of a stock operator\\" (about Livermore) as I did this. There are some good points from Livermore, I think, hard to tell his words from Smitten additions. Hate that. Livermore market key is worth it, but I'm steering clear of this publisher in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand why the last three chapters was removed.","review":"I had a hard time finding the original version with the last three chapters intact even I am willing to pay more.

Unfortunately, even the master couldn't hold on to his success. \\"JL\\" reportedly made $10 million during the beginning of the 1929 crash, only to lose EVERYTHING in the early 1930s. How did he lose his fortune? Unfortunately, his book does not say. Nevertheless, Jesse does reveal his system that served him well for many years. And even if it went kaput in the early 1930s, I think one can profit from his experiences. The book shows that Jesse often used \\"pivot points\\" to time his trades. Basically, \\"JL\\" was a mental technician. What has worked in the past may not work in the future. As George Soros had said, \\"The rules change.\\" That phrase is especially important as we come ever closer to the end of the greatest bull market of this century, the type which wiped out JL himself. So, don't blindly follow JL's methods. Despite JL's subsequent failure, he did write a good book. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I found \\"How to Trade in Stocks\\" fascinating.

I purchased this edition so I could have a newer copy which would not have pages falling out of it. Unfortunately the editors have already removed three chapters of Livermore material and replaced them with original material by Richard Smitten. The Smitten material is ok, but it should have been added to the original book as an appendix not as a substitute for the last three chapters written by Livermore.The original book was only 112 pages long and the material from that book stops at page 56 in this new edition leaving you with around 122 pages of new material not written by Livermore. For that sin I can only give this book two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The part written by Livermore is worth 5 stars...","review":"Jesse Livermore must be wearing holes in his funeral clothes turning in his grave about the butchery that Smitten and Trader's Press have perpetrated on his book. Never before have I seen so many errors in punctuation, spelling, and grammar. Did a fourth grader edit the manuscript? Furthermore, it is difficult to determine which words were actually written by Livermore and which parts were added. Since the \\"Livermore Key\\" is printed in this edition exactly as it appeared in the original (1940) edition, one may surmise that Trader's Press has an entire copy of the original. Why not just reproduce the original exactly at it was printed in 1940 to maintain some coherency? This book was jam-packed with ads for Smitten's and Trader's Press other books. However, the part actually written by Livermore is pure gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"An infomercial","review":"As others have said, the parts of the book written by Jesse Livermore are very worthwhile. However, at least half the book is a mish-mash of Livermore and Richard Smitten, and it's not always clear who is speaking. Smitten essentially repeats everything that Livermore already said and does a terrible job of it. Moreover, his attempt at taking control off the narrative is to bring up the biography he wrote on Livermore and the software based on Livermore's strategy. I can't believe I paid money for an infomercial.

We have attempted to understand these various examples, even so far ....

The book is poorly written, and what educational info there is from Livermore could be handled in about 20 pages. The rest is anecdotal, interesting at times but useless to trading knowledge. The \\"Secret Market Key\\" is a bunch of price quotes which are neither enlightening nor relevant, since the stock market was a whole different animal back then.

Full disclosure: we are both Jewish refugees, formerly from Moscow, having lived in the US 30 years (me) and 20 yrs (my mother), so many parts of the story were directly related to our own family and our personal histories.

Were it as beautiful as \\"I Am Cuba\\" - also a propaganda film sponsored by Communist Russia on behalf of the Cuban government, it would at least have some redeeming quality. The footage can be interesting historically, but such a lopsided presentation perpetuates the depiction of the pre-Israel non-Jewish residents of Palestine as simple-minded camel-herders whose children bathe in the same water with cattle.

The scoop itself seems pretty durable. I use Fresh Step clumping litter and the scoop gets just about all of it. I wish the front part of the scoop had a slightly smaller screen to sift out some of those pesky smaller particles though. Also, the edge of the scoop is folded over so there is a small gap which can trap litter particles. But getting it perfectly clean isn't a huge deal; it is a litter scoop after all.

It was a well designed, sturdy scoop with a attractive cover. After an international move, I decided last month to buy a new copy of the same model. This is NOT the same product! As others have mentioned, there are three big problems. First, and least significantly, the stickers on the cover are almost impossible to remove. Second, the entire construction is very flimsy and bends under the stress of a large clump. Third, and most grievously, the scalloped edge makes the easy task of cleaning a box with clumping litter into a nightmare. It cannot clean against the edges (especially the rounded edges of a Booda dome.) It rips well-formed clumps to shreds, making a sticky and seriously gross mess.Don't trust this item's overall high rating or the older favorable reviews. This is, as another recent purchaser reviewed, the world's worst litter scoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"booda scoop","review":"not worth the price, and not easy to use.

When it arrived I was a bit concerned to see that it came with two pairs of red and green filtered glasses and there was no mention of 3D TVs on the box.

The 2D version looks incredible and the soundtrack is powerful and very good indeed. The movie is pretty basic FINAL DESTINATION stuff but does manage to work up some suspense in a couple of scenes, in particular the beauty salon sequence.

I can honestly say that I found myself laughing at both the dialogue and insane amounts of gore (you have to see certain scenes to believe them, and even then they don't make much sense). This is a fun movie, but not an Oscar-worthy one.If you want over the top bloody, gory fun, then this movie is fine. Don't expect the script to be anything but messy, and don't expect spectacular cinematography.

Now I have examples and instructions that I can burn onto a cd and can reference whenever.Also, we went to perform for my son's class and I was able to record it so I can give it out to his teacher and my parents.I found it to be:- Easy to record- Easy to transfer to the computer ( the battery pack comes off and it uncovers a USB hookup)It fits our need for recording instructions, music examples, and concerts.It records in stereo fine with the 2 internal microphones, I bought the extra microphone and haven't used it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected!","review":"Light, easy to carry and to record; Enough memory for me (I record my daily conversations with people in every possible occasions to improve my English speaking proficiency and pronunciation; Good sound quality both as the recorder and player.

I purchased for my wife to use in her voice lessons, and it lives up to the high audio standards required by this situation.However - - the battery lasts no more than 2 hours, and when put on standby for a weeks time, the battery seems to drain and it suddenly runs out of juice with no warning!! I use rechargeable batteries, but it is way too much of a pain to be constantly swapping out batteries and re-charging. Definitely would NOT have purchased the product if I had known.Also, our first unit was DEAD after 4 MONTHS! Replaced under warranty but coupled with the short battery life, I do not have a good impression of the product. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"This product was a very good buy, and the sound quality was wonderful.

The recorder has many handy features and it is very easy to use. The only complaint that I have is that, when recording, the folder will not display how much memory is left. This is disconcerting during long lectures. But the availability of 5 different folders makes this concern only a little pertinent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little gadget","review":"This item was purchased for recording digital sound clips that I wanted to upload to computer programs I am designing for my special needs child. It has worked well for that purpose. My main dislike, was a rather loud click that became part of the recording and it occurs as the record button is pressed (or maybe it was the stop button). Thankfully I had gotten the microphone with the recorder; which eliminates the irritating sound. Recordings are much cleaner sounding with the microphone. We found an unexpected use for the recorder as well. I had been able to go to Librivox and download public domain audio book readings. I added the files to this little gadget and my daughter was able to listen to 49 chapters of Black Beauty for entertainment during some recent traveling. We liked it well enough, that we purchased a second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recorder","review":"I am very pleased with this gift. I use this almost daily to record quick thoughts and gasoline prices for GasBuddy. The voice quality and battery life are excellent. I have not used the usb feature as yet.My only concern is the controls, which are excellent for stationary use, but not while driving. I often have to slide my finger back and forth to find the record or stop buttons. The visual and sound record indicators are subtle and best suited for a quiet environment.With those observations, I am very happy with this product.Thanks pet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE LITTLE RECORDER","review":"Nice little recorder. It is easy to operate and very user friendly. Only needs one AAA battery and it lasts quite long. I didn't give it 5 stars because of this:If you already own an mp3 player with the ability to record, you may not need this gadget. Granted quality is a bit better, but if you are not gonna user it often, your mp3 player will do just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recorder but with munchkin-sized controls","review":"When shopping for a digital voice recorder the customers reviews on the various models I was considering truly helped separate the manufacturers' copywriting hype from useful information. But the one thing no one commented on is the thing that is driving me somewhat nuts when using the WS-300M recorder. The controls are so tiny I have to look at the machine when accessing them. I'm not a big guy, nor are my fingers plump, but the buttons are sooooo small, the space between them is slight. Having to look at the recorder is not always easy -- when driving, in the dark, etc. It could be that all DVR's have teeny tiny buttons and that the WS-300M is no worse than the others. I don't know as this is the only one I've used. Other than that complaint, this is a terrific recorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for notes and meetings","review":"I work in an office and the WS-330M's been a great tool. It's made note-taking more effective since I can take my time and focus on listening in meetings instead of trying to feverishly write notes. There's a marked difference between the lowest and highest quality. The two middle settings are very similar. So, if you need more recording time, I would go with the 2nd to last setting (SP).Haven't used MP3 player mode yet. Don't intend to.Also, haven't used in large room / lecture hall. So, can't tell you how it does in there.PROS: Compact; lightweight; high quality recording; well designed interface; connect to PC w/o extra cables.CONS: Buttons almost too small; needs more memory for the price with USB flash drives being so affordable.Mine came with: USB extension cable (nice touch), headphones, AAA battery, manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Device","review":"Easy to use; plugs right into the usp on my computer; sound is clear and the various files make it easy to identify music versus dictation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"Although it is light and small, this recorder is very convenient for classes, meetings and conferences.

I went in search of a recorder for the \\"voice recording\\" aspect first and foremost, which works very well in this recorder. I decided on this one versus others, however, because it had the \\"and music player\\" option. However, since the extent to which that is true, I would have been MUCH better off just purchasing a cheaper digital voice recorder or spending a little more to actually get the voice and music options. Just be forewarned if you're excited by the capability of playing music if you would like more than 50 songs available at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This recorder is better than the analogue ones in that it:Is Digital.Has longer recording time.Is portable.Easy connect to the computer.Otherwise, what make me feel disappointed:The battery runs out very fast.The VCVA is not practical at all. With the highest mic sensitivity, major parts of the voice is dropped from recording.The microphone is not sensitive enough to pick up week sound signals.High-priced.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus WS-300MNot so great","review":"I found the device too small, and the ability of the mike to pick up sounds when you are handling it is poor. I also found the way the USB connector works--disconnecting the battery pack--kind of bizzarre and somewhat quirky. The device seems flimsily made, and although it was fine in a quiet room, I found it difficult to use in noisier venues--i.e., the car. Also, storing things as WMA files is pretty silly when you can use more widely accepted file formats. This made it impractical for me to use easliy with my mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"It's teeny, lightweight, and a snap to use.

I use it to tape lectures at school and it records very well.My only complaint, as with all tech products, is that the instructions arent easy to follow if they even include instructions for the product purchased. How many times have you read the instructions to find out that they pertain to various models, not just the one that you are trying to figure out?Took me a while to figure it out, and I am still trying to figure out why the recording sometimes stays on the recorder, after I copy it to my computer, and sometimes it just completely goes over to the computer without keeping a copy on the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute book","review":"We read this in our homeschool as a fiction read aloud.

I saw it at the drive-in when it came out, and then ob VHS as Dr Butcher MD. There is a lot of grain in the movie, especially in the darker scenes, which is typical of movies shot on film. I think this enhances the viewing experience. Down with digital and CGI, this is what a horror movie should look like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot but too much talk not enough action","review":"This movie just wasn't packed with enough zombie action for my personal taste. It was a lot of talk and not enough zombies/action. I was pretty disappointed. If you're looking for gore and lots of it pick a different film. This film is slow moving and not gory enough for my insatiable appetite for zombies, guts, gore, and the macabre."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unbelievably stupid, that cult status is inevitable","review":"I remember seeing this film in the earlier days of video stores sitting on the shelf as \\"Doctor Butcher, M.D.\\". It looked serious enough to a ten-year-old but now that I've actually sat down and watched it I couldn't help but laugh at its sheer incompetence. The music must be attributed to a small Casio, the special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen (paging Herschell Gordon Lewis!), the dialogue is inept (\\"I'm determined to have your brain!\\") and the zombies aren't really the bad guys; that title goes to mad Dr. Obrero and the decidedly Asian cannibals that attack our heroes on the island. Bashes you over the head with its stupidity, but hard liquor significantly softens the impact, and actually can make it fun under such influence (especially with friends to help make fun of it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This is a very misleading name.There is no \\"holocaust\\" of zombies, unless you consider a group of 4 shuffling zombies a holocaust.This move should be called Cannical Holocaust...With Zombies, because that is exactly what it is. Although Cannibal Holocaust isn't a grand movie, it is still actually better than this title, which is attempting to rip it off in a way.Back in the late 70's/early 80's, zombie films and cannibal films were making big money. Zombie Holocaust is a lame attempt to cash in on BOTH genres at the same time by throwing zombies in what is basically a cannibal/mondo movie.But the most important fact here: this movie just isn't that great. It is boring, with bad acting, bad zombies, silly tribal cannibals and people somehow managing to get eaten by cannibals who barely comprehend something as complicated as the wheel.Your money would be better spend elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard it's gory but where's the gore???","review":"I get this movie here based on many reviews but there is only very minimal blood in it... so where's the gore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Navet","review":"Bon les gens sur ce site on l'air d'avoir aimer ce pseudo film de zombie/cannibal mais hélas ce n'est pas mon cas.

Bon on ne le se cachera pas Z.H a de forte influence sur le film de Fulci 'Zombie' une scene a meme été emprunter sous forme d'hommage (inutile a mes yeux) les acteurs sont lamentable à en mourrir de rire (une chance que j'ai pas écouter la version francaise) mais le pire se sont les Zombies, pathétique quand j'ai vue les cannibals avoir peur de ces zombie j'ai bien rit. bref l'idé de départ était bonne avec un bon potentiel mais hélas ce film est à classer parmie les navets.

Well, I did not have a week since the paper had to be printed out and submitted the following day. After a while, this printer started screwing up, the paper would get easily jammed or it didn't print straight. I got so frustrated that I repeatedly pounded on this thing with my fist. That did it.

The fact that allows you to have color and b&w; installed together was a big shock; I never expected that from a $30 printer!For those complaining about it not coming with a black cartridge or USB cable, get over it! Its $30! The cartridges are about $20 each and cheap USB cable is about $4. Do the math, if they included those things then Lexmark would be paying you to take their printer.If you plan on buying a black cartridge or don't already have a USB cable then check-out the Z615.

Saving a few backs by excluding a USB cable I get...but deleting the black ink cartridge? Come on, Lexmark!...I guess the printer business is a cuthroat one. Apart from that, it's a fine little printer for the price and performs well...but only makes sense if you happen to have a USB printer cable and a Lexmark #16 or #17 black ink cartridge already lying around.

Because Mr. Secunda is partial...He portrays the Romans like the \\"bad guys\\", he doesn't lie about what the romans did, but he forgets to mention that their foes were as vicious (sometimes worst) as the romans were.All in all is a good book and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Fantastic stuff, esp for wargamers etc. Top illustrations, excellent presentation of evidence...in all, great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the music","review":"This is inspirational music for me while I'm painting and calming when I'm driving or working. So different from the noise we're used to, it's a welcome addition to my very eclectic collection, thanks to one of my sisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skimpy","review":"Very disappointed after I recieved this product. Since I got these for gifts, they look like I've eaten half of the candy! Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of peppermint","review":"I love this stuff and was willing to pay what ever to get it, but I was disappointed to find that there was not very much peppermint in the bark. It was like 4/5 white chocolate and 1/5 peppermint at a MINIMUM it should be at least half and half."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive guide","review":"Given the number of pages, it is a good source of background information about this family of aircraft. It has brief entries about development, deployment and operations. Very light reading with little need for technical background to understand and appreciate. Does not have a very high proportion of illustrations or photos, just sufficient to get the point of the text across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"This book is the most poorly edited book I have ever seen on any subject. It is full of errors. Please do not waste your money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"book is simple, but full of errors","review":"This book is poorly done. It has lots of errors that will confuse the beginner. It covers the basics and is easy to understand in some places, but most beginners will become frustrated do to the errors in this book, especially when Access won't do something this book says it will."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not find this book particularly helpful...","review":"The author of this book is not dealing with difficult ideas or content, but still manages to confuse the user. This is because the language and terms he uses are not consistent and his explanations lack focus, clarity and depth.It is possible to learn Access from this book, but the user certainly has to make a bigger effort than might be necessary if more thought had been given to the book.A small but irritating point: it is difficult to remove the CD without damaging the back cover..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors.","review":"This book is good for a beginner, but with the errors that are contained in the text, the reader would need to be a more advanced user to get some things to work correctly. Most chapters leave the reader wanting more, but maybe that is asking to much of 21 day course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept for book, but examples are incomplete","review":"I think this was a great concept for a book, but was quickly frustrated the incomplete examples in the book. The way the databases are set up, when you get to certain portions of the book, it tells you to be working with certain data that doesn't exist and doesn't tell you how to get it in there.I returned this book about 3/4 the way through. I don't have time to correct mistakes while I learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginners book","review":"This book is a good buy for the beginner. It covers areas that the other teach yourself books have not covered on Access. Mainly design issues. You may be able to create a working database, but without proper design, the pain of correcting it is intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"if your IQ is less than a house plant this book is for you!","review":"Holy [moly] this book is mind numbing. Not having had anyexperience with Access i decided to pick up this book in order tolearn it real quick like. Now i may not have had any experience with Access but i have heard of a computer before in fact i may have even seen one at one point, but this book assumed that i had no idea that civilization had advanced beyond the dark ages. What i'm trying to say is, that this book teaches the obvious. Even if you've never used access ever you'll still find 400 of this books 600 pages totaly remedial. This book could have been reduced to ten pages and still have been as informative. After reading this book i wish i had spent my money on fork so i could stick it in my head, yes that definately would have been more fun, and it probably would have taught me more about access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful dvd","review":"This is the italian release by Legocart, a full frame (cut on the sides) poorly encoded release with awful audio, and no subtitles whatsoever, just the italian audio.
