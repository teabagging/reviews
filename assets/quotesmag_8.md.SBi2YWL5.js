The pole needs to stick out about a foot above the cup so that the trombone doesn't wobble. Took me a second to figure it out...

It led me to this book of his, which focuses on WWII and Cold War military aircraft which have crashed in Arizona.The writeups are informative and never boring. This is an easy read for those who are interested in learning more about this neglected aspect of aviation history.There are plenty of photos, but I deduct one star as the quality of the black-and-white reproductions is only fair to poor.The book is recommended to all readers nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"I hope there will be a sequel to this book.

I loved this book for the perfection of the way the artist/author captures the exhuberant love for life expressed by the dog and cat characters, Hondo, Fred and Fabian. Peter McCarty manages to give us the essence of a happy day in the lives of these animals. It is so infectious that I felt happy just looking at the simple yet evocative illustrations. This is a book for very young children, I suppose, and I'm sure toddlers will love it and will be readily able to appreciate the fun it celebrates, but as an adult I loved the way it illuminates the feelings of non-verbal beings and the opportunity it gives us to glimpse the richness of those feelings that we so often overlook. It's a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playful story - wonderful atmospheric illustrations","review":"I love this author's style - both in text and drawings. The story is simple yet wonderfully accessible via the antics of the cat and dog. There's a playful quality that my son (age 4) enjoyed.

Very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Art - Very Weak Story","review":"I bought this book based upon its previous glowing reviews, however after reading several Rainy Dohaney books, this just doesn't stack up.The artwork is beautiful, but this book is not engaging enough for any child over the age of 20 months or so. My 3 1/2 year old liked the art, but was bored by the story and kept asking questions wanting to know MORE about what was going on. She was intrigued, but bored.It's not a TERRIBLE book, it's just a dull book.

Once I flipped through it, I fell in love and bought a copy for myself. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful, with a soft, luminous glow that makes them feel slightly dream-like. The story is simple and delightful, describing a day in the life of Hondo (the family dog) and Fabian (his feline sibling) and the adventures they each have.A sequel, Fabian Escapes, is similarly wonderful, and I highly recommend them both! They're short and simple enough to be read to even very young children, and the illustrations are so beautiful that adults won't get tired of reading them over and over again. I honestly read one or the other as a bedtime story to MYSELF at least 2 or 3 times a week!

The top part of the case comes down far enough on the screen to make swiping the status bar not work. Swiping the status bar is how you see what's new on your phone -- email messages, Facebook alerts, software updates, etc. When this feature works, you can then select the new item that you want to be taken to in the menu that drops down. I consider this to be an essential feature of the Droid X, so this case is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"For someone who does not clip a phone, this is an excellent case. My Droid fits perfectly. Everything is visible. The camera works in the case. The leather feels soft -- even luxurious. There is room for sim cards, business cards, even a stylus if you use one. The clasp is magnetic so it closes quickly and easily. No complaints on this case, although connecting the charger is a snug fit.

You can use one artifact and structure a whole campaign around finding and/or destroying the thing. The rest of the book you can use as generic Bard's tales, provided your party's not so jaded that they interrupt your story to say, \\"Oh, he's talking about the Eye of Vecna (or is it Venca?)! Let's go find it.\\"I'm not quite sure why they kept the random powers for most of these artifacts. Is there some rule that says that if you're not rolling dice, you're not playing D&D? Most of these artifacts are centuries old. I would think that they would have powers that were more constant, not different every time someone new found them.Fun book. Good items. Lots of room for abuse, but I don't feel the need to proselytize game balance right now. That could be because I'm being slowly dominated by the Dice of Mort the Mad PowerGamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong answers for some questions","review":"Test practices are fine, but there should not be any mistakes in the book.

Unusual was defined as 'odd' not 'peculiar'.Too many errors for a test practice book, which has a lot of filler pages to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory recording & performance","review":"The performance is unsatisfactory and not professional at all. You can easily here the unstable rhythm and not-well-tuned tones, especially for those piccolos and flutes.When I was listening to the CD, I also found that music is in a 2-D dimension only : simply like music from mono radio.Of course, if I take into account of the price, it might be unfair to expect too much, but I know that some CD of this price level can have much better surround sound and performance.I would not recommend this CD to those classical music audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is Really good","review":"I just recieved this game about 2 weeks ago and it is so cool.

Do not be mislead by the previous review... in no way do any songs here resemble \\"Popeye the Sailor Man.\\" There are a few seafaring themses expressed in the melodies and lyrics, and this is accurate, as the Vikings were a seafaring people (anyone who knows anything about Vikings knows that). The music IS rather complex, although most songs begin rather simplistically. By varying the complexity of the music, it only makes the song overall MORE complex. This band is definitely among the best out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This!","review":"You will regret buying this album. I don't know what the last reviewer was talking about: The melodies are lame, the musicians are only average, the vocals are not only stupid - they sound terrible as well. Some of these songs sound like a cross between Popeye the Sailor Man and the theme to Gilligans Island. If you want to listen to Viking Metal try some old Vintersorg or something, but do not buy this album - it won't even make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilton wrote the book!","review":"My husband and I were able to fix a problem with our 2002 Rav4 at a tenth of what it would have cost at the dealer.

One of the more subtle lines of thought that should hit home in the movie is how fellacious our overseas missions attempts are when we seem to care less about home missions work , with people we can see, feel and touch their lives; instead of being able to promote what we are doing around the world as a badge of honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Chance doesn't deserve a chance","review":"My husband and I watched this movie for the first time last night. Perhaps we were expecting more after having seen Courageous in the theater recently (that was a great film). \\"The second chance\\" didn't challenge us to be a better person, to live more like Christ. Swear words were said from the pulpit and other places in this movie by the one \\"pastor\\". The anger oozing from the pastor was a turn-off even though you know it is because of the lack of help in a very dark place and the constant 1 step forward, 2 steps back. We were left having witnessed not the love of Christ but hate and frustration towards others. This had the potential to be a great movie but it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Disappointed with the inner city pastor's language and un-Christlike example. He had no sense of humor throughout the movie. While there were some realistic elements in the movie, the power of the Spirit seemed to be lacking. After seeing what some Christian movies can do to lift one's spirit, this movie fell far short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Chance","review":"Really enjoyed the movie, it gave me hope and taught some life lessons. My only complaint was the ending left me hanging there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking movie","review":"This movie is definitely not for young children, as it portrays the drug culture of homeless people. It does, however, carry the message the God cares about all people, and wants us to also. Michael W. Smith successfully protrays a minister who is forced outside of his comfort zone and called to minister to an inner city church."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must-See!","review":"I love this movie!! The talent in this film really shows through, the filmography is excellent, and the story is gripping! I would recommend it to anyone! (Anyone who thinks Michael W. Smith is just a good singer, wait til you've seen him act! You won't believe it's his first film! And the other actors are great as well!)Not only is the movie appealing and well made; it also has a valuable message for the church today. I think any viewer would agree. (Be sure to check out the bonus music video from Smitty too! It's an awesome song!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"A telling tale of how today's values can often conflict with what's really important.

Smith ALLOW to be in a movie with blasphemy, but share a scene where the \\"Pastor\\" says the N word in front of him and he does nothing about it. There are many things wrong in this movie. After the first 20-25 mins. I had enough of the language, anger and attitude, that I deleted this movie and cracked it in half. I also deleted Michael W. Smith's music and threw out his music. I will Worship music that is by someone who KNOWS the Gospel who has been shown they are a sinner and deserve hell and unless they repent (daily) and put there faith in Him, they are Saved. Otherwise, there music is just as worthless as dog vomit.Call me a \\"judger\\" or a \\"legalist\\" if you want, but that's what the Bible and my heart point out to.

The wealthy mega-church is filled with only white people while the church in the 'projects' is made up of mostly black people who are former druggies and prostitutes. I thought this film was attempting to oppose racial bias? So there are no minorities in the mega-churches? Only blacks struggle with addictions and illicit lifestyles?Sorry, but I did not get the point of this movie. Supposedly this movie was to portray the church as Steve Taylor envisions it. I sure hope there aren't many Pastors like the ones portrayed in either 'The Rock' or the Second Chance church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Michael W.

Smith fans, the man cannot act! You may think he's fantastic but you fans are so in awe, you couldn't see his lousy acting skills. However, he's an okay singer. He only did this movie to be more prosperous in his luxuriant lifestyle than he already is.The other actor in the movie jeff obafemi carr was a pretty decent actor. He tried his best in this horrible weak movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done..","review":"The movie is well done. It is a good story, acting is very realistic, character lessons strong, entertaining. I recommend the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Christian movie","review":"It doesn't matter what ''side of the tracks'' you are from, if you belong to Christ, you are supposed to love each other. They were just mad and fighting the whole time! Where was the gospel of JESUS CHRIST in this movie? Where is the message of repentance and salvation? The \\"pastor\\" in the movie doesn't even know how to repent (and clearly doesn't have the desire to)!! This WHOLE movie is about taking revenge when things don't go your way. And the pastor was the main one doing it! He acted more evil than the drug dealer did!! He treated his ''brother-in-Christ'' like dirt throughout the whole movie. The Bible says that anyone who doesn't love his brother is not of God (1John 3:10, 4:20).This is not a Christian movie. Don't be fooled by the church building."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Chance Movie","review":"This was an okay movie. I expected more for a Christain music and the acting wasn't the greatest. My daughter enjoyed it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - and NOT just for strong Christians","review":"This movie revolves around 2 ministers who grew up (and still live in) in very different worlds. Forced to work together, they eventually find that they aren't that different after all.As many people have said, there is cussing in this movie. That is reality - especially in certain neighborhoods. The important thing in this movie is its messages.One of the things that I have always liked about Micheal W. Smith's music is that it gets its point across about living a good and positive life, without using too much rhetoric and preaching. In doing so, Michael relates his message to many more people. In my opinion, this is true of this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Chance Review","review":"The Second Chance gives an interesting view of the Church in America today. A mega-church being operated as a business loses all sense of reality of what a church is and does. The pastor and his son are rudely awakened by the actions of one of their mission church projects whose pastor see a widening divide between business-minded church leaders and the needs of the people who are the Church. Discipline turns into discipleship as the pastor's son faces ministry one on one as Jesus did."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware pastor cusses","review":"I didn't finish watching this video. During about the first 15-30 minutes I heard at least three cuss words. One of the pastors even cussed out the congregation! Not what I expect from a christian type movie. There are other very good christian movies that do not use bad language to get their point across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down...","review":"I didn't find anything in this movie uplifting.

Another man's test at learning what the other guy is living through."},{"rating":"2","title":"the second chance","review":"I only gave it a four instead of a five because thae cusing that did not fit this type of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"There should be more films like this one.","review":"This is a very enjoyable film. I am a Michael W. Smith fan who was able to see the film in the theatre, and I found it to be very enjoyable. It conveyed a very important message while remaining lighthearted at moments. It is the kind of film that leaves you thinking for days and that you would not be ashamed to see with your family! Frankly, it seemed more like a PG than a PG-13 rating to me, and I was very relieved! I am so tired of movies filled with filthy content. This one was a breath of fresh air! I am very excited about the release of the DVD. The performances were strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"The story in this movie needs to be told. Unfortunately they attempted to be just like mainstream productions and interjected several UNNECESSARY curses. I am involved with several grass roots programs that are trying to make a point to the mainstream media that worthwhile movies CAN be made without all the profanity, and a movie geared toward Christians (and hopefully a lost and hungry world) cannot seem to break free of that nasty habit. I am very disappointed to see that. How will we ever get word to Hollywood or any other movie producing entity that profanity is not necessary to make a good movie if Christian movies use the same language? I wouldn't recommend anyone see this movie because of that very reason. What a twisted and mixed message that leaves. Michael W. Smith, I am very disappointed sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"good italian languaje","review":"this is a venezuelan singer who deserve his cd in italian,hard to find, and in the usa all the italian people i knowwould like to know more of him and buy his cd in italiannow in venezuela my country, his is a big musician good oneno doubt about it que bueno el cd de franco en italianovamos amigos venezolanos apoyen a la musica. essso comprenlo."},{"rating":"2","title":"debes tenerlo,must own","review":"extranjero es uno de los cd que mas vendio como otros en venezuela pero es uno de los aclamados por el video de no bastay la cancion extranjero, ya que hay muchos aqui que se sientenasi seria bueno que lo compraran y el cd de straniero en italianoque franco saco en italia y que casi no se consigue.como buen venezolano que soy y fan n1 vale la pena tanerlo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought two of these.","review":"I bought two of these for my father in law and my Nissan Titans.

Definatly pick these movies on DVD, they arent confusing either, they all have connection to the previous one. Unlike those Leprechaun films.

Even in the beginning, before the \\"critters\\" even arrive on Earth, the movie isn't boring, because we are introduced to all the charctors of the family that dealt with the \\"critters\\" and we see some of their different situations.

Many of the more complex grammatical concepts are just glossed over, or illustrated with non-standard examples. In addition, I found the fact that this author is British to be problemmatic. His background and academic experience tended to make the book come off as pedantic to American readers. References to parts of speech and grammatical elements are often inconsistent and unnecessarily complex. And finally, I found the fact that I had to write for the answers to the self-help exercises inexcusable. What good is a self-paced grammar text without the answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning, not as good as reference book","review":"I found this book very useful, whether you are learning Hebrew from scratch or whether you are refreshing or formalizing your knowledge of the language.

But it's a great pack and was only edged out by the High Sierra Swerve's excellent use of compartments high up in the pack (which more evenly distributes the items you're carrying, allowing the pack to maintain a thinner overall profile, as all your stuff doesn't wind up in the bottom).I love the retractable pull-up document sleeve and the extra waist-level pocket on the backside of the pack, and there are plenty of organizational features for small items. It stays fairly thin when fully loaded, at 8 inches max. That's important when you have to slip the pack under the seat.

And even if it wasn't singlehandedly responsible, the fervid description of two women deeply committed to each other in a mutually self-sacrificial relationship definitely gave me a future model for romance. (Much to the chagrin of my therapist.)Although I loved Star Trek as a child and read the entire Pocket Books series, my affection for this novel had nothing to do with our fearless comrades of the NCC-1701 and everything to do with the pulpy cover art, classic girls-behind-bars motif and solid writing by Wander Bonanno.

Both albums are good (as far as this genre is concerned) but I have to say that 'Dahmer' has got the edge musically ... it's a very tight and (strangely) catchy album from some very talented, mental metal heads!Some great tunes to sing along to when (very, very) drunk.To summarise ... a gore, comedy, opera classic about everybody's favourite serial killer - Little Jeff!But it certainly can't (and wasn't meant to) be taken seriously ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the hell?","review":"I first heard these guys when they opened for cannibal corpse a few years back.

Don't get me wrong, musically, these guys are quite talented. However, the vocals are the absolute gayest thing ever recorded. There are alot of metal bands out there with some pretty gnarly lyrics, and I have no problem with it whatsoever. I do however, think its really stupid and corny to sing about nothing but serial killers. I've seen them live twice, (not by choice) and believe me, these guys literally worship serial killers!

NOT SO in this case! More 'mainstream' artists (like No Doubt, and Dropkick Murphy's) but the quality is just not there. Many songs sound like demo tester recordings that they just handed to Fat Mike to put this CD together. But of course, many of these bands wouldn't just write/record something just for this comp!

The thing that pisses me off the most about this album is the FACT that these bands were paid/bribed/enticed to create or have someone else create for them these songs which have no political stability to back them up. It's just a bunch of liberal protesters with no ground to stand on who have a hobby of playing with a guitar/bass/drums as hard and often as they play with themselves.

Sure, the songs have direct or veiled political messages, but what do they have to complain about, and how can they pretend to represent working class America as they sit in their mansions and eat their caviar while this shameless ploy to play off of people's hatred of Bush makes more millions for the bank. Don't tell me they aren't getting at least a piece of the money, even if they don't make any off of this direct cd, their own personal cd sales will be boosted b/c of it. I say they sell their mansions and give all the money of their cd sales to whatever cause they feel truly necessary.

It is nice to see bands speaking out and exercising one of the rights that makes the country great. I would recomend it to any young person under 25. The stakes are to high to be apathetic. I really like what these bands have done here, which is encourage the youth of America to exercise the right to vote. There are to many people in the older generation that seek to keep the young people out of politics. One thing that I thought about when listening to this album was the simple fact that we are the ones who are going to run this country in 20 years, lets make it a place that we can all live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Message! Decent Music!","review":"This CD has songs, like \\"Rock Against Bush vol. 1\\", that plain rock, to those that make your ears bleed *cough* no doubt *cough*.The highlights of this album are; Flogging Molly, Operation Ivy, Rancid, Bad Religion, Dropkick Murphys, Thought Riot, Foo Fighters, and the Unseen. Im not saying the other songs are bad, some of em are, but that those were the clear standout bands on this comp.Politics have always been in punk, from the early days (Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks etc..), to modern day. (Bad Religion, NOFX, Rise Against etc...)On John Kerry: True, he may have lied about service in Vietnam. But for christ sakes! THE WAR ENDED THIRTY F*CKING YEARS AGO!

I carried it for a little bit and some of the black rubbed off of the clip already. The blade however is still spotless and razor sharp. I haven't been able to find out one way or the other what the black coating is made of as the Spyderco catalog doesn't specifically say what it is, like it does with its DLC coated knives.I made a more detailed review of the Native III and its a very similar knife. I don't expect much different with this knife except for a little more longevity on the edge with S30V. Its a very good knife for the money.

This cd runs the gamut from 70's funk to acoustic ballads. This is John's first full solo effort, he wrote a tune for the \\"About Last Night\\" soundtrack back in the mid 80's. His biggest success away from Hall and Oates was the song \\"Electric Blue\\" which he co-wrote for the band Icehouse. Phunk Shui if released in 80's would have many potential hits. Highlights include \\"Color of Love\\", \\"All Good People\\", \\"Unspoken\\" and \\"Phunk Shui\\". All the songs on the album are first rate, the one clunker in my opinion is \\"Go Deep\\" If you like retro grooves, smooth harmonies and musicianship, pick up this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"A GREAT thing that came to those of us who have waited long and patiently for John Oates to come out with his first solo release. If you love John's smooth, soulful, sexy voice, you will cherish this CD. Its worth the cost of the CD to hear All Good People, which is absolute perfection! I first loved Little Angel for the sexy way John stretches his vocals. Once I figured out it was obviously written for his son, Tanner, it became even more special to me. The lyrics are just incredible. I felt most of the CD was an amazing journey inside John's head. I think great music came out of great happiness in life. Way to go, John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phunk Shui","review":"John Oates debut CD has finally arrived! John, the dark haired one of Hall & Oates, the most successful Duo of all time, steps out, in this long overdue solo effort.This music reveals a more personal side of Oates. Notable tracks on this collection are, \\" Color Of Love\\", \\"All Good People\\" and \\"Love In A Dangerous Time\\".For those of us who experienced our rites of passage in the late 60's and early 70's, this musical journey harkens us back, to a time, when our universe exhibited a kinder and more optimistic spirit. If you yearn to revisit those feelings, this CD will transport you there. Oates is a humanist at heart.While this CD will probably not scream up the charts, it is asincere effort and deserves to be heard.

While Sicily undoubtedly has a fascinating and rich history, it did not come through in this work. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the journalist author wrote in disjointed journalistic dispatches: whenever the material began to get interesting, the author dropped the topic and moved on to the next headline; furthermore, his narrow focus on political events (with a smattering of high culture) made the survey of \\"A Thousand Years in Sicily\\" rather superficial. The extraordinarily awful translation only compounded these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olsen is Correct.

My favorite from this album is \\"Shibumi\\" and \\"Exultation\\" that song has such an impact as do the rest but it's as though you can focus your mind on being able to create energy waves and feel that from your very palms.This music is like no other new age I've ever listened to and it kinda gives me the feeling of being able to conquer matter, energy, space and time.

Still, this single is very OK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific look at the Beatitudes vs. the Seven Deadly Sins","review":"I had to read this book for a freshman seminar at college, and I absolutely devoured it. Kreeft is very much a traditionalist - he uses sources ranging from the early Church Fathers to modern philosphers, yet all of them fit together seamlessly to make the point he wants you to get. I have re-read this book several times, and each time I find more helpful information on how to live the type of life Christ calls for. Whether for personal devotion or a study of Christian morality, I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtue-Can We recover It?","review":"Philosopher and Cultural Critic Peter Kreeft has written an outstanding book discussing virture in Western Culture. He opens the book by asking \\"Is Virtue Out of Date?\\". This sets the tone as he spends the next couple of chapters on how Western Culture got to the point in the lack of virtue we now see before us.The middle of his book discusses the \\"Cardinal Virtues\\" and \\"Theological Virtues\\" and their importance. He then does a comparison and contrast between the \\"Beatitudes\\" and the \\"Seven Deadley Sins.\\" His conculsion is a little too short for such a profound work, yet rating this important book four stars would not do it justice. Four and a half would be more appropiate, so I'm rounding it off at five stars.A Must read for all Christians in Western Culture, and others who are concern about the decline of virtue in our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Example of Faith Seeking Knowledge","review":"Peter Kreeft is one of the rare writers and philosophers that can share an in-depth knowledge of Thomism in a way that inspires and moves the reader to Christian action. Kreeft honors the magisterium, rejecting many modern sensibilities while avoiding the straight jacket that some conservatives would use to bind our minds and our wills. In other words, he strikes the moderate tone and has the spiritual insight one might expect from a man that not only just knows about virtue but practices virtue in his life.This isn't the book if you're looking for an academic treatise on Virtue. However, it is a beautiful and inspiring meditation on on the need for the practice of virtue in our private and public life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was awesome.

Definitely not just for kids.","review":"I can see that people are saying that this is more for younger readers, but coming from a teenage bookworm, I absolutely loved it! I'll definitely be reading this more than once, and I rarely ever do that with other books. The reason why I like Full Tilt so much is because it's just so captivating. You don't even feel like you're reading a \\"children's book\\". Everyone can relate. The whole concept of going on \\"rides\\" is just... wow. Awesome to say the least. Also, Neal Shusterman throws in some vivid imagery that takes you into another world entirely. Cassandra's twisted theme-park world, to be more specific. This book is a perfect combination of overcoming your fears and looking deep within to find some things you never even knew about yourself.Overall, an amazing journey that I recommend for readers of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 2K2.","review":"This is probably the most complete NFL game there is. Certainly the best one I've ever played. So it's 2002 and the rosters are out of date and the graphics are a little dated. That shouldn't bother you. The passing, running, and catching are all top notch in my opinion. If you get the hang of it on Rookie, bump up the difficulty to Pro. You'll have to be pretty good to do well on Pro. The A.I. doesn't learn your patterns very well, and you can usually win games by running the same plays over and over (I have about 8 plays I run all the time and I won the Super Bowl last season on Pro setting). I can't say how tough it is on All-Pro, but I will find out some day. If you don't mind if your football is a little old, you really should get this one.

In Nfl 2k, the plays were at least plays that I've heard of. In this game, I never heard of most the plays. Not only that, they got rid of some of my favorite plays, such as Reverse, and The Bomb(which were in Nfl 2k.)

However, can somebody please explain to me why in the world if you turn up the difficulty level to all-pro your recievers drop 90% of the balls that fall in their hands??? This is definitely the biggest problem with the game! It really takes alot of the fun away if you ask me. I know its suppost to be a realistic game but 10 drops a game is really not realistic, only if youre the Bengals or some crappy team like that. Is this just a bug in my game or is this happening to gamers around the nation also? Besides this extremely big problem I would have rated it 5 stars, however I sometimes want to just destroy this game into little pieces when the computer cheats making me drop balls when they were clearly beautiful passes to wide open recievers.

First you can actually get a good running game going. Second the playing is more balanced, but these aren't the best features. The best thing is that you can download as the season progresses. That way if a player comes out of nowhere during the season your stats will reflect. That is the greatest part of this game. Maybe this will keep the market from having a new game every year. You can download an update players every year via VMU or memory card. Also the addition of online play and the downloadable upgrades, not to mention career mode and better graphics (if that's even possible) this will be the greatest football game ever. Eat your heart out PS2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is awsome","review":"This is one of the best sports games Peroid. This has great graphics (can compare to Madden 06 on the ps2) sound is nice, but my favorite feature is the use of the VMU.

The moves the players make are so realistic sometimes it is scary! Nothing is cooler than a couple of juke moves by your RB to bust thru the line for a huge gain!

The rhyming prose is great for her age group and really keeps her attention. Plus, the illustrations by Tim Burton are really wonderful.

The illustrations are magical. However, they do little to disguise the awkward rhymes.

Such is the unique and wonderful world of Tim Burton; his style often does not catch on immediately, but it slowly finds its way beyond \\"cult\\" viewing and into the hearts and minds of mainstream audiences.

I have been studying shamanism, and this is the most useful introductory text I have come across. It will give you the principles you need in order to build your own shamanic practice, without forcing you down the path of a certain cultural shamanic tradition.As Cowan says: not all of us are cut out to be actual Shamans, but anyone can be a shamanic practitioner.I highly recommend this book, whether you are already a practitioner, or are interested in learning more. This is not a book you will regret buying, no matter how advanced your practice becomes over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eclectic Blend","review":"I came upon this book when I first began to explore the depths of shamanic practice. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Within this volume are simple, thorough exercises which teach the basics of core shamanic technique ( such as discovering your totem, the journeys, etc.) The authors also includes many exercises of a more eclectic bent to deepen connections to the natural world in and around us. What is most refreshing is the honesty in which the teachings are presented. The authors do not claim that their teachngs will ultimately turn you into a traditional tribal shaman. They present a shamansim for the modern day and yet manage to pay due respect to the teachings of the ancient indigenous cultures where shamanism was born. Anyone with an intent to explore modern shamanic technique would do well to pick up this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"ok honestly ive only gotten through chapter one so far. and based on my interpretation of what he said is that if i want to practice shamanism i shouldnt copy tradtions but make my own. That to me is like saying pratice but dont do it in the way it was meant to be done. Peopsoanlly i think you can make it your own but first you have to understand why they did things the way they did. he sends alot of mixed messages. He also said that some people hide who they are... the only reason i can see people hiding who they are and living in fear of being \\"exposed\\" is that theyre not comfortable with who they are in the first place. not that they should go shout from the mountian tops or anything but hiding who you are is like saying what your doing is wrong or bad.

They get there by the use of a magic carpet used by a fakir. They only have one way to save the Princess. Rain must pour on the dry land. Cacafonix sings badly enough that the gods in Gaul get mad at him and make it rain. If Cacofonix gets the gods angry in Indea surely it must rain right?

The \\"5625\\" belt comes with an inner padded belt with orange threads marked S, M, and L where you can fold over the velcro to adjust the size. Then you tighten the ballistic nylon outer belt over the padded belt to secure the whole thing to your lower waste. So, I don't know why this vendor lists it as being \\"medium\\".

Stokes","review":"I bought this game thinking it was just another FPS that broke barriers back in the day. I was wrong. This shooter is so much fun that I just could not put the controller down. You pretty much just battle it out in a multitude of well made maps and challenging opponents. I was addicted after the first kill. Playing with someone else in multi-player is even more fun. Going head to head with 3 of your buddies can be a great time, even on an old CRT TV. ;) This game is over a decade old but I still love it. I grew up in the 90's and the early 2000's so I was brought up watching the gaming world develop into what it is today. These games are great for a look back into what was... AND a fun time. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a Dreamcast console. Although some of the controls can be a bit tricky to master, it's suitable for anyone who is familiar with the Dreamcast gaming console and first person shooters."},{"rating":"1","title":"How I wasted (the price)","review":"I bought this game hoping it would be like Unreal Tournament.

It was a highly sentimental book filled with mediocre lines and left nothing to the imagination. If a character is having dinner, George Johnson goes to painstaking effort to describe absolutely all the food, what the table looked like and what kind of chair he is sitting on, but without any emotion behind the descriptions. Indeed, just about every second paragraph is merely a long list of the things in a characters surrounding. This is not good writing. This is not a book.

It's written in an informal, easy to read style. And if you go through the book and do all the examples, you will find yourself quite comfortable with the tools in Photo-Paint. It would also be useful as a general reference text. The author says he is not an artist, but I thought his creations were artistic and they are certainly effective. There are a few unfortunate slips in the hands-on examples, things that wouldn't work because of step which had been omitted or incorrect locations for menu items, but I was always able to figure out how to correct them. Like most rather complex programs, practice is the only way to become proficient.

The author spends more time trying to make smart remarks about the subjects than actually explaining them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah Dallas has done better work","review":"I almost pre-ordered this book because I'd liked stuff Sarah Dallas has designed for Rowan. I'm glad I didn't buy it. This is not a knitting book I'll be adding to my (extensive) collection. The chapters are organized around color themes, which I think is ridiculous -- I want a knitting pattern to be about the shaping of the garment itself, because that's what I'll be doing. Thaks, Sarah, but I can pick my own yarn colors. None of the designs are interesting or original from a design standpoint, from what I saw. They're all fine, but they're pretty generic. If you already own a lot of books and knitting mags, you've probably got a few dozen patterns like these already.

I'm glad I did for the following reasons:1. the Blanket Cardigan (featured on the front cover), and2. the cabled Hot-Water bottle cover (on page 62)Most of the reviewers are right: this book is relatively unimaginative and basic. You likely won't dog-ear dozens of pages to mark projects to try. But every now and then you hit upon an excellent pattern that you knit up time and again for personal or gift use, and I'd consider both the cardigan and the bottle cover one of these patterns.For that reason, I recommend this book.

I found this movie to be rather tedious and Barrymore's accent exceptionaly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring a Barf Bag","review":"Drew Barrymore is beautiful and talented; \\"Riding in Cars with Boys\\" is cheesy and boring.This story was a mess. The flashback of Drew's character in the 1980s to when she was a girl, then a teenager, then an adult--it was chaotic and completely uninteresting.When the main character is in her mid-30's you can actually see in Drew Barrymore's eyes, that she's TRYING to act mature, for the role. Bad acting!Speaking of bad acting, the \\"dramatic\\" scences with the two little kids was just plain SCARY! I don't, nor anyone for that matter, want to see six-year old's breaking down and spouting scornful words like adults!

Besides that it is horribly directed, i felt sorry for the talented actors who were left screaming and shouting in this pitiful story. I don't remember a movie, even movies with war and explosions, that hurt my ears as much as this screamfest. It almost was a horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding in Cars with Boys","review":"I am a huge Drew fan but even my admiration for her could not save this movie. This movie is horendous.

I hated Drew Barrymore in this film (that means she did a good job). The little boy would have been much better off being raised by his junkie dad. The direction is great, the picture is a perfect digital transfer, it's just the story itself. I can only imagine s/m types or Oprah fans enjoying this kind of vicious tearjerking. There is not one likeable character in this film, it's hard to care what happens to this loser family. We are forced to sit through nightmare tragedy after nightmare tragedy. It's like the Jerry Springer show. In the end Drew is a bitter mess that is totally diluted and sad, the kid is in need of therapy, and the dad is... well, pretty much the same as he was in the beginning, a dope. I just can not say anything nice about this film. The only silver lining is that it makes films like HAPPINESS, WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, heck, even ERASERHEAD look like feel good John Hughes films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding in cars \\"ON\\" boys","review":"Nothing but a lame excuse to show the overrated Barrymore's face on the screen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!","review":"Definitely a must see!

What I found was a movie I loved immensely, and one that made me cry at several points. I know so many young girls who should SEE this movie immediately. And Drew Barrymore deserves an award for her performance, to be sure. Adam Garcia fans will have to adjust to his American accent, which he pulls off pretty well, but there are times it seems just a bit forced, or that you can detect just a hint of his usual Aussie accent.

The levels Cassedy writes with are just amazing. The plot is so intricately woven that it marvels me. I read it again this past summer, and simply cried at the end when Lucie stood up to Miss Pimm.

The story: Milda, a young pianist goes to drab industrial small town to play one night, meets the bird-brained working class blonde Andula during the ball, they make love at his hotel room, he returns to Prague, she breaks with her boyfriend after a fight, and decides to go to Prague to meet Milda. As it happens, the pianist lives with his parents, who are totally opposed with Andula staying at their rundown apartment (not that Milda wants her to stay). It is a quite artless film, and it is also ugly the way Andula is treated throughout. Only redeeming feature is Jana Brejchova's affecting performance as a not very bright person who seems to have been bruised more than one time by life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game I ever ran","review":"This is the worst modual I have ever read.

We are then challenged to look through and around the 'crud' that makes up so much of our world rather than leaping into the slime only to re-surface some years later laughing about the irony of living but not living. A fellow reviewer was angry that Mr. Purdy did not include global air quality as a common thing. I think Mr. Purdy is only suggesting that if we can not really look and be dazzled by a childs little fingers and big smile then ...we just may not ever be able to fully comprehend global air quality or really much of anything outside our own little world of trying to laugh about the crud that makes up our list of daily challenges.

Ignorant, stupid, utterly bereft of humor, humanity or wisdom, a childish tome written by a childish scold with no understanding of the world. Purdy should not be blamed for this dismal juvenilia but his publisher should be publicly pilloried. How can writing as ponderous and pointless as this get into print? Just think abou the people whose books were turned down so this could be printed. If you want to get a sense of Purdy's generation read A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers, a book that uses irony to brilliant, humorous effect and shows someone who has dealt with real difficulties in his life, not some pious, over-privileged brat who feels he has a right to lecture people at such a tender age."},{"rating":"1","title":"no concrete solutions","review":"Purdy's book best represents the decline of the American left. Throughout Purdy's book, he never mentions any concrete solutions to America's problems. Instead we just get a diatribe against urbanity and materialism.

Drawing on a wide range of sources from Henry David Thoreau to Jerry Seinfeld; from Edmund Burke to Alexis de Tocqueville to the Bible, this little book is all about the health of living in the public life of a democracy & the world of nations at large upon this varied & much trammeled planet.Jedediah Purdy's thoughts range from avoiding the world to gene therapy; from the business world to the practice of politics; from the meanings of words to the meaning of public responsibility. It has a splendid Bibliography, a useful Index & something to say. Made me take another look at life here in these United States - how we got to where we are & why. An impressive first effort!

Yet he is not limited to his extraordinarily deft touch with language. His concepts in For Common Things reach beyond the kind of psychobabble that usually passes for wisdom in this Spandex society -- agree with him or not, he is a thinker, someone Mark Twain would have gotten drunk with. I myself would like to raise a glass to this intelligent and incredibly gutsy young author. I found his book thought provoking, astonishing, and challenging -- never boring or superficial. He has one trait which distinguishes, and doubtless made his ascent possible: authenticity. Many will break their necks in their hasty attempt to degrade and minimize his work; for those like him, that is the price of being admitted to the pantheon of respected authors.

It is a hideously executed game filled with arduous task after task after task. I feel I'm being punished each time I play this game. With Ecco, the only thing that matters is the stunningly gorgeous environments. Of course, this is inadequate. Where's the fun of completing a long task or the reward of enduring a difficult challenge? If you want to punish a child for a misdeed, force him to play this awful game.

They create myths out of historical facts. For example, Greece has been a nation of crooks since its conception.

Do you know how many pounds actually made it to the balance of the the new Greek state? 190 thousand only. The rest ended in the pockets of the leaders who we have come to glorify as heroes.

The Chicken Almond Salad is the best and the Potato Chowder, Tomato Dill Soup and Spanish Country Soup are my favorites soups. I will say that if you don't want to spend time in the kitchen, this cookbook may not be for you because many of the recipes are a little labor intensive.

The music is the message, and its repeated on the soundtrack.Loaded with tracks from famous freedom singers such as Vusi Mahlasela, Mbongeni Ngema, and the Robben-Island Prison Singers, the soundtrack takes you back to this struggle for freedom, and fills you with the emotions that most certainly drove the people of South Africa to overthrow Apartheid.Perhaps the best thing about this soundtrack(and the film), is its power to motivate.

By the end of the 1950s, Warners was cutting costs in the cartoon department, and these simply don't compare to the classic stuff from the 40s and early 50s.

I very much doubt this claim. Why would they draw a sign if they never intended for anyone to be able to read it?

The top and bottom of the shorts have been cut to adapt them to widescreen format. This makes them unwatchable as bits of the action and animation are missing, the image looks cropped and you keep concentrating on the missing parts. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE viewing. Plus I must say the image restauration doesn't look as pristine as the Golden collection series.What is more unsettling is that Warner Bros keeps doing this all over again, tampering with content (censorship, cropping...) showing no respect at all for intellectual property but most of all no respect whatsoever for the customer. It is disgusting.Sadly I can't recommend the buying of this product and its sister : the Daffy Duck superstar.

After sleep-overs we would groan Saturday mornings about this stuff and cheer when the early and funny ones came on. Often we could tell just by the opening whether it was time to change the channel for ten minutes or not.It's horribly tiresome that whenever Bugs appears on dvd in the last ten years the majority of the discs are crammed with this late material and not the work 1940-1947.I won't be purchasing this one but I hope Warners will collect the early best of America's favorite bunny on a future volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an embezzle!

You don't expect John Williams play \\"Quand Trois Poules Vont Aux Champs\\" in its most primordial simplicity. Yet this is just about what he does on this most enigmatic record. What was the point? Using his renown to help his African friends gain exposure? That's the only explanation I could think of, and if true, it's been awfully nice of him, but still, the musical value of this collection of ditties is zero.

Mel *is* dog's best friend; he and pal Fergus always are having fun together, like two children in a toy store. At the same time, they have their fights with each other. All in all, it always make you smile.And although being a dog person, I cannot help from saying that Cuddles (AKA Claws, the culturally ambiguous cat) has become one of my favorite comic characters ever.

Unfortunately, her choice of writing the book as a journal leads to alot of repetition of thoughts and emotions. No doubt she experienced them every day, but reading the same brief description many times over is not as interesting as if she described the thought process just once in detail (ex: giving thanks to her sister almost every day).

The main problem with this book is that Eade tries to explain rules, etiquette, tactics, strategy, openings, middlegame, and engame -- all in the same book. Longer books have been written that cover only one of these categories! Naturally, this would lead to incompleteness.

I hope that the DVD of the film will have a \\"no soundtrack\\" option, so that we can enjoy the wonderful acting without the constant \\"Da-da-da-da, Da-da-da-da\\" of Philip Glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditative and dramatic at the same time","review":"A very beautiful, sad, touching, flowing, zen-like, brilliant, heart-felt and ultimately thrilling score and performances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Help.....","review":"I like most of Philip Glass's work but this is my favorite.I loaded this CD into my car stereo about four months ago and I haven't removed it yet.I'm never get tired of listening to it and don't expect to remove it from my car stereo soon.It's mesmerizing, moody, intense, and just beautiful.I've watched \\"The Hours\\" 3 times now and enjoyed it more each time I saw it, there is so much there.It would seem to me that either you like Philip Glass's work or hate it - hard to be neutral about it.Try it - if you like it then you are in for a great body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely music that enhanced the film","review":"First of all I was disappointed that the CD of the score did not include the operatic aria by R Strauss used in the film. Glass's music was very nice to underline the three stories in The Hours. I enjoyed it in the movie more than I have on its own but I'm sure there will be times that I'll want to play it at home.I had thought that Phillip Glass wrote in a less melodic style and I liked his use of piano and cello in this music. I noticed that Tommasini in the NYTimes hated the score but most of us ordinary listeners loved the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful...","review":"I don't usually buy scores but after seeing the movie, \\"The Hours,\\" I knew that I had to buy this one. The movie is a revelation and this wonderful score by Phillip Glass helped to add intensity to the beauty and sometimes overwhelming emotions held within this breathtaking feature. If you're not into thought provoking and out of the ordinary movies, then you most likely haven't seen \\"The Hours.\\" However, if you have seen the movie then you know that this album, which brims from beginning to end with inspiring melodies, is definitely a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Glass, But Still Must-Have","review":"The music is quite lush at times, but haunting other times. Overall very beautiful and, of course, a must-have for any Glass fan. With the other releases the past 12 months -- and if you haven't yet bought \\"Naqoyqatsi\\" yet, you are missing a extraordinary experience -- this has been a great time to be a fan of this absolutely brilliant and generous composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"The film was a masterpiece and the soundtrack is incredible.

While her writing and characterization has improved since the first novel in the series (\\"The Jewel of Tamar\\"), the tale is so tragic and heart wrenching that you'll wish you had never read it; everything good and happy found in the first novel is cruelly stripped away. I had hoped that this book would focus more on the dynamics between Tsujataha and Sillara, but instead, it wound the reader through seperate paths of misfortune and heartbreak. If you were a fan of her BGII mod, this book will ruin it for you (and does not fit with that timeline, regardless). If you were a fan of her first book, and are hoping for a happy ending, you will not find it. In sum, the high cost, amaturish writting, and utterly depressing story makes this novel one that you can easily pass over."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the first","review":"I've read them both, \\"The Jewel of Tamar\\" and \\"Born of Evil, Born to Woe,\\" and though the first one is good, the second one is much better. \\"Born of Evil\\" is the conclusion of the epic tale of Sillara and Tsujatha.

The trilogy takes a young soldier from pre-war to post WWII, and is part of the catharsis Germans went through to process their role in the war. Well-detailed and entertaining, it is NOT the equivalent of something like \\"Band of Brothers,\\" of \\"The Pacific,\\" rather a period piece starring many veterans, employing the film technology of the day.

I've since used them on average of once a week to cut and trim back tree branches and saplings as well as roses and other bushes. Fwiw, they do tend to do better on green or growing wood than on dead branches. As another reviewer noted, the foam handle covers can slide off but I glued mine back on and haven't had any problems since.

It's easy to take off and put on plus it really does reduce hand fatigue while working on cars.

The film is marketed in some other Internet sites as an educational film on knife attacks in prison, and how to counter them. In reality, this film is comprised mainly of interviews of ex convicts and former correctional officers who worked in Rikers Island prison. There are some photographs of stabbing victims and some authentic camera footage, but about 90% of the film consists of interviews.The film concentrates on prison violence and corruption in the late 80's and early 90's. I did not find the subject interesting or topical issue. Anybody knows that there is violence among the prisoners, and anyone can claim that the correctional officers are corrupt. And in any case, the cases handled in the film happened over a decade ago.Some people might find these interviews interesting, but I did not learn anything of value or of interest from this film.Run time: 0:43"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Suction!","review":"I bought this for my small efficiency like apartment and thought this was better due to my limited space. I should've just went with a bigger vacuum because this one sucks (and not in a good way). It barely will pick up hair on the floor and I sprinkled carpet fresh/baking soda on my floor to freshen the carpet and it couldn't even pick that up. There is no suction which makes it very hard to pick up hair,crumbs, etc. from the carpet. The only way I can see this working is maybe using on a tile floor. I'm now forced with a vacuum that is useless and not even worth donating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight Eureka","review":"Though it looks a little like a toy vacuum when you take it out, it works so great and has some wonderful and powerful suction.

So happy with this purchase, and a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I read reviews before buying this. I was hoping to use the vacuum for pet hair on furniture, but didn't work very well. However, it worked great on carpet, carpeted stairs, woodwork, ceramic ... on dog hair, dust bunnies. It was also heavier than I expected. The dirt cup was very easy to empty and there wasn't another filter to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usual Eureka standard","review":"For the price, I suppose it was worth it for a couple weeks use, but it's certainly not up to the Eureka name and nothing I would ever recommend to anyone. It's basically a handheld vac with an extendable handle and a VERY cheap head with wheels that plugs into the end. The cord is so short that I can't even do one room without changing outlets, and the cup to empty is pretty much impossible to get off without breaking the entire thing. Again, for the price, it's served it's purpose for a few weeks until I get my real vacuum, but other than that, this was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend a little more on something better","review":"I didn't want to spend a lot on a vacuum since I only have one rug in my apartment.

I don't know how I managed before with two dogs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for only $23","review":"The Eureka vacuum is compact, light-weight and has good suction. I have long brown hair that constantly falls out - in the bathroom and throughout our studio apartment (with hard wood floors). We moved in 1 month ago and have been using a dustpan to sweep all the hair and dust. No more brush tangled with my hair! The Eureka vacuum sucks up my hair without a problem.

For about two months. I have hardwood floors and I really liked it. I mean, the cord is WAY to short, but I just hooked an extension cord to it and went on my way. That is until the part that keeps all the crud in the cup and not in the motor broke. I heard this strange noise and smelt something odd, I took off the bottom part and there was a huge wad of cat hair jammed in the motor intake. I pulled it out and it worked fine for a few days. Then there was a light coming from the vacuum when I last used it...i don't know if it was a small fire or a bunch of sparks, but nonetheless...I shut it off. And promptly threw it away.

Light, good suction- yes even on short nap carpet which surprised me as it had no beater brush. I bought it for bare floors. It does not lose nearly as much suction as the others when the dustbuster type motor filter stops up with fine dust. That said IT IS NOT meant to take the place of a regular vacuum. The nozzle is only 9\\" wide. CONS the cord is 15'- SHOULD be 20'. You have to remove the nozzle to empty dust cup-note: attach nozzle with minimun pressure it will not fall off.

Was okay on kitchen tile...doesn't pick up items the size of cheerios & larger. Very loud motor & plastic wheels clank loudly on tile & grout. Unfortunately, it'll be banished to my kids' playroom since it's short enough & lite enough for a child to operate.

The Featherweight model had a lot of rave reviews about it but, having bought and used both, I think the Boss vacuum is SO MUCH better! The Boss's handle telescopes back into the unit; the Featherweight detaches. The Boss vacuum has more pick-up ability. The floor attachment of the Featherweight, when used on short carpet,lifts up on the backstroke; the Boss model does not. I put the Boss model in our R.V. to do quick pick-ups while on our trips (we bring our cats and needed a vacuum to get up cat litter as well as dirt)what a lifesaver!!!

The vacuum even reaches corners and edges well. As I was vacuuming the floor my toddler dumped the remains of the pretzel bag on the couch, I took off the bottom piece and it worked great!In total you get 3 pieces: The trunk of it with extender arm, the bottom floor piece, and the crevice attachment.

I bought this to vaccum a 4'x6' rug and it is incapable of performing the job. I live in a sandy area so some sand gets on this rug, I think this vaccum expells more sand into the air than it picks up. Also the suction does not seem very good as it doesn't pick up well. Additionally the construction of the floor agitator and wheel assembly is about the same as a childrens toy, which is about the performance you should expect from this product. The only things that I can say which is positive is that it is relatively quiet and it is light.

I'd have sent it back but the shipping fee & my time and trouble (not to mention gas to go to the post office) were not worth the effort.

It also worked surprisingly well on my area rug. It gets lots of cat hair too, and it was a breeze getting it all off.I'd say the only bad things about this vacuum are that it's hard to get the bottom piece off to switch it to a dust buster type vac, it could be easier to empty, and the cord is kinda short, but all in all I think the benefits outweigh the minor design flaws.

Unless they have changed the motor's power I strongly recommend paying another $25-30 for the Eureka cordless model 2 in 1 Easy Clean cleaner.My experience with this model is abysmal. It has too little suction power for even small pickups such as pieces of cat food and is a nuisance to plug in to a different outlet each time you go to another room. Sure it converts to a hand vac but you have to lower the handle and pull off the base part which gives you a smaller but better suction input or put on the easily lost crevice tool.

I'd like something more along the lines of a rectangular shape like the space-saving designed veggie trays in the stores. Oh, I knew it was round when I bought it.

I also noticed my opposing characters always got the best cards and also the best forcejewels even at the easiest setting. The mini-games were OK, but the battles and mini-events were boring and aggrevating. I gave up on it and now trying to trade it for a better Dreamcast Game. If Sonic Team made Sonic Shuffle it WOULD be the best party game in the land.Also if the loadup screens weren't as long it also would improve the game. The graphics and control were the upsides. Overall I would rate 1 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, tedious fun","review":"Do not buy this. I am going right out and saying it. Mabye if you really want to, rent it. the mini games are fun, and are the only redeeming value, every other time you will be bored or frustrated. the graphics are neat, with the cell shading techniques. Also, the load times are not so bad, but every time you do something else besides play the board game, you undergo 2 long load times.(eg, you land on a mini game, it loads, you play it, it loads again) all in all, i expected more in a mario party spin-offp.s- i do not even own a N64 so dont think i am biased to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy this if you are a Sonic collector","review":"I used to think that there would never be a bigger mistake than Sonic Labyrinth. Sonic Shuffle showed me I could be wrong. If you like cel-shading, you might like the art here, but the characters look too flat compared to their surroundings. The music is not Sonicy at all but it does fit the overall mood of the game: irritating. This one was made by a different crew though. The voice acting is dreadful and the lines are corny. The game is extremely slow and dull. The only way to stop the Dreamcast from beating you is to be really lucky or have 4 people playing. Younger kids will be frustrated with this one and older Sonic fans like me will be disappointed. If you have to have everything Sonic like I do, then get this. Otherwise, leave it alone. Get something like Sonic Adventure or Sonic Adventure 2, they're better games and they show off the Dreamcast better than Sonic Shuffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt like this much","review":"i played this game for a good 30 minutes before i gave up. this is [the same as] mario party, but it is much worse. i loved mario party so i was eager to give this one a shot. thhe adventure mode is so boring. it is like playing a board game for that has nothing going on except for the occasional mini game. they werent unique or interesting either. pass this one by folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I read reviews before buying this game and thought it might be fun.

We were both pumped to play it and couldn't wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once. Well, the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing. The game board was right out of Mario Party and didn't look too exciting. The mini-games were dull and too short.Before too long, the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds. And so were the people playing. But it's not like we didn't give it a chance! We persisted. We wanted to like it! Then, my friend did us all a favor: he turned off.

This is a very boring game, and with the AI, they can be very hard to beat, even on the Easy difficulty setting. The game's story is horrible: A fairy named Lumina asks the Sonic team to help her get Precious Stones and save everyone's dreams from Void. Yeah, it's a baby story.The graphics are suprisingly good.The sound is so bad.This game doesn't live up to its full potential.

I believe all documentaries should be produced and directed how they do it. You never get bored watching one of their films. The documentary shows both sides of the story equally. The individuals involved are interviewed and share their stories and the actual video depicting the alleged rape is shown as well. You are left to decide for yourself who is guilty, if anyone. Beyond that, it brings to light the difficulty of defining the word rape and shows that even if there is real evidence (like a video) it doesn't always mean that it is an open and shut case because perception of the victims actions differs from person to person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I read some of the critiques of the first novel by these authors and wisely avoided that book.

When I read a novel, be it fiction or non, I look to be educated or learn something that can be used to educate someone else. Looking over my shoulder seductively in a thong isn't exactly what I had in mind. The writers made sure to mention the use of condoms, but only after they had \\"nibbled\\" on their partner's goods, first. Call me crazy, but what's the use?

How about that, Ms. Howard?As you Amazonee's can see, I'm so disappointed with this novel, and would only recommend it if you care about nothing but fashion! Take it from me. Save your money.

The only glitz and glamour is in the minds of the two people responsible for the book (I cannot, in all good faith and fairness, bring myself to call them authors, or even writers), and while some of the people in the book are apparently rich, nobody is famous, except in their imagination.

I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month.

But it has become very clear to me that BlueProton is NOT the company from which to buy it. They obviously couldn't care less about their customers, so I strongly recommend that their potential customers go elsewhere to buy anything they might have bought from BlueProton. Yes, they offer great prices on some items. But what does this matter if you pay your money and get less than you ordered, and when you try to contact them about it, they ignore you?

Over the course of my career, I have read over sixty leadership books, and this by far is the worst one I have read.The author painfully stretches stories to fit his proposed point of view. Please do not misunderstand me, I believe leaders can lead quitely; however, his examples and portrayal of leaders was awefull.I will never recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to be a good leader.

I'm not sure who this book is for. Mr. Badaracco seems to find many of the ordinary human aspects of business startlingly unique, and is pleased to guide us through these unique and unusual places. The problem is, anyone with half an ounce of common sense had Mr Badaracco's epiphany when they were 23. This is old hat. It's common sense.My new goal in life is to somehow get associated with Harvard so I can churn out books stating the obvious and enjoy an avalanche of cash.This book is silly. I'm so disappointed.For an excellent book on leadership and management, check out \\"First Break all the Rules\\" by the Gallop people. Or connect the unconnectable and read \\"If you Want to Write\\" by Brenda Ueland. Either will get you much further along than \\"Leading Quietly.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst leadership book ever written.","review":"The author needs help. He committed only to a four year study on leadership from some bureaucratic corporate stuffed shirts and wonders why their not inspiring leaders. Leadership is a 10,000 year study,read the bible. Leadership is ones ability to influence others not create committee's. Badaracco managed to squeeze in real leadership traits in with bureaucratic ones as if to substantiate the claim. One knows that most managers and leaders are uninspiring that's why most corporations eventually fail and people change jobs like underwear. There are a lot of books out there, some are complete hype with a catchy title others like this propose to reinvent poor leadership traits in with good ones as if its something new. Don't waste your money. Read some of the old books on leadership and success like the Bible, and get Jim Rohn's The Art of Exceptional Living (Audio)(he has a list of must read books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry and academic with little practical advice","review":"Contains some interesting observation by the author but the book is very academic with very little practicable advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on Windows XP or Vista","review":"This was going to be such a great gift for my 8 year old.

The features are about equal to cameras of this kind but the overall quality of the workmanship is excellent. Everything works (functions) exactly like what is documented in the instructions. The quality of the photo's are excellent, most likely due the quality of the optics.Draw backs: Plastic housing makes the camera feel cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this camera in April 1999 having read several good reviews. Have to say I'm disappointed; the lens is undoubtedly sharp (though on normal size prints, the advantage is negligible) but the exposure/focus/flash system rarely gets it right. Exterior daylight shots, about one in four is OK. Inside or night, far less. Have tried different ISO rolls, different processors, variations on the manual settings as well as leaving it on fully auto, but no improvement. What is annoying is comparing with the shots taken under same conditions by friends with P+S Pentax etc. (Olympus seems expecially good). They paid half the price and get twice the result! Will not be buying another Leica compact again - have the impression I paid for the name and possibly the lens, but lost out on the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Point and shoot.","review":"I love this camera.

If you are familiar with Kings of Convenience, most likely, you will be pleasantly surprised with the results. While the album is far from sounding like Kings of Convenience (well, maybe it sounds a bit like Versus at times), it still retains that certain Erlend-ness and builds upon it. The CD is catchy with an infectious 80's vibe resurfacing throughout; it's very danceable, diverse, and creative. Oye has a unique vocal delivery and continues to establish himself as a pop-music wizard. Sometimes his approach grows a little tiresome, as on the particularly bland 'Every Party Has A Winner and A Loser,' but every song on here deserves a listen. Overall, it is a more than acceptable substitute for a new KOC album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original artists, and conveniently not mentioned.","review":"I had my suspicion when I saw the price and it was only confirmed when I received the album, unfortunately it was NOT stated who the artists WERE on the page.

But if they had had \\"Live and Let Die\\" listed as a sample it would have been painfully obvious... I'd appreciate in the future if albums like these were labeled a little better...

There is a saxophone jazz solo in the Bond theme that was made up for this song. Instead of ending with the guitar strum it goes into another sax solo and fades out. Thunderball is played at twice it's normal speed. The singers are lousy. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is mot even the on the CD. Instead it's a song that doesn't appear on OHMSS under it's name. The only memorable song is Casino Royale which sounds exactly like the original. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Best of the James Bond Themes\\"?...only the titles","review":"This by far the worst of the renditions of the Bond themes. First, all of the performers (I can't call them singers), sound worse than the worst (aka cheeziest) Las Vegas lounge act. And since I live in Vegas, you can believe me when I say this. Second, the orchestrations are horrific. Third, there are some songs that don't even exist in the movies! This waste of time and energy is good for one thing...a big LAUGH! If you get together with your fellow hardcore Bond fans and play this CD, get drunk and laugh for hours. This is a pathetic effort to cash in on Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa fanboys, cool your jets.","review":"No these songs aren't directly from the movies. What this is, is a remix compilation of the James Bond theme songs from the Starlite Orchestra and Singers. I don't understand the hate this little album gets. These are some classy remixes, in particular my personal favorite is the remix of \\"A View To Kill\\". This just personal preference but the stylized synth and vocal work made me think of early 80's electronica such as Tangerine Dream.All in all I recommend you listen to the samples first if you are a rare music collector. There are some gems on this album that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect large folder","review":"I've had this knife for over a year now, and it never lets me down. Although it is large, it can still easily fit in a pocket. The AUS-8a steel blade is comparable to 430 stainless and thus resists corrosion; however, it has a more natural tendency to take a good edge than most other stainless steels. The handle offers quite a secure and ergonomic grip. The blade lock is (IMHO) the most favored system and offers a secure safeguard against an accidental close. If you want a quality folder that is rugged in every sense of the word, the MULE should be at least a consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ka-Bar 2-3051-6 Mule Field Folder Knife","review":"Absolutely love this knife. Solid, sturdy, sharp out of the box and well made. The only issue I experienced with the knife (which amazon resolved quickly by swapping it with another one) is that one screw was missing. I highly recommend this folding knife. Should you decide on this knife I would recommend tightening the hardware as soon as you get it, (#6 and #8 torx are required).

The movie starts out with Van Damme being called a tough guy and as usual he gets the girl. It's all fiction.Van Damme, who got his claim to fame from the movie Bloodsport, only got into 2 fights in this movie. The rest of the movie is basically him commanding other people to do what he says. He doesn't talk firm; he just talks with a constant low tone with no firmness all throughout the movie.

And now Van Damme surfaces in this by the books action film set (where else?) in Romania, the country where making films must be enormously cheaper than anywhere else.

Yes, there are scams involving vitamins, but there are con artists in EVERY industry/profession. Many of their arguments are illogical and/or just plain silly. The authors are clearly very biased, and, ironically (though not to my surprise), they provide no scientific references from the literature to support their claims. Further, the argument that vitamins pills would grow on trees if we needed them is an example of their illogical and unreasonable nature. Fortunately doctors like Herbert don't grow on trees; for if they did, we would surely be comdemned to a life of mediocre health. Herbert, with his perpetual campaign against nutritional supplements, is doing humans a disservice in an age of a degraded food supply and overwhelming evidence that nutrients can prevent and treat disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book will save the World from being OD by Vitamin","review":"Supplement means to supply a deficiency.

To attack vitamins where the cost is low, substantial benefits have been proven in trials and toxicity is virtually non-existant is ludicrous.

The two have the obvious parallel of skilled guitar playing and a folkish sound (though DiFranco's on the deep end of it.) The problem is that, like McKeown, DiFranco can serve up some good lyrics...but unlike the skilled McKeown, Ani Difranco simply cannot sing. The whole time at the show - and on this disc - she just talks very fast in a sing-song voice over skilled guitar playing, but that's not deserving of attention at all. Lots of personality, but that can't compensate for her \\"singing\\". She'd make a good background guitarist providing backing vocals maybe, but she can't fill up the center of a stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"what music should sound like","review":"I've been an Ani DiFranco fan for sometime now and appreciate all of her music/spoken word. I've never been one to write reviews and/or rant about one particular album by an artist, but Knuckle Down is a different story. I truly think this album is what the culmination of genuine quality and talent sounds like. Knuckle Down has slow lingering tunes like callous, minerva, studying stones, sunday morning, parameters, that resonant through the walls of your soul. While on the other hand it also has slightly more upbeat and sincere tracks like the title track, manhole, modulation, paradigm, and lag time. Ani has grown immensely through the 15+ years she's been making music and in shows in all of her work. Knuckle Down is Ani doing what she does best: telling stories, expressing life as she experiences it, and making beautiful meaningful quality music.

I hadn't bought any new Ani music for a long time. The last couple I had listened to did not seem to have the same intensity as her earlier material, but I decided to take a chance on this one and was thoroughly impressed. Unlike others that reviewed the album, I really enjoy \\"Seeing Eye Dog\\", it has a bluesy, gritty feel, but has Ani's signature sound throughout.Do not expect this to sound like her earlier works, while it is an album full of integrity, this album has a fuller, more produced sound to it.

Far from it. The book contains no bibliography and very few footnotes. The writing style is simplistic, sometimes even pedantic, and the presentation of topics and viewpoints, particularly coming towards the modern era, ranges from slightly to flagrantly biased. The ethnic conflicts of the nineteenth century are blamed entirely on Russian imperialism, the Ottoman Empire \\"had no choice\\" but to ally with Germany in the First World War, the tragic plight of ethnically cleansed Muslim populations is discussed in detail but that of Christians is not mentioned or glossed over as military necessity etc. This is a great book only if you are looking for a naively composed compilation of various sorts of post-Ottoman apologism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Deal","review":"This game Is asome the graphics are great all the players look like themselves (unlike NBA Live) you could do street ball, playoffs, Season, franchise, and more the players do awsome dunks and for only [$$$] Go And get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Game","review":"I bought this game because the Dallas Mavericks were doing good(2-0).

My own research shows there is what I believe to be a definite link between cancer and diabetes; I'd like to see this discussed further by Dr. Quillen. However, even as an older reference book, this is a must-read for diabetics, especially type II. The diet recommended by the ADA is so far off the mark, that any diabetic following it will surely struggle to keep their H1ac and blood sugar levels in the recommended range... just TOO many starchy carbs, leading to more medications, more complications, and more problems.

Starring Tommy Lee Jones in a surprising but richly merited Oscar nominated performance, the film is notable for its ambitious depiction of the Iraqi conflict and the anguish of veterans who, when coming home, carry both physical and psychological scars. As a murder mystery, \\"Elah\\" is too ful of unrealized subplots, sketchily drawn minor characters and portentious symbols to be successful, yet it derives considerable strength from the leathery countenance and taut body language of Jones, who is perfect and poignant in every detail.

It does this with high intensity and without any cheap political shots. One might even say it manages to keep its subject out of the political area. It does not discuss the question whether the invasion ought to have been done in first place, it only shows how the role of occupiers in a civil war constellation destroys the life of the soldiers of the occupying force. Its subject is not the dead on either side, but the destruction in the souls and minds of those who survive.The movie shows that Hollywood has not become entirely irrelevant; it is an argument against those who claim that Hollywood has nothing to add to civilization, or that its influence is only devaluing morality.It also shows that films can be made with more than making money in mind.And a personal lesson: if you ever receive signals of distress from your son or daughter, please listen, or you might have to regret it like T.L.Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear","review":"This is a dishonest film that suggests all military in combat can return home, still kill someone and, immediately after the deed, satisfy a hungry stomach.

The film also suggests that this is an issue unique to the situation in Iraq. All military, in all countries, in all wars have members who committed such acts. If you're going to protest the war in Iraq, through a screenplay, do so addressing the issues pertaining to this war. If you feel that the soldiers are victims, say it more clearly than how it is done in this screenplay. I say this as a Liberal Democrat. \\"In the Valley of Elah\\" is as narrow and dishonest, in its information, as John Wayne's Right Wing \\"The Green Beret.\\" The war in Iraq is too complex to try to squeeze your opposition to it into a script about a homicide investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti military","review":"This movie has some good performances but it is very difficult to watch.

The androids themselves engender more sympathy, even though they lack the grand reason for being that they had in the movie. They are simply there, and they're not supposed to be. While the movie ended on a note of hope and redemption, the \\"hero\\" of this book has a lot less satisfying ending, leaving the reader with a dreary image of the future.I like the fleshing out of the bounty hunter profession and backstory, the additional androids, and the complexity of the Rachel character as more than a cross-species love interest. I think they could easily make a movie based on this book that follows it more closely than Bladerunner and still be its own movie and a sci-fi hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"i was required to read this book for class and it turned out to be very interesting and fascinating.

Properly read, his words will change you forever.Unfortunately, Mr. Dick is no longer with us and his books are almost impossible to find. I suggest you check your used bookstores and try to find additional titles.Here are some of my favorites:\\"Vulcan's Hammer\\", \\"Solar Lottery\\", \\"The Man in The High Castle\\".If you have read this far and find a copy of \\"Vulcan's Hammer\\" in excellent condition, I would be interested in obtaining it.

It is too long to be a short story but not long enough for a novel. I felt no real connection to any of the characters. They were not fleshed out and their world was not convincing.The protagonist, Rick Deckard, seems just as emotionally stunted as the androids he \\"retires\\" for a living.

This is the only book of his that I have read, but I am well versed in science fiction and cyber punk. The book is strong, the writing style is typically sci-fi, fairly straight-forward with periods of techno-babble which later make sense. THe plot is interesting and thought-provoking, and when Kurt Vonnegutt wrote about sci-fi authors in Breakfast of Champions, I think he must have been thinking of PKD. This is science fiction as well as philosophy, and I recommend this book. If you like it, I also recommend you read Neil Stephenson (Snow Crash, oh yeah), Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game), Robert Heinlein (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress), and whoever it was that wrote Neuromancer, I forget his name. All of their books rule but the ones I mentioned were my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exception to the rule that books are better than movies","review":"To be fair, I found only a glimmer of similarity between the two pieces. Both pit a number of human-engineered automatons against a single cop, but after that setup the two pieces couldn't be more dissimilar. Dick's work is laborious, boring, the action stagnant with philosophy. There are points when Dick could delve (interestingly) into the hero's psyche and render the author's philosophical and moral arguments more convincingly with action; instead, the writing is too concerned with the sort of adolescent, masturbatory concerns that have tainted science fiction in the past. If you want a brainy, philosophically overwrought read, pick this up.

I think the main reason I found it enjoyable was that the book maintains a constant flow-not necessarily an easy read, but not cluttered by computer lingo that can be confusing to the layperson. The interactions between humans and androids were much more intricate than that in previous books I have read, for example, Deckard and Rachel's relationship.

There's really little to be said about this book that hasn't already been combed through by geeks the world over, but it's worth reading, as much for the anachronistic references to 1992 (Hovercars! Weren't those sci-fi prognosticators just too cute?) as for whatever exploration of existential alienation. But let's be honest with ourselves: This book would never have been read by anyone but adolescent boys with acne, halitosis, and girl problems if it weren't for the success of Warner Brothers' overrated 1982 film version, Blade Runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet (unlike the movie)","review":"Weather or not you've seen Bladerunner, you will like this story the way PKD tells it.

A must read for even non-sci-fi fans as it could be the book that converts you to the genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of all time favorites","review":"This has been one of my favorites for decades. The movie Blade Runner was shallow and disappointing after the book. I recently re-read it and \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" holds up just as well now as it did when I first read it in the early '70s. Like any good psychopath, the androids lack empathy. While more intelligent than humans, the androids are chilling and horrifying, even as both the main character and reader find themselves questioning their own sympathy for them. As the android Rachel says: she has \\"empathy\\" for herself. And yes that does make them fundamentally different from the rest of us humans and animals that do have empathy for each other. Is this about robotics?: no. It's about what makes us whole sane beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those poor andys","review":"2.5 really. Definitely not my favorite. I can appreciate PKD's vision of what the future could be, but I didn't like the character of Rick Deckard at all. I couldn't feel anything for him except dislike. There were also quite a few times in the book where I had to stop, scratch my head, and then re-read the passage, and it still didn't quite make sense to me. (Or as I like to call them, my \\"Huh?\\" moments.) I can see how this influenced cyberpunk and later sci-fi authors, and I appreciate this novel for that, but it just didn't work for me. I read this quite a while after I had seen the movie, and I liked them both about the same. The book and the movie are significantly different from each other, and Deckard follows different paths to achieve the same goal of \\"retiring\\" (killing) the androids. I thought that paths were interesting, just not interesting enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Future","review":"really interesting ideas of the future are in this book. Dont go into this book thinking your going to read about the movie, there are expansions and different directions that the movie just could not capture. Great book and a scary look into our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG EDITION","review":"Completely disappointed and feel cheated for Amazon and Oxford not making it more obvious that the paperback was a rewrite....would go so far as to call the edition and sale fraudulent. What author wants their words re-written? Be very careful when deciding on which edition to purchase...the original is worth every penny and more....one of my top 10 books of all time....continue to reread through the years. Philip Dick is one of the best writers of the despair of human existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy clothed in futuristic wordplay","review":"Philip K Dick has woven more than an interesting story. \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" was a study in humanism more than it was a science fiction classic. Readers who often ponder over what it really means to be human will be well rewarded for the hour they spend reading it and again, the hours they spend musing over the mentally deficient character in the book and the mutilations that a spider suffers at the hands of the near-human androids. The science fiction part of the story is interesting, but what really makes the book a must-read is the way it has dealt with human comnpassion and empathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated science fiction?","review":"I think this book is flawed in its construction. I'll give an example: after the main character discovers a complete android infrastructure, a shadow social world, he does nothing about it. He has killed his target, and the existence of the shadow society no longer interests him. This is absurd, the same as the fact that the androids had engaged humans to kill androids, and these humans had never heard of the real thing. The book presents interesting possible future problems on androids, but I don't like the way they are handled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and Perplexing","review":"I first saw the movie BladeRunner before I read the book. The book to me was hard to understand especialy when Isidore had hallucinations or dreams. The book did not explain who Mercer is or who the killers are. The androids in the book seemed stupid compared to the ones in the movies and made less an effort to survive or fight back. The book was partialy intresting but became boring at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as powerful as the movie","review":"Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all time, and picking up this book I expected alot. Dick's writing is completely contrary to Ridley Scott's film, though. Dick's style focuses on queer details about the philosophies of the future (Mercerism, obsession with animals), whereas Scott conveys the more poignant details about the fine line between replicants (andys) and humans. The most crushing difference between the two was the purpose of an android four year life span. In the book, it is simply a question of the cells dying without regenerating. In the movie, it is an engineered tool used to kill the replicant slave just as it gains the emotional capabilities to appreciate life. There are no emotional adaptations in the andys of Dick's book. The androids are so callous and loathsome that the reader doesn't care when Dekkard retires them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and worse than the movie","review":"My 2 cents. It's no surprise that the book is deeper than the movie (Bladerunner) in characters and overall plot. I liked the whole Mercer story. But the movie is more fun in the andy \\"killing\\" parts. Its a great book and now I want to see the movie again!Blade Runner: The Final Cut"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Expectations","review":"The first 1/3 of this book was very intresting to me and really kept me in it, as the foundations of the story were laid. It slowed down though when Deckard met up with his first android target. The next 2/3 of the book had interesting ponderings and the quest for the answers by Deckard,but the action in the book was a big let down.Most action parts were covered in one confusing sentence that left me with a, \\"What happened?\\". The action in the book also seemed to be spaced a bit strangely also. Overall, an okay book, but somewhat of a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional","review":"Bravo to Katherine L.

A further disappointment was actually using the camera.

It's one of those pop songs that recalls the best of the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The songs on 'Grand Prix' are irresistably catchy, and they get better with each listen. It's a shame this record has not been given it's due recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarship -- for a change","review":"I cannot add much to the prior customer review of this volume, which is comprehensive. Let me just add that, as a practicing attorney, I found this volume a delight to read. The author demonstrates a (proper)scholarly indifference to the outcome of his study, and seems content to deal with whatever the evidence actually shows about Jung. This book lacks the sensationalist \\"juice\\" of Noll and McLynn, but who needs the latter? I would rather read the relatively dull truth about Jung than entertaining (but misleading) insinuations and faulty research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very convincing","review":"I read Shamdasani's book together with the two books by Richard Noll. When you compare the books, it is clear that Noll's scholarship is thorough, devestating to Jung, and convincing. Shamdasani's book, which at 144 pages is actually more of a pamphlet, is a strange, mean-spirited, attack on Noll that borders on the personal. It is an odd book that seems to have been written in a jealous rage. Obviously Noll is the more talented scholar, and Shamdasani wastes his arguments on trying to undermine Noll without offering anything new and convincing. It is not surprising that this book has not been reviewed by serious publications, as Noll's have. Thank goodness I did not buy this book, but read it in one long sitting in the cafe at Borders. Shamdasani's book is a waste of time and money. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An underachievement. Not very good scholarship.","review":"I settled down to read this book, hoping I would find a stimulating rejoinder to Richard Noll's work, and was disappointed. If this is the best critique of Noll that the Jungians can muster, then the Jungian community is in deep, deep trouble. Shamdasani detests Noll -- and that is the only fact one learns after reading this short book. I wasted my money buying it. I would urge others to pass on this one and wait for more sophistated works of Jung criticism to appear."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"It was reversed bladed, but the blade was flimsy.

The channels and availablity of music is legion. There is so much really good stuff out there it boggles the mind. So when something turns my head, I stop and ask myself what is it about this music that warrants replay after replay. Soul first of all. Craft, poetics, a singular voice, heart, reverence for roots, work ethic and most of all, a feeling that this album was written to me alone. She feels like a friend I could call at 3AM. I also respect the way she knows from parentage and experience that a good solid album is only the first step. She gets out there and makes herself known. I buy my music carefully. I'm not even close to making a decent living. With all the ways of stealing music it's all the more important to support those who put their lives out there and fight for recognition.

Chris Haslam has my favorite part with his amazing tech and weird tricks from his kickflip one footed nosemanuals, lipslide to bigspin out or even a one footed handrail grind. Cooper Wilt and Greg Lutzka have solid parts. Rodney Mullen and Daweon Song have the big parts against eachother. The skating is definately amazing and technical. Rodney mullen has a fun part with a whole bunch of different spots and tricks and Daewon comes through with crazy combos. I hate to say it but somehow the two parts get a little redundant. I love both the guys' skating but Daweon's part seems to get a bit repetitive with constant flip/manual action. I like Daweon's Skate More part better and even Rodney's Opinion part seems a little more exciting. Overall it is a great video with a few fun extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I thought it would be","review":"I saw the first Vs. video a long time ago and it blew me away.

Finally, she hit the bull's eye with Senora Tentacion in 1994. I was in my mid-20's when I bought this album and can only describe it as BEAUTIFUL ! The way Lucia looks on the cover as a '40's or '50's Hollywood seductress is the way her vocal talent and music shine on this album ! Her interpretation of composer Agustin Lara's music is in fine form here. It's about time she put out an album with a style of music that would give her vocal ability a great workout. You can feel the emotion, the passion and heart from Lucia on this one. With this collection of romantic boleros she has recaptured the faith of my older relatives as well as the younger crowd. Senora Tentacion gets more than 5 stars !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time classic bolero album.","review":"This CD can be viewed as the \\"soundtrack\\" to the superb Telemundo soap opera \\"Senora Tentacion\\" in which Lucia Mendez plays the role of a cabaret/lounge songstress in an imaginary Latin American country (in the 1950s) torn apart by political turmoil and civil unrest. On this gorgeous album, Mendez gives \\"modern\\" (but true-to-the-original) interpretations of 12 of the legendary Agustin Lara's most famous compositions. If you like the music of yesteryear's great boleristas (Pedro Vargas, Tona La Negra, Tito Rodriguez, Chucho Avellanet, etc.) I strongly recommend your buying this CD if you can find it as it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"romanticly excellent","review":"She is one of the most popular singers in Mexico.

Of course, I carry it on my key ring and there's a lot of abrasion there, but Leatherman should think of such a thing. I don't mind the look of my worn and weary!

I was a little reluctant to carry it at first, but it was a gift so I kept it. Now, six months later, I find indispensible on a daily basis. It has a small, but sharp knife, an excellent scissors, and functional drivers, both straight and phillips. What is most impressive is the is the engineering, there is no give or movement in the the mechanism as it is moved into the various postions to use its various tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but needs one change to be perfect","review":"This somewhat sturdy tool is a very useful combnation that fits in most pockets without you unintentionally advertising its presence by having it there (it's small).The scissors are pivoted with a stamped rivet, so you cannot adjust how tightly the scissor blades come together. so as they become loosert over time, they become pretty much useless as scissors. Also, because of the rivet, you cannot take the scissors halves apart for sharpening--which also limits their useful life. So a small screw instead of a rivet would make this very very good tool just about perfect, although unavoidably more expensive.On the onther hand, at twenty bucks, you might just treat the item as semi-disposable and figure that you will replace the whole thing every few months (years, depending on use)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"I gave one of these to all of my groomsmen- they liked them much better than a money-clip or beer stein. Got one for myself as well- Durable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was given this product used as a gift by a customer at a store. My initial response was that it would be useless, but I now carry it in my pocket quite frequently. A scissors is one of the most useful portable tools to have. Unlike other pocket knifes (e.g. swiss), the scissors on the Leatherman Micra is useable, even for cutting annoying plastic packaging on electronics. I will note that the tweezer side sometimes allows pocket lint onto some of the tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Favourite Tools!","review":"Leatherman is a very useful and handiful tool because its has 10 different tools in one ultra-compact unit. If you are going to walk in the forest with your friend, you will take this Leatherman Silver Micra with you. It's small enough for pocket or keychain! After the two hours walking, you are so tired and thirsty that you want to take a little break. You open your wine bottle with your botton opener. \\"I am hungry not thirsty,says your fried.\\" You'll give him your Leatherman and he begin to make a fire.

This little trip was a very comfortable and interesting only because boys have a one Leatherman with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Useful Multitool for those Small, Unexpected Jobs","review":"The Micra fits my criteria for a multitool that I can attach to my keychain: it's compact, sturdy, and has the basic tools that I want.While I consider the tool to be well made, I think you also need to have realistic expectations. I've heard other people talk about the knife nicking trying to cut cable, or the file breaking while trying to pry a door open. I don't think any of the Micra's tools were designed to replace its larger counterpart. On the other hand, I've used keychain-sized pocketknives before but they tend to be pretty flimsy; the scissors are only good for cutting paper, and the screwdrivers feel like they'll snap with any decent amount of torque. I think the Micra holds up pretty well - for small jobs. I've had mine for almost three years now, and even though I use it a few times every week it's still in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Bother getting one with a color","review":"I bought a red micra about two weeks ago and have on my key chain.

While not suited to the sort of heavy-duty repair that its larger brothers are capable of, the tiny Micra is still a very handy toy, small enough to live in your pocket and well suited towards the kinds of tasks found in an office today. The scissors is actually very usable- much more so than the toy that comes on the larger Swiss Army Knives. Ditto the tweezers, with their hardened, polished tips.

Now, these many years later, I have a greater appreciation for her portrayal here and I find that I am quite pleasantly surprised at her work. There is a subtle revelation of who Apple Annie really is that is quite beautiful to see. Her performance is so reserved that she seems to give the picture away to her co-stars, but what is actually happening is a remarkably intelligent development of character that only adds to Davis' range as an actor. She is, in a word, superb. All the actors are wonderfully cast in this truly delightful gem of a Capra film. For Davis, an excellent cast and the overall high production standards of this movie - 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acting and Very Fun","review":"Wonderful story line that's hard to watch without laughing.

Everyone was trying to be funny rather than playing it in a serious mode and allowing the plot to supply the humor. I'm a big Glenn Ford fan but never found him to be accomplished in comedies. He's miscast as Dave the Dude, a part better suited to someone like Dean Martin. Peter Falk is excellent as is Bette Davis as Apple Annie, but the film falls flat. I never really liked the 1933 version \\"Lady For a Day\\" any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra, Oh Sinatra, where art thou???","review":"I have no doubt that this would have been a better (and more enduringly popular) remake had Frank Sinatra agreed to play the role of Dave the Dude. Dean Martin was another of Capra's early choices. While I've never been a Martin fan, it could have been interesting watching him and Davis.Glenn Ford tries VERY hard, but IMO he's hopelessly miscast here; I find Ford stiff and utterly charmless in the role of Dave, the soft hearted gangster.Happily, Davis saves the day and runs away with this movie, all while delivering what may be the most low-key performance of her career. The rest of the cast is terrific--Edward Everett Horton's butler is a tiny gem and a touching farewell performance.While this is not among Capra's best, it's essential viewing for any film fan. And hey, even if he didn't star in the film, at least Sinatra recorded the theme song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"Sure this book is well written and educational, but talk about BORING and UNINTERESTING.

I also did not expect it to kink as much. Gads, it kinks like crazy. I cannot recommend this hose. Being larger in diameter I did think I would be more difficult wind up but it is. Can't tell ya how disappointed I am in this hose. I cannot recommend it . I would recommend a smaller diameter hose and get a stronger flow and more powerfull flow ... which makes sense, smaller opening makes a stronger flow.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems well made","review":"While I haven't used it a lot yet, this hose seems well made, and is fairly kink resistant.What I really like about it is the 'full flow' fittings. I needed all the flow I could get, and unlike some hoses I have looked at, the fittings are not a restriction. About the only trade off I can see, is that it takes an o-ring at the fitting, instead of the standard hose gasket."},{"rating":"2","title":"This hose is large","review":"You will not find a better made hose.

There is still a slow drip, even after that effort and added expense.�?The hose kinks. Not just in overly-stressed angles but constantly. This is what killed the hose for me. I've used the lowest grade box store hose that didn't kink this much. Its a never ending battle of stopping to walk back and un-kink it.There was no way I was going to pack it up for shipping back.

But now I see that one book in this series is in an anthology - an anthology I have no interest in purchasing, since I don't especially like the work of the other authors included. In addition, anthology stories tend to be too short and unsatisfying.Write a one-off story for an anthology, by all means, Ms Kenyon. But WHY put part of an ongoing series in one? It only irritates loyal readers, who feel ripped off at having to pay full novel price for an unsatisfying novella. They will either pay it and feel dissatisfied, or not pay and feel unhappy about having missed out on part of a series due to what seems like the author's lack of forethought.-wmr-uk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, bad and ugly","review":"This anthology was a huge disappointment to me, and I was shocked at the lack of quality in the last two stories. Sorry, but this book just isn't worth the cover price.The Sherrilyn Kenyon story was oversimplified and lame, but I'd say it was decent considering the length restriction. It seemed really short. The Amanda Ashley story was enjoyable, but if I had one complaint it was that there was sexual tension between the two main characters that Ashley did nothing with.Red Moon Rising was a good story with plenty of action and I'll definitely look up more of Lori Handeland's work. As for Make It Last Forver... This story was absolutely awful. It rambled on, had no point, had thoroughly dislikeable, unattractive characters and there was no payoff at the end. From this one example, I'd say that LA Banks is a poor writer in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING (with one exception)...","review":"Simply put, the stories in this anthology were amusing if a little staid, not living up to the zing or power of some of the more hip collections (How to be a Wicked Woman, etc.)The one exception to this rule was the story by L.A. Banks. That one was awful. Absolutely awful. Too much description, not enough conversation, a hero who's saving the world by playing his guitar (huh?) and an ending that was not only dissapointing, but down right absurd. I will certainly not be searching out any other stories by this author, and will avoid any anthologies she's included in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Supernatural Romances","review":"If you enjoy reading cheesy romance novels with lots of steamy sex, this is the book for you.

It was fun but sadly felt a little too quick and a little bit lacking in depth even for a short story. I felt like I could have picked this book up in the bookstore, finished her story in 20 minutes and put the book back,Amanda Ashley' story was so blah and unreadable. I trudged through it. The ended made little sense and I was left thinking Huh?The L. A. Banks story I gave up trying to read. Perhaps it is me but for some reason I just cannot get into books that start off in 1979.Lori Handeland's story I found a little better.

Ahhh if I had endless line of credit card with no worry about the payment I be in heaven.HOWEVER... and I mean HOWEVER, the rest of the collection of short stories is........ dull.

Her writing is spectacular and her character's are vivid and interesting. I purchased this book in the hopes that not only would I get a good story from Ms. Kenyon, but also read other authors of the same genre who I might find interesting. I must say that I was disappointed by these stories. While Ms. Kenyon's full length books tend to enthrall the reader (except for most dream hunter ones, but that's for another time) I found her story and the others in this compilation lacking something. Perhaps the genre does not lend itself to the short story as well as the full length novel and those who haven't read the full length novels might like it.

Grady tries to redress this in 10 Lies that the Church Tells Women. As a husband and father of four daughters he approaches the subject lovingly and with intelligence. He believes that women have a right to equal opportunities and choices long denied them by misogynists, the Church and fearful chauvinists. He does not shy away from criticizing the damage done to women's rights by modern day feminists who have concentrated on gay rights and abortion. He points out that the first proponents of women's rights were 19th century Christian men and women. This is an excellent book for a balanced, well reasoned and biblically sound exposition on the oppression of women by the \\"church\\".

I have always felt a call to ministry but for the first 30 years of my life was held in bondage to a man-made doctrine based on fear and a desire to \\"keep women in their place.\\" I find it very interesting that those who give this book a low rating usually come from that same background.

The book is a portrait of a 16 year old girl who lives a typical 16 year old life. Her older sister develops anorexia when she leaves for her first semester of college, but the eating disorder senario is more of a subplot to the boyfriend/ best friend sagas that consume most 16 year old girls. In fact, the eating disordered sister is away at college when the book begins and is hospitalized in the middle of the story, so she is absent throughout most of the novel. The book concludes with the trivial boyfriend/ best friend crisis resolved, but there is no epilogue to let the reader know the fate of the eating disordered sister. Do not read this book with the intention of gleaning information on the causes and effects of anorexia; I do not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, Poor Representation of Anorexia","review":"I was shocked to read this book and how it played up all the problems that further an anorexics pain(the out of touch, selfish, suffering family). This book is about everything but the one individual that is disappearing and screaming for life and attention. I am sad to see the whole book focus on the younger sister and her relatively healthy existence. I would never recommend this to someone with an eating disorder, simply that it will make them feel less than I already know that they feel. Second, I wouldnt recommend this to any individual that is living with an anorexic because it brings the attention back the people that are ignoring the disease versus the person hurting. This book is selfish to the disease and the pain it ravages on its individuals. Anorexics are not crazy or mad, but rather intelligent, extremely complex, and high achievers in all aspects of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real?","review":"As I was reading this book, I picked up on a lot of certain behaviors that I thought were unrealistic. The sister in the story who is suppossed to have an eating disorder didn't seem like she would. Based on her actions and her words I wasn't convinced that she had an eating disorder. It was hard for me to enjoy the book because I kept on saying, \\"An anorexic would never say/do that.\\" The other sister's life was actually interesting though as she delt with her best friend and boy friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bare-bones look at life","review":"if you have a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a family, you will want to read this book. Cathi Hanauer's painstakingly accurate depiction of the heoroine's coming of age amidst a family plagued by a domineering father, submissive mother, and an anorexic-stricken sister can be understood by all readers. Rather than focusing on the traditional and often popularized aspects of anorexia, Hanauer gives us Billie, the younger adolescent sister of Cassie, a rapidly deteriorating anorexic. Through Billie, we not only experience the turmoil of adolescence, but we also share an aspect of eating disorders that are rarely depicted....the effects of the disorder as seen through the eyes of the afflicted's family. The struggles of Billie and her family are frighteningly realistic, and one only naturally wonders about Hanauer's insight.

All featuring annoying mice who always win against the rats never losing a important character or even taking many casualties. It's all white and black with no sublety. and these books are so famous?

My favorite feature is that Mr. Jacques tied in many of the characters into this book that he used in Mariel of Redwall. It made the book even better because I found it exciting that I was already familiar with many of the characters. I can't tell you much about the story line, but I will tell you that this book is totally enthralling to the very end. I would suggest reading Mariel of Redwall first so you will be familiar with the characters and see what happens to them.

It was publishedin 1994 and one out of a giant series called Redwall. The author is Brian Jacques, one of the greatest authors of all time I might add. The characters include Joseph the Bellmaker, Finbar Galeep,Dandin of Redwall and Mariel the warrior maid. The book is about a fantasy land where animals are the domant race and when a fearless warrior maid that will stop at nothing to free Southwards from a evil war lord named Foxwolf and his daedly mate Silvermord. The book is also about friendship, bravery and courage. Mariel accomplishes all here goals but I'm not going into the detail. Mariel learns that killing is very sad and after a battle she becomes wise and and skilled with a notted rope as her weapon.

And I also think that he overuses a lot of stuff, like the molespeech, and the bloodwrath. Lets try and keep some realism in this, how could a mouse ever kill a fox, it's impossible, but it happens often, the only book that was good at all, was salamandastron.

This book lacks nothing in interesting scenes, or daring adventures. I give it a full 5 stars for a good reason.

Jacques has done it yet again. I have read this book twice now, and It ranks among the top twenty or so on my booklist. Since I read a lot, that is a high honor!I have rated this bok a seven, because while it is very entertaining, well written and has much more praise forthcoming, I must admit that perhaps the overall structure of the story is a bit overworked by Jacques. His books, while each unique in their own way, all seem to have the underlying theme of: band of Redwallers and friends versus vermin horde led by tyrant with personality problem. Still, this book is very good for a rainy day at home. You can get absorbed in this (and the others in this series) for hours at a time, and may finish it quicker than you might have intended at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food,fighting,food,bad guys,food,good guys,food,victory, and of course food","review":"Many warriors own the glory but the saying in Redwall is \\"This is the Bellmaker's story because the dream was his.\\" Of course you read this poem and you should be courious about why this is the Bellmaker's story.

If you read any of the Redwall books keep some food nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Redwall book","review":"If you have been a long-time reader of Brian Jacques and the Redwall books, this should be a welcome addition to your library.

It is a fantasy book written by Brian Jaques. I think it is a good book suitable for kids ages 10 to 13 years old.The plot of the book is very interesting. The main plot is that Mariel the Warriormaid and her friend Dandin go out to try and rid Redwall and the surrounding areas of evil. While they are doing so they encounter a very evil tyrant named Urgan Nagru and they try to stop him.I think this book was very good for people my age, age 13.

It certainly does mention Muslims who are fanatical but it also mentions those who are moderate. As for the reader who found it chilling I too wonder, as has one of the other reviewers, whether or not he and I have read the same book! I did not find it at all chilling, since the author is clearly an optimist. It is excellent in particular on the subject of Islamic rage - it is not an exegesis of Islam per se, but a fascinating historical account of how the faith developed and why some Muslims today feel a profound sense of rage against the West. It is thoroughly to be recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherwood is an Evangelical but no fundamentalist","review":"Catherwood is an Evangelical - but he is no fundamentalist. There is none of the foaming at the mouth kind of writing on Israel in this book that you see in fundamentalist literature. In fact one of the chapters of this book specifically criticises those who would demonise Islam, and points out that many of us in the materialist West are just as guilty of being against God in our self-centred materialism as the Muslims we all too easily demonise. Yes, this is sure a Christian book, but fundamentalist no. Read it and see for yourself - and make sure your Christian friends read it, because we in America sure need the voice of Evangelical but politically moderate Christianity that this author argues for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A careful and balanced book on a contentious issue","review":"This is indeed a careful and balanced book on a very contentious issue - Catherwood is very careful to look at all the key issues facing both Christians and Muslims, and is very balanced towards both.

This will obviously turn off many potential readers but Catherwood makes no apologies for his devout belief. He is not, and should not, be branded as radical.While I enjoyed reading this book I believe Catherwood is a bit too optimistic that we can combat Islam by simply reaching out to our lost brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and thought provoking","review":"This book is an excellent overview of Christian-Muslim relations over the centuries. It is readable and full of interesting information. If more people, both Christians and non-Christians, understood the dynamics of world politics as well as does Catherwood, perhaps we would not be in such a mess. Catherwood is solidly Evangelical, without being fundamentalist. He also challenges Americans and other Westerners to consider ways in which their own lifestyles might be contributing to world tensions.

Their diverse bag of influences seems to stem from the same record collection the Strokes had (aka VU, Stooges, Television, Pixies) but throw in a little Radiohead, possibly U2 and more of a leaning to 80s pop than 70s raw. But there are definitely twists to keep it interesting. And while we're talking about influences - who cares if a band is derivative? Hey, we're all Post Modernists here, right?

The [adult content] and violence makes me say PG-13, not PG...This isn't a criticism, though, I enjoy this DVD more than number one. The story is becoming more plot based, less episodic, and the characters are getting fleshed out. This series reminds me a lot of Cowboy Bebop, and the animation quality is the best of the best.Even if you haven't seen the first DVD, this second one is more than enough as a starting point.All in all, if you enjoy a bunch of beautiful pirates, or like Cowboy Bebop, this is a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon/Macys Disgraceful!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is not a review of the Fossil bag - it is a review of Macys-Amazon and their customer service.

Desperate to make Lorca's abstract and haunting images accessible, Simon and White lose the poetic element in Lorca's writing. Not to mention the translation is not even literal. (i.e. \\"Carne\\" is translated \\"skin\\" instead of \\"flesh,\\" or \\"meat.\\" \\"Asesinado\\" is translated \\"cut down\\" instead of \\"murdered.\\") So what we end up with is a vain attempt to make Lorca more easily understood--a task which insults the intelligence of the reader and the creativity of the poet--which in turn results in a loose translation that reads too much like prose with line breaks. If you are looking to buy Poet in New York, do yourself a favor and buy the Medina and Statman translation. It is much truer to the spirit of the original, as well as the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"??? Not sure what you are looking for...... Fredrico Garcia Lorca's ...

I agree with the person who said that it DID seem to block the wind, making you hotter. The crystals the seller talks about were all in one wad, bunched up near one end of the little shoestring-like scarf, so how could the crystals cool anything? I sure don't have the answer. What I DO know, however, is that these things are purely and simply RIPOFFS!!! Amazon should not allow obvious fraudulent gimmicks to be sold on their site.

On \\"The Richest Fool Alive\\" she croons soulfully. She goes country gospel on Ralph Stanley's classic \\"Daniel Prayed\\" with Ricky Scaggs' counterpoint vocals and furious mandolin making the track jump alive. On Melba Montgomery's \\"Out of Control Raging Fire,\\" Travis Tritt joins Patty for harmonies that seem to float like smoke up to the clouds. The bluegrass gospel \\"Rise Up Lazarus\\" is a lovely melody that will place you in the Little Brown Church of your childhood, \\"Go forth John & Paul, spread the gospel to them all, Give them courage to believe & they shall be released.\\" \\"You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive\\" is moaning country blues, an epitaph to folks who knew about hard living and getting by. This is an incredibly strong set with no weak tracks. Patty's singing is soulful and moving. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul of the Mountains","review":"Patty Loveless is a songbird in a class of her own. I bought this cd a couple years ago and it still remains one of my top all time favorites across musical styles. \\"You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive\\" gives me goose bumps and I cannot help but sing along with a full heart. My parents grew up in \\"the holler\\" and my childhood summer vacations were spent at the W Va mountain homes of my parents' childhood and grandparents. As my grandparents passed away, the homes were long since moved into by new owners through the years but the precious memories are mine forever. Patty pays tribute to my heritage in such a graceful and heart-piercing style with Mountain Soul. Thank you, I welcome the honesty and purity in your craft; I will never tire of this cd as I am easily transported back 40 years and you have touched my mountain soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"born to sing bluegrass","review":"Patty Loveless was born to sing bluegrass. It is pretty much her back ground of music. This is a good set of songs especially the ones that are duets. Jon Randall and Patty do a wonderful job on Someone I Used To Know. The song with Travis Tritt is just as good. Out Of Control Raging Fire is very awesome Travis and Patty sing beautifully with their harmonies on this song. The whole CD is very good and is good to have along with other Patty classic CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patty shows her roots on \\"Mountain Soul\\"","review":"This album is quite possibly Patty's best release to date! This long overdue collection of bluegrass tunes echoes Patty's roots in Eastern Kentucky. Patty transforms country classics such as the Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton hit \\"Just Someone I Used To Know\\" in to bluegrass gems! Patty also covers several songs from her bluegrass mentor Ralph Stanley, such as \\"Daniel Prayed\\" and \\"Two Coats\\". Traditional bluegrass fans will also be delighted to find Patty's recording of \\"Shady Grove\\", but renamed as \\"Pretty Little Miss\\" for this album. Patty by far delivers the best recording of \\"You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive\\" far surpassing previous versions recorded by Brad Paisley and songwriter Darrell Scott.

I love her ballads mostly. This disc is one of her best in years. Although I am not a fan of gospel on country discs she does them justice. Her cuts with Travis Tritt and Jon Randall are excellent. There really isnt a bad cut here. If you are not a fan of hard core country you will not like this. Although I read on her website before this release that this cd was not a bluegrass album it does resemble bluegrass with the instrumentation and style of songs. To sum it up this collection is far better than most country cd's coming out now. It will get a nomination for either country or bluegrass cd of the year comparable to the recent dolly cd Little Sparrow. You wont be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another cash-in","review":"In the last 2 or 3 years, there has been a revival in so-called bluegrass music.

She is commercially turning to stuff that influenced her long ago to make loads of money.If you like awful music, I can't recommend this sacharine CD enough! If you want to listen to real country and bluegrass music, stick with Moon Mullican, Bill Monroe, Jim Reeves and Jerry Lee Lewis and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little short of the potential, but still worth buying.","review":"Patty Loveless has long been one of my favorite female recording artists and I love bluegrass/mountain music so I anticipated loving this CD before it ever arrived.The anticipation, however, did not match the product. I found the duets to be weak (expected much more from the combination of Tritt and Loveless) and several of the songs didn't leave me feeling much of anything.The CD does have some gems, \\"Daniel Prayed\\" (with Ricky Skaggs), \\"Rise Up Lazarus\\" and \\"You'll never leave Harlan alive\\" caught my attention from the beginning and there are a few other good ones, but on whole, the disc came up a little short.With that said, I'd still buy the CD knowing what I know now. I'm a critical listener and Patty's voice alone can carry an average disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"No demonstrated modifications and Injury limitations","review":"I liked this DVD. There are Pros to it, however there are also a few things that detract. The pros: the instructor is pleasant and the exercises are basic, but thorough. The cons: this workout is not suitable for anyone with a wrist injury or weakness. Only one of the stretches (the thigh stretch) can be easily modified and the instructor actually doesn't demonstrate any modifications. If you have arthritis, tendinitis or really any wrist or shoulder issues be aware that this is likely not the workout for you. You will need to be able to bear roughly half of your body weight on your wrists/shoulders for about 2/3rds of this workout.Again, if you have no injury concerns, it is a pleasant, basic and relaxing workout.

I'm going to contact the manufacturer to see if it is aware of this issue.Update: I purchased this hose 6 months ago. The manufacturer never responded to my request (through its website) for information regarding the bulging problem this hose had. Interestingly, the bulges disappeared as the summer got hotter. But, the hose has developed a leak at the site of one of the former bulges. I would not purchase this hose again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Lining","review":"I bought the hose in July. It is lightweight and I was happy with it.But, by the following May, it had developed distortions that made the hose swell and threaten to burst over a span of about 10 feet about 20 feet from where the hose attaches to spigot. This also caused the hose to make funny sounds (the water was filtering in and out of the internal lining)and it affected the steadiness with which water came out at the end of the hose. In the end, I have had to retire the hose -- it didn't seem worth cutting out a 10 foot section to try to repair the hose when it is likely that the same problem will occur elsewhere. I notice that others have had this same problem. I've never seen it happen to a hose before -- after 25+ years of home ownership.

Either that or buy \\"Keys To The Kingdon\\" and \\"Strange Times\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but not great","review":"I love Eminem and Bad Meets Evil so naturally I thought I'd try out some of Royce's solo stuff.

I got the original release back in December, but he's added a few tracks and made another cd. If you've heard the 'Slim Shady LP', you'll know Royce from \\"Bad Meets Evil\\", well Royce also won the Detroit freestyle competition. This cd is great, Royce hits on all cylinders. The best tracks are the 2nd single \\"Rock City\\" feat. Eminem, the 1st single \\"You Can't Touch Me\\", \\"My Friend\\", \\"Boom\\", \\"Who Am I\\" and the newest single \\"Mr. Baller\\" feat Clipse. Every track is hot, if your hesitant bout buying the Royce album...I'll vouch that he's the hottest solo artist this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royce is Awesome","review":"Royce Da 5' 9\\", you might be saying who the hell is that but if you like Eminem check out Bad Meets Evil from The Slim Shady LP and you will now who he is. This CD has been held up for awhile but i believe it was worth the wait. Royce has some tight beats on here by Premo (BOOM, My Friend) & the Neptunes (Mr.Baller & Others). Boom is awesome, probably the best song on the CD. The Clipse come through on MR.Baller. Rock City with Em and Nickel Nine Is... are also nice.

I bought it a couple weeks ago, and I'm glad I finally copped it. Every track on it is a banger. The Premo-produced tracks \\"My Friend\\" and \\"Boom\\" are absolutely gangsta. \\"Off Parole\\" is also the s**t. It goes 2 show U that even after a long wait, U can still come out nasty. I recommend this 2 all my true hip-hop fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine Inch Nails rocks","review":"this in my opinion is one of the best CD's that Trent Reznor has put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a listen, but nothing new here.","review":"I've been a huge NIN fan for years and gone out and bought all trent's releases ... except this album. Why, because Trent deserves lower sales on this. Half the songs sound like The Fragile: disc 3, which isn't a bad thing - but the rest is unashamedly commercial, an attempt to do something MTV / radio friendly. Dave Grohl's drumming doesn't lend well to NIN. There's nothing on this album that smacks of experimentation or creativity like previous NIN work and it's obvious at this point in Trents career that he will never find a new lyrical slant. There are good tracks here - Every Day Is Exactly the Same, Right Where It Belongs, amongst others. Personally I aint buying until Trent puts something original out again - and if I have to wait another five years I'll have given up on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece...no...Awesome all the same..NO DOUBT","review":"A few reviewers I see have shown their inorgance, have rushed to a decision about this CD. If you have really being paying attention to what Trent has been through the last few years, you would expect nothing else. It IS different than The Fragile, and a little more accessible than the past, and I DO think The Fragile is a masterpiece (even though Trent himself feels otherwise), but this 2005 NIN is brilliant all the same. Been 5 -6 years since The Fragile, are YOU the same as you were 5 years ago!? I can name several albums in my 40 years that I first heard and hated and now love. (This in not one however, liked it from day one.) Patience..... Just saw him in San Diego 0n 5/31/05, his talent and emotion are undeniable. Congrats on your case victory also Trent! Highly recommend the DVD DualDisc surround sound version of this also, amazingly cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"As much as I might like to say that this is the worst NIN album, I won't, because it will cloud the fact that based on it's own merits this album is weak, and weak is not a word I thought would ever describe a NIN album, but it is......weak! Really, a step backwards in many ways. The arrangements, the melodies, the vocals, the lyrics, etc. are not exciting, because they're not inspired and it is OBVIOUS. I knew Trent was desperate the minute he had to attach Dave Grohl's name to the project, because it meant he needed help producing the album and selling the album. Grohl's drums are at best adequate and at worst annoying and boring (songs for the deaf was amazing, and I'm sure Trent was hoping for that spark!). Sorry! Trent played it way to safe! Low risk, low reward...period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Cable","review":"Very well made cable. The components used are good quality and the price is outstanding.

Problem is these are not true banana plugs that bulge in the middle, as can be seen in the pic. Instead it consists of four separate pieces that spread out to get wider toward the tip.

While Maier spends as much time as he can on the private side of S.I. Newhouse Jr., he in the end focus on what is most seen of this most private of media moguls-- his media properties.Maier uses the device of choosing figures and brands important to Newhouse history (Roy Cohn, Random House, Tina Brown, the New Yorker) and spending a chapter on each one, tracing their history in relation to both Newhouse and Advance Publications. While a good device for giving a thorough overview, be warned that it does make for a slightly disconnected read.

The result almost ruined the album but those additions did not damper the great songs that Larry does here. However, Larry's departure from Capitol was inevitable after this.

However, I was recently stuck at home with a broken ankle, and the movie was available on demand, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm so glad that I did. The movie was wonderful! I think that the chemistry of the characters was wonderful.

Unfortunately, this movie was very bland and a bit confusing. I was not sure why the two even got together since they had no chemistry and barely talked to each other. As another reviewer stated, you didn't have any motivation for the guy to get the girl because we did not get to know anything about him save for the fact that he was a gigilo. When the plot finally took a dramatic twist I was not invested enough in any of the characters to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on the book instead...","review":"This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The story is vaguely - VERY vaguely - based on Liz Young's bestseller \\"Asking for Trouble\\", but if I were Liz Young, I'd be ashamed to be credited in this movie.The storyline of The Wedding Date just never managed to catch me. It just dragged along, with mostly caricaturelike characters, of which none ever was really sympathetic. At the best they were unbelievable. All the hilarious and exciting twists and turns from the book were flattened out, and everything was as predictable as it was stupid. Add far from convincing acting to this extremely boring storyline, and you get the perfect recipe for a dead movie.My advice: stick with the book. It's a thousand times funnier and a million times better: totally unpredictable, and with sympathetic, recognizable and complete characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to say, it sucked...........................","review":"I love Dermott and I love Ms Messing (we also call her Lucille Ball in this house), but this movie was so disappointing to me. I only get out for a very few films at the actual theatre and opt to instead wait for mostly everything on DVD. There are a few previews that make me run to the theatre and this was one of them. The preview did indeed, unfortunately, have all of the fun scenes in it and the rest of the movie was slow with bad timed or bad taste liners and a predictable plot which dragged. Predictable plot is fine if there is some chemistry between the two main characters to begin with . The movie left me wanting more of both main actors, but in a different movie with perhaps some interesting dialogue???? Wait for the DVD and rent it on Netflix on a very slow rainy afternoon and your disappointment will not be as great as mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!","review":"I actually have more than one DVD of this movie and I downloaded it to my kindle.

Debra Messing is the jilted lover, expected to put in an appearance at her sisters wedding. She wants to make her ex jealous, and show the rest of her family that she has moved on. An escort is hired to be her boyfriend because her family is hideous to her about how it should be you getting married.

I don't even like Debra, but somehow her staple clueless stare was somewhat becoming in this portrayal. This movie isn't much of anything, but if you're engaged or recently married it can be a silly backdrop to poke fun at your own wedding or wedding plans. Definitely watch with a bit of wine, or chocolates too. This is the most subjective review i've written, haha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a romantic comedy, just a mildly friendly flop","review":"Although it was cast as a Romantic Comdey, it was neither romantic nor funny. There was absolutely no character development!Dermot Mulroney is a horrendous actor, only proven by this monotone, emotionless straightfaced throughout the whole movie chop acting job. The dialogue was absurd as well. The storyline was incredibly choppy and the plot line was predictable and weak at best. The relationship between the main characters was the least built up. The supporting actors provided the best of the movie and the few decent scenes revolve around heartfelt one liners. It was NOT funny in the least! Overall barely 2 stars. A HUGE disapppointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased, but loved it","review":"The truth is I'm biased because my man proposed after we watched this movie! Needless to say it's very hard to top that! But I think I can be objective in saying it was very entertaining, worth the price of the movie ticket, and worth also picking up on DVD when available. So my sentimental rating is \\"5 stars\\" and my objective rating is \\"4 stars\\". I am VERY hard to please when it comes to comedy - it's just not my genre and I don't laugh easily, but this movie did it. Debra was absolutely charming. I laughed a lot and never became bored. There were a couple of moments when I thought I might become bored, but the film always came back with something to re-inspire my attention, interest, and enjoyment just in time. Very good and definitely recommended, even if you're not big on the comedy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"That warm and fuzzy feeling! A great pairing of stars....","review":"A wonderful romantic comedy. Yes, we've seen similar stories before, however this one is a very nice one. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney are extremely charming together in this film. I can't wait to get the dvd.It was also fun to see the roles reversed a little in this one. The female lead was playing the role the leading man would usually be in, and the male lead here was playing the \\"sex object\\" part that would usually be forced on the actress. So, I thought it was a refreshing difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil family dynamics at play","review":"Is it me, or am I the only one horrified at the lack of family loyalty and boundaries in this \\"romantic\\" comedy? Since when is sleeping with your sister's finance and breaking her heart in the process just a trivial issue to be dismissed? Debra Messing did a great job as the lovelorn woman. Can't say that about of the other characters. Her sister was a shallow twit that we are to believe that EVERYONE was in love with. Go figure. Happy ending? Our heroine ends up with the male hooker - What a catch - Am so happy for her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"How about a little Pretty Woman reversal? Anyone? Oh yes, the formula is tried and trued, but gender flip-flopping is enough to call it \\"new\\" - or so says Hollywood. It is actually pretty good. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney were perfect (and believable) as a couple, and the chemistry was definitely there. A couple scenes were a little... over the top, and there was a bit of drama, but it was still a good romance. The only thing I would change is the beginning as it kind of just throws you into the story so that you feel like you missed something. Overall, a good movie to see on a date or for a night out with a few of your girlfriends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKED!!!!","review":"Debra Messing plays a single woman who hires Dylan McDermott (or whatever his name is -- I get those guys mixed up) to escort her to her sister's wedding and then they fall in love. If you want to know why they fall in love perhaps there is another movie to watch, because it sure isn't explained in this one. The movie is one boring scene after another, with boring one dimensional characters. And what's the deal with Debra Messing? When she first came on the scene in those early Seinfeld episodes, she looked hot! She also looked good in Will & Grace. But she is downright unattractive in this movie. Maybe it's the lighting, maybe she's aged, but she looks terrible. That a smooth player like Dylan Walsh (or whatever his name is) would fall for her is laughable. Save your money and watch Pretty Woman for the 100th time if you want to see a good romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG. BORING. STUPID & S L O W :-(","review":"While this did have a few funny-ish moments, the majority of the movie was long, boring, stupid and slow. Not to mention the wasted talent of Debra Messing and Dermot. I don't think either are desparate for money, so why would they take on a role such as this. It was torturous to watch. I'm so glad I didn't see it at the theatre and pay more money than the dvd rental cost. I think I forgot to mention predictable too. You know what's comming. I should have trusted my instincts and stopped watching it earlier, but it was like those train wrecks you can't take your eyes off.

It' formulaic and nothing too special. In the end it's a cute little romantic movie, but there are better ones out there..Pretty Woman is one example."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has it all","review":"If you are looking for a movie that features a sister sister relationship, a farce, an airplane AND a wedding... then this is your movie. The Wedding Date has it all! By far, the most entertaining part is when Debra Messing says, \\"Yeah, I'm just fine. Nothing a bottle of Jack and a straight razor can't fix.\\" (to which she strains a forced smile) The plot is disjointed and the scenes leave too much to the mind and not enough right in front of you, so that you can't truly enjoy it for what it is... a mindless, cheesy, not quite Can't Buy Me Love, cliche, romantic comedy. With a few mind-altering subtances and a couple friends, you can easily sit through this movie and probably even laugh here and there. My friend D says that figuring out the plot was the only interesting thing about it... I say, the soundtrack and Debra Messing's eye make-up make it all worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the wedding center pieces","review":"Stinko, Does Dermot have any facial expressions, I think he slept through this movie with his eyes open.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"This ranks right up there with Gangs of New York for movies I would have walked out of if I had realized my movie-watching buddy was hating it as much as me. There is simply nothing redeeming about this movie, which is inexcusable with two solid actors in the leads. Don't waste your time- I love chick flicks and can appreciate even the most cheesy if there is something likeable about the characters or there is a cute story; this just made me want to poke my eyes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Wo \\"MAN\\" at My \\"Best Friend's Wedding\\"","review":"Romance isn't dead...it just costs $6,000. From the previews this movie resembled \\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\", but after viewing it I see large differences. Some of the scenery is much better and Julia Roberts is not in it. Plus, Julia's hooker role from \\"Pretty Woman\\" now goes to her \\"Best Friend's\\" co-star Mulroney. If you can stomach another 'for hire' love story and enjoyed \\"Best Friend's Wedding\\" you'll love this. Well, except for the corny quickly summarized \\"6 months later\\" endings a la' \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" which were actually cute and somewhat funny in their day. The gaping holes in the script are also a minus. Hummm, does the fact that he's an escort really never get realized (with the exception of a small remark by her step-father regarding a magazine article )? Good grief!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romantic comedy, good chemistry, sexy!","review":"The cast is great, lovely settings, and the chemistry between the actors is spot-on! Dermot Mulroney is always sexy. You'll want to see it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"No romance and no comedy","review":"The Bottom Line:The Wedding Date apparently decided to cut out all the parts that make a romantic film work (the scenes in which the main characters, you know, fall in love and stuff), maybe because it follows formula so rigidly that the audience already knows they'll end up together anyway; as it stands the movie checks in at about 78 minutes of embarrasingly bad, uninvolving filmmaking that will appeal to no one.2/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I love romantic comedies and both of these actors, but this movie was not good. I gave it two stars because it was below average. I watched the whole thing, hoping for it to get better, but it didn't. Then I tried to watch the commentary, thinking that at least hearing the making of the movie should be interesting. Wrong. I couldn't make myself watch more than 10-15 minutes of it. The only person on the commentary was Debra Messing--not even the director or the producer--and she had no idea about why things were the way they were. The only things she could comment on were scenes she was in and she didn't have a lot to say. There were several minutes of complete silence. I think it should have been called 'watch the movie with Debra Messing'. And, like I said, I like her, but this movie was pretty poor. She referred to the movie's low budget several times, saying they didn't have time to do any more than X takes of a scene, so maybe that explains it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Comedy","review":"Among the best romantic comedies in the last 20 years this film has humor, excellent acting, and cast enthusiasm.

The plot is really far fetched. American airline employee employs a gigolo and flies half way round the world to attend her sister's wedding. It turns out she is a British American and she tries to make her British ex-boyfriend jealous. The flim makers can't make up their mind to make a British romantic comedy or an American one. 4 Weddings and A Funeral was set in the UK only so situations are really British. This one is like 4 Weddings and A Funeral mixed with Pretty Woman (only things this time its a he). The story could have turned out better if either it was set entirely in the UK or in the US.

The wedding is only a fraction of the book (over and done with by page 168) with a lot more going on afterwards. In the movie there's not a lot going on at all.

Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't. I did not find it all that funny or romanic. It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing. I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie. Their relationship is not developed well at all. As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort. For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not. I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute. There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for. My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful. Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chick Flick","review":"I love this movie & watch it every chance that I get.

However after watching this movie, I can't understand why he is not in more movies. I almost would say that he is ready to take George Cloney out of the pedastal. It is a romantic/comedy type of movie, few laughs and I completely understood why she fell in love with him...did anyone miss the shower scene?

It is one of those movies that I like to watch when I don't want to try to figure out what is going to happen next, one with a lot of romance (which always makes me feel good), and a happy ending!

It is a thriller and has a surprising ending that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Did someone forget to edit this book? It was poorly written and lacked basic editing. The plot was unrealistic- to the point of being goofy. I caught myself rolling my eyes time and again throughout the book. Unfortunately, this is the first and last Frey book on which I will waste my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the most gripping novels I have read in years","review":"This is one of those rare books that are full of different characters and scenarios yet don't bore you with pages of briefing notes explaining who, what and how different people and events work. The book started off with an action scene and never let up all the way through. While the end was predictable it was achieved in a nail-biting way. In my opinion Stephen Frey is a brilliant author who will eventually top the \\"best-seller\\" of thriller lists. I should point out that my pet hate in thrillers is when the author allows the hero/heroine either to die or spend the rest of his miserable life hinding from the all-powerful avenging force. Mr Frey does not do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy writing spoils a promising premise.","review":"I appreciate good suspense fiction, and this is not it! The book starts out with a fine premise but less than laudable prose. And the writing style only deteriorates. The last third reads like a hastily composed first draft--a barely fleshed-out outline. I couldn't help but conclude that Frey was in a big hurry to get this one into print, and so was his publisher, because no one polished or edited it. If I read one more time that someone's hand was \\"large\\" or \\"huge,\\" or that someone \\"hesitated for several moments,\\" I was going to recycle my copy. I don't care how successful Frey is, he should be embarrassed by the quality of the writing he turned in here. It shows a lack of respect for his craft and his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of promise, but no delivery","review":"I just discovered Stephen Frey recently and really enjoy his books. This one, however, was a big disappointment. I read a few reviews and found I should have paid attention because they were right on the money. This book has a great beginning that really drew me in, but as it went on, the writing went downhill and the end really seemed to be slapped together. What could have been a fabulous final third of this book, had it been developed, just kind of fell apart. He must have been in a hurry to meet a dealine or something - totally unpolished.I highly recommend The Day Trader, and The Legacy, but would not recommend The Vulture Fund at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly plot, 1-dimensional characters","review":"The plotline, while preposterous, was at least entertaining and fast-moving.

OK beach reading, that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frey fails to deliver.","review":"Stephen Frey must have been in a big hurry to finish this one. Likewise, his publisher must have needed it fast. That's the only plausible reason something so unpolished could have gone to press. I like Frey's premise, but his character development, plot structure, and writing style are amateurish at best. I challenge anyone to track the point of view in this book! In addition, Frey manages to offend most female readers with supposedly high-powered women characters who are obsessed with pleasing a man. And the ones over age 35 are terminally depressed about their fading looks. Please! Frey makes Grisham look like a literary genius. I recommend instead any novel by Andy McNab."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game that could be longer","review":"I purchased this for my daughter's 7th birthday, she really really wanted it! Installing it was a breeze, the controls were easy, and every move and puzzle was intuitive. There were some moments in the game where she became frustrated, especially the ending sequence which involved jumping onto moving pads. The only shortcoming is that it was not long enough. She finished the entire game in a weekend. It is pretty graphics intensive, so make sure your computer is up to snuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"More system requirements than they tell you...","review":"Just simply having a \\"3D video card\\" is not enough. It has to be an AGP card (not a PCI, which means your motherboard better have an AGP slot) and the video card has to support AGP Texture Acceleration. Not all 8MB or larger AGP video cards do this. You may find yourself forking out [money] to an[store] (cheapest option) just to get a video card that will let you play the game. True, this will enable you to play other games that you normally would not have been able to play, but if your plan was just to buy your girl another Barbie game, you may be overstepping your hardware limits with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!

Usually she handles all her new games herself, because she's very smart. Yet this time she had problems and wanted me to help. I took a look at the game and found it totally Horrid! The figures and graphics are as stupid as I've never seen and the game has no intelligence at all, and there's no help button nearby and you have to cancel out the game to read the only help: a read-me notepad file! I wasn't even able to go as far as my daughter did, let alone helping her. This game doesn't sharpen a girl's wit and entertains very little. It's a very poorly designed game, and I don't know how the designer of this game could have such poor intelligence and taste! It's a terrible game! Don't buy it. Period.

You find yourself running down abandoned alleyways forever while an annoying Barbie voice says, \\"Look, there's a light on the second floor.\\" Take it from me, there is no light on any second floor.

This particular disc however does not really come up to my expectations for two reasons. Firstly, some of the performers feel that an exhibition of their finger dexterity is more important than an expression of feeling and melody and tend to rush through some melodic pieces, losing a lot in the interpretation. Secondly, the recording itself appears to be rather uneven in volume and it becomes necessary to continually either increase or reduce the listening volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"I read this book when I was writing a report on the causes of 9/11, and it had some good stuff in there, but some of it was pretty crappy.

The songs that are credited to james on the smashing pumpkins albums are great songs, recognized by Billy Corgan as great songs, with producing credits to Billy as well. However, \\"let is come down\\" does not measure up to the quality of james iha's smashing pumpkins work. You can see that james was not the driving force behind the quality of the smashing pumpkins. It's a shame this is the man who broke up the band ( billycorgan.com ) since he's not the man who made the music great, which you'll understand if you listen to this album. I'd rather listen to the guy with the acoustic guitar that stands outside the movie theater near me every friday, then listen to this album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ret it come down","review":"James Iha's voice is too limited to be used on an entire album. I doubt he could even get a job singing backup vocals on \\"Me so Horny\\" for 2 Live Crew. The music is bland and weak, like a bad cup of coffee. The only good song he ever wrote was \\"Summertime,\\" and that isn't even on this album. Buy this if you like hearing people with Japanese accents sing country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Iha country man?","review":"This album combines all of his great songwriting skills into 11 well crafted tunes. The album is influenced by much 60's and 70's pop music. It's brings elements from the Pumpkins into, too. All the songs are mostly about love and the feeling it gives you. Some people say it is a throw off from the Pumpkins did you ever listen to one of there albums? There is an acoustic track on everyone at least. James brings in lap steel and pedal steel guitar along with other instruments to add a fresh flavor to the songs. I really like this album and if you like folk and a little country or are a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins so would you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iha has it...","review":"I have always loved Iha's compositions in the Smashing Pumpkins i.e. \\"The Boy\\", \\"Go\\", \\"Blew Away\\", just to name a few.

Really excellent for any music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let It Come Down is a little slice of pure pop heaven.","review":"James Iha's solo album is quite the departure from the elegant noise we're accustomed to hearing from the Smashing Pumpkins. Melodic guitars meld with the occasional country twang to produce a sublimely happy aura which permeates each song.

I am a very serious Pumpkins fan, and i think they are one of the most talented and original modern bands...i always thought James' songs from Pisces Iscariot etc..were slightly below the standard set by Billy...and i didn't expect James' solo album to be quite as superb as the Pumpkins...but i was dismayed at how utterly horrible this album is...James' voice is nothing special, if not annoying...he's one of those guys similar to a lot of english indie bands who can just about get away with calling himself a singer.... If James wasnt in the Pumpkins, this album would never have been released...i advise you to check out Jeff buckley or Nick Drake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome!","review":"Let me start by saying I've only rated two albums (not including \\"Best of...\\" compilations) to be worthy of 5 stars.

Everytime this CD comes into the rotation (where it'll stay 'til the CD-player breaks), I'm transported into a red convertible, driving down some country road with my arm hanging out the side, and my best friends riding along, enjoying the sunshine. This album puts me into the \\"happy\\" mode that I know everyone strives for (regardless of what kind of cool image they try to maintain). Buy this album as a cheaper alternative to Prozac.

The book focuses on the discovery of the Cosmic Background Radiation which enabled precise dating of the Age of the Universe. He describes how the Wilkinson team worked to discover the background radiation, and how they were surprised when two Bell Lab researchers Penzias and Wilson were the first to discover it. Lemonick talks also about how the Universe can now be precisely dated as 13.7 billion years old. He relates the great Age of the Universe to the Copernican revolution and sees it as part of the process of disabusing Mankind of its notion that it is at the center of the Cosmos.As I understand it his book also gives a great part to describing the whole development of exploration of the Cosmos in the past century, and too on the human drama and personality conflicts involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adventure by an awesome couple.","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1980 and still have my copy.

But he just isn't at all a good writer. His style is awkward and clumpsy - he doesn't know how to effectivel tell a story. How he got as far as he did is a modern wonder. AND the cause of the book, being in effect comissioned by Prince Philip, was also it's death, as it is extremely prejudiced in presenting only what the palace wants us to know and believe. There are numerous unpleasant and controversial facts about the historical characters in the book which are neatly omitted, and Alice is always sympathetically and gallantly focused. No even-handed critique or analysis here - just a nice Windsor-approved glowing tribute, and poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for the author","review":"I was hesitant to order this book as biographies tend to be dry but Hugo Vickers has written a most sensitive and honest account of HRH Alice's life. He had the cooperation of her son Prince Philip who graciously allowed family photos to be published. This is a very good book about a lady who overcame personal problems and, at the same time, always tried to improve the lives of those less fortunate. A remarkable lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, authorized biography","review":"When reviewing this book, it is necessary to keep in mind that it was suggested to the author by the family. The palace doors were open to him and he interviewed multiple HRHs and other relatives. Family photos are part of the volume. Princess Alice herself left no diaries, correspondence to her, or memoirs. The author had to piece together family and friend interviews and her own letters sent to others. With information necessarily spotty, perhaps due to the interviewees as much as the distance in the past, some aspects of her life such as her spirituality are perhaps described less well than one would have wished. For those interested in European royalty and its multiple familial alliances it is a fascinating description of an era that lasted from late Victorian through modern times. For the wealth of information, I thought it fairly well written, less ponderous than the British biographies that list every event, in order, every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!!!","review":"This book is an easy read and very helpful to the first time homebuyer.

You don't have to spend this kind of money to get good pictures but the lens on the minilux is really superb. If you value a fast, sharp lens that gives you that Leica look in your photos, then it's worth the money. Most amature photographers look for a camera with a zoom lens but if you want lens speed that will pay off in low light this is the ticket. There are no perfect cameras. That is, one that can be everything to everyone. The Minilux has a small viewfinder, no information in the finder and a not so easy to set exposure compensation.

The text concentrates more on paradoxical interventions and on communication theory than on hypnosis (there is not much hypnosis, if I remember correctly), but the idea is that therapy is a form of benevolent, partially conscious influence. Essential to the thesis is that every behavior is a communication, and that different styles of communication can get tangled up. The therapist's job is to sort them out and then come up with communications that the client cannot help but obey, even if they think they are disobeying (paradoxes). This one goes along very well with the book by Beier that I have reviewed, but is much more focused on directive client influence than Beier's book.

He has an incredible ability to immerse his readers in unusual times and places with fascinating characters and accurate detail of their social and geographical environments. In this case it is the Norway of a thousand years ago as Christianity attempted to displace the Norse religions. We are treated to much detail of the medieval Norse landscape and as we follow the protagonist who was for a time a Varangian mercenary at Constantinople we learn much about other parts of the world as well - even as far away as the Yucatan (where a foul storm blew our lead characters)- and where Mayan legends suggest a visit by a Norse explorer in the form of what they believed to be the blond haired, blue eyed god Quexacoatl.Watkins never ceases to educate and entertain me. He is grossly underappreciated in this country - perhaps better known and respected in the U.K. Shows our ignorance, perhaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this one","review":"A third of the way into this book I was wondering \\"where is the real Paul Watkins, and what have you done with him?\\"Watkins is my favourite author by far - but I wish I had never read this book. It is so gawdawful cliche. Relying on improbable coincidence after improbable coincidence to keep the 'plot' moving.There is none of the trademark Paul Watkins setting of time and place in one's mind with excellent writing. Very little character development, weak plot lines, historical inaccuracies, and weak attacks on politically correct targets.In short if you are a Watkins fan take a permanent pass. If you have never read him, don't start here or it will finish your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I struggled to read this book, having to overcome the handicap of actually knowing something of the history and religious beliefs the author uses to flesh out his story.For one major example, extant evidence leads us to believe that Germanic beliefs were polytheistic (many gods), not pantheistic as Watkins describes (i.e., that they saw godhead or lifeforce in everything). His depiction of the origin of the Nordic pre-conversion belief is simply preposterous.Thunder God is an average story with shallow characters and short on detail. I found it lacks the grit and realism of Household Gods and the historical accuracy of Severin's Viking trilogy- books that have in abundance what this book tried for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Storyline","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this excellent novel. The storyline and characters were well developed. The detailed descriptions of various places, events and customs added to the storyline instead of detracting from it.

The recipes contradict their dietary reccomendations by using ingredients they warn against, like white flour, and the recipes can commonly be found in cookbooks.

The remixes instead put Kylie in a more aggressive electro mode. The best mix is the Ashtrax Mix(5:02) and puts on a more aggessive bottom to the rhythm track. Much more electro vibe going here. This should be shortened and released to radio. The Robbie Rivera's Hard and Sexy Mix(6:59) is basically a dub mix. That is my only fault in that I've heard Robbie Rivera do vocal mixes and there is not one here. The mix is very tribal/bleepy type house in style. It is very well done and features parts of the vocals for indentification. This so far sits at number 20 on the Billboard dance charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise--Another Hit!","review":"Kylie hits the right notes with this song. The original song is pretty amazing, though I can't help but think the intro to the chorus involves some 'sampling'--just haven't figured out what is being sampled.

The remixes are fun, with high-voltage beats that go on forever...very club-scene. And the video is interesting...just have to keep watching it to figure it out. A must-own for Kylie fanatics.

Only one problem, this unit just sucks! I can't count the times my wife and I have commented how we threw $50 away on this piece of junk! It barely (I repeat, barely) has enough power to vacuum up small pieces of dirt! And yes, before you ask, we have kept the filter clean and have emptied the dirt reservoir regularly.

The pros of this broom vacuum: lightweight, easy to use, picks up most light dirt such as pet hair and dust, lets you sweep dirt first and then vacuum if you prefer, and takes up no more space than a regular broom. Cons: must be held perpendicular and still to pick up heavier dirt and it does not pick up all types of dirt. I recommend it for hard surfaces especially if you sweep your floors regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Not Recommend","review":"Bought the broom thinking it will spare me the effort of collecting the dust in a dustpan. The broom is too heavy and misses out on a lot of little particles. It sucks!! but only in the very center 2 inches. No charging dock so you will need to keep the cord in a secure place. I should have just bought a broom and a handVac instead.

When I got it in and charged the battery as specified in the instructions, I discovered it's really a piece of junk. The battery does not power it long enough to finish the job and the tiny pleated filter clogs up so quickly that you find yourself standing over the trash can beating dirt out of the filter more than you are sweeping. I have to admit it's still better than using an actual broom and dustpan, but if you are looking at this product I would try another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I wanted this broom the minute I saw the TV commercial. I quickly assembled it - the only positive thing I can say about it! - and became quickly disappointed in it's cleaning ability, once I had it charged. It does not pick anything up.

Better yet, I will just use my broom and dust pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"I dislike this item. It's pretty heavy for it's size.

The good reviews def. outweighed the bad reviews with this product. So when I finally got it, charged it and used it, well tried to use it I WAS SO MAD!!!!! Not only is it HEAVY but the suction is less then ZERO! I thought well maybe I'm doing something wrong, actually I was hoping that I was doing something wrong...NO I wasn't. My husband gave it a shot then my sister gave it a shot. This vacuum is WORSE then AWFUL! It's TERRIBLE!!! Believe me I'm not looking for something like a Dyson, I was looking for something similar to the Swiffer. BIG MISTAKE! Don't waste your money.

I'm going to buy another Swiffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as good as a regular broom","review":"What a waste of money.

At first, I thought it was great because it definitely beats using a broom and dustpan. However, I quickly learned that it has major limitations - notably its suction power, and the fact that hair and other items are constantly getting stuck in the bristles.Also - it doesn't run very long on one charge, and immediately loses its suction power at that point. I'd much rather suffer through the inconvenience of a cord, rather than have a vacuum that loses suction power so rapidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I knew how, I'd send it back!","review":"This is a broom vac.

I was very dissapointed at the amount of times I had to go over smaller particals the size of peas several time just to get the thing to pick the items up. Also very poor design in the filter system. The little flat that opens allowing what particals like hair and dust to get up in the cup go directly onto the filter and stay there blocking the flap from closing and particles fall back out. No way does this machine pick up M&M's like on the comercial or a pile of dirt like they do either. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"New highs of sucking (and that ain't a compliment)","review":"This is probably the WORST product I have ever used. I have 2 dogs (one that sheds) and wood floors throughout my whole main floor so I am always looking for a product to assist a quick clean-up, and let me tell you, this ain't it. You are supposed to use it as a broom to sweep everything into a pile than you are to turn it on to suck it all up. Does it suck it all up, you ask? The answer is no, it just plain sucks. It also sucks as just a plain broom. I should also mention it is horrendously hard to empty the little it does manage to collect and if you do have dogs, the hair sticks to the broom. My solution to all this electronic stuff that is supposed to make your life easier is this: a broom and a dust pan.

It works well on my Pergo Wood floor in my kitchen and also my carpeted steps to the basement. I love the fact it comes in colors...such fun.

The instructions suggest you use the \\"broom\\" to sweep and then turn it on and it'll inhale your crumb pile. One can do that with a regular broom and a handy vac... but here you don't have to bend over. Not to mention, you'll get a nice workout wielding the thing because it's not light. The broom handle is somewhat slick and slippery. It works fine on low pile carpet if you use the thing to 'scrub' back and forth the way you would with a floor vac. If I had a chance to try it before buying, I would have passed on it... 2 stars because it does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way would I buy this again!!","review":"It's not that the it dosn't function well......for the 1st 2 minutes after a full charge.....then the power starts to go away and it is useless.

WASTE OF MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a VERYdissapionting product Not worh a penny!","review":"NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!! I have bought Dirt Devil products in the past, and I have been satified so decided to buy this one. I could not be more dissapointed in the product! It does not pick up even the smallest amount of debris. My husband can get anything to work, but we could not get this to work after numerous attempts. The company does not even seem to care that they are selling a non-working product.I think they just hope many people will not bother to return it. I will never buy from this comapny again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good so far","review":"I'm a Dirt Devil fan from way back. I have the hand vac, too, so when I saw this new product I snapped it up. It works well and is quite handy. Taking the dirt cup off is tricky -- I pressed the button and the cup plus all the accumulated sweepings from its maiden voyage went FLYING onto the floor. Trying to catch the mess, I accidentally turned the machine on. It was like a Three Stooges skit.The only thing I'd say is that anyone buying a product like this (assuming you like it and intend to keep it for several years) is to buy the accessories for it while you can. If the model is discontinued or the machine doesn't sell well, then you are out of luck if you need to find accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, well kinda---","review":"It is handy. It is a good idea. But there is a technical flaw which makes it's use very limited. The space between the filter and the intake tube is very narrow. If you pick up anything larger than bread crumbs, the debris just jambs up, clogging the intake tube and you have to constantly stop, open it, and dig out the jamb.Emptying the canister is clumbsy because of the weight of the bottom of the tool. You have to juggle the tool with one hand and push a button with the other hand and try to catch the canister. Then put down the stick and use 2 hands to remove the filter and dump the contents. Getting the canister back on the stick is not easy, either.I have emailed the manufacturer about this problem, but they just give me lame replies like \\"there is a 1-year defect warranty\\" and \\"the manual is available online.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Its not light as advertised.

I guess I thought you would sweep with the vacuum on, and it would suck stuff up as you swept. Not so. It is ok if you are just sweeping up some spilled cheerios or something, but it is way to heavy and awkward to sweep your whole kitchen floor. The vaccum gets clogged up with stuff pretty easily, and then, all the stuff you just swept up gets dropped back out when you turn it off.

I started charging it right away, I couldn't wait to use it. I first used it in my kitchen, then my living room area and it worked great! The big test was the area's around my kitty litter boxes, and it passed with flying colors! It picked up all the litter that the cats had tracked out from the box! It worked great also on the pet hair and dust bunnies. I would have given this product a five, but this unit is much more heavier than I had anticipated. It is a bit of an arm work out if using it on large areas like I have. The wieght also put a strain on my wrist which I thought was odd.

It does what it is designed to do, which is small areas and it works good on stairs. But this product is clearly designed by a man. The chamber is difficult to open and empty. The vacuum housing where the chamber is attached to is heavy, making it hard to hang on to when you try to open the chamber to empty the content. You need a large hand to handle that. Mine gets dropped almost every time. So, if you are listening DirtDevil, a product not only need to be functional, aesthetic but also easy to use for the users it intend to attract.

A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pushes the dirt around.","review":"This broom was mediocre from the word go. It's awkward as a broom but the vaccuum power was so weak that sweeping was pretty much its only use. Basically, you could push the dirt around (though not as easily as with a simple $7 corn broom) and it would suck up a few crumbs and that's kind of it. It wasn't broken, it just didn't work very well. There are no pets or young children in the household so it wasn't on heavy duty either. It was only used for cleaning the edges of the living room and a tile entryway and it didn't do that particularly well. Sadly, we didn't think to return it in time and about two months in the suction got even worse but we were stuck with it. The idea is good but it just did not work for us.Save your money and skip this one. (We ultimately bought a corn broom and an 18-V B&D; handvac to take over edge and entryway cleaning. Neither is as convenient as this product should have been, but both work well for their purposes.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This vac sucks - because it doesn't","review":"I bought this vac to suck up dog hair from my tile floor.

It's not a broom at all - there are no real bristles just a strip of foam. It will pick up dustbunnies, but most of the dust and hair you \\"sweep\\" up just sticks to the foam strip and does not get vacuumed up. You could do a better job with a swiffer, which is cheaper and much lighter. This item is quite unwieldy and will not fit into or under tight spaces. I have gone back to cleaning our hard floors using a combination of a real broom and vacuuming up with a B&D dustbuster, a swiffer for dust, and then every 1-2 weeks vacuuming with the dyson.

The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star rating for us is that the overall weight is a little surprising, understandably, but by no means forbidding.

Basically, the filter gets clogged up quicky, and the unit loses suction. There is only a relatively small opening for vacuuming up dust, at the center of the bottom -- maybe 3 or 4 inches across, and an inch wide.The rest of width only functions like a regular broon. But the bristles are shorter than a regular broom, and the resulting lack of flexibilty makes it difficult to angle the broom to get under objects -- like the toe area along kitchen cabinets. Those are particularly difficult to get to with the broom vac -- and of course that's where most of the crumbs end up!Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROUGHT BACK TO THE STORE","review":"I USED THIS FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND GOT TIRED OF IT NOT HAVING ANY SUCTION POWER.

It just sucks it up right into the broom and has quite a bit of storage space so you don't have to empty it every time. Holds its charge well. The cons is it is still a broom, so tight to get get into those hard to reach places. It is also a little heavier than a broom. Most of the time you have to get right on top of the item for it to suction it up. And to clean the bristles, you have to use your hand... Other than that, good product.

The broom/vac is a fill-in, when I notice that the dust is just not coming up, or hair is becoming noticeable (say every 2 weeks.) It fills this role with no problems, and at a pretty good price.The suction is fine for dust, but quickly slows down when hairs begin to clog the filter. Emptying the bin was simple (but I did feel embarassed to get out my full-size vac to clean out the filter.) The charge lasts for me to do my entire home, at a quick pace.It weighs a couple of pounds, so you'll notice it as you use it (this is not a straw broom!) but nothing to worry about.

I have only hardwood floors and thought that this product (based on reviews) would do the trick to pick up dirt and dog hair, but boy was I wrong. All the dog hair collects on the brush bristles and does not get sucked into the dirt cup. Not only that, it's so poorly designed that the dirt gets sucked up and then *stuck* up against the air filter instead of actually going down into the cup, so it needs to constantly be cleaned out before the cup is ever filled. It has such a weak suction that it can be completely charged and empty and it still does not pick up loose dust, it just moves it around like a regular non-electric broom.

Just not bad that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for cleaning up after kids","review":"With three children under the age of 5 in the house, I always have crumbs and cereal and such around the kitchen table. The Dirt Devil is able to pick up everything that slips through their little hands. I have been very satisfied using the Dirt Devil as a day to day picker upper between floor scrubbings."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!!!!!!","review":"I have 2 small children and I have to sweep my kitchen after every meal! The broom vac does the job perfectly! I noticed a comment about the bristles being short so you can't sweep with it. The trick to that is to turn it over. It will sweep great then you can just suck up the pile after you are done sweeping. It was a little heavy feeling for about the first week, but now, I don't even notice. The canister holds a ton so you do not have to empty it very often and I just rinse everything out in the sink every once in a while. The filter has held up great to repeated washings. The battery also holds the charge for a long time. Using it 3 times a day, the charge lasts about a week. If I have a large job, I will sweep with it first and then vacuum. It is easy to turn on/off with your foot. I even use it for touch ups on the carpet. I have had the vacuum for about 3 months and I am buying every woman in my family one for Christmas.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirt Devil Broom a BOMB","review":"I was so excited to buy this adorable broom for help with constant sweeping I do following around two small children....well, the broom could not be more disappointing. The broom barely picks up common crumbs, and is awkward to use. You never seem to have it at the right angle to pick up anything. I found myself almost spoon feeding the broom--it hardly works!! The suction is so bad it's unbelievable--whatever you do, do not buy this thing, it's a waste of money. I only wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing. It's so bad I have wrote a letter to dirt devil complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"dustbuster with a handle","review":"I was disappointed with this 'vacuum'. I expected more of a vacuum cleaner, this is just a dustbuster with a handle. I have to go over and over crumbs to get them up, it tends to just move them around. It's a pain to clean out the cup. There is a rubber seal around it which is difficult to put back in place after emptying and I don't think will last very long. The inside filter is paper which I think will clog pretty quickly and is not replaceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money - Wait for Improvements","review":"I bought this because my childrens food crumbs were breaking my back from having to bend down with a dust pan and brush and pick them up. I thought this broom vacuum would help because I wouldn't have to bend down. I still have to bend down because it doesn't pick up some of the crumbs very well, it ends up just pushing it around. The dust pan and brush still works better and is more efficient than this broom vac. I get frustrated using it on my kitchen floor and always have to resort to the dust pan at the end since pushing the particles around is not what I'm trying to achieve. I'm sure Dirt Devil will make some improvements one day on this vacuum. I'd wait for the improvements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, value for money","review":"I bought this recently for cleaning my kitchen tiles.I use it everyday for light cleaning after cooking.Works great and I think its value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have pets, forget it!","review":"I was excited by this product. It seemed convenient and I was sure would be very useful in sweeping up after my dogs. After using it only a couple of times, the filter clogged. I have to constantly wash it now to get any power. Once there are a few dog hairs (trust me, I've not gotten close to filling the thing) it simply refuses to pick up anything heavier than a piece of lint. It even struggles with the lint. Even when you empty it, unless you actually wash the filter, it will pick up a couple of fluff balls and then return to it's useless state. I'm only running it over wood floors so it's not like I'm trying to pick up dirt that is attached to a carpet.This is an awful product. Save your money and spend it on a dustpan and brush and avoid the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's more of a mop than a broom.","review":"I was so excited to get this product, but quickly disappointed after the first use. You can't actually sweep with this \\"broom\\" because there are foam/rubber strips right behind the short bristles. The bristles barely touch the ground because of the foam strip. Therefore, as you try to \\"sweep\\", you actually end up dragging this heavy broom. Because the foam is in cotact with the floors, it creates a lot of friction and makes it impossible to \\"sweep\\". It feels more like you're mopping the floors which means that everything sticks to the foam. The suction worked okay for me, but I barely used it because the sweep didn't work. I already have a broom and a dustbuster, both of which work better than this mutant hybrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad little machine","review":"My parents bought this for me when I asked for a small cordless vacuum like my mom and grandma use for small clean ups around the house. Although the idea of making it like a broom was creative and helped to pile up the dry crumbs on the kitchen floor, the only place there is suction is in a 3 inch hole in the middle of the base and the suction isn't very stron. So you have to go over the pile several times for the vacuum to actually pull up the crumbs into the canister.Also I found that it did not hold a charge long enough for me to clean my kitchen floor, which is not very big. And the product is not flexible like a broom, which makes it difficult to get into some corners to get crumbs and hair out of them. I found that my regular broom and dust pan were much more successful in such endeavors.I would not recommend trying this product, and would recommend more of a handheld or cordless stick vacuum style product for smaller clean ups around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is not any more effective or helpful than an ordinary broom. Pushes the debris around, weak suction. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does exactly what I wanted it to do!","review":"I am new to hard wood floors and had no idea how fast the dust, etc. builds up and shows...like overnight! I wanted a quick, easy way to deal with the issue, and this product does the trick - just like I wanted. One thing to keep in mind is that if you use it many times before you decide to empty it out, the dust can build up and block the intake - so just be sure to empty it frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use with a timer","review":"I had one of these put ahead of a Gilmour 9400 timer on a hose bib connection. BAD IDEA. The timer shut-off causes a lot of water hammer and this broke the tee. That is, the hammer, after about a month, caused a crack in the tee that allowed a LOT of water leakage.If you're just looking for a tee for convience then this is a nice one.

The following is a review of all the tools including, Bypass Pruner, Gear Max Folding Lopper, Folding Saw, and Telescoping All Purpose Hedge Shears. I have found uses for each tool in the set and have been satisfied with each of them. The small pruners help with little plants and have a nice grip. All the tools have a nice non slip grip and our made of materials that are made to not rust so they should last a long time. The extension for the trimmers is a nice feature for cutting hard to reach areas. The saw tool is good for thicker branches and has a nice design that stores closed so you don't get cut picking it up. Lastly the big trimmers have good torque to cut bigger branches. The price is a little high, but overall you can get a lot of use out of these tools. I would recommend this set to anyone who has a use for garden tools and is better than buying each individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"To me the album was the best ,and I'm not just saying this because Queenn (wit2 n's)is my favirote aunt I'm saying this because when I first heard it I was like, O my God I cant believe that my aunt has a cd out.If you have not got All That I Have I advice you and go and get it by any means necessary.It was the BOMB.

This album captures all the energy and authenticity of local Irish groups in Chicago. Many of the featured groups can be seen at one of the many Irish Pubs. The CD is recorded extremely well; this is a studio recording (for most songs), but the songs retain an organic and natural sound, just the way Celtic music should be!I would recommend this CD to anyone who lives in the Chicagoland area, or loves Celtic music - sure, the groups may not be headliners, but this is one of the best Celtic CD's I own.

I'm not sure of the technical reasons why this is, (another reviewer goes into more detail as to why) but be warned! this disc may not play on your player. It's really unfortunate because this film is brilliant. My one star review is for the DVD quality only - not the film itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film--Awful release","review":"My roommate and I both jumped at the chance to buy this new release of Fantastic Planet, what with the 1999 edition being out of print, and thus, more expensive.But now I'm returning it and spending the extra twenty for the '99 version.Neither of the discs play on our dvd player--a Magnavox, purchased new in 2005. These are the first (and only) dvds that we've been unable to play. The main menu pops up, but whenever we try to advance beyond that point, the screen freezes, or blanks.Sure, our dvd player isn't super new, but we've never encountered a problem with a disc until now. We are certain the problem isn't just a faulty disc, either, because we each purchased Fantastic Planet, received them at different times, and both act exactly the same way when put in the television--teasing with the menu.This was a waste of our money. So, just be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING Film, TERRIBLE version of it","review":"This film is completely spellbinding and amazing. The Terry Gilliam/Monty Python-esque animation is totally stunning. The only PROBLEM is that this is a HORRIBLE, I repeat HORRIBLE, version of it. I own a VHS copy and was thrilled when it first came out onto DVD, but little did I know my VHS VERSION IS ACTUALLY SUPERIOR. The color on the VHS version is better and on the DVD release YOU CANNOT TURN OFF THE SUBTITLES!! The subtitles even overlay the picture and do not stay in the black letterbox bars and at times DO NOT EVEN MATCH THE DIALOGUE OF THE CHARACTERS. I cannot BELIEVE this is going for $99 now when it's such a horrible version of the film. Save your money and buy the VHS version! The DVD is only in stereo anyway, so you won't lose any sound quality. I really hope another distributor gains the rights to this film and releases a version worthy of its caliber as the masterpiece it actually is, because this version is so substandard it makes me sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon listing incorrect - this disc is region 0","review":"This disc is region 0 and can be played anywhere.

I think the gripes about the subtitles are overblown. I didn't find them that annoying.I had seen this movie when I was 10 years old, and it captivated me ever since. I was amazed when I finally did a web search and found the movie based on only a few flimsy details. 20 years later, I eagerly watched the movie to see if it fulfilled all the expectations I had built up. It did.It is a fascinating, well-thought out movie with interesting allegories to society. It is highly imaginative. The animation is good for 1973, and I find the art pleasing.If you're a Sci-Fi buff, you'll like this movie. If not, don't bother. It's an eclectic niche film.

I bought it because I love this style of animation. Some of the scenes were very psychedelic, almost like an acid trip. It turns out that the story was actually the most entertaining part of the movie for me. It definitely gives you a different perspective of human life.The DVD included four interesting shorts put out by the creator. Most of them included live action as well as animation. The only reason I can't give a full 5 stars is because the subtitles are HORRIBLE. Among the worst i've ever seen. There's little contrast between the background and the text, so about 75% of the words are legible. I really don't understand why the publishers thought this would be acceptable. I took French for several years, but I can imagine how frustrating it would be for someone trying to read that text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is awesome but the DVD transfer is garbage","review":"Amazon should consider taking this item off their site, the image quality is atrocious.

The subtitles may be a literal translation of the French language and while interesting to see the difference, once, it's rather tiresome to have the subtitles there, not to mention distracting. It's difficult to rate this DVD because it's a great movie, but the subtitles only version sucks. And I haven't actually bought the DVD because in reading earlier Amazon.com customer reviews it seems the producers are pushing that same cheesed-out VHS tape version, with extra features of course.

This is one of the most bizarre movies -- animated or otherwise -- that I've ever seen, which more than makes up for the lack of depth to the story. My favorite scene is when Terr and the girl who owns him are running around whistling to shatter the crystals. Just the sounds of the crystals growing, the whistling, and the shattering noises put a smile on my face every time.

Now you have the JOB of emptying this hose and attempting to wrap it the way it was packaged, THEN, wasting your valuable time and gas expense in getting it to UPS to ship back. The manufacturer should have to pay something back to the customer for this trouble.

The advantage of this book is that it gives you the facts in such a way that it is up to you to decide whether or not the author is right in her conclusions.

There's some neat stuff in there and the physics is good. It plays really well and there's a great sense of immersion. The AI is very good and the levels are well designed and good to look at. There is a little slow down especially when you drive into the pools but I think it is technically very impressive for a playstation.

The graphics are like the first Twisted Metal and control is very bad. Your cars all handle differently from each other but have no precise handling like you expect in the year 2000. Sounds are sub-par, your giant vehicle sounds like a little windup car and it makes a little sqeak when you should be burning a huge patch of rubber! I had not played for very long when I began asking myself \\"Is this 1994 and why am I playing this game?\\" There are so many other games of this genre that are so much more fun, with great controls and graphics that this is a total waste of your hard earned tenspot!

The water started pooling on the ground within five feet of the sprinkler while the rest of the coverage area was barely damp. I returned them. I subsequently got much more even coverage with oscillating and pulsating sprinklers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sprinkler","review":"I bought two of these. Both broke in the first year, the spinning part broke off leaving a large hole that water gushes up through like a fountain. I was able to repair them with some industrial glue, but when one broke a second time I just threw it away.Besides durability issues the distribution is really uneven. If you set out a few tuna cans you'll quickly see that in a small radius around the sprinkler water comes out very fast. Farther out than halfway to the edge of the spray water falls much more slowly. The end result is the edges of your lawn will not get enough water, while the middle gets more than it needs and wastes any extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"love love love this doll","review":"this beautiful barbie doll was bought for my young great-grangddaug's barbie collection. she loves the dolls and enjoys just looking at them. she is young but knows these dolls are special. oh yes, she has some barbies to play with but the ones kept in their boxes are just to look at. i saw this gorgeous doll online at amazon.com and had to buy her. the person who sold her was very concerned that the doll would arrive safely and packaged her really well .she is just as their ad stated - it was a great shopping experience!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What!?\\"","review":"This does not look like Barbie - Fashion Feever - Ken Suede Pants Outfit!

The genre of alternative history has always been something that sounded interesting to me, but I'd never read any.Well, the writing is absolutely terrible: Cliches abound; literary crutches that didn't work a first time reused several times, sometimes within a few pages; terrible representation of Southern dialect; lots of things that just annoy the heck out of me.If I had realized this book was 640 pages long, I would have given up on it early. But, I'll give Turtledove this, I cared about a few of the characters and finished it up because I wanted to know what the heck happens. Unfortunately, it's part of a trilogy so I only got a small payoff at the end -- one I saw coming, at that. I won't be picking up the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Flabbling\\" Waste of Time","review":"Being a fan of another alt-hist writer I thought I'd give Harry Turtledove a try. Maybe I should have started with an earlier novel, but I went for a more recent work assuming the author would have developed his writing skill.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I thought \\"Settling Accounts\\" was a humorless bore with stilted plot development and empty characterizations. Even the cliffhanger ending sputtered out with a yawn. The in-your-face constant use of the \\"n\\" word,especially in combination with Turtledove's idiotic, parallel universe bending concept of \\"population reduction,\\" is a straight up insult to every American, black or white, who lives in the South. Perhaps the author hoped those sentiments would stimulate thought and provoke discussion of the subject of racial inequality in the United States, but I found the novel far too juvenile to consider this within the realm of literary exploration. It was simply ugly.Darn, I was hoping to have a new author to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"condition rated incorrectly","review":"The condition of the book was not as was stated.

It is great mix of romance, crazy hollywood people and Alpha-males."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not her best.","review":"Julia London said on her website that she garnered some of the best reviews of her career for this book and while it was good, I don't believe it's her best work. I still think the Devil's Love, Wicked Angel and the Rogues of Regent Street were her best work. I enjoyed the connection and the story between Marnie and Eli but I found myself, at times, skimming over pages more quickly than I have done with any of her other books which tells me that it did not hold my interest like some of her other work. I guess I like her deeper, more intense love stories versus the quirky comedy of Wedding Survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever lead somewhere?","review":"I literally love everything she writes and was floored when I couldn't finish this book.

Several years ago I bought a half dozen 2 ft stainless steel shelves from a local big box store - cost was $44 each. Recently I needed to add longer and larger shelves but had little hope of finding anything affordable. Surprisingly I came across these and ordered two thinking I'd be able to make do even if they were thin. Surprisingly, these are not thin but quite sturdy. They are an ample width and easily hold larger items with a 100 pound caapcity. Installation is simple. While there are more attractive units on the market that don't show the brackets, the rolled edge does help provide both safety and added finish.Bottom line - versatile, functional, sturdy and great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing metalcore","review":"This band just plain rocks.

There is more research and development of motivation as the investigation unfolds. Less shocking discoveries more insights into the behavior of people........... I like the approach very much. This was my first experience with Ms. Leon and it has made me eager to read more of her novels in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Venice the Menace","review":"This was strictly a for-fun read, although the subject matter was dead serious. The death of a maestro, who is also a monster, isn't a new theme. But Leon's hero, Brunetti, the main subject of the story, is whimsical and warm, and I love him. I can certainly see, however, why the Italians refuse to print this in Italian. Leon's honest portrayal of Venice is a menace. I'm ready for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed every minute","review":"What a fun book! This was my first Donna Leon book, and I'll definitely be reading more. Brunetti is such a likable character, though even the less likable ones have their endearing quirks. Leon has a nice style, and I found myself laughing out loud more than once at some of the humorous interactions and observations she depicts. I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because I thought the resolution of the book didn't quite work as well as the rest of the book. (I don't want to say too much! You'll have to read it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow To Start . . .","review":". . . but well worth seeing through to the end. The lead character, Dottore Brunetti, is an engaging man who -�?supported by a well developed cast of characters �?pulls you through the plot's twists and turns before delivering you to the denouement with the who, what, and why all neatly packaged. A satisfying read; I'm looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Little Crime Story","review":"I'm not following the five star group, but I enjoyed the story and the way Donna Leon writes. There's enough personal information about each of the main characters to add the realness and enjoy the little fickle behaviors of each, without it becoming the main driving part of the story telling. And the story itself is good, but not excellent in my opinion, because certain things that happened are almost too bad and too cliche-ish. There's a bit of exaggeration here and there of how bad some of the living conditions are and how much certain people have suffered because of this evil genius. And yet, in the end, we have a reasonable explanation of what happened, a charitable act of forgiveness that makes us feel better about \\"the law\\", and there's a certain balance of good and evil that feels like real justice instead of \\"letter of the law.\\"I'll definitely read more of the series to get the larger view. This was my first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm","review":"Donna Leon and her series was recommended to me by several readers because of my love of the mystery novel and a special fondness for mysteries set in Italy.This is the only novel of Leon's I have read thus far and my recommenders were absolutely correct the mystery is well written and engaging and the Commissario Guido Brunetti is a winner.However I figured out the motive pretty early on in the novel. Normally I never do that nor do I really try. This is the third time that a first novel of a series (including Elizabeth George)delves into this particular social ill as a motive for the murder. I suppose the question of which author started this trend is kind of the chicken or the egg.Nevertheless I will get hold of the next novel in the series. Brunetti, his family and his approach are fun as well as the mystery writing well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will Caterella burst into Brunetti's office?","review":"If you enjoy the Guido Brunetti novels by Donna Leon then by all means you really need to also read Andrea Camilleri's \\"Inspector Montalbano\\" series of books.

Camilleri's books were translated into English by Stephen Sartarelli and provide abundant footnotes explaining Italian culture.I would highly recommend both series."},{"rating":"2","title":"How About a Region 1, English Subtitle version of the German Series?","review":"I love this author and all the books, but do you all realize we're missing out?

How about trying to get this series as a Region 1, English Subtitled, DVD for your loyal Brunetti Fans? While it appears they were not highly rated on IMDB, they were filmed in Venice, and I believe the fans of this series would not be critical if given the opportunity to follow in Brunetti's footsteps through the streets of Venice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Effort Yet!","review":"This is my 3rd Donna Leon, Commissario Brunnetti mystery, maybe there is something to be said for starting in order...In Death at La Fenice, the famous Conductor, Helmut Wellauer is found dead in his dressing room of cyanide poisoning. Commissario Brunnetti is given the case and pretty soon his list of suspects is long, but realizing he doesn't know much about the man himself he keeps digging to uncover the mystery behind his death.This was Leon's best effort yet, in my opinion. The mystery was well written and well developed with many plausible \\"suspects\\" that kept me guessing until Brunnetti himself figured it out.The difference between this book and her others that I have read was there was not as much description about Venice in it (which I usually love, but now wonder if it meaningless prose that just feels the pages) and the mystery was well developed and interesting.If you are going to read Leon I would definitely recommend Death at La Fenice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you to Italla","review":"I just got back from Venice and it's the most beautiful city in the world. This easy read takes you right back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG BORING QUESTIONING","review":"I think, Donna Leon is a very good writer. What I mean is, that she's got a very good writing style, but unfortunately she is a very very bad screenplay-writer. What I want to say is that in this book, there is just too much times the same plot, there are not enough exciting parts which would bring a real progress in the case. It's just always the same story, about twenty times in the book, Brunetti goes to someone and talks with him, but he doesn't find out anything intresting that would bring a bit of excitement in this boring questionings. The end is really good and logical, but I think that this good part only contains about 30-40 pages, and that's not enough to make a crimestory worth to be read. I think, perhaps I should read another book written by Donna Leon, to get used to her style and to Guido, who is very sympathic to me, but I don't know if I'll have the power to manage this incredible boreness during 95% of a book once again...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death at La Fenice","review":"I found this book very disappointing.

Be warned, however, that these books are not terribly suspenseful and are certainly not thrillers -- they are highly literate police detective novels.. They are fun to read because the characters, especially Brunetti and his wife, are like real people (not superheros like Jack Reacher and Mitch Rapp), interesting, and very well drawn and developed from novel to novel..

I only took sections 1 and 3; passed section 1 and missed section 3 by two points. The reason I hold this book accountable is that it makes no mention whatsoever, in its section 3 study guide, about reading sheet music. However, on the exam I took there were several multiple choice questions and one short-answer response that relied on reading music. Without any idea this would be on the test, I was a bit dumbfounded, having no previous knowledge of reading music. Had this been covered, and given the tiny margin by which I did not pass the test, I regret using this book, and will opt for Barron's in the future, who, I later checked, does cover reading sheet music.

(I haven't looked at the math/science section yet.) When I took the practice test I found that it didn't mirror the CSET test very well and when I read the REA section, I found that it didn't even prepare me for their own practice test. I was more wobbly on Section III (phys ed, music, art, health). What I lacked there was some terminology and sheet music familiarity. The book ended up not covering any of this material at all. I was really worried as I really need that stuff for the official CSET practice test. I found fill-ins and my actual test didn't have as much sheet music 'reading' on it as the practice test, so I was lucky, but I didn't feel this book prepared me and it had LOTS of errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Do not waste your money on purchasing this book!

The item I received was below expectations in comparison to other products I own by Gilmour.First, the rubber fell off after a couple of uses. Very hard to adjust without the rubber portions.Second, this has a very small outlet with reduced water flow in comparison to others I own. I believe they made the outlet tube very small to accommodate the rubber piece that promptly fell off.Third, contrary to statements on Gilmour's website about the number of products made in USA, this is made in China.In summary, I would not purchase again. Disappointed with the product, but given the price not worth sending it back and paying return shipping.I would recommend the Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle sold by Amazon for almost the same price. Larger, solid brass, smooth turning and no rubber pieces to fall off. The Dramm is also made in the USA and my wife and I like its spray pattern and water flow better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for all Cat Lovers - (and dog lovers, too)","review":"What fun! I put Willie Morris' writing on a par with Cleveland Amory. His transition from being a \\"dog man\\" to a \\"cat man\\" resembles what, I am sure, many people have gone through. The cat's mysterious ways finally sink in, and sense is made of them. One must observe the cat's behavior carefully - the whiskers going forward mean one thing; whereas, if they go another way, it could mean a 360 degree change in mood. The way cats use their tails is another indicator of their humor. Learn the differences. Cats are subtle; dogs are not. There is a lot of down-to-earth cat and dog wisdom in this book for any animal lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great gift!","review":"I am a cat woman who received this book as a gift.I just love it.

Still, I saw a lot of Spit in my two cats and laughed a lot and some of the silly things he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Cat Woman","review":"We all know Willie Morris can write a good book. I laughed as I read My Cat Spit McGee. So many of his stories in this book reminded me of the transformation my husband had made after a kitten entered his life. My husband was much like Willie, always been a \\"dog\\" man. One day our 65 pound Golden Retriever mix/Bear delivered a 5 week old kitten to our house. That little kitten had my husband wrapped around his finger from the start. Now at 14 lbs., Lucky, AKA Knucklehead is Bear's best friend and my husband's buddy. Knucklehead answers to hubby's whistles and loves the redfish scarps as hubby cleans his fish.

It doesn't really alter the shininess/dullness of my hair.

I got that song on a tape a long time ago and thought it was Lizzie Borden because that was what the tape was supposed to be. However, it turns out that was an Exciter song just thrown in on the end of the tape. Well, Seven Witches does an excellent version of it! They also do an amped up version of Bat Benetar's Hell Is For Children.My only criticism is that there are no song credits or lyrics in the CD booklet. For all I know, the entire album is obscure cover songs except for the two tracks I recognize. However you slice it, it is still good power metal and Jack Frost and company know how to lay it down.

These guys come from the country that gave birth to such bands like Sarcofago, Krisiun, Sepultura and more... But none of those bands played Black Metal. This is truly a masterpiece. Fast, extreme, breath-taking and soul ripping black metal agression... I think they sound like a mix of Emperor, Dimmu Borgir and Dark Funeral... They have fast melodies, amazing blastbeats, some great keyboards in the background, chaotic vocals (sometimes very grim and screamed, alot like Ihsahn's vocals, and sometimes more guttural and growled). Simply an amazing job by this great band. I recomend this album to anyone willing to know great Black Metal that is not from Europe. Since lately, most european bands are sounding predictable and the same, or simply throwing all their great work to the trash by releasing crappy techno-ish albums, Unearthly definetely shows us that in other parts of this world, Black Metal is still the greatest music style."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the Dimmu & Emperor fans","review":"This is the 2002 first full-length album from these Brazilian Black Metallers (They had a couple of demos before and have released a second album since).This is one of those albums that I knew nothing about and picked up solely because I thought the cover art looked cool, the song titles sounded interesting and the used price was right.I wouldn't say this album is exactly bad, but it's just not my idea of what Black Metal should be like. But if you're a fan of bands with more of a keyboard sound like Dimmu Borgir or Emperor, I'd say that this album is fairly decent and might be worthwhile checking out. -- Especially if you can pick it up cheap used like I did.

Seems low resolution, and herky jerky. Heck someone with a home computer could improve upon it. Acting is grade D television level. I blame directing for that. Editing is pitiful. You see things like one scene with bikers along the street rolling up on the middle of the scene, then cut to another angle and they are gone. Ditto for the vehicles on the street. And so on and so forth.In short, pretty much everything is bad about this. How it got some good reviews I don't know other than folks like their cursing (I don't mind if it fits), and they are easily pleased.Avoid this at all costs.

There is no way this will provide a fair bounce off the board as it is stiff where the frame is but very flimsy in the sections between. I'm amazed that Spalding even sells something like this. Reinforcing the frame everywhere (eliminating the current large spaces with nothing but the thin backboard) would make it usable, but I think I'll just find a better set.The frame seems adequate, and the rim assembly also appears to be solid--1 star for that. But the backboard itself just ruins it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost impossible to install alone.","review":"This product is almost impossible to install alone. I ordered the proper installation kit for installing on either a pole or flat wall. I chose to install on a garage wall above the door. Some of the holes were improperly spaced. I had to cut one of the pieces shorter and re-drill a hole in the rim. It would have been much easier if you had a second person to hold the rim while you attempted to install it. The instructions were very confusing as well. Some of the mounting hardware still isn't tight due to incorrect fitting holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A triple headache, a double nightmare!","review":"The product itself is OK, but the installation was a nightmare. We had to go out and buy parts since those enclosed were not adequate. The instructions were all wrong and the board could not be assembled or installed by following them. The item had to be returned once because the box was all beat up and there were parts missing The second time the box was also delivered in a very poor condition, but no parts missing. So we decided to keep it since this was a Christmas present for my grandson and this was already the middle of January. We did not expect the nightmare that followed. I wouldn't recommend buying this Backboard from this supplier to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"basketball","review":"Ordered 6 of these for a facility, three were installed about a month ago and 2 of the 3 rims have broke off from the backboard.

I have the old backboard removed, so I called Spalding with instructions in hand only to be put through to a voice mail/answering machine. Needless to say after leaving a detailed message and return phone number no one ever returned my call.

To right this wrong, he advocates forgiving international loans. Let us be clear about this: The loans will be forgiven by using public money. That is, our money. Yours and mine. In other words, a singer-songwriter who is not in any sense elected and has no legal constituency is working busily to appropriate your money to forgive loans that were secured by corrupt foreign despots.This is a really irritating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Need More People Like Bono in the World.","review":"Bono is a hero to just about anyone who can put their cynicism aside just long enough see his honesty.Here's a guy who's got access to a rare vantage point. He talks candidly with the politicians, the celebrities, the billionaires and the world leaders of social change during the day; and then at night he sings his heart out with 20,000 of his closest friends. This is someone who's perspective is well worth listening to. Reading his words is a true education.This guy who interviewed him, Michka, does a decent job considering he's obviously star-struck. I wish someone who was a bit less cynical, and a bit more spiritually aligned with Bono's heart and soul, would do an extended interview like this with him.Nonetheless, Bono's voice still rings through loud and clear in this worthwhile read - what do you expect?

Its well worth the money and the honesty this man pours out in the pages is well worth the time spent reading it. I love Bono. He is a passion in my life, his music and his incredible open heart.

If everyone could just do more to help others, I think this world would be a great place for EVERYONE. And I think Bono is a real asset in making others see this.

I thought it was going to be another \\"entertainment book\\" about U2 and their career. Little did I realize that this book is very in-depth about \\"the man behind the shades\\". Bono shares his joys, his struggles, and his adventure in this book. It covers anything from his family, his inadequacy as a celebrity, the workings of U2, his activism, faith, and other topics. This book is definitely a must read for anyone who loves U2's music and wants to gain a better understanding of Bono."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look into Bono's character","review":"A long-time fan of U2's music and impressed by Bono's activisim, I was anxious to read this new book. And I loved it! I couldn't put it down!Written in a coversational style, I at first thought it may be difficult to follow. Instead, I pleasantly realized that it made me feel as if I was listening to Bono talk to a group of which I was part. Because we are actually reading his words, I think we really get a look into Bono's mind - or even his soul.Every topic I could want to hear Bono talk about is covered - his music, the band, his family, his belief in God, and his activism. It had it all.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about what makes Bono tick. It confirmed to me that he has a very big heart, a great intellect, and incredible talent.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting conversations between friends","review":"To anyone who has wondered why Bono is the way he is, this book pretty much answers any questions you may have had. He comes across as a very bright and caring person who has a sarcastic wit about him, but who can change gears and get into some fairly deep topics. You also get to hear why charity is so important to him-the talks on charity were my favorite chapters. All in all recommended for U2 and Bono fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, not as good as expected.","review":"The teacher do not demonstrate West Coast Swing dance with clear distinct movements and style.

The information that is provided about the classic usage of chilis in many dishes and the whole section on hot salsas is just not classic Cuban. While the book provides some interesting takes on classic Cuban cooking, don't look to it to recreate Cuban dishes that you'd get in a Cuban home or restaurant. Overall, I found it inauthentic.

Without hesitation, I would give five stars to the audio CD of \\"Servant of the Bones.\\" What happened? The premise of this book is theretelling of the story of Jesus, when he is a young boy. The author borrows from the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the New Testament. But the combination doesn't work. First of all, the narrator is weak; True, he is supposed to be a quite young, but his voice doesn't have direction or strenght...after all, he \\"is\\" supposed to be Jesus! Other aspects of the book are unconvincing. The idea that Philo, the great intellectual of Alexandria, desperately wanted the 7 year oldJesus as a student of Jewish scripture is simply not believable.I wanted to like this book, but it doesn't match Anne Rice's earlier efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing look at Jesus's early life","review":"The early of Jesus is not very well documented in the bible or in many other places. Anee Rice takes her poetic liscense and paints a wonderful picture of what life for Jesus was probably like when he was growing up in Egypt and Israel. She is able to show the certain problems that he would have confronted when he was growing up as the Son of God. She is able to keep the reader interested with what is going to happen next, because even the best biblical scholars wouldn't know what was going to happen.

I found it extrememly boring. Nothing much seemed to happen plot-wise and it was very slow. I have read books before where the plot itself was slow, but the relationships between the characters were deep and involved, which kept the reader's interest. This book did not even have much in the way of character development, making Mary and Joseph seem shallow and bland. There was even this one character who kept laughing all the time in the first half of the book - I never could figure out why he was laughing all the time, and it began to annoy me! The end of the book did pick up somewhat and began to hold my interest, but overall, a tedious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"This book was poorly written and full of inaccuracies about the life of Christ. It makes him into a sci-fi type of superhero who has to learn to control his \\"superpowers\\", which suprise even himself (since he doesn't know who he is). It's one of the downers of this book that Jesus is shown as accidentally killing a boy with his superpowers because he hadn't learned to \\"control\\" them yet. Moreover, Mary is portrayed as a pathetic, weak and constantly crying woman. In addition, the book is boring and lacks action. The most interesting part of the book was the writer's explanation of her own faith and the research she did for this book - research that unfortunately is not evident in the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring and Tedious Story Ever Told","review":"I can't remember ever reading such a boring book.

But it's just so dang BORING! The journey from Alexandria to Bethlehem, which could easily have been covered in three chapters, drags over half the freaking book. There's so much repetition, and tiny short repetitive sentences alternating with huge, paragraph-long sentences, that I just couldn't bring myself to finish the last 1/4.

Her personal \\"witness\\" at the end of her new novel was the best part of the read. The novel itself drags on mercilessly without much action or interesting dialog. To her credit, Anne Rice did do her research and she didn't cheat. She read broadly from the theological spectrum of ideas and undertook some fine critical thinking of her own and for that, I applaud her. Unfortunately, the price of the book was not worth these few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"For me Anne Rice has always been a little hit and miss, and this novel is no exception. There was nothing I liked about this novel. The writing was sub-par, the material was bland and flowery. Granted she took on a different aspect of Christ's life, and I could tell she did her research, but the end result wasn't a compelling book. Anne Rice needs to go back to writing about vampires because if this is what her future writing is going to be like, I will be tuning out.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"2","title":"kind of like the vampire ones","review":"i wasnt sure what to expect with anne rice being christianish now, but the book was good. it was like reading one of her vampire novels, only instead of drinking blood, the main character can heal or kill things. it is missing the eroticism. but other than that, a usual anne rice book, which means it's of course excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I have been a Rice fan for many years, yet as a Catholic I must admit I was very skeptical about reading Anne Rice's biography of Jesus. After creating so many maginificent anti-hero characters, could Anne create an objective portrait of our Lord Jesus? But once I began reading the book, I could not put it down. There is no hint of Lestat there, the book stands on its own without the monster's help. If you are looking for Lestat, you will not find him in this book, but you will find it to be an inspirational, beautifully written story about the young Jesus. A very bold move by Anne Rice to write this in the first person, but this boldness is what Rice's fans like about her, her work is never \\"watered-down\\" and Out of Egypt is just as daring and excellent as all of her past novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of egypt","review":"quite boring.. so many names & places that mean nothing to me.. i am @ 60% on my kindle.. waiting for something .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"Book was a little disappointing, but seller has Great stuff; great prices.

At least for people who have been exposed to more than a bible.I'm sorry to lose such a great author to the, in my opinion, real dark side.

But one of the reasons I like Anne Rice's Vampire and other gothic tales is that she explores morality and ethics beyond, and in spite of, faith. Here she does a 180 and embraces the myths of Christianity and seems to say that faith in needed for good. I guess I am disappointed in this new interest of hers because her rationalization for atheism in The Vampire Lestat was sublime. The writing is classic Rice; the themes are weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to fiction, Anne","review":"Why is it when celebrities like Mel Gibson and Anne Rice have some sort of ephipany, they feel compelled to educate the masses on their beliefs by mass-marketing fiction? Like the Passion of the Christ, this book was based on a purely Catholic point of view and is biblical only on the major points. I have to admit I was turned off early on when she wrote about Jesus' siblings not truly being blood brothers, but were Joseph's from a former marriage? Where does it say that in the Bible? If you truly want to learn about the life of Christ, don't turn to highly popular but fictional stories--go to the original source, the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This is an interesting move on the author's part to begin from the fiction work of the special powers of vampires and now move to the equally fiction work of the special powers of Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"First-person voice of Jesus is problematic","review":"This book is an interesting view of something we really know nothing about , the early years of Jesus Christ. The Bible provides very little information on what Jesus was like as a young boy so Anne Rice is as free as anyone to speculate about it, I suppose.Still I think her writing this book in the first-person, giving you a direct window on Jesus' mind, is problematic. It is one thing to try to imagine the circumstances of Jesus' early years. It is quite another to delve into his consciousness. It puts quite a strain on the \\"willing disbelief\\" that any reader must bring to work of fiction, especially a story so presumptuous as the one Ms. Rice has written here.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding!?","review":"Somewhere it was probably a good idea unfortunately, it all went pear shaped between the idea and the publication. Whoever said that they weeped over this book was probably only weeping remembering the money and/or time they spent over this book.Personally, I'm a huge Anne Rice fan but on the 3rd page of this book I wondered where Anne Rice was. I felt like I was left in a desert somewhere and she had taken my money and run.I think Anne should have stuck with her Erotica and Vampires, two genres she knows very well. I think Jesus' story should be left to the other infamous book everyone's already aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in faith?","review":"Anna Rice reconversion to catholicism also spells the beginning of the end for her imagination, creativity, openness, and even world view. This book is a testimony to this unfortunate reality. While the latest trends in spirituality and research on Jesus, has led to the conclusion that Jesus was simply a wise man, an old and wise soul, yet married with a son, Anne Rice falls back on her old faith, revealing to her readers a tunnel vision. In a time when america is becoming a dangerous coutry filled with religious fanatics, this book reinforces the fallacy that Jesus was divine, a belief or blind faith that has led humanity to murder in the name of jesus, and to deny the existence of our divine self and responsability to \\"know thyself\\", the true secret to life as revealed by Jesus, Buddha and Sacrates."},{"rating":"1","title":"booklady","review":"as a librarian, i felt an obligation to read this book; if only to answer the question \\"have you read this book?\\". i found it repetitive and shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"What a lovely surprise. Have been an Anne Rice fan for many years. Have read almost every book she has ever written. Ms Rice has always had a knack for creating a written work of original viewpoint or storyline but for me the best part has always been her prose. This book reveals an entirely new side of the author. I am not surprised by her originality nor her courage, but writing the story of Jesus in the first person is a stroke of genius. And as usual, her skills and talent in forming emotions, impressions, and just enough detail to fully wrap yourself in a character's life is in full bloom. I highly recommend this book, even for those who aren't staunchly Christian. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Speaks To The Heart.","review":"This is a picture of Jesus - as a young boy - that fits comfortably into the character of Christ as found in the Gospels... and yet the creative detail imagined to fully render that character brings a fresh light and joy to the subject. The heart of this book testifies to its author's spirit of humility and grace.Those who know the Lord will love this story. For those unfamiliar with Christ, what an introduction to the possibilities of his undocumented early years!Thank you Anne, for moving us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to the next","review":"The book starts a little slow but is still punctuated with moments heartfelt drama and genuine insight. After the first half it picks up and paints some vivid pictures. It's a quick read and, for me, brought a level of realism to the Christ story that I could really relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"kitschy bad taste","review":"The best thing that can be said about Rice's foray into god-botherer territory is that she takes a fairy tale figure and turns it into kitch fiction. If you want to experience an explosion of Catholic bad taste, dip into this Christmas turkey. You will not be dissapointed. It reads like the Jesus-on-the-way-to-calvary and the sublime rosary f**k sequences from John Waters' 'Multiple Maniacs'. In a word, jaw-dropping."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't want to read this book","review":"I used to read all Ane Rice novels, I don't do it anymore. Somewhere along the line I find their new books not interestingly enough so now I prefer to read the reviews and then decide to read (buy) the book or not. Frankly I think that if I was interested in reading about Jesus life (which must be interesting, endearing and valuable) I would choose another writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Turn-about","review":"I had heard Anne Rice had converted to the Catholic religion and was so incredibly devoted to it that she just had to write books about the life of Christ. No more horror for her!Well I guess she did not make enough money to make it worth while, so she announced she was going back to writing the other stuff.It made her books about Christ cheap and deceitful.I threw the book away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"This account of the childhood years of Jesus kept me entertained and looking forward to any future installments of the story that Ms. Rice may write.Since reading her first published novel years ago, I've always felt that Rice has a real talent for first-person narration. I believe she displays that talent well in this novel. She quickly draws the reader into the story by the convincing strength of her character's \\"voice\\".I think if you approach this story keeping in mind that it is the author's FICTIONAL \\"take\\" on the early life of Jesus, you'll find it is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"From darkness to the light...","review":"This book was AMAZING. The only problem was that I wanted more at the end and it was hard to tear myself away from it. I poured over the afterward just as eagerly as I did the rest of the book. Anne Rice's attention to historic detail and her ability to help me see in a completely new way a glimpse however small into what it might have been like for a human child to realize that he is the messiah and responsible for the saving of the entire world's soul's and yet still having to fit into the hum drum existence of daily life was just breath takingly real and fluid. I left the book with an even deeper faith and a new desire for more knowledge of the life of Christ. Well done Mrs. Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christ the Lord-Out of Egypt","review":"Totally light-weight reading. I expected something better from Anne Rice. There are some things that should be left as a \\"mystery\\", like the boyhood life of Jesus. His character is so much bigger than this book does or could protray. I was planning on reading the next book, but definitely not now. My 8 year-old granddaughter has read better books than this except maybe the names aren't as difficult to pronounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject Interesting, Book Boring","review":"A year in the life of a seven year old Jesus is an interesting topic at first glance. But then again, a perfect child, with perfect parents and a perfect brother don't do much to inspire my interest. Rice writes firmly within her new found Catholic Orthodoxy and for those who believe in this particular conservative brand of theology her juvenile Christ may well inspire. She takes a well researched but narrow minded scope of first century life in Palestine, and her characters never seem to live as real people except to further her own brand of religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"My second review of this work","review":"After reading it a second time I can only say...its worse. The book is SO Biblically inaccurate it should be tough for believers to read without rolling one's eyes 1000 or so times. For example, James, the charater so many other reviewers like, was in fact not Jesus' older brother as is depicted in the book (yes, I know its fiction). Jesus in fact was the oldest of Mary's children (hence....she was a virgin) and Mary was Joseph's first wife (hence....he had no other children before Jesus). At age 7 Jesus did in fact have a cousin James, who would have been about 13, the son of Alphaeus. Jesus' brother James was Mary's second born and at the time Jesus was 7 James was about 5. In Anne's book not only does she makeno reference to any of Jesus' half siblings she openly states Mary and Joseph never had relations.Again, I know its fiction, but come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE!!!!!","review":"I swear every time I pick this book up to try and read it I fall asleep.

This book was SUCH a disappointment to me. I had to force myself to read it through. The only \\"positive\\" thing was it gave some historical context through \\"personal experience\\" pov, but really, my feeling after having read this book was simply, \\"Well, I read it...\\" Almost as bad as \\"The Violin\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would def. make an interesting movie with the right script...","review":"Written from the perspective of Jesus as a 7-year-old, this is a delicate rendering of what the author thinks may have run through his mind leading up to his discovery of 'who' he is. The book moves slowly and carefully weaving subtly bits of all the gospels and early Christian legend regarding Jesus. It is an interesting read... esp. the quite long Author's Note which details Rice's return (after a long stay as a athiest) to rather Orthodox Catholicism theology (even though she appears to still hold liberal political views - I think). It would no doubt make for an interesting - though no doubt controversial - film, if ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Fiction","review":"while the book is a decent read, Anne Rice's personal commentary on her journey of faith while writing this book (provided as a post script) remains the most fascinating thing about it. however, the content provides a colorful understanding of the cultural backdrop behind the story of the life of joseph mary, & jesus christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I was reading the wrong book","review":"Unlike others here, I found the book dull and tedious and could hardly wait to get to the end (I never quit a book once I start)....a real snoozer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elicits praise","review":"Great retelling.Really highlights devotion, praise and worship.A great addition to the christian library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"When I first heard about this book, I wondered how vampires fit into Christ's story. Much to my surprise, Rice has set aside vampires and has found this truly worthy subject. This is a book of fiction since we don't have any historical documents to help us know what Jesus' early life was like, but Rice has done extensive research to try to give us as \\"true\\" a picture as possible. She tells an excellent story, and even though readers can acknowledge that this is fiction (albeit well researched), it opens up our minds to thinking about just what kind of life Jesus may have had before his public life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pious much?","review":"This book was beautifully written (although I found several typos) and obviously painstakingly researched. What several previous reviewers seem to miss is that this novel covers a span of time in Jesus' life that wasn't recorded anywhere. So I see little point in criticizing Rice for not 'sticking to the bible' there. What I enjoyed most about this book is that it strongly depicts Jesus as a Jew, a fact that many people seem to forget. However, the plot is terribly slow and perhaps using a first person narrative wasn't the greatest idea. But the bottom line is that this is a nicely written historical novel that clearly comes from a place of love and devotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cheers and 5 Stars for Anne Rice!","review":"I've always been a huge fan of Anne Rice, but this book is her best. She clearly illustrates her passion for her subject matter, and paints a fascinating tableau of the early years of Jesus Christ. Although I've heard biblical stories all my life, unfortunately I had never reflected on what his life and influences must have been as a child.Anne Rice weaves her story in such an interesting and vivid way that you feel you are in the life and times of Jesus. This is a must read...you won't be able to stop thinking about it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subject; great possibilities; poor execution.","review":"I really only finished the book because it had so much potential. While the development of how Jesus came to be a 30 year old man in full ministry, found in the Gospels, was included, and intriguing, Anne Rice's telling should have been a much shorter novel. For me, a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great!","review":"I loved this book! Even though this is a \\"story\\" that most of us know, I found it to be a real page-turner that I couldn't put down until I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solemn and special","review":"Good book on the life of Jesus-the -child with excellent historical background of 1st century Judea. Rice beautifully re-creates the possible life of 7 year old Christ just after the return to Nazareth from Egyptian hide-out. It's an interesting approach to Jesus humanity and divinity without much of pompous characterization. The book should be a good read for believers and non-believers alike. However, I have decided not to give 5 stars, because throughout my reading I was unable to be connected to book and care about the story, and even at times I was thinking to abandon or rush to the conclusion. At the end, I stayed to the end, and enjoyed the marvels and hardships of the one year in Jesus earthly life. I hope, Anne Rice will continue with adult life of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ the Lord, was a child before becoming a man","review":"It's easy to forget Jesus was a child before he grew into a man. In Anne Rice's Christ the Lord, he's a kind, intelligent child with many questions, particularly about the strange circumstances of his birth his family refuses to speak about. His coming into this knowledge, and first insights into his divinity, are the central story of this book.Christ the Lord is a compassionate, thoughtful imagining of what life must have been like for young Jesus. At times it's slow and uneventful, but Jesus' moments of revelation are stirring, and make this a worthwhile read. If you enjoy Christ the Lord, I highly recommend Norman Mailer's The Gospel According to the Son, which is similar in ambition but tackles a broader period of Christ's life.I listened to Christ the Lord unabridged on audio, narrated by Josh Heine. He does a nice job capturing the innocence and intelligence of Anne Rice's thoughtful young Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very Boring","review":"Anne Rice lends a voice to the Christ-child in her novel, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt. Through the eyes of a very young Jesus, the reader learns about the return of the holy family from Egypt, as well as Jewish culture, and how Jesus learned his true identity.Obviously, this novel is quite a departure for Anne Rice. I do not have an issue with the subject matter, nor do I take issue with any minor historical inaccurracies. My problem with this novel was how truly boring it was. Rice is capable of spellbinding her reader through vivid description and crafting an intriguing tale. Unfortunately, she did neither of those things here. The plot, if you will, was extremely dry. The reader learned more about the surroundings of the characters than about the characters themselves. Her narrative tone was flat and unimaginative.The bottom line is that I was very disappointed with this book. It was not at all what I expected. I cannot honestly say I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ the lord out of cana","review":"This book was a little slower to start with than the first book, but still captured my imagination. The \\"good parts\\", where Jesus realizes his power, are an inspiration to us all. It allows you the reader to feel God is here for you by making Jesus a normal man of flesh and blood. He feels anxieties, he has desires, he is searching for his future just like us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding the way","review":"Based on meticulous research, Anne Rice has written a beautiful account of a year plus in the life of Jesus as a young boy. She writes in the first person, which works better than I would have expected, and seems to have an intuitive understanding of how this boy might have pondered the things that made him different but which his family was not yet ready to explain to him.The tone is reverent, but not mushy. Jesus is a real boy, with human thoughts and emotions, being brought up in the Jewish culture. Although there are flashes of his divinity and the role that he is destined to play, they do not predominate.So whether you are a confirmed Christian or reading the book for other reasons, there is much of value here.Also be sure to read Rice's notes about why she wrote the book,I found them inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"Everyone's criticism is valid. The book is a bit dry, and as person who has NEVER PICKED UP AN ANNE RICE book in my life, I can see the lack of imagination and imagery that would have kept me riveted. However the book shines as historical fiction. As a Christian, I am drawn to understand the politics and culture that Jesus grew up in. From gender roles to the role of the elderly and children, I was captured by how detailed (historically) the book was. I recommend it to anyone interested in learning the circumstances and background that surrounded Our Lord in his youth.What I would like to see was more exploration and narration, but i would definitely continue on with the trilogy Rice has in mind, and hopeful the passion of Jesus (and Rice's poetic writing) will arise in his teenage years...which in all honestly is totally open to creativity because there is nothing in the traditional bible on that period in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus made boring","review":"My bookclub picked this book and the decision was unanimous: Boring! It takes some talent to make a bloody riot in Jerusalem a yawn, but somehow Anne Rice managed it. The most interesting part of the book was the Author's Note in the back. However, all the extensive research Rice claims to have done doesn't really show itself. The book is strangely devoid of any sense of realism. Rice's characters all feel distant and undeveloped. Even her efforts to add historical context feel sketchy. My suggestion? If you want a novel about the early years of Jesus, read Christopher Moore's \\"Lamb: The Gospel According to Jesus' Childhood Friend.\\" It doesn't even pretend to be Biblically or historically accurate, but you care far more for this Jesus than Rice's hollow portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking about what Jesus ' early life may have been like","review":"I am reading this book for a second time.

It read more like an adult attempting to sound like a child and failing. There are a number of instances in this novel that could have been elaborated on (Why was that character always laughing?).

Her uncanny ability to have her main character speak to us draws her readers in again and again.

Catholics believe that not only Jesus but Mary and Joseph as well knew who Jesus was from the very beginning. Christ was fully man and fully human; at no time did he not know who he was. The idea that Jesus could, not knowing who he is, accidentally wish someone dead is completely unbelieveable and is very offensive to Catholics (or at least to those Catholics who understand their faith). Rice should have spent more time researching her new faith before she decided to write about it. If she had, this could have been five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story!","review":"This book, written in the first person of 7 year old Jesus, is the story of how Jesus came to discover who he really is. It's a beautifully written, well researched historical fiction that left me feeling uplifted and hopeful. There's something for everyone in this story - even for those who don't believe Jesus is the son of God. Because this story is about love, forgiveness, purity of heart. I read some of the criticisms here, and the tone of their blurbs all suggest a prejudice that has nothing to do with this book, but rather a complaint that Anne Rice dares to claim Jesus was the son of God. That's not a criticism of this book, that's a criticism of the Catholic faith. And to understand the difference is an important distinction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or Fiction, It's a Good Story","review":"Initially, I picked up this book with a bit of skepticism. I was a fan of her earlier novels, and quirked an eyebrow at the news that she'd converted to Catholicism. However, I was curious about how she'd handle the earlier years of Jesus, so when presented the opportunity to borrow the book from a friend, I did. I could hardly put it down.Ms. Rice gave life to a portion of Jesus's earlier years that, I'm afraid the Bible lacked. At least that the standard King James version lacks, I'll admit that I'm not familiar with anything more than that. I was intrigued, and in the end, I was drawn into the story through the perspective that Anne Rice used. Researched or not, factual or not, and real or not, she made me want to know more, and I would greatly recommend reading this to anyone!I hope she continues this further in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"total new direction for Anne Rice","review":"Anne Rice is by far my favorite author, so it was a given that I would work my way through this one eventually. I must say that it took me a while to get into \\"Christ the lord: out of Egypt\\". I read thirty or so pages and put it down for months before starting in again. The pace is somewhat slow compared to Ms Rice's vampire chronicles, but still well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ the Lord Out of Egypt","review":"I was very impressed with Ms Rice's style of writing. It was as though you were hearing the story first hand from Jesus himself. It put Jesus in a human perspective and her style of presenting Him in this manner made this a believable story. I found myself picturing in my mind as I read along that I was actually there and observing the events myself. Excellent piece of work. I have recommended this book to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Departure","review":"Those of you familiar with prior works of author Anne Rice might be surprised with this novel, as it is in no way related to bizaare or freakish content. It is a thought provoking and thoroughly descriptive account on the life of Jesus. Even if you are not a believer, the historical narrative is entertaining! Give it a try. Anne Rice's writing style is recognizable and carries the reader along for the duration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Couldn't put the CD down. Josh Heine is perfect reader.","review":"I heard the CD version and just LOVED it!! And Josh Heine is a perfect reader for this book. He made me feel as though I were right in there with all the characters. He was a wonderful choice.I've never read an Anne Rice book, and after this one, I sure want to read another one. She is a very talented writer.To anyone who is afraid of reading material written by a \\"secular\\" writer, fear not! I was actually encouraged in my faith by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book, Great Subject","review":"I'm a bit surprised by all the rave reviews this book has received, I guess the simple fact that Lestat-Anne Rice simply writing anything remotely religious made a lot of reviewers ignore this book's major flaws.The book's main weakness is its structure which can be a bit confusing, additionally there are just so many characters, you end up losing interest in its main protagonist which defeats the purpose of the book.Also, Anne Rice's language is repetitive and simplistic, a far cry from the poeticisms of her Lestat books.And finally, the saccharine wide-eyed tone of the book can become too much.Disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and fascinating...","review":"When I first saw the title and author's name, I assumed she was being irreverent. Then I read an article in our local paper and realized that Anne Rice was sincere and I bought my copy that same day. She has done a wonderful job and I look forward to reading the rest of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I loved Anne Rices' other stuff but was really bored with this. I read 100 pages and gave up on it. I wish she'd go back to the Vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controversial","review":"I had my reservations and even felt 'sinful' while reading about Jesus in the first person. The book had me waiting for the big event to happen and it never did. It was a written account of the mind of child Jesus trying to come to terms with who He was.Controversial piece as nothing has been found from these 'dark years'. The author tempts the reader with names of Biblical personalities in a historically-correct setting making the reader's mind wander and trying to connect the dots. I would not give it an A+ because the structure of the book fails to create momentum. It did, however, bring peace as my mind wandered into known passages of the Christian Bible.From a Christian point of view, there were some assumptions that can lead to confussion for those who do not study the Bible regularly. James and his origin is probably one that would be considered risky, and Joseph's weakness in facing child Jesus. It is after all fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Fell asleep everytime I tried to read more pages. One of the few book I am not going to finish reading.

The liquid crystallizes, so to rewarm it, you have to wrap it in a towel and boil it for 8-10 minutes. Neat idea, but completely impractical. I am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"These things are cute and they work!","review":"I've been using mine for several years now and have given some as gifts. They come ready to use and though they are small they do provide enough heat to keep my hands warm if I stuff then inside my gloves or into my hand muff or hoodie pocket. I use 2, one for each hand. Though the instructions say to wrap in a towel to boil I have used a small linen bag and even just layed them directly into the pan to boil and they still work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lay the Sax Down and Put Your Hands Up!","review":"I no longer have this CD. That in itself should tell you something. I've heard good things from this group so if you're new to them don't write them off entirely. The Sax playing on this album was very distracting and prevented me from getting into the groove. (when I found it.) Yes, Jazz is great! Between the improve and odd time signatures it's something that a real musician or simply a \\"musician at heart\\" can really get into. I just didn't see the point in keeping this album when I've found much tighter playing elsewhere. Sorry guys!

It worked for me for the first four or five months, then stopped working entirely. While my switcher worked during August and most of September in 2009, it often took ten or more button pushes to get the correct \\"channel\\" (1 through 4).

I have been unable to get the Apple TV to work through the switcher. After calling Xtreme's support number and double checking settings, cables etc. I find out that although they claim this device was made for the Apple TV it does not work with some units. After searching the internet for problem with this combination I found that I am not alone, there are a lot of unhappy buyers out there.(note: Extreme mac does not have the usual support forum or faq that most sites have, I think that is intentional to try and keep this problem quiet)I have a new Sony TV, Apple TV, top quality cables, followed all troubleshooting advice. The switcher works fine with my xbox 360 elite, my DVD player and my Dishnet receiver. Just not with the Apple TV. The Apple TV works fine when connected directly to the TV.Buyer Beware, when used with Apple TV this product may or may not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product","review":"If you are looking for a \\"Fire and Forget\\" HDMI switcher, look no further.

It's attractive, and does exactly what it is supposed to. Works perfectly with my Harmony 890 remote -- the codes are in Logitech's database, no learning required.

I placed it underneath the Apple TV box (same exact form factor, designed to stack) and the intense heat from the Apple TV COOKED IT. This is not mentioned anywhere in their literature or on their website. I have been trying to get a replacement unit (which they agreed to do at no charge) since JUNE 2008! They said they have none in stock then and it is now November and they still say they have NONE IN STOCK. I have gotten a run around every time I called them including today, when I asked for a refund so I can buy some other brand on the web. Every time I call I get a different story.

The only time I could pass through the signal is if I set the PS3 to pass through in 1080i.Just to make sure, I plugged the PS3 directly into the same HDMI port on the TV as I was plugging the switcher into, and it would recognize the signal in 1080p, so I know it's not the TV. Plus, I just got a new Samsung PN58A650.Anyway, I called XTremeMac support and they told me that recently there have been problems with the TV recognizing the switcher between the items you are plugging into it and the TV, so that is causing the problem. I don't know why that would cause the problem, but I guess the switcher should be unrecognizable to the TV according to them, and it doesn't do that in the latest batch of these switchers.[...]Good luck to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"non existent after sales service...","review":"I bought ExtremeMac Luna around 18 months ago.

THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR BlOOD AND GORE VIOLENCE,AND A SCENE OF SEXUALITY.The reason I gave it 4 stars was it was a little slow pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason returns. Or does he?","review":"After seeing three virtual re-makes of the first film it is refreshing to find a Friday 13th with some fresh ideas. Tommy Jarvis, who killed the mass-murdering retard Jason Voorhees as a boy, is no 18 and has been institutionalised since the traumatic event. Now at a halfway-house, he finds that Jason has apparently returned. Or has he? The new setting and excelent dream sequence and halucinations make this one of the better of the Friday 13th films. Jason comes across as much more monstrous and there is som nice tongue-in-cheek humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...But Not the Worst In the Series","review":"This movie should be skipped over. You don't even need to watch it to further your understanding of Jason Voorhies or the character of Tommy. It's over the top hilarious and the acting is so bad you'll want to throw your TV out the window.The only thins that I do like about the movie are the Tommy scenes where he's beating up people, and the scenes of the hilbilly mother and son. Otherwise, definitely skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Beginning that should have never been!","review":"Ok, first let me make one thing clear...I noticed that a good bit of reviewers trashed this movie simply because Jason was not the killer. However, this is NOT the reason I am trashing the movie. True, Jason is missed but Part 5 still could have been a better movie than what it was. Yes, the character of Tommy Jarvis returns and I'm assuming this movie takes place 10 years after Part 4. Tommy Jarvis is in a mental institution due to the events of Part 4 but unfortunately the character of Tommy wasn't enough to save the movie. The killer in Part 5 is a father avenging the death of his son and the very last portion of the movie was very lame. Also, Part 5 definately had the most nudity and foul language of any of the Friday the 13th series as one reviewer put it which is a total minus as far as I'm concerned. As I said in my review of Part 4, skip Part 5 and move on to Part 6. Trust me on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Not Bad Underrated Sequel!\\"","review":"John Shepherd, Melanie Kinnaman and Shavar Ross starin this 1985 horror sequel.

He's a very attractive guy (who'd have thought Corey Feldman would bloom into this?), and makes an unusual diversion from the usual chick-parade of the Friday the 13th movies. There is no real plot, even by series standards, and the budget must have been at sub-Charles Band levels judging by the abysmal gore effects (fortunately, they couldn't afford many of them). As for wondering who the killer is, who GIVES?! The 'director', and I use the term loosely, can't even handle the mystery angle properly. Yes, there is one.

I was pretty excited when I first heard about a \\"deluxe edition\\" part 5 being released. Unfortunately for me the extras that were on the workprint release of this same film weren't included. There are some deaths scenes in this film that you actually never get to see. However, these deaths scenes are on the workprint. I just think that if they wanted to release this movie yet again, they should have made it worthwhile by including the extras. It's kind of like when you buy Goonies on DVD and you dont get the extra scenes of the octopus battle and when Troy steals the map from them. I mean why bother? Save your money...because you get no extra death scenes. It's not much different than any other release of \\"A New Beginning\\". I'm very dissatisfied with this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"How stupid...","review":"This F13 has to be the worst, and that's coming from a die hard F13 fan. First of all, it's not even really Jason in this film. It's some posing psycho that puts on the mask and slaughters a few kids. What really made this film stupid, is how the murder scenes were directed. Most of the teenagers died at the same time!The only part that was really cool was when an unexpected, beat up hill billy was decapitated while in motion. I guess that scene was to make the audience gasp. Obviously they needed something to attract the audience from death of boredom.I hate to critize an F13 film, but this one was just terrible. Save your money, and don't buy this one. Two stars at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why they made this one if jason is not on it","review":"This one sucked i mean the movie was good but if they gonna put Jason on it instead of some dude thats acting like him they shoudnt made the movie.You could tell that wasnt Jason the mans size, Jason is like built this dude was skinny.This was the worst one out of the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series stoops to an all new low","review":"After the undeniable success of part 4, It was decided that there would be a part 5 in the series [Despite the fact that part 4 originally promised to be ''The Final Chapter''].

Believe it or not, This could've worked. But, It was all executed wrong. The imitator here is far less thrilling than Jason and the murders are all unoriginal and without any merit. The real Jason does have a cameo appearance in a dream sequence at the beginning of this movie, And when i find out that that's the only time the real Jason will be in this movie, I all of a sudden wish that the copy-cat would somehow run into the real Jason in the movie and get killed by the real Jason.

But don't be fooled into thinking it's some in-depth documentary filled with fun facts and interesting information. It feels more like you're watching a visual companion for the trivia section on IMDB. There's also a director's commentary track that has its moments... But for the most part you're just listening to what sounds like a dirty old man. I learned very little (if anything) about the actual making of the movie. But if you want to hear a director react with some excitement to the number of boobs he shot, then you'll be satisfied. Having said that, the image quality of the movie is very nice. Those used to the VHS version of Friday The 13th Part 5 are likely to be very happy with the transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning","review":"Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning is the worst in the series so far and that is saying allot. The acting is much worst then in prior movies. The script is awful like on a police academy parts 4 and onwards level. The special effects looked cheap even for the time the movie was made and the budget is like nothing close to the first couple of movie. The music is outrageously bad and is probably some of the worst 80's music I have ever heard. I love the 80's hairdos, the tacky cheap looking clothes, and the make up is atrocious.The dialog is so bad that one wonders if it is a high-school project gone awry. The killing scenes are also kind of lame and they seem to have run out of ideas. The movie is only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it is like at least twice as long and the plot makes no sense at all. This is a movie that has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst \\"Jason\\" movies ever made!","review":"I don't know why I said this was one of the worst \\"Jason\\" movies ever made because you know what, Jason wasn't even in this movie!

He goes away to a camp where they can try to help him with these problems he is having. In his time there many things happen, yeah you know killings! But the worst part is Jason isn't the one doing any of them. It's just a man in a costume, I will leave it to you to figure out who it is.

The movie starts off promising with Corey Feldman and the real Jason making cameos, but the body count in this movie was WAY too high (7 people die in the first half hour), the teenagers are even stupider than before, the humor is unfunny, and there is just too much female nudity. Plus, I found out who the killer was right away involving one particular scene when the sheriff says, \\"What maniac could've done this?\\" Overall, this horror flick was just plain awful and makes the other \\"F13\\" movies look like \\"Citizen Kane\\" in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"New Beginning\\" gets off on the wrong foot","review":"\\"Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning\\" is much like Jason himself.

Tommy Jarvis, still having nightmares about a certain pissed off goalie, is transferred to a boarding house for troubled teens. Once he arrives, the body count starts to rise & all fingers start to point to Tommy. What could have been a decent whodunnit is turned into a waste of the viewers' time (not that the first four were anything to right home about, either, but, at least those \\"Friday\\" films had much more suspense & if your going to have a \\"Friday the 13th\\" film, have Jason in the damn movie!). \\"Juwanna Man\\" himself, actor Miguel A.

If it does have a down side, it's that the direction is often heavy-handed rather than strong. The truth behind this episode's 'Jason', for example, should have stayed a secret until the ending.

This was a BIG mistake. The most persistant problem beginners, the target group, have is correctly designing tables. I did not recommend the teach yourself Access books before the Access 97 in 21 days and it looks like I will not be recommending the most recent addition for Access 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha?","review":"Having a strong knowledge of Access, I decided to purchase this book because of its chapters on VBA and SQL. However, I realized after a while that with its unclear instructions and asking me to do things \\"if you want to\\" or \\"maybe you should...\\" made me quite unsure of what to do next. Many times I wasn't sure whether it was an instruction or a suggestion to try later.Is the author afraid to give me a clear-cut set of instructions for fear he might offend me? Come on! I'm trying to learn access and I'll be happy to do what you tell me. However, when I'm not sure I'm even given a set of instructions until the next section or the end of the chapter, that's a real problem.I am not pleased with this book AT ALL and wish I hadn't bought it.I recommend you PLEASE check out this author before you purchase his books. I for one am NOT HAPPY with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Access 2000 in 210 (yes, 210) Days","review":"Fully anticipating to learn the basics of Access 2000, I started reading this book the day it arrived. Having a decent knowledge of database concepts (gained during many painful years of military contract software use - Thanks ULLS-A), I expected to pick up on the topics fairly quickly. After reading the first few chapters, and working through the example database files (that's another story), I was somewhat confused. A lot of information was presented, but not in a thoughtfully organized manner (in my opinion). I had to reread the chapters twice to finally get the concepts straight in my mind. I do not recommend this book for anyone wishing to learn Access 2000 without any prior knowledge or experience with databases and database programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golly, I'm still confused on what Access can do ...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm an intermediate programmer with years of experience, but browsing through the pages of this book, I thought I could gain something. Boy, was I wrong ! After chapter five I stopped reading because the topics were not presented in a manner that something will still linger in your mind after browsing through the pages ! Boring is the word . I have read several other 21 days and 14 days books , I thought all sams publications have the same rich content. I regret I spent some of my hard earned money for this book, but in fairness to the author, this book is really for novice programmer with no experience at all , with the intent of entering the database programming world and not for seasoned ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should've returned this book when I saw read-only files","review":"When I found that parts of the CDROM were read-only, I emailed the publisher. They emailed me back, saying they were not read-only. Two of the first five databases were unusable, and it took a long time to get past that.I'm now about halfway through the book, and although the book started with some good, in-depth discussions, it has rapidly progressed to manipulations of reports and queries based on tables you don't understand the basis of. I wish we could be building one or more databases from scratch, so I could understand what I've done.Oh, and some of the practice examples are already done, so you can't follow the directions to do them.I can't wait to finish this book, so I can move on to something more useful. It barely touches on most topics, so there'll still be lots to learn before I can make any use of it.I wish I'd gone to Amazon and read reviews, instead of browsing at the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disorganized book","review":"The examples are HUGE - I have always thought that some straight simple examples would be nice. The very first DB you make really has to be taken off of the CD since it has 8 tables.The book does not really improve after that since the info is very scattered. For instance the FORMS chapters are 5, 10, 14. In between is a ton of other stuff. All of the form examples are HUGE also.I imagine this book will be a nice reference book once I know what I am doing with Access. However with the long examples I found myself short on time to complete them.In this books case, teach yourself in 21 days really means 21 solid 24 hour lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want money back..","review":"I am a beginner of this program, and after a few hours I just gave up reading this book. Attached CD is read-only, while it tells me to input some data(hmm..can I do that??!). The book talks about some tables which \\"are in the CD\\", which aren't, no clear single line explanation of what the normalization is (read entire one page worth explanation, and I still don't have a clear idea what the definition is.)etc. Authors' habit of saying, \\"if it is necessary,\\" \\"if you have some time,\\" \\"if you're familiar with..\\" really bugs me.. - what is this? Are they too insecure to give readers an instruction?? I noticed it soon after I started reading the first chapter. I should have looked reviews here before purchasing this book. I have to say I abhor reading this book. I won't get another books from these authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than expected - disappointing","review":"I was unhappy with this purchase. The solids are smaller than they should be - the advertisement clearly says 1\\"x1\\"x1\\", but the tetrahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron are all smaller. The tetrahedron in particular looks very small. The cube and octohedron are 1\\" in their longest diagonal only.Plus, for the cube and dodecahedron, the facets were not well proportioned. Since that is the point behind these objects, the quality of production was inadequate.Think twice before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total Release","review":"I first heard La India's Dicen Que Soy in 94 in Miami. El Zol 95 played her constantly, and I had no complaints. I was so glad that there was another powerful female singer to represent us in Salsa.La India is like many powerful and possessed women vocalists that I appreciate; with the addition of heavy percussion: Patti Labelle, Rachelle Farrell, Laura Nyro, Celine Dion... add your favorites.Her lyrics are honest and hit the nail on the head; leaves you feeling empowered and released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman who sings what many womens' hearts feel!","review":"I discovered India about a year ago while watching her on television, and immediately was in awe! Her sound his addicting and her voice is full of emotion! There are few female Salsa artists in the music industry, but because of The Queen of Salsa, Celia Cruz, she has opened the door for current and future female salsa artists. Indias' CD seems to strike a cord with many women who are getting over a relationship. Her \\"No me conviene\\" is really helping me get over a relationship. I no longer feel sorry for myself, but feel sorry for him! Whether you are a salsa lover or not, this is a MUST CD to listen too. I guarantee you will get hooked.

It leaked pretty bad when I first got it so I had to use some teflon tape to help it seal. also the product came extremely dusty. The sprinkle pattern is pretty weak too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep","review":"This book is unbelievable. It cuts through old belief systems and inspires you to look deeper into what the truth might be. It begins as the old myths and legends throughout history did, but has such a force in it that you hate to put it down. At the same time you must re-read passages for all the hidden meanings. Better than I ever imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"as a start.. perfect","review":"I bought this book to study number theory on my own. (but let me say I had great knowledge about the material b4 I got into it). I studied the first three chapters on my own, and it was great experience, but then I had to stop cuz I did not have any free time to continue.

Do not expect this to filter out any \\"Pop's!\\" It will not. The pop sound and air blast comes through the unit virtually unfiltered! It is a poor mesh screen, and is ineffective. I can not believe Blue Mics, whose other products are top of the line (The Yeti, for example) would sell such a useless item! I immediately repackaged it for return. I do Voice-overs and narrrations.

Returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should go to jail for this piece of junk.","review":"This is a piece of junk that is physically impossible to use. If you will look closely at the picture, you will see that it is held to the microphone by a specially made attachment that is not included with it. So when you buy this, and try to use it, you find that it is impossible to attach to the microphone or use in any way. It makes a great doorstop. Save your money, and buy a different screen that is actually usable in the real world. The microphone is great, but this microphone cover is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do-It-Yourself Compatibility","review":"Much has been said about how this \\"universal\\" windscreen isn't quite compatible with Blue's Yeti microphone. Why Blue didn't include an appropriate clamp or selection of clamps or design the Yeti base so the existing clamp would fit is beyond me, but with a cheap Black & Decker battery-operated drill, a 1/4\\" hex shank drill bit, and some oomph, you can make it compatible yourself in minutes by drilling a hole through the center back of the base and attaching The Pop there using the included clamp knob with the longer screw. Sure, the logo is upside down when you bend it backward over the mic, but it in all my years in voiceover, this is a combo that simply amazes with fantastic audio clarity and ease of use. I knock it one star for Blue's lack of foresight in compatibility and expect they'll get it right in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"microphone","review":"this filter is amazing it has done a great job for my microphone keeping out exterior noises while we are working great product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter, but poor mounting mechanism","review":"This filter is a great accompaniment to the Yeti Microphone, but, as other reviews have mentioned, I do think the clamp is very poorly designed and is very prone to coming loose and falling down. The filter itself is very, very sturdy and I noticed a significant improvement with sibilants and other sounds that tend to peak when recording. I really do like this filter, and the design flaw is only a problem if you move your microphone around frequently. I don't know if there are other filters that work better with the Yeti, but I bought this because it was the same manufacturer. My microphone stays stationary on my desk so I don't mind the filter's clamp so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy with use for yeti blue","review":"Do not buy with use for yeti blue - it showed up as a suggested add-on. Yet, there is no easy way to attach. More money thrown down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal?","review":"I ordered this pop filter, as it was listed as \\"Frequently Bought Together\\" when I was purchasing the Blue Yeti microphone. Yeah, that's right, they're made by the same company - but there's no way to attach this \\"universal\\" pop filter to the Blue Yeti stand that makes Yeti so useful for desktop recording. What a joke - a \\"universal\\" pop filter that won't even attach to the stand made by the same manufacturer. It's nice quality overall, but that it won't attach to the Yeti unless I remove it from its stand is a non-starter. Yeti buyers beware! I'll definitely be returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, but doesn't filter pops","review":"Sorry, but 1 star. This is a pop filter that doesn't filter pops.I have a Yeti Pro which I love and am an avid Blue Microphone product user, and use this filter; but I can still hear an ample number of p-pops, and s-whistles...It just doesn't work as well as a cheap plastic double filter. I am switching back tomorrow.Yes, this filter looks so much more sophisticated, and it's made of metal, and it's shiny, and brand-matching with the Yeti.....it just doesn't work.The science behind a pop filter is a no brainer, and doesn't involve good looking sophistication -- stick with an $11 plastic one that does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Pop Filter","review":"Watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the Yeti microphone.

Not sure how you can claim this is a Universal Pop Filter when there is no way to get it to work on the Yeti without drilling a hole or (like I did) using a twist tie for a seriously poor looking end result. What makes it worse is the company's \\"Deal with it\\" attitude-like it's cool to be creative. Well, not for me at $30+ bucks. Buy something with a clip and buy it cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Filter Terrible Fit with Blue Yeti Mic","review":"Length:: 1:57 MinsI ordered this pop filter from Blue assuming it would be a perfect fit for my Blue Yeti mic based on the Amazon recommended \\"buy together\\" feature. Don't do it! You know what they say when you assume!It's a terrible fit. I can't believe these are made by the same company. I spent several minutes fiddling with the pop filter and no way could I make it fit with the Yeti. I even ended up scratching the Yeti base a bit trying to put this pop filter on.I then came back to the Amazon review page and noticed folks are drilling holes into the Yeti mic stand (yikes) and ordering extra brackets to make it fit. I should have read those reviews before I ordered it.This could be the best pop filter in the world but what good is if I can't attach it to the mic. Amazon should not be recommending this pop filter as an add-on to the Yeti.I've attached a video with my work-around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this filter, especially with my Blue Yeti","review":"Length:: 2:12 MinsThis filter works well, has a very low profile, and looks great with theBlue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone. At least I think so, with my duct tape and cable tie mounting solution. (Don't criticize just yet.)

It seems that his faith was about as strong as ... well it wasn't very strong at all it seems ...I was floored to see a man (Dr. Stan Larson) with a PHD from Burmhingham University, writing this kind of book - one would think that there would be much more worth-while topics to not only spend your time, but also your money on. Fortunately I did not have to spend my money on this book - I received it as a complementary copy from the author himself - had the greatest time shredding it - do you know that a really big shredder can gobble nearly 50 pages at a time?

We used it almost every weekend this summer and never had a problem with the paddles or the balls losing their function. If you are playing this with adults, keep in mind that it is just made out of simple plastic and if you throw the balls with too much force, you can crack the plastic on the paddles.

Rather than dismissing him as a monster, and refusing to consider what he might have in common with ordinary humans, the author takes him seriously as an individual, as a man. She doesn't justify him or make excuses for him. But we will only hurt ourselves if we refuse to look honestly at evil in the world, and in ourselves.Besides this, the book is both excellent journalism and excellent history.

This is one of the few books that for weeks after I finished it I would continue to think about it and go back to pick it up to refresh my memory. If you are interested in learning about how normal Germans could have committed these acts this should be the first book you pick up. I could not put it down; it really grabs you and does not let go.

The girl runs away from her parents, stays with the older man, and they form an odd, but innocent friendship. As the new friends interact and learn about each other, the viewers get a chance to reflect on Life itself.I found the film to be very relaxing, but not boring. The film is a study in calm, with little action and no gunfights, as the older man lives in a world apart from everyone else. His landscape is picturesque and peaceful. Living away from the busy city life, he spends his days in the quiet farmlands with nothing more to do than simply gaze at the world around him.\\"Squint Your Eyes\\" is an artistic drama, but also has its moments of good, solid humor. Overall, it's a statement about friendship and lifestyles. This is one to watch with your whole family, if the kids will sit still long enough to get into it's slow pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilmour Saw is Dull and Cheap Junk","review":"Had a Swedish bow saw for 20 years, still sharp as a razor, a pleasure to use.

My boys wanted to watch one after another and I admit I followed the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A G I Joe version of the Ateam.","review":"I have recently watched the season and as someone who appreciated Larry Hama's writing in the comic series I was initially disappointed in the overall plot and premise. Nearly all of the characters have been reworked, and actually I think the serious would have been better had it not been a Gi Joe series at all (however it would have been odd to have a silent ninja around). That said, once I started watching I was able to disconnect the comics from this alternate GI Joe universe it was quite fun. It is clearly influenced by the Ateam premise of a group of innocent soldiers wanted \\"for a crime they didn't commit\\", and my son even thought Roadblock was Mr T. But we like the Ateam, so that wasn't an issue. It is a little bland, though. Im not exactly sure how to put it, but it just seems a bit gray emotionally. Worth watching though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & kinda stupid.","review":"When I heard a new G.I. Joe series was coming, I was thrilled. I really liked the classic show & knew this one would be better animated, more realistic but just as fun.Well, I was partially right.I'm not sure what the problem with the series is exactly. Is it the bland animation? Is it the lack of the classic designs? Is it the fact that these bland characters are nothing like their classic (and charismatic) counterparts (Zartan & the Dreadnok being the worst examples)? All those things contribute to the problem but the simple fact is...this series is just boring, uninspired.I'll tune-in to Season 2 to see if this show starts to feel like the G.I. Joe I grew to love but I won't be holding my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for diabetics","review":"My doctor recommended this product.

I'm finding it works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"These may not be the best paddles out there, but if they're good enough for Martin Kilpatrick (whoever he is) they're good enough for me. Took awhile to receive them, but they made in time for Christmas (barely). These are \\"pips-out\\", which means they have the little \\"nubs\\" on the rubber face. These are NOT the thick rubber padded type of paddles.Good, cheap, decently made paddles for the average Joe amateur ping-pong player."},{"rating":"1","title":"say no to these ping pong paddles, they'll ruin your game","review":"I needed new ping pong paddles for our table and ordered these online. Must say very light compared to the old set. Not very sturdy at all. Completely disappointed. Will never buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a movie","review":"I bought this movie expecting to actually learn something about Seabiscuit. I thought that this was going to be a documentary. It turned out to be pretty much a commercial for how great Seabiscuit was.. You didn't actually see much of Seabiscuit, they a do a kind of re-enactment of Seabiscuit's life. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. If you actually want to learn something, don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Yes I understand the problems of remixing and all that. But, that is not where the problems are...1. You get two 'films' of the same thing. One in B&W and one in color. Whoopee. Both (fortunately) very short.2. This is not a documentary! It is PR shot by the owner of the horse. No real interviews and only short racing filmclips.Wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed in \\"Lost Documentary\\"","review":"Sadly, the profound story of Seabiscuit was completely lost in this documentary. None of the special highlights were brought to light in this worthless film. Narrartor was benign and drab. The only part of the film worth salvaging was the footage of Seabiscuit as a baby. Very dissapointed that I chose the wrong documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but...","review":"This is a very interesting video. It is part actual documentary footage of Seabiscuit and part docu-drama. It is listed as having a running time of approx 60 minutes. This is somewhat inaccurate. The actual footage is only about 27 minutes. It is played first in the colorized version and then again in the original black and white which makes the total running time about 54 minutes but there is really only 27 minutes of material covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational","review":"I will have to admit the story of anyone or anything beating the odds and overcoming all of the obstacles life can throw at you, always tugs at my heart strings. I wished there would have been more actual photos of Seabiscuit but there are still plenty of him to give the viewer a real look at this incredible horse. I highly recomend this documentary to all horse lovers, and to anyone that just loves an inspirational story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the Original Seabiscuit Movie!","review":"This is a fun lost film that has been unearthed in time for all of the Seabiscuit lovers of 2004 to take a trip back to the 1930's. It's more of a tribute by Charles Howard to the Biscuit, than a documentary, but very enjoyable. This may not be the best choice if you are looking for a \\"modern\\" PBS-style documentary. For that either buy PBS or the 2 DVD set of the feature Seabiscuit with lots of nice bonus material. But if you love Seabiscuit and the Howards, and want to see an authentic piece of film made by Charles Howard, this is a fine choice. Your expectations should be of a fascinating vintage 30's film about a truly great horse. A nice complement to the feature film DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing - not enough documentary","review":"I'm a huge fan of documentaries, but this video contains too many scenes of current horse races and interviews with people (who are totally unrelated to the story) about what they thought of Seabiscuit. But on the plus side, the video did contain some facts regarding jockey George Woolf that I found interesting because I've never seen it before in any other related documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Documentary","review":"I was so excited to find this DVD. I did not know Charles Howard had filmed this horse. Nor did I know that he had included Seabiscuit's bloodline. The video of Hastings, Fair Play and Man O' War was very exciting to see for someone who is a huge fan of this bloodline. Three cheers for Charles Howard for documenting this for those of us who came after, so we could see these horses in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit lost documentary","review":"Pretty interesting, but don't expect something amazing. It is a documentary that is old, and I like this style of documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Some facts about the Biscuit and some scraps of original footage are crammed into the DVD with very predictable--almost seemingly scripted--commentary by trainers, jockeys, and the like. DO NOT waste your time on this. The only good part of the film was the stock footage of racehorses added to fill it up, and even that wasn't spectacular. Get the 'American Experience' film. It is way more informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH SEABISCUIT","review":"EXCELLENT PRESENTATION. REALLY LIKED IT. I HAVE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE AND LAURA HILLEBRAND'S BOOK AND WHATEVER ELSE I CAN FIND ON THIS FANTASTIC LITTLE HORSE. ONLY PROBLEM WAS A LOT OF NOISE FROM THE ANNOUNCERS WHO CONSTANTLY RATTLED ON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitation at its worst","review":"This has got to be the most amazingly horrible movie I have ever seen. Does anybody give a damn about the horse? This is pure exploitation of horses, almost the worst I have seen except for some rodeo footage. I mean, really, we have to glorify fat men getting off on racing horses? Let's at least have some true horse heroes like Secretariat, who had an owner who actually csred about him, rather than this retro, I'm a big fat guy who doesn't care about crap kind of owner that poor Seabiscuit had. Geesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, some drawbacks","review":"First-Looks great looking into the car with the matching seat covers. But-fabric is sewn to the thick rubber cover and therefore is not going to wash easily, already was slightly yellowed when it arrived and will dirty quickly. We'd purchased another Allison set and that wheel cover was all fabric which can be easily removed and thrown in the washer. I probably didn't read this description closely enough. Difficult to put on the steering wheel and tore about 2 inches while trying to put it on. Smells strongly of plastic or rubber and makes your hands smell. Shipping was excessive-almost as much as the item cost. I guess I'm spoiled from using Amazon's free super saver shipping so often-which was not available on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flat","review":"Good concept, but rather flat in content.

The problem is, after delving through Chinatown, Feng shui, and investigation by San Francisco's favorite Dashiell Hammett, you end up sighing, \\"Is this it??\\"To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The book is still competently written and has the interesting leads of Mary Russell and a human Sherlock Holmes to make this a decent time waster; however considering the quality of some of the other entries this really seems to be a series that is starting to run out of steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game is Afoot","review":"This was the 8th adventure for Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, and a different story for Laurie King as well. The book is far more personal and deals with the psyche of Mary Russell in many ways. The result is a fascinating read, although it is in some ways different from the earlier Russell books. I'm not sure I'd suggest starting with this book in the series, though I would highly recommend it for those who have followed all the books. It ties up a number of loose ends from earlier cases in such a way as to marvel at King's overarching plan for her characters over these past 8 books.For most of the book, Mary is off of her game by the dreams and feeling that haunt her from her youth. She learns that she was in San Francisco (rather than London) for most of her childhood and lived through the 1906 earthquake. Part of the tale is told from the viewpoint of Holmes as a result and Mary is not as active a participant as in other cases.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tea gets weaker","review":"I have read all the Mary Russell novels and found the first to be a revelation that I recommended to friends. However, I am reminded of a comment I once encountered about the Alexander Dumas novels that followed The Three Musketeers. It was that they were like sucessive cups of tea made from one tea bag - flavorful but weaker and weaker. This one is getting pretty weak. Frankly this novel's introspective turn does it no favors. The balance between characterization and action is off and the exploration of character is just not very interesting. If you want to see this balance handled better in this genre, check the new Maisie Dobbs novels of Jaquline Winspear. If this is the first Mary Rusell novel you have encountered, go to The Beekeepers Apprentice, the first - still a good read !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Locked rooms, SF earthquake story.","review":"Locked rooms is interesting.

Start with The Beekeeper's Apprentice and work your way forward. This series is definitely worth the time. This book is the best by far in the series. It allows us to enter the dark corners of Russell's mind for the first time and truly get to know her as a character. This duo has fought a mad Maharajah and a female Moriarty, but it's not until facing Russell's past do things really start to heat up. King includes bits and pieces of history in every one of her books making the worlds come alive in a way that few authors can.

This is a masterpiece. It combines beautiful, heart-rendering songs (particularly any of the Elves' themes) with great action/adventure scores (the Fellowship theme). The soundtrack has such emotional power that, even without seeing the scenes in the movie, you can just feel what's going to happen.The Two Towers is probably the softest of the trilogy. Many of the songs are gentler, almost sweet, especially the Elven themes. This album doesn't have quite the overpowering epic scale as the first two, but is probably the best to listen to if you're reading or ever just want to take a walk. Of course, the song for the credits (known affectionately as \\"Gollum's Song\\") is wonderful.This soundtrack (and the rest of the trilogy) is destined to become a classic.

So i am very disgruntled and bitter toward anyone who had any part or supports this way of ripping off true artists.

Not only does it include all of the themes from the first album, but it also includes the theme for Rohan, which is my favorite musical cue from the entire trilogy. Add to this the best treatment of the opening melody, and the best closing song (albeit dark and mournful, but hey, that's what made Two Towers the best film of the three as well)!My favorite section is Track 16 (Forth Eorlingas) which corresponds to the moment of the film when Gandalf and the Riders of Rohan are flooding down the mountainside to confront the Uruks - the moment when the music swells as the sun crests the hilltop ALWAYS gives me goosebumps!For me, the first album is too repetitive, and the third is too vacuous - The Two Towers is definitely Shore's best entry in the Trilogy! Hope they bring him back for The Hobbit!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT score but really annoying embedded PC elements","review":"I aboslutely love Howard Shore's score. If this is any normal CD, it will be a 6 out of 5. However, the publisher's decision to add many embedded PC elements on the disk make it extremely annoying to listen to on a computer. For example, an auto startup screen pop up when you put in the disc. Windows Media Player cannot copy the last track Gollum's Song, pressumably because computer files are written too close to it. I have not figure out a way to turn the tracks into MP3's (a totally legal activity as long as you don't share it with others)to use on your portable MP3 player. ARGHHH."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully epic and moving","review":"This soundtrack is magnificent and fits the LORT epic scale perfectly. The Rohan theme inspires the views of grand mountain peaks and serene fields as well as a deep sense of duty and pain that the rulers of the city must cope with. Whenever Sam and Frodo appeared, the sweet melody from the Shire was there to comfort and remind us that the purpose for the journey was to save all that was good. Evenstar is quite possibly the saddest piece in all of the LOTR soundtracks, as it is used to tell the painfull story of Arwen's lost love and the sacrifice of eternal pain that she is willing to bear. The vocals in this soundtrack are absolutely stunning and are the single reason I'm such a fan of LOTR music. Howard Shore did a wonderful job capturing the spirit of the story within each moment of the movie. Every scene required his pieces to show the audience what was being experienced on screen. A beautiful yet dark example of soundtracks at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first","review":"I loved this cd and actually play it more often than the Fellowship cd. I love the soundtracks throughout Rohan and especially love the the Helm's Deep track. It, like the whole cd, is very powerful. Unlike most of the reviews I've read, I throughly enjoyed Gollum's song and thought it if not equal to than better than Enya's song on the first soundtrack. Unusual, eerie, and beautifully sad, it fits Gollum and this whole cd as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!","review":"Hearing this soundtrack, totally reaminds you of the movie. I love the music it so, so, realaxing. My favorite songs are #6 & 12 because of the beautiful violins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I love all of the Lord of the Rings music, and couldn't would wait to get all of the soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music","review":"This music is incredible. I enjoy every minute of it. It's great music to read to, to game to, to relax to. The vocals, when present, are sang incredibly well.I highly reccomend this to anyone who enjoys the movies or books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT a rehash of the Fellowship","review":"After seeing the movie and listening to the soundtrack several times over, I really can't make up my mind which of the two movies has the better soundtrack. One thing is clear, though. This is not simply the Fellowship score with a few additions. I know some people have posted otherwise, butI respectfully disagree. There is music to tie us back to the first movie, but most is all brand new. In fact, Shore has done a wonderful job linking the music without simply rehashing it.My favorite is the score for the riders of Rohan. It features a Norweigan fiddle and is absolutely beautiful.Admittedly, there isn't a lot in the way of lighthearted and comforting music in this one, like there was in the Shire and Rivendell in the Fellowship. However, this is a darker film, and the music fits it wonderfully.This is a CD worth buying, especially for Rohan's theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Annoying Presentation","review":"Orchestral music enthusiasts who enjoy cinematic scores will, predictably, enjoy Howard Shore's composition for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and the other scores in this series as well. Of the three CDs, The Two Towers does I think show us the greatest range of Shore's thematic elements used in the eponymous movies. This CD is comprised of music incidental to scenes set in Rohan, Fangorn's Forest, and the approaches to Mordor, but it is the Meduseld/Theoden themes that \\"stay with you\\" well after the soundtrack ends.The CD does, however, have a major presentation flaw. When played in a computer, there is an autostart web-link that impedes listening. You have to work around the web link in order to merely play the music. The link is nothing other than a garden variety in your face advertisement, and a solicitiation to join their website and otherwise provide them with information that will presumedly be used as an excuse to annoy you with MORE advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howard Shore - Istari, or just plain genious?","review":"Sometimes I really question Howard Shore's composing - how can anything this good come from the hands of Man? The music is inspiring and takes you on a roller coaster of emotions, from calm and serene, to tense, to sad, all in one song. These compositions truly touch something deep. I really recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Howard Shore is a god walking amongst mere mortal composers. This work is a work of unrivaled genius. If you buy this soundtrack, I truly believe that you will not be the least bit disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's talk about the Music","review":"There are probably over a thousand reviews for the movies, but let's talk about the music of the movies.I have to say that of all the movies, this soundtrack is the best of all three. The haunting string melodies, powerful trumpet melodies, and moving context of the music as a whole is wonderful.I don't normally buy soundtrack scores. But, this is one of the few in my collection.This is a wonderful collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent soundtrack","review":"For those of you expecting a reprise of the FOTR soundtrack, prepare to be surprised. While Shore deftly weaves many of the old themes into this soundtrack, most of the musical themes are very new. This is a darker movie, with a darker soundtrack. And it's magnificent. All of the tracks are memorable, but the last six are simply fantastic. Gollum's Song especially may at first not seem to fit, but just listen to the lyrics and you'll remember why Gollum was the best character in the whole movie. I highly recommend this soundtrack -- great for listening to over and over.. and cheaper than buying tickets to keep going to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Company Part Two","review":"This Soundtrack is great company for your imagination and mind scape. I sew, and making costume reproductions from LOTR movies is one of my favorite things to do..listening to this CD is a must when doing so because it really keeps you inspired. My favorite tracks on this CD are: The King of the Golden Hall (This theme runs through the film starting when Eowyn sees Arragorn for the first time outside the great hall, she's standing alone with the wind whipping through her hair), Evenstar (theme played during Arragorn's dream sequence back at Rivendell), Breath of Life (played when a vision of Arwen kisses a wounded Arragorn lying by the river), Isengard Unleashed, and Gollum's Song <this woman almost sounds like Bijork> (from the credits). I suggest buying the soundtrack for Fellowship of the Ring as well, so that you can continue your mind scape journey from the beginning to the next installment of the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Independent punk review","review":"I ordered this DVD-Audio release because I liked the songs and I thought it would be nice to give my ears something decent to listen to. How big was my disappointment. The tracks are only available in 5.1, with the possibility of stereo downmix (the downmix weights and phases are suppiled on DVD). That's not too bad in itself, but the weights are set incorrectly, causing some distortion. The sound of this album is washed out, muffled, as if I were listening to the music playing from a telephone. Youtube videos have better quality sound. Hell, I bet even ringtones will have better quality. That's not why DVD-Audio is here, is it? Just avoid this one and save your buck ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle of The Sexes GEM~ better than you would think~","review":"Stewart Granger is a \\"woman hating\\" Lord of his English Manor and is over heard making some very NASTY woman hating comments about a French Movie Actress the person who hears him IS the actress~ Granger has bets going he can Tame the ACTRESS.

Can't you let the music speak for itself? Isn't it enough that we have people like Mutter, the violinist and Church, the singer who turn on the sex appeal already with their globs of makeup and scanty designer clothing(not to say they aren't good artists).

She really brought them to life well...so well, that as a reader I became angry, sad and happy at their actions aloud, as if I were watching television. I really enjoyed this book, and think it would make a great screenplay. I honestly didn't want to book to end, I wanted more!!!

Identifying with each character is easy, regardless of the fact that their lives are so different from mine.

As I said it is tough to include all, but take a note of the upcoming Encyclopedia of the City from Routledge (editor Professor Roger Caves from San Diego) and you will see what an encyclopedia means.

Karsh has always had a unique style and although it is great that he experimented and changed his style since every artist should, I felt like something was lost in the translation. It is original and he achieves a multi cultural sound by blending hip hop, rock, electronica, and asian influences, but overall, I found the album to be flat. There are a few good tracks, but as hard as I tried, I just couldn't get into it and found myself bored. This album sounds too \\"pop\\" and commercial for me, but aside from that, it just didn't hold my intrest.

At first I thought it was a song from Dimmu Borgir, and to my suprise wasn't. So I bought the cd and I love it. It is heavy, great vocals, and I love the electronics. The only reason why I give it a four is because they sound exactly like Dimmu Borgir, except there is a female singer and there are a few loops that Dimmu Borgir does not use. And this band is not the first to use female vocals with death metal. Tristania has been doing this for about 5 years or longer. I'm not saying they were the first, but they've been doing it longer. And I believe Nightwish uses male vocals along with the female vocals. Overall, a cd worth a listen. Nothing new for those familiar with bands of this nature.

This is the reason the Minox cameras have been the choice for 3 generations.The Minox TLX is no exception.This is a camera that can be easily carried in your pocket every day, yet gives you images of astounding quality. Barely larger than a disposable lighter, the TLX is quiet and smooth in its operation. Its ergonomic design allows for large or small hands to operate it comfortably, despite its diminutive dimensions.The titanium finish minimizes glare, and keeps your camera looking nice even after hard use. Even the retention chain has measuring beads to help you focus in on those tiny objects you could never photograph before.Never again have to say, \\"Wow, I wish I had a camera!\\" With a Minox you will always have one handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrunk","review":"Only one wear out of this shirt.

After they disbanded, Matt went on to form High on Fire, another monster that will most definately appeal to fans of bands like SLEEP.

The second those opening chords on \\"Baghdad\\" hit your ear-drums, you know you're in for a treat. This album is slow and heavy, just the way I like it. I won't go so far as to call it Doom Metal, but if you like bands like Electric Wizard, Acid King, and Sleep, you'll love High on Fire. I can't praise them enough, and I can't wait to see them live.

The book is very unique in the way of presenting the idea and insight - An illustration in every couple of pages, bold and capitalized texts all over to emphasize, a list of possible actions or solutions along with multiple choices, a brilliant sense of humor, etc. What they accomplished with such attempt is readers' attention and impact on their lessons to give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book to Read with Profoundly Simple Bits","review":"This book brings you back to the first principles of problem solving in a way that is easy and fun.

Only two seeds (of 8) germinated, and the plants just don't grow!! They are watered, fertilized, receive plenty of sun, and they just stay the same small stunted seedlings of about 1 inch in height. Growth is aganoizingly slow, and I started these baskets in mid-March and it's now the end of May!!I also purchased two kits for hanging baskets of flowers, and they have been almost as disppointing. I expected that after 2 1/2 months I would have full flowering baskets, but they are also small and stunted. The extra seeds that were left over, I planted in a seed tray using my own soil.

It is preposterous to denigrate this book as not being for beginners... One would naturally need a background in classical Latin (two years at least) before tackling the complexity of the Medieval Latin. As per the lack of ecclesastical Latin in the volume, you can get that in other specific primers dealing the ecclesisatical language. I am especially impressed with the inclusion of excerpts from Luitprand of Cremona's account of his time in Constantinople.

All three previous albums were absolutely awesome, and all in different ways. This album is very...blah. It's boring. Most of the songs are slow and not very compassionate. It seems like the members have gotten into so many other political things other than music over the past five years, that they didn't really care about making good music.

In the meantime, her relationship with Annie blossoms as the two begin decorating Kate's bare-as-bones house. This is another in a very long line of Naiad's formulaic publications - it hasn't varied in over two dozen years - so there were no surprises, the relationship is the same as any book published by Naiad in the last twenty-five years - different names, different occupations, and different locale, but it is the same book that Naiad always publishes.

Well, last week, after about a dozen uses, one of them disassembled completely. Just fell apart. Oh, all the metal (pot metal, not exactly a Titanium body, here!) stayed intact, the plastic parts went elsewhere. It's in the recycly bin. The other one: 1. One of the tabs broke off so setting the watering arc became a lot more difficult (it ain't metal), 2. It only rotates through the entire set arc on the widest setting. On the mid- and narrow setting it may go through 10--30 degrees and then change its mind (and direction). It will go from the run position, where I want it, to the 1/2 hour position and I can come out after an hour and find that things are quite dry...

After about 3 weeks I picked up the hose to move it and the receptor snapped off. At first it looks great, but it ended up being the most expensive and least performing sprinkler that I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sprinker, but bad plastic connector!!!","review":"I picked this item from BJs for $40 and it worked fine for about an year until the join snapped where I connect the hose.

Metal base lends to the \\"appearance\\" that this may be the last sprinkler you might have to buy for a while........however, after only one season it broke. And wouldn't you know it, it broke at a point where one of the few plastic parts joins the metal base. Too much to pay for a sprinkler that will not last a season. I guess I'll keep looking for that perfect sprinkler....."},{"rating":"1","title":"All metal except where it counts","review":"Nice sprinkler in concept and the metal base is nice and leaves the impression that the sprinkler is very durable. Unfortunately the timer mechanism and the water inlet are the same inexpesive plastic found in the cheap sprinklers. As other reviewers have pointed out, the neck of the hose attachment is weak and breaks if you pull the sprinkler by the hose or accidentally trip over the hose. This is typical of Nelson products. I have one of their timers and it broke in exactly the same place. It kind of reminds me of the cars in the 1950s that were designed with controlled obselesence featurs so the car would start to rattle and squeek after a year or so. I am sure that the Nelson marketing guys wanted it to look strong and sturdy with the metal, but have a breakdown feature might cause the less clever to keep coming back year after year for a new sprinkler. JUNK design at best, Clever marketing a worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really good and different reference guide","review":"As we are presently remodelling our home, I have been referring to this book quite a lot. It is full of interesting ideas and good tips not only about color schemes. I have given it 4 stars because I don't agree with everything the author says but most of her views are very interesting and innovative. The color bars are extremely useful and do take the guesswork out of what goes with what.

As for the family room which is the room I am in most of the time the book said you can use colors that make you happy. I painted it kind of a medium blue with overtones of green.

I have spent many hours in the New Orleans Public Library and have visited the Armistead Center but have never had the time to sit down and put all the information together so that I could start to compare the fact to the stories that were passed on to me about my ancestors. Being light skinned black with a french maiden name, I am often questioned as to my family background. My grandmother and mother's stories and my own experiences often amaze people as to how rich my background is. Now I have a book to pass on to my children as well as stories of my past. In an age of reams of wirtings about the diversity of America, I now have a book to pass on to them about my own diverse past - my creole legacy.

I am going to put most of them in a book and expect you to dig deep down in your pocket and pay for it.\\" Hahahah. I think this book would have been a lot more meaningful to me if the people in it were real, ie, people to whom I could relate to in my life. You don't have to be famous to tell a good story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monument To Self-Promotion","review":"Ms. Thomas appears on the cover but only writes the foreword. Hugh? This is a collection of famous people all thrown together and Ms Thomas, somehow, for whatever reason appears on the front cover. Self-promotion??? She seems to have dropped in for the party and the reader is left wondering if she really did any work on the book? What am I buying said the wise man? The collection of stories asks us to buy into the idea that the right words said at the right time will make a life-long difference to a person. Tell me, could the \\"right words\\" be said at the wrong time?? Isn't the timing of a message in large part make it the right thing to say. When you really think about it the premise of the book needs some work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"It is very tiring to read. One story after the other. I wish when publishers thought up books like this that they would consider stories unlike the ones in this book. Stories of average people who have made it. Let's face it, most book lovers are not millionaires and it would be nice to know something about people who are not rich and famous who have been successfull. This is the same old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative twenty stars","review":"This is trash. The book consists of two to three page stories about actors and politicians, and a very few stories about people who actually deserve respect. For some reason, we are supposed to care about important events in the lives of people we don't know, and who don't write long enough stories for us to get to know them. These stories are mostly poorly written, often nonsensical, and never though-provoking. In short, this book lacks substance, meaning, relevence, or literary merit of any kind.If you want to read something inspirational, stay away from the chicken-soup-for-the-soul kind of \\"inspirational\\" books. Read some real literature. I reccomend the Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, and The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational fare!","review":"I'm a huge fan of vicarious wisdom--if you can learn something from others gone before you, why not? The vignettes shared by the celebrities here are poignant, funny, and rich with personal history. The cast of characters Ms. Thomas has managed to line up is impressive and diverse and there's something for everyone. I'm amazed by the breadth of experiences shared and by the different approaches taken in answer to Ms. Thomas' challenge.You can read this book end-to-end or you can leaf through it when you need some inspiration (so far Tom Brokaw's story is my favorite!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Words","review":"This book shares the personal stories of different celebrities from different areas of endeavors and of different political persuasions. As such, the collection is a bit of a mishmash - some thoughtful and meaningful stories; some rants and riffs of self-centered yammering that should have been edited - heavily. Also, the factchecking was surprisingly sloppy in places.However, I took away a valuable lesson - the importance of our words, and how they radiate out into the world in ways we can't anticipate. For example - the simple words of a firefighter's grieving mother touched Rudy Giuliani and guided him and inspired him two weeks later on Sept. 11, 2001.Who knows how what we say may change someone's life? This isn't the greatest book I've ever read, but that \\"lesson\\" will stay with me for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please! Give me a Break!","review":"I was really looking forward to this read but grossly disapointed. I hardly see any \\"right words\\", just a bunch of (excuse me) \\"silly\\" stories from mainly celelebrities. Oh Boy, I want to be just like them! I don't look up to celebrities in the least because most of them are only powerful/successful because the entertainment industry is so \\"over paid\\". Who cares what these people have to say about their success? Isn't it enough our hard earned dollars have made them so much richer than the average American?? Ms. Thomas, I would have rather read more about average Americans and their stories of courage, or wise elderly people who really know about\\"average\\" America. We need a lot more advise than what these people want to say. Please just pass it on to your other celebrity friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Unmoving","review":"Most of the stories have a PR bent to them and when I was reading them I felt they had been edited to make everyone look good. This is an overly postive book that is unrealistic and does not work in the real world. For example, could the right words be harsh words with a negative tone that made the person act in a certain way? The answer is yes, but not one example exists in the book and this makes the book feel like a press release rather than a credible biography. Finally, the quality of the writing is not that great, so don't expect Charles Dickens here."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Marketing and Hype Than Good Stories","review":"Well, after seeing Marlo on TV I bought this book and I am sorry I did. The book is in need of a good editor and the sloppy writing style made me reconsider my purchase. The publisher apparently thinks that by putting Marlo on the cover it is going to get people to buy the book. I have always liked Marlo Thomas, but a popular celebrity does not a good book make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Famous People Who Write Poorly","review":"What struck me most about the book was how badly written many of the stories are in this large volume. Ms. Thomas has been on every show in America promoting her book, but when I sat down and just read the book I was not impressed. There will be no literary prize here and this book is a sad commentary on how publishing houses have moved away from good writing and focused on good salesmenship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Marlo Thomas of former That Girl fame is not all that in this book. This tome is 400 pages and the idea expressed in the book is that some words spoken to a person long ago have made that person what they are today. This is really ridiculous. There are some parts that are rather funny though. For example, Stephen Ambrose says that the words that meant the most to him were \\"never judge a man by his motives.\\" Doris Kearn Goodwin is also in the book and given recent headlines about the two of them it seems that readers should judge at least some people by their motives. Other people in the book have also fallen from grace and to use their words as an inspiration seems silly and downright stupid to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Message but a shallow approach","review":"The overall message to this book is positive, but it is really a shallow volume. There are no deep thoughts here to contemplate, so don't worry about bringing your thinking cap to the material. The book would better serve as a large paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"I was hoping for inspirational material but the bulk of this \\"book\\" is drivel with little if any redeeming value.

The stories are heartwarming, some funny and all encouraging.I dont understand the negatives remarks that have been made about Marlo from other reviewers. She is a talented, beautiful woman, who has picked up where her father left off, helping the children of St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital.Thank you Marlo, and all those in the book that shares intimate details of their lives with us.

I guess it is because as a young girl she taught to be free so long ago.This book is like a grown up edition of \\"Free to be You and Me\\". She has chosen people who have practiced that very thing, \\"free to be\\".I would have loved to have read more about her experiances, but, as we know she is humble and makes others see what they have to offer to the world before her self.One suggestion if she ever gets to read this, is I would love to find out where the young children of so long ago have gone with thier lives. Some have become celebrities crossing their own roads.I love to read about extra ordinary people in extrodinary ordinary lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, weak result","review":"If the essay writers had followed the concept of rights words at the right time, this would have been dynamite.

I found the majority of material to be related to 9/11 or to wildland firefighting while the cover implies it covers all ranges of firefighting. The material included is good...it just spends very little time on structural firefighting and the men who do that job. What time it does dedicate to it is mostly in the form of re-hash of previous material; Report from Engine Co 82, Working etc. There are better books out there, unless you are interested in wildland firefighting.

One warning is that you need to rinse the sprayer out with clear water and spray some clear water after every use or the sprayer will clog up from the spray mix left in the sprayer.

In the book Marie is a very well educated girl and she cares about her subjects. If she really did care then why did France have a revolution????? I read that she and her husband would spend hours wasting money by gambling and spending money on expensive clothing and jewelry. Marie Antoinette was a selfish brat, but the book wasn't based on Marie Antoinette. I guess that's how Marie Antoinette was from her own point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Royal Disappointment","review":"Expecting a vivacious heroine such as Cleopatra or Queen Elizabeth whom I admired in previous Royal Diaries, Marie Antionette's adolescence lacked intelligence and adventure. Born Maria Antonia of Austria, Marie Antoinette is forced to wed Louis Auguste, eventually becoming Queen of France. Throughout this lengthy diary, Marie did little more than complain of trivial inconveniences such as how uncomfortable her elaborate hairdos were or the unpleasant appearance of her husband. A few select parts describing the luxuries of palace life were interesting, but in all \\"Princess of Versailles\\" was a royal bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Favorite Series but my least favorite book in the series","review":"Do not get me wrong.

She tells of hardships such as when she loses her sister Carolina to marrige and of her Mother and the palace.Throught her diary we see how the 18th centruy is and and her marrige, the parites and her favorite niece Theresa.Her marrige to Louis XVI and the monarchys came as one.

Since she was nine, she has known that her destiny is to marry the Dauphine of France and become their queen, yet as it draws closer, the thought of marrying begins to frighten her a bit. In her mind, she comforts herself with thoughts of her handsome future husband, though when she meets him, she if horrified by his chubby, pimply exterier, only to discover he is as terrified as she is...

Along the way, he is only allowed to use his money to help others, and he abides by the agreement despite some cost to himself personally. Yup, he makes it through the challenge, because he is basically a strong-willed person who was told he didn't have the guts to stay the course, and he discovers he wants to do the right thing.Sure it's rather hokey, but wouldn't it be great if an obscenely rich someone today had the guts to learn what it was like to live this way beyond the 8 hours a day for the week or so it takes to do a \\"reality\\" show. OK, off my soapbox.The acting isn't great, but the lesson is. I'd watch Cary Grant in almost anything. This is a movie I wanted my grandchildren to see.

The only thing AMAZING about it is CARY (and thank goodness it's ONLY 62 minutes long). The story behind it is interesting, and it could have been a MUCH better movie with the right director. Cary did his best with what material he had, but I do NOT recommend it (unless you play it on MUTE and just gaze at him)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD of a poor film","review":"This is one of Cary Grant's least memorable films...which is why I'd never heard of it. Produced on a very low budget, the episodic story makes very little sense, and the behavior of the characters strains credibility. Grant has no chemistry with his leading lady, so there's no reason to care if they end up together. It's all made even worse by a simply terrible DVD, apparently made from a mediocre 16mm print, with splices and scratches and very poor sound. There's no reason to have this DVD in your collection -- if you feel compelled to see it, rent it.

We found the instruction manuals a bit hard to follow, but we got it right (eventually). They are easy to load in and out of and I like the wings that can help keep their heads from rolling around when they are sleeping. My one problem that I realized pretty late in the game is that we need a car seat with a higher harnessed weight limit. This one only goes to 40 lb. harnessed....that meant nothing to me with my newborn, but now with my 36 lb. two-year old I have figured out that this seat isn't going to take him all the way. He obviously can't go into a booster any time soon! So we are now buying another car seat. The Graco Platinum Cargo (up to 48 lb. harnessed) or the Britax Marathon (up to 65 lb. harnessed). Just a thought for those of you with larger kids (DS is in the 97th percentile for weight and height)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I love this car seat.

Firstly, it is very difficult to install and when we had to take the cover off to clean it, it was like taking apart some complex puzzle that had no instructions. Even the instruction guide was difficult to follow. Luckily my husband had ordered an Evenflow Tribute Deluxe Convertible car seat and after putting that back in the car, we wouldn't even think of trying to use this one again.

I use this seat between 2 grandaughters that are a year apart and the shoulder adjustment is so easy. Also, their heads are supported very nicely without any additional use of support. There are a couple of inconveniences to this car seat. The first one is that the seat is rather large in the rear-facing position and would not work in smaller cars because it sticks out a lot. The second one is that the crotch strap is hard to buckle. I have learned to buckle it first then the chest straps. In the front facing position the size of the seat is fine. The seat is very comfy and very easy to adjust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit All Car Latch Systems & Button Locks In Cold","review":"We had the worst experience ever with this seat! It did not work with the latch system in my two year old Subaru so we had to use the seat belt technique. The latch to push to loosen the seat belt in the chair was in a position that was difficult to reach and pinched my thumb several times. The belt tightened by pulling down...which was next to impossible as there was no room to pull down when it was installed in the car. The baby got stuck three times as the red release button would not release when pushed (in cold weather)...meaning we had to carefully drag him out from under the belt. We came very close to cutting the belt on two occasions! We finally gave up and returned to the item to Babies R Us...this took over an hour as they couldn't find the item number even with my receipt and we ended up losing our shipping cost and $10 coupon even though the product was clearly defective. We purchased a Britax instead and it is awesome :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"I like the Eddie Bauer 3 in 1 Elite Car seat. I had shopped around and compared prices on just about all major \\"infant, toddler,booster\\" car seat. This one I found to be the best one for its features and price range. There is only one thing I don't like about it; I can't figure out how to remove the infant head support. It appears to be sewn in. This could just be me but, I had my husband look at it to. It is rather large so if you have a smaller vehicle it may have a tight fit. I drive a midsize SUV and it fits just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big for alot of cars","review":"This seat is so tall ...that if you dont have a big back seat in reverse mode it's obnoxious.

It was a big hassle to take the infant headrest off and extremely difficult to remove the base from the main chair! You had to almost take a hammer to the metal pole and pull it out...it was soooo hard. My husband couldnt even do it! I guarantee if you are a clean person who likes to wash your carseat cover more than once a month...you will take this seat back, just like i did! I honestly think this seat is nice but it is next to impossible to take the cover off and wash it, unless you want to get out your \\"tools\\" to do it for an hour!If you are the type of person who doesnt wash the cover very much and wouldnt mine the extra muscle and work to do it, this seat is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat!

It had to be rear facing since he is still under 1 & it was really difficult to figure out at first.

She is 3 years old now and we are still using it. One draw back is that it is difficult to remove the seat cover, after I got it off and washed it it took me 45min to put the cover back on. I agree with another review that it does sit a little high, but ALL car seats do. My son was born 10 weeks premature, after he turned a year this past June our pediatrician recommended the Britax Marathon car seat. It's a great seat but very expensive and sits much higher than the Eddie Bauer. I was recently in a car accident and am going to replace both car seats with this one. Both of my kids seem to like it and it's very easy to adjust the straps. GOOD LUCK"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"Okay, I have had this car seat for two years and as gross as this sounds, the padding has only been washed once due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to get it apart and back together again properly. Once my husband and I did it once, we swore that we would rather buy another one than try to wash it again. I don't know why any manufacturer of car seats would make it this difficult to wash the padding on a carseat knowing that spills and messes are ineivitable with children. I kid you not, it takes a ton of finesse and a tool box to get this thing apart. I am pregnant with my second child and I refuse to get an eddie bauer product again. My husband and I are pretty easy going when it comes to products but this is rediculous. Probably the worst thing I have ever bought for my son.

It really isn't, unless you don't mind older kids getting exposed to body humor, sex, and humor about the uncomfortable situations kids get into without realizing it.That being said, I do find this book humorous, although not a 'laugh out loud' kind of funny. It's more of a \\"Yeah, I've been there\\" type of humor. Also, a lot of the cartoons made me feel more sad about the situation than amused, but I suppose it's not my style of humor at times.If you like dark humor about growing up, this book really fits the bill.

But one of her sisters shows up nearly unannounced to compete, and one of the contestants turns up missing (and is later found dead). Savannah now has to figure out if the death was a murder or a suicide, while trying to also keep her sister safe if there's foul play going on...Pretty good plot line with the usual number of twists and turns along the way. Of all the Savannah Reid novels I've read to date, this one probably has more character development of a sibling than any other. The story also touches on accepting oneself without trying to fit into society's mold, when Savannah finds out her sister is taking laxatives to maintain a already low weight.Still enjoying the series..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savannah is back","review":"and we are meeting more of her kick-in-the-head family.

Instead, wait for the special edition that's bound to come out in the months ahead that'll have everything this doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd be embarrassed to have my name on something like this","review":"I feel sorry for Muhammed Ali. It must be tough being a charismatic, interesting person, and having your life displayed in such a terrible fashion as this movie presents. I get the feeling most critics really wanted to like this movie going in, and were afraid to talk about how bad it really was. It opens with an incredibly boring ten minute musical, and progresses to get even worse. If you can stomach more than 30 minutes of this travesty, you're more of a masochist than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect role for Smith","review":"The guy can't act, sing or dance. So to cast him as a boxer who took one punch too many is believable. Can't Will Smith just disappear like DJ Jazzy Jeff. I'm so sick of him. Dang peanut head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This is a long film, but worth it. Will Smith is great as Muhammed Ali. The film covers Ali's whole life. I am anxiously awaiting for the DVD. What a compliment to film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ali","review":"Will Smith's performance was excellent. But I do regret wasting my money on a movie about a man who refuse to serve his country because of his religious beliefs. Especially at this time with the events of the past months. I find it ironic that he refused to enlist because of his beliefs but yet in his personal life he seemed to live it as he saw fit. Being a member in today's military forces I truely regret every seeing this movie and hope that others will not make the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Muhammed Ali is the greatest and will always be the greatest boxer that ever lived! This movie was wonderful in portraying the life of such a powerful individual.Throughout the movie all I could think of was that words have power -- it was the power of his WORDS that made Muhammed Ali great . . . Because his words proclaimed him into being the Heavy Weight Champion of the World again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing destroy it","review":"This films failure is at large due to poor editing. Then opening sequence is played out over about 10-minutes using the same song played live, the opening boxing match that follows is slow, boring and long (where is the editing??) I felt like the film was wasting my time and I had almost already gone to sleep. I let it play out about fifteen minutes and then noticed the full running time of the movie (where is the editing). Didn't finish it so my two star rating is only for the first thirty minutes or so of the film. I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing to say the least","review":"Although the preformances of Will Smith and the rest of the cast are nothing less then first rate, the very long story is choppy and hard to follow. When viewing the film it was assumed by the film makers that everyone watching already knew all the facts and event's in Ali's life thus the film would jump from one month to one much later, and even years later skipping over explanation for signifigant events.Anyone who know's Ali's life story already might find this much more appealing, however with out the background knowledge the film becomes hard to follow and rather confusing. With out this knowledge it becomes hard to even like this film at all. Even with actual effort put behind trying to like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD/Video","review":"Actually, I'd give it 1.5 stars. I have been an Ali fan my entire life. I can remember sitting at the television, mesmerized by Ali's charisma, and superb boxing as a child with my father. I have read all I can about Ali, and seen every video available. This movie did not do his life justice. Ali was full of energy and charisma. This movie was not. It was long and drawn out, full of \\"artsy\\" camera shots and cinematography with little of the energy that Ali radiated through out his career. In a movie of this length, they could have covered more of his life, instead they let the \\"creative talents\\" of the director and producers take center stage, while Ali himself would have never let anyone take center stage over himself. If you're a diehard Ali fan, (whatever you do, don't take your wife, if you go to the theatre, she'll hate it), you'll want to get the video/ dvd, so you can pause it and fast forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ali Lacks the Punch","review":"I went to see Ali with great anticipation based on the trailers and behind the scenes television spots. I am almost fifty years old and grew up following Ali's amazing career and life.I'm not sure what Michael Mann was attempting to capture, but I feel he missed in all areas. The story doesn't really go anywhere. It just sort of rambles. It spends far too much time on musical montages. One scene of Ali doing road work in Africa just seems to go on and on and on.The casting is a real plus. Will Smith captures Ali better than anyone (short of Ali himself). Jon Voigt almost steals the picture with a remarkable performance as Howard Cosell. Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles round out an excellent cast. Unfortunately their not given a very good story to work with.I recommend you rent \\"When We Were Kings\\". A documentary about the real \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" starring the actual participants.\\"Ali\\", I'm afraid is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Smith Ain't Ali","review":"The life of Muhammed Ali could have made a great film. But this attempt comes up way short for two main reasons: 1) Instead of portraying Ali in a balanced way, it attempts glorification of someone who had more than his fair share of human failings. 2) Will Smith is seriously miscast. In the film, he doesn't look like, talk like, or act Ali. Will Smith might be good in the role of a light-weight boxer, but it was a big mistake to think he could portray a heavy-weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Little would have done just as good!","review":"One of the most charismatic people of the last 30 years finally gets a movie about his life; what a shame \\"The Fresh Prince\\" had to portray this hero. The movie falls short to all expectations and for some reason Smith gets acclaim.Ali's life was something else. His life outside the ring rivaled his battles in the ring. The premise of the movie looks good on paper, but many aspects were left out. His encounters with Joe Frazier in and out the ring was for some reason excluded from the movie. Ali's rival WAS Joe Frazier.Will Smith was decent in his imitation of Ali. He had the voice down (so does Billy Crystal), but all that weight gaining wasn't enough. His only love scene was with his real-life wife, this is not groundbreaking acting! Smith was good in the boxing scenes, which were better than any boxing-related movie to date.All in all, very disappointing. Maybe there will be a sequel, if there's one for Men in Black, I can easily see one for this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Smith Flops","review":"I went to the movie theatres expecting this great movie, because that is what Will Smith usually gives us. The first hour and a half was very choppy and didn't have any sort of flow. The last hour and a half made some sort of sense. I would recommend to rent this at home and not waste your 7 bucks. Ali turned out to be a very long-winded, not-exciting movie and I almost felt like walking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, what happened?...","review":"I think Michael Mann forgot to have something happen in this movie. This film is about 120 minutes of slow-motion training shots, 20 minutes of actual boxing and 20 minutes of actual story. Muhammad Ali is an interesting person with a fascinating story, so why only tell part of it? Why stop after he returns to the ring? You've given the movie no real ending or closure. Aside from this, the performances are great. Will Smith is at his best as Ali and John Voight is wonderful as Cosell. I just wish there was more fist in \\"Ali's\\" punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ali","review":"The life story of heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, following the champ's early days as Cassius Clay and his rise in sports and politics, including his controversial refusal to fight in the Vietnam War and his infamous comeback battles against Joe Frazier and George Foreman. Smith gives a towering performance, defiantly funny and impassioned. This movie is a winning TKO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet lofty expectations","review":"After reading and hearing so many good reviews about this movie I found myself disappointed at the end of it. Will Smith doesn't even try to remotely sound like Ali, and comes off as very flat. Everything \\"learned\\" about Ali in the movie is nothing new unless your very young or have been living in a cave for the past 40 years. Also, it is diffult to believe that Smith would really stand a chance against the actors who played Liston, Foreman, Fraiser, or even Chuck Wepner. As for positives, Jamie Foxx steals every scene he's in as Drew \\"Bundini\\" Brown; but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Will Rocks as Ali! His sass-mouthed remarks on George Foreman and other opponents bring chuckles and wrinkles about my lips. He cracks me up. The show I'd recommend to friends. I admire this tough boxer. I saw some parts. This movie Rocks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over hyped","review":"Thought it was going to be an epic, turned out to be just plain pathetic. This movie lacked so much. Who cares that will smith bulk up for the role and looked a little like ali. I wanted to know more about his life. They could have shown less about the fights and more about the man...... poorly done, big budget flop, thats why it fell of the radar at the movie theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"See this film","review":"Ali may not be \\"the greatest\\" film you'll ever see but it makes a respectful showing as it tells the life of a living legend. I was very young when Ali was in his prime but stillI remember the respect he gained from the people in my community. Ali, as played (very well) by Will Smith is ashowman, a philospher, a poet and a lover. Smith was perfectlycast here. Who else could mimic his charisma? Jon Voight'sis superb as Howard Cosell. His and Smith's performance isworth the price of rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Greatest\\" deserves better","review":"Ali, a self-absorbed philandering idiot in a slow, slow movie with bad music. Will Smith's acting was good, but everything else stunk for this film. Please, don't waste 2+ hrs of your life on this. I regret that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Will Smith did well. His portrayal of Ali is all this film had to lean on, the storyline was weak and drawn. I'd suggest renting it once, not buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressive.","review":"Aside from a few wonderful performances by supporting players (that warranted the 2 star rating), namely John Voight, Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles, this is a very boring flick. The film is too long and the cuts are way too quick in a lot of instances. But, isn't that the case of the movies nowadays. Everything is filmed and edited like a music video these days. Just cause that kind of thing works on television doesn't mean an audience wants to sit though that much assault on the senses. Plus Will Smith was the same variation on almost every character he plays except with a bad Ali impersonation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good the second time! One woman's veiw*","review":"I knew from the first advertisement on television that this would be great. I could see it in the look on Will Smith's face. We were not disappointed. Will Smith's dedication to \\"become\\" Ali, is nothing short of amazing. We both grew up watching Ali in the news and in the ring. His sharp tongue infuriated my Grand Mother but intrigued & entertained me. Ali always had what it took to back up his mouth. This is true filming excellence, and Will Smith really takes and gives the shots. There are some things that can't be faked, and Will Smith did Ali the justice that he deserves. Also, the sound track envelopes you completely, making you feel the surge of the crowd and the energy of the moment. WOW. The only seats left in the theater were 4 rows from the front. Perfect. Almost \\"Ring Side.\\" What a ride! Over too soon, we emerged from the theater pumped with adrenaline. We went to see it a second time. It's THAT GOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have not walked out of a movie since \\"Time Bandits\\".

What a a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets change our name because we're a sissy...","review":"this guy doesnt deserve to have his name printed on the cover of a movie. Between his racist, black panther life and his draft dodging alter ego they should have burned him at the stake years ago......stupid peanut head."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO REALLY WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME?","review":"Will Smith proved to be spiritually lost when he appeared on Oprah to promote his \\"ALI\\" movie. He told the audience that there were more books written about Muhammed Ali than Jesus. Hey Will, First let me tell you that Jesus only put out one book, \\"The Bible\\" and second EVERY knee will bow (Romans 14:11) and call Jesus Lord, not Muhammed Ali. One more thing, if Ali is so great then why did your movie BOMB at the Box Office while \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" broke records? I guess you were mistaken about who people are more interested in. Can Muhammed Ali save you from your sins? Maybe instead of doing a movie called \\"I Robot\\" you can do one called \\"I REPENT.\\" Remember that PRIDE comes before a FALL! WHO REALLY WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME?"},{"rating":"2","title":"On Oscar night, the best Actor announced WILL end in \\"SMITH\\"","review":"This biopic features a bravura performance from star Will Smith. He literally becomes Ali, proving that the actor is a force of which Hollywood should reckon.Jamie Foxx is also remarkable as \\"Bundini\\" Brown and Jon Voight is magnificent as Howard Cosell. If the Oscar board is wise, both thespians should be up for \\"Best Supporting\\" nods.The oh-so-familiar story has its lapses but the brilliant cinematography, scoring, and direction by Michael Mann make this one of the highlights of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up to ALI","review":"I was extremly dissapointed in the direction of this movie but Will more than mad up for it. I can think of a half dozen better directors who would not have made the movie look and feel like an eposode of Miami Vice. It think the music was a bit over bearing and the diologue was weak. But Will's dedication to hitting the mark was evident. In fact I think he should receive at least an Academy Award nomination for his effort. Bravo Will... Thumbs down for Michael... Thumbs up in spite of all to ALI!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"If you consider yourself to be a true movie buff, Mohammed Ali, or Will Smith fan, you will truly enjoy this movie. Will Smith did an outstanding job in assimilating himself to Mohammed Ali' personna. It is a great work, and a must have for a home collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing record of Ali's life","review":"Liked it very much. The movie instigate me to do additional research about Ali's life and people around him, in special,Malcon X. I have being suggesting it for many friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too long!","review":"I really did enjoy this movie and it's almost a sure thing that you will too. Seeing a great team of Will Smith and John Voight play the part of a great team in Muhammad Ali and Howard Cossel is extremely entertaining. When those two interact are great parts of the film, as are the boxing sequences. However Michael Mann did the same thing in this movie that he did to The Insider in 99'. He made it about 15-25 minutes too long! I mean there are parts in the theatre where i just couldn't help but say shouldn't this be over. Some scenes are just dragged out too long. There is a specific one where ali (smith) is running through a town in africa and all these people are chanting his name. Think Rocky but make it fives times longer. It is touching but just over done, as are several other parts of the movie. It is a good film but it just could have been better and should have been an oscar contender. You might sit through it once but it's not worth a second watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ali","review":"I felt really bad for Will Smith,this woman was just aweful.It jumped aroud no real direction.I thought that is would start from his childhood up.Was more about politics etc.Will Smith was the only good thing in the movie he did the best he could with this BAD movie.Sorry Will,but you where buff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn's Ali review","review":"Movie was good.

I dont even recommend renting it - wait till it's free on TV if you have some time to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!","review":"This movie was at best a 90 minute flick but with all long drawn out boring \\"Music video\\" type parts, it stretched out to over 2 1/2 hours. Ali, in my opinion, is an interesting character, but the way this [movie] was put together was not worth the ticket price or even a rental price.

It's almost as if someone said, \\"Listen, Will, your voice isn't close to Ali's so don't even try. Just let your acting do the talking.\\"...I won't dwell on the historical details of the film.

Excuse me but,I would like to remind that religous freak that this is a movie review, not an open forum for you to preach to other people how rightous your beliefs are. It's a movie about sports don't take it so seriously. The problem is Ali is the exact same movie as when we were king's. The footage is similar the plot line is similar and instead of will smith it's real life footage of the champ himself. If you haven't seen the documentary when we were kings, youre missing out.

Will Smith performance is impressive and Michael Mann's techinque filming the boxing matches works well because it gives you the sensation of being on the ring: maybe this movie could appeal to someone who hasn't read books about Ali, nor seen documentaries, however in such a case I suggest you read Remnick's \\"King of the world\\" and watch Gast's \\"When we were Kings\\".This DVD edition is a barebone one: the video is honest, no state of the art here; the 5.1 DD audio track is good but no much surround effects here."},{"rating":"2","title":"minus howard cossell","review":"i hated mr cossell with a passion. i loved it though. i gave this a second chance and luckilly it was really the worlds greatest. i love this kind of movie. u know exciting and epic. will smith plays muhamed ali a great boxer. he had 3 wives and is controversial. the end fight was so good i was wondering if that was really him. overall its perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"We ordered this for our three year old and it seemed to work well until the ball actually hits the rim and then the rim falls down.

I was a lil more interested in Galen's relationship/lack there of with Kara and his \\"feelings\\" towards Conner.

The book is entertaining on several levels; Ian reveals much of the enigmatic history and culture of Tibetan Buddhism, gives a great overview of the late 19th century search for the fabled falls of the Tsangpo river, and his personal account of several expeditions to find those same falls in the late 20th century. He presents his quest in both physical and spiritual contexts with an entertaining and sincere style. It's remarkable that there was still such a hard-to-reach, virtually untouched segment of the world left to be explored at the end of the 20th century!

In addition to performing the favorite songs from their first CD, they performed 2 new songs called \\"Believe\\" and \\"Telling All the World\\" that have exploding guitar riffs and raging vocals. Flickerstick also performs a cover of the Mazzy Star song \\"Fade Into You\\" that captures the true feeling of the song.

Opening with an incendiary cover of Eddie & the Hot Rods classic \\"Do Anything You Wanna Do\\", Mike sets the tone for an album that never falters. This scorching declaration of independence fits right in with the Monroe Mythos.Mike Monroe IS Rock'n'Roll, and this album is ample proof of his contribution to our music. His explosive rendering of Dead Boys standard \\"What Love Is\\" is worth the price of the cd on it's own. His plaintive vocal on final cut, \\"Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye\\" is proof positive of the man's versatility.This album is Punk Rock for here and now by one of the masters; it's an excellent companion piece to that great new one from Hanoi Rocks. Unreserved recommendation to those who like hard, passionate Rock'n'Roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rules for fighting that war you've always wanted...","review":"The rules are passable for a miniature game, but as a set of mass combat rules for AD&D, it works well. It was listed as a 2nd Ed. game, but it is seriously lacking in the area of magic: none of the spells from TOM are here, and very few from the PHB. There are resources available on the net to help, just search with the word BATTLESYSTEM. If you can find a copy, and you wish to dive into miniatures, this is a good start. TSR/WOTC has no plans to re-issue this game, but if they received letters from fans demanding it be brought back... Check the local game conventions for a game and try it.

I bought it for a family member who enjoyed several of these candies during their childhood years. Unfortunately the candy freshness was poor. Most of the confections were shelf-stale. Old.

For those who are willing to lose themselves in Rohmer's style of film-making, A Summer's Tale has many rewards. For those who do not appreciate Rohmer's style, well, at least you gave it a try. To criticize a Rohmer film for being wordy and having no plotline is tantamount to criticizing a Hitchcock film for being suspenseful. Rohmer makes films in which you learn about characters through the conversations, not through the story line. They require patience and are certainly not for every taste.

Surprisingly, the curved ends with padded foam don't create annoying bumps in the shoulder area of my dress shirts either.These hangers do make things hang down more because of their stacked nature, but I found that the space that's saved is worth it. If you don't have another rod below where you're hanging these hangers it wouldn't be a problem. The shirts will hang down as much as a knee length coat probably would.I have a terribly small closet [a travesty of injustice, really] but I can still cram my hangable shirts in there with these things, so I definitely recommend them as a must-have for the organized fashionista!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for delicate blouses","review":"I've used this type of hanger for decades, and this is by far the best one for delicate blouses and sweaters.

The third episode started the same way, with glitches - so I turned it off and returned both DVD sets back to Amazon since season 4 would be useless without seasons 1-3. I have found in the past that usually if a series is glitchy and you get a second one to replace it right away, the next set is usually also glitchy.

This quirky eccentricity is juxtaposed with the conservative neighbors.

Overall...my point is...the book for it's small size and and low price was a very good intro to my new family pet.I would suggest buying this book prior to buying the dog.

The men who had refused to fight before; took up arms for this battle(all but two). The wounded man he sent back to die in peace appeared again to fight due to the urgency of the situation....Chamberlain expresses admiration for the men he had known and who died that day.What makes this interesting is the style it is written. You get to \\"listen\\" to the man vs someone else writing about him.There are photos and a map that were added. Some could argue filler but I think they are ok as it gives you faces for some of the names he mentions.Overall, it's a decent article and I am glad I picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good magazine article reprint--very disappointing as a book","review":"This article is a reprint of a 1913 magazine piece written by Joshua L.

I remember standing in the bookstore looking (skeptically) at all of the relationship books, when the title of this one caught my eye. I said to myself, \\"yeah, right\\". When I picked it off the shelf, I noticed a quote from Marianne Williamson, who at the time was the Spiritual Leader of the church I was attending. Having much respect for her, I read the first few pages. Immediately, I was hooked. I after reading the book, I purchased two more copies for single friends. (I'm actually online this morning to purchase more copies) As I explained to them, the title really doesn't do the book justice.

This book teaches you to look at your relationship more objectively, and then make informed decisions about your next step. I felt empowered after reading it! It gives you the tools to better understand your mate and to help you take your relationship in the direction that suits you! I've recommended it to many friends (don't all of us go through this at some point?) and every single one has come back to me to thank me.

I understand the whole female & male energies, yes, but I feel that what the author tells \\"feminine\\" women to do is inauthentic.

I was so sick of being with passive men but I didn't realize the burden was on me to change my behavior in order to find a real, masculine man. I have had this book now for several years, with dog-eared pages that I continually review. It is not easy to change, but I keep up my \\"practice\\" and I truly believe in the principles taught by Pat Allen.

I loved how Pat explained feminine energy women vs. masculine energy women and what the difference was. She helped me understand my role as a masculine energy woman.

After the first 7 chapters, she left us masculine energy women out in the dust. That was what really bothered me. \\"Getting to \`I Do'\\" is a great read for the first seven chapters and then that is it.

There is all kind of unnecessary detail about various psychology philosophies, stories about other psychologists nothing to do with the subject at hand, lots of anecdotes which again have nothing to do with the subject. There are self testing questionaires for \\"pessimism\\" which are useful. There is too much info described too bluntly for \\"self diagnosis\\" of severe depression and other personality traits which would, in my opinion, put an already depressed person into deeper depression rather than inspire him to seek help (I am not a psychologist but I am an MD). The section that actually deals with changing pessimism to optimism is only about 50 pages out of more than 300 page book. The gist of the book can perhaps be summarised in less than 10 pages.I did not find the book to be even readable (but I still read it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep walking...don't pick this book up","review":"I think I was expecting something else from this book. This book left me bored and reading it took me back to my experiences in high school when I was forced to read some boring text book. I found the majority of this book to be nothing more than an author bragging about their past. Too much of this publication was about research the author had done and findings they had concluded.

If you are looking for simple and direct information about how you are feeling then I suggest finding another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Inflated Author Offers Little Advice","review":"I got this book with great hope in it's title.

The author spends most of the book talking about his awards and recognitions for this or that and little if anything actually helping a negative thinker be optimistic.

The evidence that drawing excessively negative conclusions from dissapointments is bad for your health is compelling.But there's a hitch.

The application of Learned Optimism, properly and easily applied, will effect every aspect of your life.As a father I have seen in my children learned behaviors and have been able to help them understand events - as momentary not permanent. The greatest benefit of learned optimism is at work - even some simple advice on how to change an employees outlook changes their approach to their work, the quality and their committment.

The actual self-help part of the book only lasts about 20 or 30 pages - most of the book gives the background and examples of where cognitive therapy has been used succesfully.If you need help with anxiety, depression etc this book is not the first recommendation (see above) - however if you are interested in the background of how cognitive therapy developed, along with the evidence to support its use then it is a quite enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"I found out that a) I am a pragmatic realist w/ an optimist's bent and b)if i choose to apply what I've read it can make a difference in my outlook and in everyday as well as professional problem solving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas but too much technical information.","review":"The book makes good points but it is a hard read due to the enormous amount of scientific and technical information included.

If you are struggling (as perhaps many or all of us are?) with something difficult in your life that you would like to be more resilient or optimistic about, read this book. Most of the book describes the history of the research that lead up to the findings on optimism, as well as numerous chapters on how optimism was proven to be a positive thing for health, work and sports (in case you were still doubting it by the middle of the book). The actual applicable portion of the book (i.e. findings on how you can shift from pessimism to optimism) only take up a fraction of the book. That is the true meat here. You may be better off googling ABCDE method if you want to jump to application in your life.

Too much of the book is devoted to descriptions of research methodology, various anecdotes and praise for colleagues. The few chapters on actually learning optimism amount to some rather generic techniques for keeping the right perspective and avoiding the negative.

Very suitable for us plus size women."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise!","review":"Actually stays in place without heading for my waist as previous ones have done! nice to be able to wear and not show straps with sundresses. Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good If You Have A Large Chest!","review":"I purchased this item to wear with my halloween costume and I have to say I was very disappointed. This product got great reviews but it did not hold my chest. I am a 38 DD and the bra kept falling down I ended up using the detachable strap as a halter and it cut through the back of my neck because my chest needed that much more support. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item","review":"As has happened several times before when ordering off Amazon, I received the wrong product. It wasn't even a strapless bra! And from a different company! I did go buy this product at the mall after returning my purchase from Amazon and I love the bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure","review":"I am not sure this will work out, I put no wire and it feels like there is a wire in it? I also did not have any shipping paper in the box, no way to return it if I wanted to. I did try it on, its uncomfortable, but will have to make due. Not sure I will use it much. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"No 34DD Offered","review":"Heard such great things, but how can you not offer a 34DD. Disappointed. My review is strictly concerning the offering which is lacking for what many have stated is a must own for big busted girls in need of a strapless bra...yet there are not DD offerings below 36."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"it's a perfect lift and support for big breast...Love it, This Bra is uncomparable with other brands, this is the Best...Believe me!! Get yours as soon is possible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"This bra is amazing. Usually I have to pull up some strapless bras all night. This bra kept my girls up nice and perky without any fixing. Truly an amazing bra. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it. 5 LOVEs, 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome support and quality","review":"This strapless is very comfortable and lift support. The hidden elastic bands on the side hold the bra in place and no bulging. I am a 36C and even though it looks \\"big\\" when you put it on it holds the girls and everything around in place, plus it has the convertible straps for back crossing and halter, if needed. Gives a great lift, when you wear strapless tops an dresses. I bought it in all 3 colors ;o."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes up easily, worked very well, a bit heavy","review":"This blind goes up very easily with tons of interior room. The backpack straps on the case are important because even folded this is good size and a bit heavy (over 20lbs). My husband is 6'3\\" and he and our two kids were comfortable in it all day in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this is a large blind not hard to put up and tear down.....it seats 4 people comfortably and with space left...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Penthouse TSC Blind","review":"This is my second Penthouse blind.....the zippers in the first blind failed and appear to be less durable than those in this newer Penthouse. How long they last remains to be seen since I just used the new Penthouse for the first time. The deer did not appear to notice the blind.They need to reinforce the loops for the stakes that hold the blind and wind tie downs to the ground. They are not heavy enough.I like the blind poles that go from ground to ground in each corner of the blind and this appears to be an improvement in this most recent version of my Penthouse. I also like the extra material in the corners of the blind.My biggest complaint to date is the fact that the tie down loops need to be reinforced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blind....but....","review":"This is an excellent blind for concealment and room and what not, however, all the stores in my area that carry it, have one false statement on the box; it claims to have a \\"zip in-zip out floor\\" and it does not. Cabela's even states this on their website. I was truly disappointed in this, as the floor would have been an excellent feature. But regardless, as stated, it's still an excellent blind, just don't expect it to include a zip in zip out floor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size isn't everything","review":"The blind is big. And conceptually, it could be a good blind. Very poor build quality though, from puncture holes due to poor stitching, to actually being able to see pin holes in the fabric in the middle of the walls and ceiling. Perhaps I just received a completely defective unit, but I am not willing to gamble again-returned. For the price, it should be of higher quality. Felt like an $80 blind, not $150."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke on first use","review":"The 30 caliber slotted end piece broke after about 5 swipes down the barral . Made of plastic ?Just not strong enough for intended use ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, End Rod is Bent","review":"This Hoppe's Cleaning Rod set (Item# 3PU) consists of three aluminum rods and two plastic slotted attachments (.22 & .30 caliber). The rod with the handle on it swivels. Open the plastic package carefully if you want to keep it for storage. The aluminum isn't finished or polished. It just looks like raw stock. I cleaned it before first use.The first set I ordered, the end rod (rod farthest from the handle) was slightly bent/warped. I returned it and got a new set. The end rod was bent on this set as well. It still fits down my .22 barrel, but there can be a slight bow and rubbing when force is applied to the rod. I expected better quality from Hoppe's. My last Hoppe's rod set was perfect and lasted me 15+ years. I'll probably try an Outers rod next."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a large head, these are the headphones for you!","review":"Well, my head is a normal size, but the headband on this set of headphones is too large for me. Even when I make the headband as short as I can, it moves forward or backward on my head; it does not stay in place.I thought the price was great on this item, but now I see why it's so inexpensive--the quality of the headphones is fine, but the size of the the headband is a major problem. I have to adjust it about 10 times during a 25-minute run because it slides down the back or front of my head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I first saw this in the unflattering surroundings of in-flight entertainment on Singapore Airlines and was so impressed I bought the DVD. The music and staging are wonderful - but, above all, this is very funny and very engaging. Sir Thomas Allen shows a comic timing I was unaware of and Pamela Armstrong gives a wonderfully ballsy performance. And surely no-one has ever been so BORED as Malena Ernman as Prince Orlofsky? This is a real treat which treats the text with suitable irreverance and the piece as an enjoyable operetta, not a delicate work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh new look at a funny operetta!","review":"This is an extremely entertaining performance. All the characters are wonderful and so right for their roles. My only complaint is they shortened Frosh's role to next to nothing and I've always enjoyed the actor who gives a new interpretation to this wonderfully comic role. It has been updated with beautiful costumes and a trememdous revolving set which is a subtle suggestion of a jail all the way through the opera. I think almost anyone would enjoy this beautiful and clever production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I'm not exactly sure how to describe why I did not like this book. The word \\"unprofessional\\" comes to my head. The author's writing style is not very polished or professional, to the effect that I found that it completely distracted me from enjoying the book. The entire book has a very unpolished feel about it and I did not find it nearly as inspiring or eye-opening as I expected it to be. Others seemed to like this book, so perhaps I set my expectations to high. But for the unusually high price of this Kindle edition, high expectations are not completely unwarranted."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most helpful book ever","review":"Interesting and helpful, this book has made all the difference in making my business more succesful. I cannot imagine what my life would be like without it, thank you Lucinda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Possibly the Greatest Movie I Have Ever Partaken In","review":"This movie is undboutedly the most powerful, if not the greatest movie I have ever seen.... then your mind will be blown by this absolute masterpiece. It simply covers all bases and is absolutely gorgeous. If you have half a brain you will be completely riveted throughout this bit of perfection, and then left feeling extremely drained and shaken up at how truly amazing his movie is.Thank you Cameron Crowe for giving the world a movie that is truly perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big budget -- big disappointment","review":"The previews were much better than the film. It gave the illusion of a mystery-thriller. This is by far the worst use of talent, money and direction. This movie ambled along & ended up no where. I agree with a previous reviewer in that Penelope Cruz is not good at all in this film. Her dialog is completely reactionary and her character doesn't have one original thought. She just looks good and is there for the men in the film to drool over.This has made my list of worst films ever. I give it one star only because is was filmed well and the soundtrack was interesting.I am only glad I saw it on cable and didn't pay for it in the theater. At least I was able to do my nails during the film, so not all was lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN IN DREAMS, THE SUN ALSO RISETH","review":"Those who have never seen the original (abre los ojos) and find themselves praising vanilla sky, are like people, who, having never seen the sun, think that the moon is bright.Just as the moon doesn't produce its own light but merely reflects the brilliant rays of the sun, anything remotely good about this film is due to the fact that it still retains some pale remnants of the original, vaguely identifiable amidst its ill conceived dialogues delivered by stiff, unsympathetic characters... one wonders if the director ever had a real dream in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close'em & take a nap!","review":"Tom Cruise is completely out of his element in this film. As a remake of Abres los ojos it carries nothing of the impact the original has. Penelope Cruz is a shell of the actress she is in the original here, and Cameron Diaz does not belong in drama (or in much else). While I found the original intoxicating, this version just annoyed the hell out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for a such an obvious, cheap gimmick","review":"I was bored out of my skull watching this pretentious \\"thriller\\". I'm a fan of Tom Cruise, but his character, and most of the other cardboard cut-outs, were so shallow that I didn't care for anyone in the film. I realize Cameron Crowe thinks he's God's gift to filmmaking, but his work in this film is very conservative and transparent. I hope someone gives him a better script next time. I figured out the ending less than an hour into the film and had to suffer through another 75 minutes until the big reveal. My advice is to save your time and money and let a friend tell you the story in 30 seconds, which is all it takes to explain. Just because a film is visually stunning, doesn't mean it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A retread from Crowe and Cruise","review":"This reworking of Open Your Eyes just does not work. Despite the obvious efforts of everyone concerned, they cannot meet the level of their previous version.This is a retread of the work of the rightly acclaimed Alejandro Amenábar's 1997 work, and the film has nothing more to offer.Only the arrival of the technical support gives the film any life at all.Tom Cruise shows the limitations of his acting in this film. Cameron Diaz is intolerably beautiful and cannot hit the note required. Penelope Cruz phones in her part.Sometimes Hollywood can remake a film very well, but they cannot in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed!!","review":"Wow! I did like this movie. It suprised me as to what I thought was happening and going on. I think its a must-see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a complex, touching film","review":"I couldn't really explain Vanilla Sky the first time I saw it. In a way, I knew I needed to see it again. So here I am, three viewings later and I still can't zero in on it. I think if you've ever had one of those dreams where you reunite with a long ,lost love on a sunny island, suddenly wake up and realize you're really 65, still single, and the girl in your dream was someone you casually met 30 years ago; you'll have no trouble understanding Vanilla Sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic mind-bender","review":"Cinema is filled with films that attempt the whole \\"mind-bend the audience\\", whether it be time-based or reality-based. The vast majority fail because they are either ridiculous or boring.Vanilla Sky succeeds because the story is as captivating as the way it was filmed. Made by the one and only Alejandro Amenabar (Thesis, The Others) from his original Abre Los Ojos, Vanilla Sky is one of the most underrated movies out there, probably because critics and elitist movie geeks would never praise anything with TC the superstar in it. In fact, the ads of Tom's giant mug left me as reluctant to see this movie as any other starring Tom Cruise. It's a typical hollywood ad, but don't be fooled by it; Vanilla Sky is far from a typical hollywood film, which is about the highest compliment one can give to a movie these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"Open Your Eyes\\" instead","review":"\\"Open Your Eyes\\" was much better than \\"Vanilla Sky.\\" \\"Vanilla Sky\\" mostly copied \\"Open Your Eyes\\" but was too obvious and less convincing. (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.) \\"Open Your Eyes\\" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where \\"Vanilla Sky\\" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in \\"Vanilla Sky\\" is poorly done, whereas \\"Open Your Eyes\\" represents the dream experience very well. I recommend watching both movies before you buy one. But if you're going to buy, get \\"Open Your Eyes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"This was the most bizarre movie I have ever seen! I had a huge headache by the time it was over. The movie trailer lead you to believe it was a fatal attraction type thriller but it's really not - its about something totally different and way to far fetched for me! I didn't like it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This truly is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I admit the special effects were remarkable but the plot is horrendous. The surprise, twist ending has to be the biggest \\"cop-out\\" in movie history. I expected much, much more from Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funniest movie of the year","review":"If you enjoy seeing Tom Cruise get his face smashed in, this is the movie for you. Additionally, if you like movies that are funny by accident, this is the movie for you. If you like movies that can be considered \\"good\\" or \\"watchable\\" or \\"not torture,\\" this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruise's Funniest Movie Ever","review":"This is Tom Cruise's Best comedic performznce ever. There are two scenes that make me roll on the floor laughing. In the scenes after the accident, watch Cruise in the club. With his messed up face, watch Cruise dance at the bar like the Hutch Back of Notre Dame. Also, watch his face when he meows like a cat. Hilarious! It is entertaining for hours at parties or church meetings. Cruise trying to act is funny, but this movie is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"When I first watched it, I was really confused. But now that I own it and have seen it again a few more times, I really see every aspect of this movie, and realize it is a true masterpiece. Probably the most profound movie of the new century, if not in the Top 5 of the last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused disaster","review":"This is one of the worst big budget films i have ever seen. after the equally turgid Eyes Wide Shut I would have hoped Tom Cruise would steer clear of nonesense such as this. If there is one thing guaranteed to annoy it is directors who work on the Emperors New Clothes approach i.e. make your film so obscure that the critics are scared to critisise it too much in case it does have a hidden message. Well the news is it has no message other than how on earth did this come from the same director as Almost Famous. If I could give it no stars I would do so without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wondering","review":"So if the main character, David, loses everything and goes mental because his face is disfigured, doesn't that sort of make him a vain vapid jerk? Wouldn't it have been a good idea to use an actor who could play vain and vapid and still engage the audience's sympathy? It also would have helped if David's competition for Sofia was someone to really worry about; Jason Lee just seemed kind of sardonic and unthreatening. Suppose David was worried about someone like George Clooney? That would make him a bunch more desperate I think.By the way, Noah Taylor did a fine job as Mr. Confuso at the end of the film. Taylor is always so interesting to watch. Such as his performance as the young David Helfgott, both maturing and distorting in \\"Shine\\". And he makes a great foil for Kurt Russell. Although still quite young, Taylor has a knowing but reassuring vibe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Cruise Makes Another Flop","review":"This guy hasn't made a decent movie since Far and Away. Vanilla Sky is just another one of those out-there movies that you have to think way to hard to follow. Then on top of this, the story is a mind bender only to conceal the ending. They try to keep you guessing till the end where you will be completely let down by the lame ending. The only scene worth wathcing in this whole movie is when they get in that car crash, but that was probably only worth seeing in the movie theater with the great sound and big screen. You couldn't pay me to see another Tom Cruise movie after his long string of wierd movies. To top it off the guy has been rated as the most annoying actor of 2005. I think its affecting the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vu Ja (should have seen it coming)","review":"Not much to say about this film other than it could have been a couple of hours shorter, and I should have seen it coming (the ending)....Definately a style over substance film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete torture","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I paid to see this in the theater and I want my eight dollars back. The story is so confusing that after the first hour, I didn't care what happened anymore and what I don't understand is where are all these good reviews on this website coming from? \\"Rotten Tomatoes\\" has dozens of reviews for for the film online and cumilatively, the film scored a 39 out of a possible 100. Thats disasterous for a film made by a major director."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey of the soul","review":"CLOSED MINDED PEOPLE BEWARE!!!! If you are an adventurous spirit and enjoy a thought provoking movie, then Vanilla Sky is for you. In one of the most beautiful and surreal films I've seen in years, Crowe takes the audience on a mind bending trip through the subconcious. Reality and fantasy become indistinguishable and when the ride is over the human experience is unvieled. Tom Cruise gives an oscar worthy performance. Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell all give stellar performances. I saw this movie 4 times at the theater and found something new every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanilla Sky is not for Everyone...","review":"Tom Cruise is a great actor because he isn't afraid to take chances. Vanilla Sky is not for the average person. Individuals with creative minds and imaginations will see the vision of this movie..it's great..believe me, you will be on a roller-coaster. Movies have become boring and too predictable for me..Vanilla Sky got my money twice at the movies because it gave me room to think...that's what a real movie suppose to make you do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be in a competition for most screwed up movie.","review":"This movie was a waste of a couple of talented actors. What is the deal with so many movies coming out with mind twisting, flashback, flashforward, \\"where in the hell am I?\\" story lines?? Plus, apparently you always need a \\"violent\\" sex scene or whatever. I think the director had a little trouble putting on to screen what was in the writers imagination. Messed up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This in my opinion has got to be one of the best movies ever made. Besides Tom Cruise being one of the best actors in the business, the rest of the cast was great. It suprised me that a lot of people didn't like it. I believe it's because they didn't give it a chance. This movie is the biggest mind screw you could ever see. That is what made it so great. Plot twist after plot twist, fhinally a movie that makes you think. All the people that bring it down should go and watch something more suitable for there intelligence level, like Pocahontis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla Sky","review":"This is another one of those movies when you never get a firm grip on what reality is. (Like \\"Last Action Hero.\\") That keeps you from getting truly interested in the movie's plot. As soon as you think you have things figured out and you become interested, you realize it's yet another dream. I wouldn't have been so disappointed if this film hadn't been advertised as a psychological thriller about a young lady who faked her death to stalk an ex-lover. That is definitely not the plot. It's an art film and I did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruise's failed attempt at being deep","review":"It seems that this movie had potential. While in the middle of the movie and everyone is confused, I thought it could end up being pretty interesting. The ending is not rewarding at all and the values the movie implies are conceited. A very over rated movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I could not understand anything. Every character is crazy or going to be crazy.A complete waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess.","review":"This movie should not have even gotten one star. The story line is totally nuts. At the end, you wonder what the whole thing was about. What a disappointing movie; even the acting was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. I THOUGHT I WAS TRIPPING ON ACID WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. MY STOCK IN CAMERON CROWE HAS GONE DOWN A LOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"you guys are morons","review":"This movie is not that great, takes over 2 hours to get to anything. its just a dream that he lives through, talk about predictable. go rent another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the coffee to stay awake through this Vanilla Nightmare","review":"What a total boring experience. It only took Cameron Crowe 2 1/2 hours to finally make the point to Appreciate What You Have and Take Nothing For Granted. I almost feel sorry for Tom Cruise (or was I feeling sorry for myself dozing off waiting for the punchline?) to watch him bumble his way through this Slug disguised as a movie. Tom, be a little pickier in the future when you're reading scripts, you've earned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Tom","review":"Didn't really turn me on. I haven't seen the original Spanish version, Abre Los Ojos, to make a fair comparison, but I understand that that version was a lot better.I'm going to say that I thought the ending was a cop out. I suppose this was meant to be a sci-fi film in the first place, but nothing in this movie left clues along the way to lead me to believe this was something other than a love story gone wrong. So when the ending crops up, I think, \\"What? What happened?\\" Probably too much Tom. He seems to have to inhabit every scene that exists in his movies.The curious question is what does Penelope Cruz thinks of the American versio of the movie she originally mad ein her native tongue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Why, Why didn't I listen to my friends?","review":"This movie is so terrible that I can't believe I watched it to the end! I now want my 2 hours back! Nothing made sense and it was extremely hard to follow. Eat some vanilla ice cream instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was Tom Cruise in this?? (0) STARS","review":"Well this movie was a real disapointment I didn't like it at all. VERY VERY slow movie. I really couldn't get into this movie because of the pace & it was very confusing & hard to understand. There was no real major plot. Do you see were I'm going with this? It really is a sleeper for Tom Cruise. I also was very suprised to here that the director of this movie also did Jerry Maguire, which is truly a different class & excellent movie compared to this movie. It also had a lot of nudity & sexuality. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's put it this way-VERY strange!","review":"O.K. I LOVE Tom, but come on! This movie was just weird. I did not like it at all and would not reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a depressing film from people I love.","review":"I love all the people involved in the project. But simply this film is way too depressing. Great concept, it just doesn't work and now I need some happy pills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"The movie wasn't too good. The only reason I watched it is because of the celebrities in this movie, other than that, the movie is quite boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watse your time!!!!","review":"I think it .... I was so confused about what was really happening in this movie. Penelope Cruz is a horrible actress, and she certainly doesn't deserve to be on the same screen with Tom Cruise or Cameron Diaz. Penelope is so one dimensional it's pathetic. I honestly don't know what Cameron was thinking when she agreed to do this movie. Tom should have known better. To top it off, I guess the special twist at the end was suppose to be riveting....I THINK NOT. Not to mention, this movie was entirely too long and drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there any point to c this movie if it is not for Cruise?","review":"If you are a Cruise fan, you will be disappointed by this one. Half of the movie he has been put on a mask. The plot is confusing and at the last part it turned from a romantic psychothriller into science fiction, it just doen't wash. The characters are so typical hollywood types I hardly can have any empathy with them. If you are not a Cruise fan, simply skip it. I would rather recommend \\"The Game\\" over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst movie ever made","review":"I disliked this movie. I couldn't wait for it to end. It seemed four hours long. I've been a long time Tom Cruise fan, but I'll not be in a hurry to buy his next. I feel as if the reviewers who gave this a 5-star rating owe me the price of the DVD. I can't think of a worse movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"what smells in here?","review":"mmm i saw the previews for this movie and i thought it looked decent. i took my girlfriend to see it and we were both thoroughly bored out of our minds. a confusing plot with a cryognic ending makes for a stink-fest of a movie. if you really must see it, have a friend rent it so you dont waste yer money. i do enjoy a mind stimulating movie but this movie will go down on my list of bad movies, right next to navy seals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost and Confused","review":"I watched this movie twice. I still don't get it. Tom Cruise tried to play this part with his normal good talent. It wasn't Tom's fault this movie stunk. Badly. The previews looked good. Turns out, the previews where nothing like the movie. The movie jumped from one thing to the next, and I couldn't make sense of it, even during the second time I suffered through it. The music was good, Tom Cruise rocks, but can anyone tell me what happened? What was this movie about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its like this...","review":"This movie is completely f'ed up for the first hour and 45 minutes. I was tempted to walk out of the theater, but I figured I would give it a chance. The ending will then make the movie as clear as possible, given the convoluted nature of the movie. If you accept the ending, you will like the movie, if you dont, you will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying film tries to be clever","review":"Let's be clear about this: for the most part, Vanilla Sky is an absolute bore. The characters lack warmth, the dialogue is dull, and annoying cliches are hiding under every rock. It tries desperately to be interesting and clever, but ends up merely pretentious and tedious.Viewers must wait until the last segment to find something of interest, but by then we have lost interest enough to cease caring. The final twist (remembering that every movie these days has to go one better than the last clever twist on reality) is fascinating enough, but comes too late to redeem a movie whose annoying 'pop' style and vacuous and lengthy meanderings ensure its failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie takes 90 minutes to get started","review":"tom cruise doesnt even begin acting until 90 minutes into the movie. cameron crowe goes way overboard in trying to symbolize the plot thru rock n' roll songs. penelope cruz is beautiful! this movie was terrible thoough. an ending does NOT make a movie good. if u can stand the first 90 minutes, the last part of the movie is interesting. but i had to FORCE myself to keep with it and stay thru the first hour and a half. kurt russell is okay too. overall, lame mostly, solid in the end. eh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanilla Sky","review":"When I first watched Vanilla Sky, I was not impressed and a bit lost in translation. However, I began to think I missed something (same initial reaction I had to Cruise's Minority Report), so I watched it again and appreciated the story behind the story. This is a fine story and a fine movie, and I recommend it to anyone who can concentrate on details and who can appreciate the difference between a dream and reality -- and the possibility that in the future we may be able to link the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This movie is the best I have seen in this year. The complex, intriguing storyline, combined with superb acting makes watching the movie a touching experience.The theme, is about true love as much as about dream and reality, a very relevant topic in the age of abundance of virtual reality. Although pretty trite the plot is after the charismatic Matrix, it still is a touching one, with the help of the atmosphere, especially the \\"vanilla sky\\".The acting is beautifully spontaneous, lively, and exemplary in every respect. You can say Tom Cruise was \\"overacting\\", but that is what acting is all about.The DVD comes with a short documentary of an around the globe promotion trip of the movie, and a commentary of every scene in the movie by the director. I found the commentary very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that all about!?!?!","review":"All of the reviews who liked this, please explain to the rest of us why?!?! Throughout the whole movie you as a viewer have no earthly idea what the heck is going on. It totally makes no since at all. That is until the last ten minutes when everything is explained. So pretty much the whole time you are left asking yourself and others questions like \\" Why did that happen?\\" or commenting on the lack of since its making. Please if you have any curiousity about this movie, rent it or better yet, have a friend rent it. Its not even worth the rental price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold Your Nose When Viewing......It Stinks","review":"Terrible movie. Yuck. Everyones talent is shamelessly wasted. Did I mention it stinks. Everyone says \\"You did'nt understand it\\", I say understand I wasted over two hours of my life. It stinks. Get out the nose plugs you will need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 STARS FOR THIS BLOATED TRASH? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!!","review":"The most amazing thing about this movie is finding people who are actually giving it 5 stars. I guess this just goes to show you that if you pour enough money in any misguided enterprise with flatulent ego, there are some people who are going to think it's great. Especially amazing are those who actually compare this horrible incoherent mess favorably to the original, ABRE LOS OJOS. Very depressing indeed. As depressing as watching a really ugly and annoying woman wearing a ton of make up and expensive designer clothes and parading around in a roomful of myopic and deaf people applauding her as she screeches away fit to break windows......................"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't go by the previews of this movie","review":"I saw the previews of this movie on Tv.

I didnt have the luck seeing this in the movie house! Let me put it this way, what Tom Cruise's character does at the end of the film should have been something he did in the beginning, you'll know what I mean when you see this. There are some Good Classic Cruise films, Top Gun, Color of Money, Cocktail, Rain Man, Lets just sweep this one under the rug"},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb and slow","review":"I don't know why people liked this. to me it seemed like a long , dull, ad for tom cruise himself. his persona in the movie was so obnoxious that i WANTED things to go wrong for him. second, the drawn-out courtship - and- love scenes were hackneyed and long, and made me reach for the fast forward. There wase interminable footage of two naked torsos, shot from behind him. third, although the last part of the movie became more interesting, the ending was more of a cheat than a satisfying explanation. don't bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste...","review":"Skip Vanilla Sky and rent Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos). I don't know what Cameron Crowe was thinking when he decided to remake a recent, intelligent movie. Tom Cruise basically plays himself: a self-centered rich guy who sleeps with women and runs away when he's done with them, which gets him into trouble when Cameron Diaz ends up driving her car off a bridge with him in it. She's dead, he's disfigured. Penelope Cruz plays the woman who transforms Cruise into a \\"good man\\". Then all hell breaks loose, and the plot becomes insane and the film begins to try to hard to be cool and impress the viewer with bizarreness.It's almost obvious that Crowe used this movie as an excuse to put his favorite songs to film. He also uses so many pop-culture references in the finale that it's ridiculous. And the sci-fi ending, which actually makes sense in the original, is over the top and completely stupid in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL !","review":"If they had tried to make it this bad, they simply wouldn't have suceeded.

Only moment from this movie that is worth of watching. The rest of the movie is [junk]. I love Mulholland Drive so much and I really like Eyes wide shut. Those movies tell you something. This movie does not. All you see is a very bad and stupid director trying so hard to impress you that how smart he is but only end up making a big fool of himself.The sad thing is that you don't even feel sympathy to him. However, I do like the two minute driving scene with Cameron Diaz. It's only because the actress is good nothing to do with the director or the actor. Both Cruise and Cruz are very boring. Actually when I think of it now. There is a hidden plot: The role played by Cameron Diaz was dead in the accident, and nothing worth watching afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL","review":"I am someone who appreciates movies. I enjoy all types of movies and give all movies a chance. In all honesty, I really tried with this movie. I thought the story was interesting and addicting, but the direction of the movie was very bad. It dragged way too much; an exageration in several scenes. Had this movie been directly differently, maybe it would have drew me closer, unfortunately, it failed to do just that.I don't recommend this movie to anyone at all. It is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, that plays with your mind.","review":"I thought this movie was fantastic! This has got to be one of Tom Cruise's best performances. My only complaint is at some points you can get lost in the story, but it all comes together at the end.

Other than that, it is very entertaining and is full of surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRANGE!????","review":"This movie was very hard to like the first time I watched it.

The movie was too strange to enjoy fully.I wish I could return it and buy another DVD.This was just WHACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Close your eyes....","review":"I certainly expected more from Cameron Crowe (although Almost Famous is commonly overrated). I especially enjoyed the opening credit \\"written and directed for the screen by Cameron Crowe\\". What??? It was already written for the screen (Open Your Eyes) and since he almost made a carbon copy of shots from the original, his directing wasn't much to brag about. His version comes across like N'Sync covering a Beatles tune. Do yourself a HUGE favor and see the original instead. Of course you will have to read subtitles (god forbid). The worst part of this \\"cover\\" movie is the ending. In the original you are left to figure somethings out on your own, in this one Cameron Crowe dumbs it down to a Scooby Doo ending where the antagonist tells you the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I am a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I must be honest. I did not enjoy Vanilla Sky. The story line flip flopped between dream, therapy and reality...which left me quite confused until the very end. Curiosity is what kept me hangin on...wanting to know what's the point? At any rate Cruise plays David, a handsome and rich womanizer. His womanizing gets him into serious life altering situations. The only thing that stayed on my mind from this movie was the statement that his sex buddy (who was really in love by herself) made, \\"When you sleep with someone your body makes a promise whether you do or not!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This movie emphasizes the shallowness of people - Tom Cruise's character and his friends are self-absorbed yuppies. If you are not young, good looking and rich, you are pathetic. Nothing in the second half of the movie made sense. David Aames' face is disfigured, then reconstructed - after which he keeps his mask on - was it because the ugliness within reflected on the outside and was too much for him to face? Ending was a disappointment. Made less sense than the whole movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amenabar rules","review":"\\"Abre los ojos\\" was a masterpiece. This copy is only for Cruise's glory.

I must say that I am happy that I didn't go and see it at the theater. BORING!!!!!!!!!! I have tried my darndest to get all the way through this movie but I have fallen asleep each time before I even got halfway through it. One day I will probably TRY and give this one another run. I really do want to see how it all \\"comes together.\\" Prior to doing this I will need to stock up on a case load of Stay Awakes, 10 pots of coffee and toothpicks for the eyes (ala Fred Flintstone); all of this AFTER I have slept for 72 solid hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming pile of...","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Part of the joy of watching a film, as opposed to reading a novel, is that the very act of trying to tell a complicated story in 2 or 3 hours in the medium of movie making compels the storyteller to get to the point. When a film tries to hard to be an artistic statement, it ends up being just that, a statement. I don't watch films for statements, I want to be entertained.I'm not saying this movie isn't an ok rental, but I'd hardly recommend buying it to watch over again, it was way too slow in my opinion to watch again, especially considering once you know the twists, there's nothing there to surprise you anymore.I did enjoy watching Cruz, she has a powerful on screen presence, and although I like Diaz a lot too, this wasn't the best role for her in my opinion. Cruise has the ability to make really great films but this one isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang ! This film is bad!","review":"This film is ridiculous!

Totally not one of Tom Cruise's better movies. Now I know why I didn't hear much about this particular movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, heartbreaking masterpiece...","review":"I cannot tell you how much I love this movie. It's one of those movies that I have to sit and watch whenever I see it on cable, even though I own the DVD. It is Tom Cruise's best performance. (If you are a Tom Cruise fan you should check out Minority Report, also a masterpiece). You know a movie is good when you cry hysterically at the end of it, every time you watch it. IMHO whenever you cry at a movie it means that the film is so good you forget you are watching a movie. Otherwise, why would you cry, right? Tears aside, this is a movie that really makes you think about important things like love and what it means to be alive. And you can't help but put yourself in his position, and no matter how vain it sounds, it would be horrifying, depressing and life-altering, to say the least. I put this movie right up there with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Both are thought-provoking, horrifying, funny, sad, surprising and just plain brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strange and disjointed...","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this film, but it was so poorly made and the plot was so hectic that I truly had trouble following it in any meaningful way. By the time they let you in on the real meaning, so much time has passed that you are just wanting the thing to end. The director seemed to have trouble deciding what this movie should be when it grew up. He finally settled on \\"shattered\\", which could have easily been the title of this movie.P.S. I give it two stars because Tom Cruise was excellent in his part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, don't buy","review":"The movie was a complete waste...waste of time, money and talent.

The poor girl can not speak English-or even act.\\"Vanilla Sky\\" is so \\"bizarre\\". It sticks in too many elements at the same time. It leaves you wondering, and confused. Everything is so...bizarro. Though I have to admit, Mr. Crowe is very darn creative, and has a vivid imagination. It's a movie that's hard to understand while you watch it, but don't understand anything until the end. At the end it'll make you say, \\"Oh...I get it now! Okay...uh, whatever\\". \\"The Sixith Sense\\" is a prefect example of a very good \\"bizzare\\" movie. \\"Vanilla Sky\\" hits you with so many things...sigh.

Must be sweeter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin a good movie","review":"I have never written a review before but this movie was so disappointing I felt that I had to begin now. The main reason that I felt so strongly was the fact that Vanilla Sky is a remake of a very good movie called Open Your Eyes. Vanilla Sky while not straying from the story failed miserably on all levels of movie making. Cameron Crowes use of rock songs for the soundtrack missed the mark and his rewrite of the script just missed the whole essence of the movie and the characters. I recommend Open Your Eyes which has Penelope Cruz also over Vanilla Sky 100% but it is in spanish and you have to read subtitles but it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall from the sky","review":"It takes only ten minutes to understand this movie is going nowhere. I didn't see the Spanish original so my review is only about this version.Safe for the starting sequence, shot in a tremendous deserted Times Square, everything from then on is just pretentious, trying to mean a lot and eventually failing to say anything.Bad script, mediocre acting, very good soundtrack though.

But the movie enthusiast who likes to be intrigued by films will love this one! It's a little confusing during the first watch, but by the time the viewer gets to the end, he realizes that a second watch is essential! It's a great flick!

This is it.I didn't have high hopes for this film, and I have to say it was far worse than I thought it would be.This is one of the weakest performances of Tom Cruise that I have ever seen. It was like all the actors in this film were completely uncomfortable in their roles, and on the set. Total fakeness. It doesn't help that the dialogue is cheesy, [stuff].The story is the most confusing aspect of the film, with flash-forwards, flash-backs, dream sequences, etc. that you just simply can not follow. Likewise, the twist at the end, if it is a twist, is mind boggling.You would expect a Cameron Crowe film to have great music? Not this one. Score (by Nancy Wilson) was very sappy, and the other music cues felt totally un-original, un-exciting and un-cool.I hate to say it, but this film is a total piece of [stuff] - worst movie I have seen in recent memory (along with Tim Burton's \\"Planet of the Apes\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"VANILLA SKY IS TOM CRUISE'S WORST MOVIE!!!","review":"VANILLA SKY IS TOM CRUISE'S WORST MOVIE!!!

It's what drives the plot. This movie is pretty to look at, Cruise, Cruz, and Diaz all look great, and it has a cool soundtrack. However, there is no internal logic: events don't follow logically from those which precede them. It is disjointed, and the ending makes no sense.

It starts out ok when you think you know what the story is about. There are too many twists and turns that can actually confuse the audience. After watching this movie you are left with a mixed reaction. This is not a feel good movie. Tom Cruise could not even explain why this was a good movie.

It is one of those types where you are not sure what is real and want is in Tom Cruise's mind.Cruise is in some type of correctional facility telling his story to Kurt Russell who appears to be a psychiatrist for his defense in a crime. Cruise is wearing a mask and you suspect that he may be somehow disfigured under it. Cruise tells how he was the major shareholder of a corporation and he had his disagreements with the board. He also seems to have a lot of vivid dreams.He also, tells about his relationships with Camaron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. He gets into a car accident with Diaz and she dies. The rest of the time you don't know what is real, what is a dream, or maybe in Cruz's mind.Diaz and Cruz are both gorgeous and the movie held me from start to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that???","review":"This was as bad a movie as I have seen in a very, very long time.

The same underlying theme of \\"what you see is NOT what you get\\".I generally don't like movies that are more art than entertainment, but this one was a nice surprise. Because of the same \\"super-twist\\" ending style of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and The Others, I don't want to reveal too much for those who haven't seen it and enjoy the shock.A quick warning to those who don't like deep themes, do not attempt to watch this. It is hard to follow at times.If you DID enjoy this movie, I'd also recommend the three listed above as well as Memento."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art movie?","review":"This was a huge disappointment. I cannot imagine what possessed Cruise to get involved in a film with such a confusing plot. Besides that, the characters of both the Diaz and Cruz ladies irritated me no end.

Cameron Diaz (Very Bad Things/ The Last Supper/ Being John Malkovich) and Penelope Cruz (Blow/ Abre Los Ojos) are also good actress, as well as being very easy on the eye. However, Vanilla Sky is probably the lowest point of all their careers.To put Vanilla Sky into perspective: Does anyone remember when Dallas was the most popular programme on TV and then Patrick Duffy left and it wasn't? Problem was they'd killed off his charachter Bobby Ewing and so had to come up with a ludicrous twist to bring him back. What was that ludicrous plot twist? It was all a dream. Don't want to be a plot spoiler for those of you that have been fortunate not to have seen Vanilla Sky but that's the twist. Yes, apart from the first 45 minutes or so of this dissapointing movie its all a dream. Sorry but I wasn't impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Vanilla Sky has glamourous actors doing glamourous things but in the end none of it matters. You'll feel like you wasted 2 hours investing in the lives of the characters in this movie because in the end you will find you have invested in nothing.

All the things that made Abre Los Ojos work have gone missing. Why turn Cruise into a millionaire? Why make him run down Times Square?

I felt no emphathy with the characters and simply didn't care what happens to them. Obvious clues about the \\"surprise\\" ending were blared out in your face throughout the movie. I dozed off during the movie, and only woke up to see if my guess for the ending was correct. The only good thing about this movie was Cameron Diaz' very believable performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stunning pretentious bunch of nonsense","review":"How this can be considered a masterpiece is beyond me. Maybe by a 16 year old on acid. But otherwise, it's pretentious mess whose concepts were stolen from much better movies, like Jacob's Ladder.Also ruined of course by the most overrated actor I can think of - Tom Cruise. Please someone tell me why you like him. I mean as an ACTOR, not just a pretty (to some women and gay men) face. I could act better and I've never acted. Every time he says something, it's as if he is reading a script. I wonder if they have a monitor with the words on it for him. He's like a karaoke actor!I'll give it two stars though just for the sake of the other actors in the film who had the bad luck to have to play across from Cruise in this silly nonsensical piece of wannabe profundity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing!","review":"I heard mixed reviews before sitting down to watch the film. I was expecting an average movie with decent acting. Could I have been any more wrong? The acting is great especially from Tom Cruise and Jason Lee. Cameron Diaz makes an impression as well as Penelope Cruz in their roles. The plot is mind-blowing with more plot twists than I have ever seen. The movie starts off a little slow, but then picks up and never lets go. The end is great, and I loved how this made you think. Great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tommy Boy Goes For the Gold","review":"I like Tom Cruise. But lately, he's kicked into movie overdrive.\\"Vanilla Sky,\\" an entertaining, somewhat clunky drama, offers Tom Terrific the chance to play a vain, super-rich New Yorker who emerges from a near-fatal car crash with a hideously disfigured face. Poor, poor Tom.The film does manage to hold your interest (Tom loves to ACT for all of us) but only because it is part Hitchcockian allegory, part sc-fi, part psychodrama and part let's see if Tom Terrific could snag an Oscar nomination. Halfway through, it falls apart, but picks itself once once the filmmakers tells what's real, possibly isn't. Dozens of other actors could have played this role, but Tom managed to get it first. That's not a bad thing, but not a good thing either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original was better","review":"I gave it only two starts because I don't like the remake as much as I enjoyed the original movie.This movie is a remake of \\"Open Your Eyes\\" (same leading actress in both movies), originally in Spanish, but believe it or not, the Spanish version was more enjoyable and more understandable (in spite of the subtitles).Good only for Sci-Fi fans and the rest of you won't really enjoy it or understand what went on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation Vanilla leave a bad taste","review":"This movies dragged on and on. By the time I was two thirds of the way through the movie I didn't care anymore. Oh Tom Cruise was an insensitive butthead and ended up scarred for life, boo-frickin'-hoo. He did have a cool alarm clock though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REALLY BAD DREAM!","review":"I don't usually write movie reviews, but this was a huge disappointment. I still can't figure out what the movie was about. I think Tom Cruise must have a twisted side to him to do movies like this and Eyes Wide Shut. And, hey Cameron Crowe- How about a movie that actually makes sense for a change? By the time it was all over, I was sorry I wasted the time watching it.Do not spend good money on this .... If you must see- get it from the library as I did- FOR FREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star!","review":"Even though this movie had it's moments...this movie isn't worth renting/buying. I thought since Tom Cruise was in it, it was going to be great becuz every film Tom is in it's always a success. But I thought wrong. This movie was very strange and missleading and just not even worth my time. I didn't like the ending and some of the scenes. This movie is not worth your money. Instead go rent/buy Tom's Mission Impossible 2. That movie is excellent and will leave you satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ending would have been nice.","review":"I'm still not sure why I watched this. I despise Tom Cruise, and Penelope Cruz needs to learn to speak better english. But I sat through it. I actually found myself interested. I like to be suprised, somewhat confused at times while watching movies. It means its not something I've seen before. Its something that hollywood rarely does these days, put out something new.But this movie lacked a solid ending. Its almost as if they wrote this film without an ending in mind and they just made one up. The film had me wondering \\"what in the heck is going on?\\" I really wasn't sure wether or not Cruise was insane or not at one point. But then to find out what was going on, I was severly disappointed. Had the ending been better I would have gave more stars, but keeping me interested for part of the movie only gets part of the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great film but I won't watch it again.","review":"This film is excellent and I own the DVD but I probably will not watch it again unless it is with someone who never saw it. Like A and I another excellent film, it is just two much of a downer. Those downer movies usually don't bother me but this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why must Hollywood bother?","review":"Bizarre and completely unappealing remake of the French film (that also stars Penelope Cruz) about handsome publishing executive Cruise who becomes disfigured in a car crash caused by jealous lover Diaz after he starts seeing a new girl down the street (Cruz). One may find the first twenty minutes of this tasteless black comedy intriguing, but Cruise's decent into hell is just so hollow and bitter that the audience will feel that they have been personally assaulted just as much as him. Visually unexciting with nothing to recommend it what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I the only one that thought it was totally WHACK?!?!","review":"This movie made no sense! And what made even less sense was the fact the Penelope Cruz was the star in a re-make of her OWN movie! This movie tried way too hard to be all artsy and deep....but it didn't work. The movie [was not good], and it was like 2 and 1/2 hours. Don't see it, unless you like throwing your money in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down","review":"Sad to see all that talent on screen have to try and make a bad script good. If you seen the movie \\"Fatal Attraction\\" you will have gotten the idea of what the movie is about, and tie in at the end the movie the \\"Usual Suspect\\" and Kablam you have Vanilla Sky. People might think this is cool, but it was simply ridiculous. The movie has no originality, and is not thought provoking at all, unless one hasn't given thought to marketing scams damaging a person's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla Sky - Rocky Road","review":"I want the two hours of my life back.The trailers border on negligence for misleading potential viewers. Just let people know a little about what the movie really about so that they can make semi-informed decisions. Obviously, the people involved in the movie were afraid we all might know the truth about this flick and stay away. I wish I'd rented Moulon Rouge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Vanilla.","review":"This is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in recent memory. I watched it with moderately high expectations, but when it was over I felt I had wasted my money and my time. Without spoiling too much, it basically tries to answer the question, \\"Is life worth living if you can't be attractive?\\" and answers it with a resounding \\"No.\\"I hate to give a disparaging review to anything (if you can't say anything nice...), but considering how ripped off I felt when I purchased this stinker, I consider it a moral obligation to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total fruitless film","review":"Well, first of all I can understand all those people to find interesting this movie without haven't seen the Amenabar masterpiece but I can't close my mouth and \\"close my eyes\\".I had very excited to see this film and give it a try without compare it to Abre los ojos (Open your eyes) spanish original film, but is impossible to achieve.All the magic, mistery, consistency, stellar playings, soul and many merits have thrown away to the W.C in the american remake. Bored and with a offensive different and simple script for idiots or children, nothing to see with the far better original.Frightful Cruise, ludicrous Diaz and go on. Even my compatriot Penelope Cruz has lost her bright in this remake.What a disastrous way to destroy a beautiful chance.Give yourself a favour and see the original and then think about this Disney farce. 1 over 10. A real pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't ever get those 2 hours back","review":"This was clearly one of the worst films ever made. Whenever my wife suggests I have made a error in judgment (daily), I reminder that she insisted that we go watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Abre los Ojos instead","review":"To preface this: maybe if I hadn't seen Abre los Ojos first, I would feel differently. I feel that the remake didn't add anything to the original, and was just a way to showcase Tom Cruise trying desperately once again to be a serious actor. Unless you absolutely can't under any circumstances stand subtitles, watch the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello?!?!?!?","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It seems like the writer couldn't come up with a good explanation for the plot he created, so he decided to go with the most far-fetched and unrealistic ending. Please don't compare this film to \\"The Sixth Sense\\". It's NOWHERE near as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla Mistake","review":"Don't bother with this empty star vehicle. Too much nonsense to wade through for a weak finish. But if you like unrealistic witty banter this may be ok for you. See the original Abre Los Ojos for a real quality film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This movie was boring and psychotic at times. I didn't even watch it all the way through it was so bad. I cannot believe that it got 3 1/2 stars this movie was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate/Love it? I'm on the hater's boat!","review":"All the reviewers who said that this is a movie you love or hate,and I really hated it. It was long, boring, and I just didn't connect with any of the characters. I would have turned it off long before it was over, but I was watching it with other people. The only thing remotely good is Camron Diaz, I guess I did like one character after all. Stay away unless you feel you just have to, and if you hate it, you can jump into our ship!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've ever seen...","review":"This is it. Since my wife is such a Tom Cruise Fan, we decided to give this flick a try. We were greatly disappointed. Tom Cruise wasn't even up to his usual high standards. Cameron Diaz was superb as always, but Penelope Cruz has to be one of the worst actresses to ever walk on the face of the planet. Combine her lack of skill with a lousy story idea about a horribly disfigured man trying to come to terms with his own mortality, and you get this...the worst movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking","review":"Ok, so Tom Cruise is looking for new ways to spread his wings. He wants us to know he's an ACTOR. I like his work, but here he's so busy ACTING, he constantly upstages himself. As for Penelpe Cruz, she was better in the original foreign film version of this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"CONVOLUTED MESS!","review":"The ultimate tease and let down. The first hour and a half was pretty engaging and interesting and then the film imploded in sci-fi nonsense. Was this Cameron's homage film to Brazil (a much much better film)? If so, he fails miserably. Better luck next time Cameron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"In the age of movie making when everything is based around thrill seeking, instant gratification, and the latest advances in computer graphics Vanilla Sky offers a nice escape. The twisting and turning throughout the movie, causes you to constantly question the meaning and direction of the story and in turn the meaning and direction of the charcter's- David Ames life.If your looking for a cheap thrill, or a sappy love movie this movie is not for you. Its a movie (if you get it - which a lot of people don't) that causes you to ask some questions about your own life, which is the underlying message throughout the movie. (The phrase \\"Open your eyes\\" seems to be directed at the viewer.) Its a movie that searches for honesty, which is an attribute of art that is lacking in most movies today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves ZERO stars actually..","review":"The ending of this movie was one of the worst I could have imagined - written like a very POOR Star Trek TNG episode (I know that's an insult to Star Trek). This movie is in the same vane as 'The Game' but the dialogue stinks, as does the acting and the script. It just doesn't pull anything off well. One of the very few movies I should have just walked out on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it through the whole thing.","review":"Couldn't make it through the whole thing. I felt it was good in the beginning but left me feeling more empty and unfulfilled as it went on. Finally I skipped to the end and was glad that I did. The ending was just as lame as the middle. The movie seemed 6 hours longer than it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far the best remake I've seen","review":"People's blaming cameron crowe do nothing else to the story but exactly what was in the original and so it destroy the originity of the orginal... First of all, this is a remake, so that would make a perfect sense why their story are the same.., the second thing about destroying originity, I rather think the saturation of this version is positively working on me. This version is more colorful than the original in a working way. I watched it so many times by now and still I know some time later I'll rewatch it again, its more like fairy tale story in a twisted way, where people yell for a second chance on certain things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Idea All Dressed Up In New Clothes","review":"Imagine a very old and over used idea that's been done yet again - but with the most up to date film making techniques. I must admit I was absolutely hooked right up to the finish. However, I was so disappointed with the finish, it caused me to give this flick only two stars!Tom Cruise is, as always, magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music!","review":"Well you can't hit a home run every day. I expected Tom Cruise, with his intensely insincere smile to be the worst thing in this movie but he's fine.Nonetheless its very long, very slow, hard to follow, wildly implausible and pointless. Love the soundtrack, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I cant believe I spent $7 to see this in the theater. I wish Amazon.com had a 0 stars option. HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADDENINGLY AWFUL","review":"The movie is fun to look at for about 45 minutes, but then it begins to get confusing (not in an intriguing way, but more in a way that makes you shout \\"WHAT?\\"), and the dialogue gets worse and worse, and then you find out \\"It was all a dream\\". Horribly unsatisfying, it made me want to fire a cannon at the movie screen. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a David Lynch Imitation Gone Horribly Wrong","review":"I was also expecting good things from this film. Having seen both David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE and the trailer for this, I was expecting something good and more or less uncommon.This film, however, turned out to be a surreal film for the people that whined \\"I don't get it\\" halfway through MULHOLLAND DRIVE. (By the way, whether you do or don't understand the plot doesn't have to be an essential criterion for enjoying a film. Try abstract animation.)This film's cheap sci-fi explanation at the end looks like it was trying to pull from THE MATRIX, but instead settled for technological explanation pulled from an airport sci-fi novel.And neither the directing, acting, nor set/costume design make up for any of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Simply awful. A movie that attempts to have a \\"twist ending\\" and fails miserably, only making itself and its creators look foolish. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO","review":"This movie (DVD)is a waste of time, is one of the worst movies I saw last year. Tom Cruise is totally overacting (I believe he was trying to win an oscar in every scene) and Penelope Cruz is horrible, the only thing who saves a little is Cameron Diaz.My advice don't waste your time and money"},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever .. but DVD is lacking","review":"Vanilla Sky is my favourite ever movie, just pipping Jacob's Ladder to the top spot. The Jacob's Ladder DVD had a brilliant series of extras. The best part for me was the deconstruction of the film in the form of a 'making of' featurette. Vanilla Sky has two similar featurettes, both of which are awful. One is this press tour thing, and the other is probably the worst documentary I have ever seen.The original music video 'Africa Shox - Leftfield' was awesome and directed by a great up-and-coming director called Chris Cunningham who no doubt will be making waves in the movie arena soon. But the DVD version of this music video was awful - just clips fom the film with dodgy editing and effects out of the 80s!!The good things on the DVD are:(1) TheFilm(2) Cameron Crowe's directors commentary which is very insightful.A mixed bag that really could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Your Eyes to the Symbolism","review":"This film was full of symbolism. You had to watch it that way to \\"get it.\\"This film brought so many questions to the surface. Do you need money to be happy? Who is the real you? Is it the one face you show to others or is the one face you see of yourself? If you had a second chance, how would you live your life?Vanilla sky is a movie that makes you think. You must watch it carefully to catch the nuances of each character's attitudes and reactions. Cruise pushes the envelope from happy oblivion to paranoia. Diaz's psychotic stalker scared me with her realism. Cruz played her part as a \\"prop\\" well. This film didn't do her justice. The surprise character was Kurt Russell. Quite a change from his usual characters.Open your eyes. Watch for the symbolism. You may need to see this movie more than once to understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla Sky","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie coming out onDVD. Boy was I disappointed. I understand what they weretrying to get across but I just did not think it wasentertaining. It was all I could do to not fall asleep.The only reason I finished watching it was I kept hopingit would get better. Needless to say it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood at it's best!","review":"Just Fantastic! Yes, that's the way I always react whenever I see this movie or talk about it. There are very few movies that have left their mark in my heart and memory and this is one of them. Tom Cruise is at its best. A very challenging role for most, but he just did it so naturally. In fact, I was not a Cruise fan until I saw this movie.The movie is very touching, and takes you on the emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the movie. It is sad to see that many people failed to understand the movie, and that explains the reason it didn't did well on the box-office. If you are a kind of mature viewer, you will understand this movie and love it too. For me, it was worth buying this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla is an apt description....","review":"This is not a film that posesses the ability to rise your interest above that of vanilla.While a cinematographer's dream, the story of a self-indulgent man facing the reprecussions of his choices, just kind of lies there. The casting was promising, but the story kills any of their efforts. It just didn't seem to have the 'punch' one would expect, given the premise and the setting. Also, the trailors really set you up for a greater expectation than you come close to getting.The end also seems to be one of those story-telling devices in the category of 'Oh no! We need to tie this all together and we've got 5 minutes to do it.' I felt strongly that the ending was just thrown together and not actually a strong part of any part of the story.If you're a Tom Cruise fan, you get plenty of Tom. But if you're a fan of good storytelling...I suggest steering clear of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"what i particularly love about this film is the element to what is called 'lucid dreaming'","review":"I must say that the reason i love this movie is not so much for the movie overall perphaps, but i think what i particularly love about this film is the element to what is calld 'lucid dreaming'. They make up the film for me, if that element wasn't present there i wouldn't bother buying or even seeing the film.Also this movie was the one who made me embark on my own 'Lucid dreaming journey'. For the rest, the movie is normal, take the science fiction out and the movie is just another movie. So i suggest you seeing this movie only if you like science fiction for it is the main theme besides love.Anyway i won't give out anymore, or rather i don't want to give anything specific apart from what i said. So just try it, it might turn your mind upside down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't knock what you do not understand","review":"A complex movie will seem stupid to a simple mind. A viewer from NORMAL, Il. compared this movie to \\"Abre Los Ojos\\", which most NORMAL people have never heard of.The title \\"Vanilla Sky\\" refers to a painting in David's 'daytime office' apartment by Monet also titled \\"Vanilla Sky\\". David uses this painting as his dream world when he is frozen. You can see it in the scene after the night club where he sleeps on the sidewalk. The next day the sky looks as it did in the painting.I thought the movie was excellent because it made you THINK, and you couldn't figure it out until the very end. THINK is the key word.Thumbs Up, I recommend it, and I will soon add it to my DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"after 43 years i have finally watched the worst movie of all time... i am bitter about the rental charge i wasted and the hours out of my life.....i want my life back... this movie makes \\"plan nine from outerspace\\" look good... by the way tom cruise is the worst actor ever....the love he has for himself would fill a room....."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down/disappointment this film was!","review":"Vanilla Sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Penelope Cruz, among others!The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond \\"below average!\\"Tom Cruise and the rest of this AMAZING cast are given terrible lines and bad roles. A shame, really...The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words...As for the plot, school plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better storylines!

While I really respect Cameron Crowe (\\"Almost Famous\\") I really have to wonder what in the world happened to him to direct such a terrible film. You watch this movie and none of it rings true and none of it makes any sense: from the central character played by Tom Cruise to the storyline or even the main theme or plot of the whole enterprise. First it's a conventional story which turns into a mystery that becomes a thriller that's really a sci-fi - and none of it's any good and none of the pieces even fit together.

I'm still confused.The plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing, it's all about lucid dreams and Tom Cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him. The film is basically all a blur from start to finish, it's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance. Why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway. Don't buy this film on DVD or you'll be wasting your money.

Cameron Diaz is terribly cast, her performance is so hyper and foolish, I just wanted to slap her. Penelope Cruz is so hard to understand, she needs to take some speech classes, and Tom Cruise thinks he is the best actor that ever existed, he's not by the way.

Then the plot twisted into \\"What Dreams May Come\\" artificial cartoon like fantasy and made me lose interest all together. The director literally destroyed a potentially good movie. The sick and twisted love triangle could have worked with controversial plot twists or an ironic ending focusing on Tom Cruise's regretful decisions. The director's option of turning the last part of the movie into science fiction completely blew it!!!!! It's unfortunate because this film was very interesting until it started to get very unrealistic with futuristic technologies that have absolutely nothing to do with the love/suspense scenes. I enjoyed the characters; Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, and Penelope Cruz, but was disgusted on the decision making of the writers and director of the ending of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanilla Sky is like Vanilla Ice Cream , refreshing !","review":"A cool , sexy , screw with your head kind of film brought to you by director/writer Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous).

Wanna life forever? Not like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and confused","review":"This film does not know what it wants to be. It is a convoluted mess of Sci-Fi, psychological drama, fantasy, love story and drama. It combines this mess with the look of an art film.The movie is 2 1/2 hours long. It moves along at a slow agonizing speed. The ending is predictable less than an hour into the film. The rest of the film is series of dream-like flash backs. The principal characters played by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz are so flat and dull, you simply don't care for any of them.This a big budget disaster. Skip this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Stars","review":"Accidentally I watched this movie on Cinemax, so I didn't start from the beginning. But I was attracted to it. The movie, or film, was fascinating. I like watching stars, and Jena Malone gave me a whole new vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Story to Heal","review":"As the title of this review, indicates that is what this film illustates. It is told with an clarity and intensity that is more real than 'reality.' It is one the most beutiful works of magical realism I have ever seen. Mary Stuart Masterson is masterful and if Jena Malone is not the finest young actress in America, I don't know who possibly could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste!","review":"If you want to watch a weird, depressing movie about a self-absorbed, drug-addicted prostitute who neglects (and repeatedly betrays) her sick, dying sister, this is the one for you! I can definitely think of better ways to spend 4 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, bizarre, pointless movie.","review":"Spotted this at a video store and thought it would be good due to the description on the back...wrong! I could barely sit through it. I can't imagine why Mary Stuart Masterson would star in something like this...she must have been desperate for work! I love her acting but I'd rather watch her in Immediate Family, Bed of Roses, or Fried Green Tomatoes. If you're looking for something to make you want to go jump off a cliff, go ahead and rent this movie, if you're looking for something entertaining and uplifting, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairytale love","review":"This is about the fourth time I've read this book it was just as wonderful as the first time. This a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remodeling a barn","review":"Can a poor but respectable family spend a summer in a barn to get them out of a slum rental? Shirley is working and spends a dime traveling out to find a summer home, and settles on a barn. She goes to the owners, and meets the young son who knows the place and arranges to have her stay there. He also comes to visit, introduces his sister, and they are both influences by the Hollister family. The bucolic adventures are charming, and the romance develops slowly from admiration to love and caring, but the spy adventure in Washington DC isn't a strong element. I think GLH is at her worst when she tries to deal with espionage or crime.The remodeling of the barn leads to the denouement when the young rich boy turns over a renovated home, fit for year-round use, to Shirley and the Hollisters, and all is well. One of the best GLH romances, a fantasy even if dated, that grows through well developed characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Enchanted Barn","review":"This book contained a lot of typographical errors which detracted from the enjoyability of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, everyone needs to read!","review":"I thought gave you a lot to think about. I love reading stories that make me think about what God would expect from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from this supplier!","review":"This is not a true copyrighted version of The Enchanted Barn. It is scanned and copied. There are many, many missing pages and the last several pages of the book are not included!!! How does it end? If you care, don't buy from this supplier.Absolutely appalling that this lousy copy would make its way to Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"This is my favorite GHL bookI have read it five times ormore the story is just as fresh as it was the first timeI read it. It is a wonderful story of family life and how they stick together in the time of adversity, even if they have to live in a barn. Their faith in God and each other makes it a very heartwarming story in the style that GHL is famous for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why spend this much money for a lousy copy","review":"The book itself is wonderful, especially if you're a Grace Livingston Hill fan, or if you like sweet, old-fashioned love stories! But this edition, which is WAY too expensive, is also very very very poorly scanned copy--there are egregious errors on every single page, some becoming almost unreadable. Do not believe their hype about \\"preserving this important cultural item\\" You can get the regular paperback from Amazon, or undoubtedly from an auction site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please refund my money!","review":"This was my favorite book as a teen, my copy fell apart I read it so often. Sadly I neglected to read the reviews before I purchased the Kindle edition. It is very poorly done, type-O's, characters inserted into words. This is a classic turned into a worthless item. Amazon should either refund everyone who has purchased this book or make corrections and send everyone a new version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Favorite Book!","review":"I am a GLH fanatic! I have read between 40 & 50 of her books so far, & this is my 2nd favorite book. My 1st is, \\"Where Two Ways Met.\\" But, this is a delightful story of a proud family of faith, in need, & of how blessing upon blessing is granted to them by someone from a totally different walk of life. Love comes in too, but can 2 people so different come together despite their different backgrounds? Read the book! You will have a hard time putting this book down! You will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unreadable","review":"Readers of Grace Livingston Hill's (nee Lutz) works are well familiar with her formula: Lovely, innocent maiden is in dire straits, meets charming, kind, handsome stranger, lives happily-everafter. This novel is no exception, so I'll leave plot critique to literary reviewers.This e-version is almost impossible to read. Every page bas one or more words that are split by random punctuation marks. Most pages have mid-breaks with the title, as though the original text was scanned without regard for page and font size. Had I not had a hard copy to refer to (disbound and brittle), the story line would have been undiscernable.It would behoove the agent responsible for electronic reprography to review text before committing it to publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Grace Livingstone Hill books and I had not read this before. Great book, as usual. Recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This is a very good book. If you know a little of C++ and would like to learn the beginning ins and outs of graphics, this is an excellent book. The author provides pretty much everything in a clear and to the point way. Being a computer science major at FAU I found that this book contains information that was not thought in class. Pick it up if you have free time and do not want to spent it reading Knuth and Ritchie... You'll be up and flying in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is an outstanding book articulating some the most important matters concerning forgiveness. MacArthur does a great job giving a biblical position on this matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Biblical","review":"I found this book too biblical with too many references and I am definite so many others who study theology will be satisfied with this book but I am someone who prefers such a topic to be described in a simple emotional tone fluently rather than a very reasonable explanation from the scripture. I believe in this because forgiveness must be touched before it is practiced, it cannot be understood or proven. This book is missing that emotional touch, and discouraged me to read it till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some components damaged","review":"Although it is difficult to determine the effectivness of this product in terms of confirming any actual horsepower increase as opposed to the manufarturer's claims, my basis for evaluating this product stems from the condition in which it was received. Packaged as new, it was revealed that the rubber tubing used to connect the K&N filter to the housing was split. I had to use one of my own hose clamps to secure these two components as the clamp supplied was undersized. In retrospect, it appears that some other customer in attempting to assemble this rubber tubing had to split it in order to attach it as this too was undersized. The metal bracket used to secure the assembled kit to the front of the engine compartment was distorted as well. It was an absolute nightmare attempting to install this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"K and N Cold Air","review":"Product was extremely easy to install and the power gains were noticable. Enginge sounds better to. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch analysis","review":"This obviously is a writer who knows what he's talking about.
