We selected this model because it had the two monitors and the price was resonable. Well I firmly believe you get what you pay for because this monitor does not hold a charge. We have to have the monitors plugged in at all times for it to work. The batteries just dont hold a charge. The reception is good but we can't unplug it and use it around the house. We wound up throwing it out and purchasing a new one. Don't waste you money on this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Monitor!","review":"After reading many reviews on many different monitors we chose this monitor because it had mostly great reviews... We are so sorry we purchased this monitor now!Half the time all we can hear is a high pitch noise or static and nothing from our baby.. It works when it wants to.. We have tried moving the base and nothing helps. It is worthless. We are now debating on buying a new, more expensive monitor system.If you decide to purchase this monitor-save the box and paperwork so you can return it for a different one. You will be glad you did. We didn't and are regretting it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static","review":"This is unusable in our home because of too much static and other interference. It really threw us for a loop when we finally heard baby sounds coming thru the static ... while our child was feeding! We let our neighbors know right away to avoid any embarrassment.UPDATE: We upgraded to the Sony \\"Baby Call Nursery Monitor - 27 Channel\\" and it works beautifully... no static at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Static - No baby","review":"I received this as a shower gift off of my registry. It works well when the monitor is upstairs and I have the receivers downstairs. But when I have them on the same floor I have to have the volume up all the way and can barely hear my 3 month old son. I can hear the neighbors daughter loud and clear. I purchased another monitor and it works so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"This monitor worked well for the first week after our son was born but then began to only provide us with static noise or a loud whine instead of providing us the security we had thought we'd be getting. We played with the channels and even moved the receiver to a different location within the nursery but nothing has worked. All we basically have is a $30 night light. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!! Cheap for the price","review":"My husband and I had a wonderful (but used) moniter with our first child, but wanted a new one for our second. We registered for this one after looking at all of the ones at babies r us and target, price ranges vs. features. This one looked like the best for the money. WRONG! It only works half of the time, which is horrible when I can't even hear my baby crying through the receiver. It can only be turned on to about 20% power because anything higher will give a loud screaching or scratchy static sound. Once my 2 year old had turned off the base but the receiver was one and it picked up a dog barking down the street?!?! I did save the packaging and will return this monitor asap, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! Babies r us has one that is less than $20 that works well, it's our backup at grandma's and may just come home with us next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Safe Glow is Lame","review":"After using these monitors for only five months the volume malfunctioned.

It was so annoying we didn't use it and finally returned it and got a much better one that we now love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ignore the bad reviews","review":"I ignored the bad reviews, thinking that these would be great. My last monitors were the same brand and I was very happy with them (looking to replace only because I dropped the monitor in gravy and it died.) This monitor is fancier than my old one but terrible. I can't seem to control the volume well. I like to put the monitor on the quietest audible level while I sleep but if it's on at all it is VERY LOUD. Plus it has terrible static periodically for no apparent reason. I'm returning it today. I need to find another one that is more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad experience","review":"one of the monitors never worked. one only worked when plugged in and only in certain areas of our house.

It hasn't worked well since the beginning. My baby is only 5 months old, but I'm ready to go buy a GOOD one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased with the battery feature","review":"Purchsed this monitor because of the good reviews it had gotten. Reception is fine but the battery system sucks. We keep one monitor plugged in in the bedroom but have one that runs on batteries that we take with us around the house. This monitor chews through 9V batteries. I'd say you get 4 hours of monitor time per battery, less with rechargables. But what really bites is that not only do you have to constantly change the battery....you need a screwdriver to do it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Graco Ultraclear","review":"We decided to pick up this monitor because it was low cost and had two receivers. I was disappointed in the range when we tried it out -- just walking through the house caused static, and walking out to the yard quickly went out of range. We then received a Graco Ultraclear as a late shower gift, and we tried it out. It is so much better-- crystal clear reception and range of at least double the Safety 1st. The Safety 1st will go back to the store, we're keeping the Graco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hastle!!!","review":"We recieved this monitor as a shower gift two years ago for our daughter. The night light was nice although we already had a night light for the wall. The parent units took 9 volt batteries that didn't last long and the range wasn't very good at all. The farther you went, the more staticky it was. From then on we left them plugged in so the portability was compromised. They worked fine for about a year and then one parent unit died. The second parent unit just died last night. For about 6 months they both acted finicky and would fade in and out of reception but still worked overall. The static was pretty bad for about a year though and drove my husband crazy at night. They did their job, but not very well. Having said all that, I couldn't recommend buying this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossing after a month","review":"I bought this monitor because we have a two story house and wanted to be able to stop having to go up and down the stairs searching for the receiver. What a mistake! A person moving around the room causes static noise and bad reception. The red light that's supposed to indicate sound is on the whole time while the air conditioning is on, which is all the time in Phoenix. I get constant interference and static and got NONE with the Fisher Price one. I'm tossing this one and taking my Fisher Price one back out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static","review":"I bought this monitor liking the feature of the two receivers but the static is very annoying and to beable to hear threw the static I have to turn it all the way up!I WOULD NOT recommend this monitor, I would take mine back but I lost the receipt! Please don't waste your time or money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for a short time","review":"I've owned this monitor twice...the first time was an older version which was great for the first 6 months and then one day just gave up working. The store I purchased it from was nice enough to take it back for me and gave me a replacement - the updated version which appears here. That one worked great for 7 months and now is just terrible...I have to have it turned all the way up to hear anything (not due to static - it only works on the loudest notch)...and even then I had to put a piece of tape on the control dial to keep it engaged (monitor was never dropped or anything to cause a malfunction). I loved this monitor at first, both times, but now - save your money and go with one that will actually keep working."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great bargain","review":"I also did not realize there were two sets of sheets for this very very low price. I was even more amazed at the quality and appearance. We love them and take turns rotating them among the family bedrooms.

I was expecting a much softer feel, but it is more like sandpaper! I washed several times to see if it softens up, but not. They are pretty, but I doubt the validity of the 400-thread count claim. I wish I would have used the same amount of money to buy just one set of better quality sheets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE","review":"I washed these three times and they still smell of gasoline.

I am going to have a hard time narrowing down which pictures I want to frame - they are all so nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece by Evola","review":"It is a curious phenomenon of the Twentieth Century that first-rate, independent thinkers should emerge from obscurity only at its end. Many are the Evola titles which have only recently been translated and published for the first time in the English-speaking world. In \\"The Mystery of the Grail : Initiation and Magic in the Quest for the Spirit\\" Evola explains in his signature virile, scholarly, succinct, and yet accessible prose that the Holy Grail is far more than what we have been imparted by its Christianized versions. A remarkable book which throws open the doors of imagination, and restores the dignity and sacredness of the warrior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but difficult","review":"This game takes a little bit of getting used to. But once you get the hang of it, you can't put it down! I wake up early in the morning to play with this game. The hard part is that there is always a way to jump over things or collect things. They are sometimes just hard to find. I recomend this fun game to kids of the ages 9 and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand","review":"I recieved this game for Chistmas, and I found it to be dissapointing.

It is a shame that they did not get more popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem amongst a sea of granite","review":"As a fan of such bands as In Flames, Children of Bodom, Enter My Silence, and other such bands that display aggression along with melody, I would strongly reccomend either this album, or the previous two albums of Callenish Circle (\\"Flesh Power Dominion\\" and \\"Graceful...

This just feels like a tired attempt to copy his own brilliance, having forgotten what that brilliance consisted of. Uninspired is the word that comes to mind. Alright, not all tunes are boring. \\"Sweet Sugar Mama\\" is actually in old brilliant G.Love-style, \\"Kiss and Tell\\" and \\"Tommorow Night\\" are ok, but that's about it. If you're going to buy one of G.Love's albums, don't buy this one. I'm happy to say, though, that his latest - \\"Yeah, it's that easy\\" is as good as the first album, although different in style and not as innovative"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cocktail Blues for the Po-Mo Set","review":"If you like to listen to popular music because it entertains you, rather than making some big artistic statement, then you will disregard all of the negative reviews of this disc and buy it. G. Love is one of a long line of white musicians that have strip-minined the blues for influences to produce a highly listenable bit of pop, al la early Elvis.Unlike overly reverent preservationists like John Hammond Jr. and Eric Claption, G. Love's take on the blues is similar to the tongne-in-cheek mimicry of urban hipsters the John Spencer Blues Explosion. However, unlike the Blues Explosion' hybrid blaxploitation/trailer trash sound of discs like ACME and ORANGE, G. Love produces a sound that is softer, yet more beat driven, a sort of cocktail blues for the po-mo set.I think that one of the charms of non-Southerners G. Love and John Spencer is that they are making the kinds of blues-influenced pop that Southern men used to make and seem unable to produce anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at any price","review":"This is not a recently published book. It has been scanned in to Kindle format by Amazon and the back cover even includes a graphic of the library card. (And it's terribly over due). The explanation was that this book was being 'saved' as it was an older reference book on the topic, out of print, and now would be preserved for all to enjoy and use.NOT WORTH THE EFFORT and terribly over priced at 99 cents! TERRIBLY written with sentences that go nowhere, hang on contingent clauses and leave you more confused about why you bought this book than you were about the history of the time period before you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you rate it if it is never in stock?","review":"The lamp shade looks like it would be nice, but we have been looking for it for months in the Babies R Us store to no avail. They say they have no idea when it will come in since the distribution center doesn't even have them. I just saw that there were only two left in stock on-line, but it is a bit frustrating to have to pay shipping and tax when ordering it on-line. We ran into the same thing with the Valence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find","review":"This is a cute item, if you can get it. I only gave it two stars because I also have been trying to get this lamp shade. I was lucky and found the last one in the store two weeks ago but when I got home there was a flaw in the material. When I went back to exchange it in the store, they were completely out. I have been trying for two weeks and they still haven't restocked this item. They have said that the are not getting their truck deliveries because of bad weather. I find it frustrating when a store that specializes in baby items runs out of a product for weeks,especially when it is your bedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Riveting","review":"I really enjoyed Dun's first novel, \\"Necessary Evil,\\" and was anxiously awaiting publication of his second, \\"At the Edge.\\" Once again, he has created two fascinating main characters, established an unrelenting pace which keeps the reader glued to the story for hours. Dan is a timber lawyer, bit of a tough guy, born to an Oregon ranching family. He encounters Maria, an environmental attorney, who was born to wealth and conservatism, but was reborn to become a populist, environmentalist, democrat. These unlikely allies are thrown together by an intriguing cast of evil doers. Dun's trademark chases are present in abundance and he has added a child to the mix, Nate. Nate brings some warmth and humor to an action packed thriller with a good romantic angle. Adventure thriller fans will love this one. An absolute must read!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a student's notes","review":"Authors explain concepts very clearly, but their examples are too easy and problems are too hard compared with the examples. As the result, you read the book, understand everything well, but have no clue how to solve 50% of the problems because authors just never mention how to deal with them. Example?

It only lasts a minute or so with each wind up, the music is entirely too loud and it's pretty boring. It's priced to high to be worth it at all. $20 would be a stretch. I gave this product two stars because it does match beautifully and is cute, but that's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not priced right","review":"This mobile is adorable but $40 is really way too much to spend on it. I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck, infact my son loves to watch it go around and around.

It's ridiculous to spend so much money on something that just looks cute and isn't useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed","review":"This mobile is great for decoration only.

I was very disappointed due to the amount paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit the crib!","review":"We love the mobile because it is cute, but it will not fit most convertible cribs because the plastic piece that attaches to the crib is too narrow! You do not get to alter the plastic piece at all, as it is molded to be one size. Therefore, my husband had to attach it to the CEILING with fishing wire. Our crib is nothing fancy, it is one that you can buy at any major retailer and is a convertible crib. The side moldings are just too wide to accomodate this mobile. The mobile should come with an adjustable mounting arm instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful mobile, very disappointing effects!!","review":"I loved the classic look of the In Flight Mobile, however I was very disappointed that the airplanes themselves get stuck as the move around.

For me, that was a lifetime ago. Whenever I play this underrated album I vividly remember those times so long ago. Trip 66 always stood out as being the musically oddest band I had ever heard. The album is all over the spectrum from a heavy rock to acoustic style coupled with the immense vocals of singer Maria. Live, they were the most intense wall of sound you ever heard. They would get onstage and just knock your head off. I had the pleasure of viewing them play live on six separate occasions and even was their roadie for a night when they played a show with Cheap Trick. Even though they have dropped off the map musically I still will never forget their music, live performances and pleasant personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cardio and sculpting workout!!!","review":"Such a great workout. I love the combination of cardio and sculpting, it makes for a fun workout that never gets boring. I love that it's 2--twenty minute workouts where if I have time I'll do both and if I don't I know I can get a great cardio and strenght training workout in just 20 minutes!!And Violet is just amazing!! positive, energetic and super supportive--she just keeps you motivated throughout the whole workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abdominal work too extensive for compromised back","review":"I bought this because of a preview included with another DVD.

This by far is one of my favorites!!!! I would consider myself advanced in the excercise field, yet I still manage to work up a sweat and feel my muscles work.

I am recommending this video to all my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout for days when you are tired","review":"I love Violet and I own a couple of her dvds. This is a fun and easy workout for days when you don't have that much anergy but still want to exercise. It is not really demanding, if you had been working out regularly for more than a month I doubt that you will find the separated sections challenging at all, however if you do both of them (it takes less than an hour) it feels like you a nice workout. It is definitely great for beginners as she really breaks things up and gives you periodic times to recover (which I truly believe are not necessary for the cardio sections are not that demanding). But as I said, when I don't have that much energy, this is the workout I turn to, you have to diversify."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners Only","review":"I bought this DVD because of the great reviews; however, it is too easy for someone at an intermediate level.

I consider myself to be in moderately good shape - I can run 4-5 miles at an 8:30 pace consistently, play soccer, work out to Jillian & Jackie videos,etc... But my heart rate was not elevated anywhere near the \\"cardio\\" zone and I was bored. I think I'm used to more aggressive instructors. Her accent is cute though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I own dozens of exercise DVDs and I am always trying to expand my library with new workout routines so that I don't plateau or get bored. I usually love cardio and weight sculpting together in one workout, but this workout was not challenging enough. I barely worked up a sweat and I wasn't even out of breath, and most likely I didn't burn squat! It was so boring that I had to stop it in the middle of the workout and return to one of my standby favorites. Also, the instructor made me feel terrible about my size, even though I am in shape. She is WAY too skinny! It's actually quite frightening to look at her. I found it distracting, not to mention discouraging. What a waste of money. Acacia makes far better workout routines than this (I recommend Strong Body Ageless Body with Erin O'Brien). Don't waste your time or money. Your body deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just average workout","review":"The thought that Violet Zaki ever had an ounce of fat on her body is implausible given her shockingly anorexic appearance. She is so thin that it distracts from the whole workout. I found the workout to be very run-of-the-mill gym fare and have been happily using Jillian Michael's workout 30-day shred with a much harder workout and finally some results. Pass on this video if you are serious about getting fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-around fantastic workout","review":"This workout is awesome. It uses both cardio and weights to create a low-to-high intensity workout. I started out doing everything Violet did, which is \\"normal\\" intensity - however, if you are not in the best shape (like myself) I would recommend doing the \\"low\\" intensity version (follow the woman on the right side of the screen) for a while and work your way up. That way you can make it through the whole 50 minutes! I also love her personality - she's not annoying and safety comes first for her, so you know you're not going to injure yourself. All-in-all this dvd is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for download: easy to follow, lots of sweat.","review":"This one works nicely as a download. There are two 20min segments with a short warm up and short cool down. Altogether, you can work out for a nice hour. You'll need a mat and some hand weights. The mat should be a sticky mat (and make sure) because your hands will be a little sweaty when you are doing planks and pushups and similar exercises and if it's not a sticky mat, you will slide around and be unable to do the exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prefer to read in actual book form.

I don't even have to think it over. This one soared above all the rest! Searles is an EXCELLENT author! He captured the feelings of the characters in this book 100% There is a scene in the book about high school. I could just picture it all out in my head and escape back to the days of high school when I read this. You feel so emotional reading about the characters in this book. The ending is So intense that you do not want to put the book down. I recommend this to everyone! My book club members all loved it! I cannot wait to read another book by him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great..but did not like ending","review":"I really liked this book alot..it was hard to put down. I kept figuring out the mysteries, but knew at the end I would be proven wrong and would have a great surprise..well..all my guesses were right. I would have given this book 5 stars, but because of the ending, I gave it 4. It ended to fast and everything was wrapped up quickly with a nice little bow. With all the drama and suspense in the book, the ending was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book","review":"I absolutely loved \\"Boy Still Missing\\" and couldn't wait to read \\"Strange But True\\". The other reviews have covered the story in depth, so I shan't repeat it again, but will add my two cents that the writing and character development are first rate. My only complaint with this book was the abrupt ending. It would have been nice if it had an epilogue chapter to wind up what happened to the main characters. For this, I almost gave it four stars, but decided the story overall was too good...so I give it 4 and 3/4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"The story was very well written. The story follows an entire family with different views and experiences after the loss of one of their own.

I didn't want to put it down--the end of each chapter made me want to continue.My only complaint is that it ended too fast. It didn't tie everything together as well as it could.But the characters were easy to relate to and feel passion for. I wouldn't mind seeing this become a movie some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to know","review":"I bought this book on a bargain rack for three dollars. After reading the book, I am baffled as to why it was on the bargain rack in the first place, and I thought that it may be the best three dollars I've ever spent.I will admit though, I was skeptical for the first fifty or so pages and I had a difficult time getting through them. But I became attached to the characters and their lives. I couldn't put the book down without knowing who the father of this baby was and what events led up to the characters' unfortunate situations they find themselves in. As the book unravels, it becomes more and more suspenseful and becomes more difficult to put down without knowing more. The twist at the end is completely unexpected but very well thought out and written. I could definitely see this book as a suspense/thriller movie, but I don't think it could ever live up to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"This is a fantastic book. John Searles did an amaizing job of writing \\"Boy Still Missing\\" and he didnt let us down on this one. \\"Strange but True\\" tells the story of Phillip Chase who returns home, after an accident, to his mother. His mother is still grieving over the loss of her other son,Ronnie. Then one day Mellisa shows up. She is 9 months pregnant with Ronnies baby. Throughout the rest of the book it tells how they over come obstacles and reach the answers to their problems. This book is funny, mysterious and poignant. It deserves two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakout!","review":"I used this product once and my entire forehead broke out into at least 50 whiteheads. I had not had a whitehead on my forehead in over 10 years at that point (I'm 33). Needless to say, I never used it again. I was using the Almay line smoothing foundation. I went to a Mary Kay party and was convinced that Mary Kay was the best so I tried it. Besides the breakout, the coverage was thick and very matte looking. The Almay's coverage is much lighter, yet covers better. This foundation is not for me! I still have the entire tube left if anybody wants it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written, dazzling read","review":"This book won't disappoint - a wonderful plot with just the right touch of mystery and a pinch of a romance. A smart read, very well written, that will leave you listening for the whisper of the unknownin Scottish winds. Just make sure you have time to read it in one or two sittings as you won't be able to find a stopping place any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very long, slow start.","review":"I could have done without most of the first half of the book. Then, as another reviewer stated I would have liked more of the ending. It just didn't tie up the loose ends. I didn't figure out the ending ahead of time, but I don't try. This is not one of those books that you go to bed thinking about the characters or that stays with you after you have finished it. Mariana was one of my all time favorite books which is why I got this one. This was a horrible disappointment, but I am going to give the author another try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mystery and love story in one.","review":"Great characters in this book and a huge dig looking for a lost Roman Legion. I enjoyed the ghostly soldier. Could almost feel the dirt beneath my fingernails. Dreamy scenery and facets of life in the rough were neat. The man who financed this expedition deserved his reward.

It took me less than 24 hours to read this book and I was sorry to see it end. Am looking forward to Ms. Kearsley's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite","review":"This the third book by Kearsley that I have read. I have read some good reviews about Shadowy Horses but for me it was a disappointment. The ghost wasn't scary enough or do enough ghostly things to keep me interested. The love story moved too slowly and the villain was not a surprise, at least to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful book","review":"Verity in on her way to Rose Hill, an archeological dig, in Eyemouth, Scotland, when she meets Davy Fortune. They are both working for Peter Quinn, who owns Rose Hill, and who hopes to find evidence of the NinthLegion. Robbie, the charming pyschic son of the housekeeper, is convincing with his conversations with The Sentinel, as he calls him, and soon Verity begins to notice unusual activity surrounding the dig.A very interesting and diverse cast of characters placed in a well written setting combine to make a wonderful read for a rainy, or sunny, afternoon. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good gothic story with a bit of humor in the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuff of legends...","review":"So many things I love wrapped up in this tale! I've always wondered what being an archaeologist might look like, and I LOVE Scotland. The ghost and supernatural aspect were a delight as well.

I love her work and could read her books all day. I love the way she develops each character to the fullest. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Suspense With Misty Echoes of the Past Thrown In","review":"\\"The Shadowy Horses\\" by Susanna Kearsley was my first book by this author, and the comparisons to Mary Stewart are wonderfully accurate. I am already ordering her other books...from me, the highest compliment. Ms. Kearsley writes in the first person, and manages to pull you right into the story, which is no small feat. Her writing style is fluid and descriptive, and she displays a talent for building suspense at just the right pace. Her characters (secondary as well) are well-drawn, likable, and interesting, and her quick-moving plot makes you want to keep turning the pages. One tiny, tiny criticism (but perhaps this is simply a result of my wanting the story to continue long after it was finished): her ending seemed rushed, and I wanted a bit more detail on the ghostly Sentinel and his tragic story, and that of the Ninth Legion...in another book, perhaps??? My final assessment: well done, Ms. Kearsley, well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very disappointed....","review":"First of all I love this author and have read all of her books. I was really excited to read this book as the plot sounded so interesting. Unfortunatley I feel very let down as the story just drags on and on. It just does not take off until will past the middle of the book. I would skip this one and if you haven't already read her other books, start with the Winter Sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book after its Kindle release but it's just not of the same quality as Susanna Kearsley's other books. I still read the whole book, of course, but compared to Winter Sea or the Rose Garden, both of which I really loved and recommend to people all the time, it just wasn't the same. I didn't find Verity's character all that interesting and her constant jumping at noises and cold spots got old pretty quick. Meanwhile the plot lacks the same time and character connections that I'm used to in Kearsley's books. Granted the Ninth Legion is interesting/mysterious, but there wasn't much depth to the historical side of the story. Overall, I didn't develop much of a stake in the current day characters or in the historical ones.I will continue to recommend the author's other books, but this one is best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadowy Horses","review":"An historical novel with a twist. I really enjoy Susanna Kearsley's writing - the mix of historical fact,spirit world and romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Mixed with Fiction","review":"History within a romance novel is always intriguing. I checked some facts which were accurate. The story captured my imagination. However, I felt the story was more a history with archeology than it was a romance. It dragged in many parts. There were not enough answers about the ghost. I feel the multiple love stories in the book could have been expanded. I also agree with other reviews that the end was anti-climatic. No, I would not recommend this book to anyone that was not an archeologist major."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Kearsley","review":"The only problem with this novel was that it ended. I wanted 50 more pages, 100, 150, forever. It was fantastic. Not only is it my new favorite Kearsley work (beating \\"The Rose Garden\\" by a small margin) but it top the list for my favorite novel ever. The way Kearsley writes, the Gothic feel mixed with historical elements and the butterflies in your stomach love stories; make me want to move to Scotland or wherever her story is set and live the life she sets up. In \\"Shadowy Horses\\" I found Verity relate-able with what I hope are similar qualities that we share and the arrangement of supporting characters were loveable and flushed out brilliantly. A winning novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't even finish the book!","review":"This book was boring from the very beginning. I have read several books that did not start out very interesting but as I kept reading they got better. I wanted to give this book a chance so I kept going, finally about three fourths of the way through the book I gave up. Nothing about this book held my interest. The characters were all boring and the subject, unless you like archeology, were extremely boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is the first time I have not finished a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not much there.","review":"I enjoyed the read but was looking forward to more info about the archeology and historical parts of the book. I was disappointed by that. Other than that, the characterizations were fairly good but still quite sterotypical and somewhat flat. The story line was very predictable. Better than many but not a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I love the author's writing style.

Their works are anything but trifles. This work, however, was all nugae. For a book about the search for the lost legion, I don't feel like I learned anything about the Roman military, or archaeology, or Latin for that matter. The plot was subsumed by the mediocre love story. The ending felt rushed, and the whole was unsatisfying. There was little character development, and the shadowy horses of the title were under used.

This game is almost a step back from its modern counterparts. It's simplistic, colorless backgrounds and characters during gameplay belong on the Gameboy's original yellow screen. Another shortcoming of this title is the gameplay control. The player's character, Luke Skywalker is made to walk extremely sloppy. Many gameplayers will find it quite difficult to maneuver Luke into a doorway or around a hazard. The screen appears to \\"jump\\" every time Luke moves in any direction, which can get quite frustrating when trying to concentrate during an important battle. The only thing that makes this game even tolerable is the story-line behind the gameplay. Hardcore Star Wars fans will enjoy playing an integral part in Luke Skywalker's training. However, gamers interested only in something fun to pass the time should buy something else-like Zelda DX or Spy Vs Spy-both are excellent little amusements."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more","review":"The box advertized it as \\"thrilling\\" but I don't consider this lousy game even worth spending time with.

Unfortunately, the first Bozo bag had a slow leak somewhere which was impossible to find, making the included patch useless. Then someone else got him the same Bozo bag for Christmas and this one seems to have lasted for now but I do have to fill 'er up every week or so just to keep it sturdy.It often doesn't bounce back, either on carpet or hardwood floors.

We have one, and just kept blowing it up every day. But it really wasn't worth it. Kids lose interest after about 5 minutes of this.I love the retro aspect of it. I had one as a kid.

I'd planned on letting me and the office pals have plenty of corporate/client frustration sessions with ol' Bozo for many a day ahead. But alas, I happened to get one that had a couple of teeny tiny rips in the nose seam. So after ~20 minutes (prior to which you spend 15 minutes blowing the lungs out of your mouth to fill it up), you have one sad looking deflated Bozo. Tried the included patch kit to fix it, but the patch just won't meld with the seam. Just leaks as if it wasn't on there. So, needless to say, I'm returning it. As always, Amazon's no-hassle return policy makes it much less frustrating than it could be. So bravo to Amazon, boo to the manufacturer who went cheap with shoddy material to make this Bozo. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a fun five minutes.","review":"My 4 year old daughter received this as a birthday present. After reading the numerous reviews online I was skeptical of its durability, for ALL the right reasons. It takes about 10 minutes of good lung time to blow up, smells of vinyl terribly and when I set it down on the carpet my daughter bopped it about 10 times and I noticed he was saggy already, upon inspection he had a hole the size of an pencil directly on the seam at the bottom by his right foot. There was no patch kit included so I attempted to glue some heavy duty clear tape to no avail. Total piece of worthless vinyl toy...save your money and buy something else.In conclusion, To much money for 3 minutes of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Education","review":"I bought this for a student of mine that has anger issues.... and needed a way to vent at home.

Tween frustrations solved by a belt in the squeaky nose. Seems well made. Takes a bit of blowing to fill him up, but he's just like Bozo was when I was a kid.

Mark was hot with black hair which added to my enjoyment. This movie shows what can happen when guys in college are let to roam free and have a good time.

Good ol' Zack from TVs \\"Saved By the Bell\\" is going to fail all his classes unless his roomate commits suicide. Sounds silly, but the college has a rule about such things. One problem. Where to find such a roomate who wants to kill himself? Lots of sophomoric laughs (ala \\"American Pie\\") and a great deal of dark comedy twist around each other in this college tale. Think of it as \\"Saved By the Bell: The College Years\\" if it were written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and was on Fox. Great comedy that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will keep you laughing even after it's over!","review":"I give this movie an A+.

If it hadn't been for the main wakko guy in there, can't even remember the characters name, I don't think I would have lasted through the whole movie. The whole idea of finding a roomie to kill themselves so the two main roomies could get easy A's was funny but other than that, that was about it. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for this paticular movie when I rented it but I seriously doubt it. You're gonna have to rent it yourself to come up with your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really thought this movie was pretty bad.","review":"When I first saw this movie I thought it would be worth renting you know.

It just wasn't worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I thought this was going to be a funny movie with an interesting plot, but I was dead wrong. The funniest scenes were shown in the movie trailor and the rest of this movie drug along until it was mercifully over.The plot was different- if your roommate commits suicide, you get straight A's- the problem was the bad acting and the bringing out of old, lame college jokes (crazy frat boys, ... smoking, drinking and chasing women).This movie had potential but fell way short of what it could have been. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie is a complete waste of time. Everything that is funny was shown in the preview.

If you have so many problems with Islam, why do you follow it?Muslim women have, can and will do great things; nudity is not eqvalent to liberation.

I recommend the readers to read the following book \\"Beyond veil and holy war\\" by Ahmed Saleem. It gives a more accurate understanding of Islam and its image.

However, throughout the book, she should've been a little more careful in choosing or in the labeling of her subject matter.I would agree, again in general terms, that MUSLIMS need to reform, or rethink how they apply, adopt, etc. Islam. But reforming ISLAM does not make much sense.I can't emphasize this point enough. The confusion of the two terminologies blurrs all the arguments, both good and bad, and makes this book a non-worthwhile diary to read.

But still I felt that the author wanted to say much more than that. The fear was also apparent despite her guts. I admire her ability to point out the trouble with Islam. But I have to disagree with her that the trouble with Islam is not \\"TODAY\\". The trouble with Islam started since the death of the prophet and the religion was lost since then. If she herself points out that there are a lot of contrary verses in Quran, and the questioning tradition (hadeath) which was gathered 200 years after the prophet's death, now what does she suggests? Take what you like and discard what you don't? You might as well design your religion...

I went to her website and downloaded the Urdu version of her book. I wanted to buy the english version but after reading the first few pages in the Urdu translation, I changed my mind.To be a muslim means \\"to submit\\". If one finds it difficult to submit to a religion with a set of morals and rules then pursue other choices, don't blame the religion. For instance, the Quran is clearly against homosexuality.

IT HAS BECOME A FASION FOR MOST OF THE IGNORANT PEOPLE TO WRITE ON SUCH TOPICS TO IGNITE THE FIRE. SHE IS UPSET WITH HER LIFE AND IS BLAMING ON HER RELIGION THAT SHE HARDLY PRACTICES. SHE REALLY NEEDS A GOOD PSYCHIARIST FOR HERSELF. I PERSONALLY RESPECT EVERY RELIGION IN THE WORLD AND NO ONE GIVES US ANY RIGHT TO CRITICISE ANY RELIGION AS WE ALL KNOW EVERY FAITH HAS SOME DEFICIENCIES IN IT.

She feels that every Muslim is blameworthy as her father, who was a merciless man. She is very successful in describing her bitter childhood whereas throughout the book Ms.Manji kept on hurling venom on the beauty of Islamic culture and its 1.2 billion Muslim adherents. With lack of Islamic scholarship, she has failed to convince her readers, Muslims or non-Muslims. It is inappropriate for Irshad Manji to relate her unpleasant childhood experiences with today's condition especially in the Muslim world.

Overall, I believe this book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"I couldn't put it down. Manji writes engagingly and with energy about a topic that she has clearly thought long and hard about. I'm sure she'd be the first to admit she's no scholar, but there's no doubt she's spent time with the Koran, reading and genuinely trying to understand it. Her views are her own---and heartfelt.She believes that reforms within Islam are necessary, and some will therefore dismiss her as an \\"Islam/Muslim basher.\\" But she points to many serious problems and has the courage to suggest some possible solutions. Why not read her book with an open mind and decide for yourself what her ideas are worth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I enjoyed this book, and found it enlightening, although I disagree on some parts with how she defends Islam. Another book, ISLAM ELEVATES WOMEN: Unveiling the Myth, by Jasmine Layne was good and showed that the ideas of how women are oppressed are actually right out of the KORAN. I'd recommend both these books to anyone interested in learning why Islam is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"As an author myself, I recommend that you purchase this book for personal study. \\"Trouble with Islam\\" is an excellent read, that leans towards the progression of women regaining equal power after the past centuries of female suppression. The disturbing elements of fanaticism are very well documented from the perspective of a Muslim. She didn't learn about the incursion of Islam for part od the deterioration of Africa from around 4000bc.

Instead she alienates her intended audience (Muslims), not by posing tough questions about the crisis our religion is facing, but by making a mockery of our core beliefs (the Quran and Muhammad PBUH). Manji's intense and raw distaste of Islam is so clearly laid out in the pages of her book that I wonder if a reform will be sufficient and if there will be anything recognizable left of the religion after she is through reforming it. To all the non-Muslims that read this book and proclaim it brilliant because Manji calls for Islam's reform, I say: the real problem is not Islam, it is MUSLIMS, Muslims who interpret Islam as they see fit and try to use it as justification for their own whims (terrorism case in point). It is unfortunate that instead of providing us with guidance to truly help us, Manji strives to enrage us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salman Rushdie Wannabe","review":"Lame attempt to ride on the \\"Islam Bashing\\" bandwagon.

I feel sorry for all her childhood disturbances with a violent father and a submissive mother, but instead of blaming her identity crisis on Islam (just because she was born a Muslim) why does not she go to therapy instead? This book is a clear supporter of the Anti-Muslim campaign in the Western World, no wonder Manji loves to defend the powerful Jewish Community. What a disappointment! Manji has trouble with her faith, her ethnicity and her sexuality. People from all religions have the right to question them, but if she is so ignorantly perplexed about Islam, why does not she convert to something else? Islam is never forced on anybody, and by now she should know it. Also, how could anybody trust a Muslim who dares to speak so badly about her own family? That just shows her rotten spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"where all this anger is coming from","review":"I wanted to read this book, just to see what's up with this women.

My point is that she is free to write about what ever she wants.I belive that everyone knows about the stories from saudia arabia, but to claim that Israel is a democrecey, while overlooking the fact that Israel impresion 3 million palastenians is kind strange. you wonder who published this book. this is a good book for people who are ignorants about Isalm, the middle east and the world in general.

To me the criteria of a scholar is the one who has a PHD in Islamic studies and written more then hundred books on various Islamic subjects. She will certainly get helped.She is angry and in search of truth. Before writing anything about Israeli and Palestinian conflict she would have lived at least 3 months in Palestine and interviewed the families of suicide bomber and ask them why they become so, what are their sufferings and why they feel proud to have one, and those Israeli families who lost their love ones and how they want to end this conflict.She should also ask herself a very simple question that ?

She makes false claims about the koran and islam which will certainly give comfort to the islamphobes and the fundamentalist evangelist christians, many of them have been lavishing her book here with 'stars'.If anyone is sincerely interested to read about a woman's perspective of islam from inside then my advice is to read any books by Fatima Mernissi, a well known woman Muslim scholar with real knowledge of the subject or read the book by Leila Ahmed's 'women and gender in islam'."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"I bought this book because I saw this lady on TV and I though what an interesting person.

The people who call themselves Muslims and donot follow the true teachings need to change. They need to know their religion more fully and understand it fully as well. They need to stop listening to false views projected by the so-called scholars of the day , many of them who are extremists.

Others, I didn't like as much, but I feel that that is to be expected with any book of poetry; some poems will speak to you others will not. The formatting was good, you can flip between poems easily because each poem is set up as a chapter which is really convenient. Also, the spelling and grammer were pretty good. The poems ranged in length some were short and others were longer. I would recommend this to anyone as Wordsworth is pretty easy to read and enjoyable.

If you're like me, and interested in the \\"self\\" and \\"reality\\" you will be floored by this book. It's not a definitive book but it leads you down the rabbit hole. Since, I've read his tome of a book Sex, Ecology, and Spirituality and many other smaller books. Ken has a way of connecting a plethora of philosophies. I appreciate his approach. I am a Christian, so I do not align with his initial end, but have learned so much about all things through him. Imagine, a way to look at all things at all levels.

Amazon's blurb says it is from a live performance, but you wouldn't necessarily know that -- I didn't -- from listening to it. I have not heard Amazon's first choice, but I struggle to imagine that it would be a significant improvement over this performance. Minkowski's tempi seem entirely reasonable, and aggressive is not the word I would use. Minkowski's control over orchestral dynamics is extraordinary. Non-musicians often don't know that playing softly is often a lot harder than being loud. The concluding duet of Cleopatra and Caesar at the end of Act 1 is extraordinary. The singers and the orchestra achieve ethereal pianissimos of great technical skill and emotional communication.Overall, it's a splendid Giulio Cesare that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"David E.

Not only was the production superb, but the casting of Helen Mirren and James Cromwell was inspired. Not be overlooked should be Michael Sheen as Tony Blair - he captured the essence of the public servant who understood the grief of the masses and tried to communicate this to the royals. Altogether a picture to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really that good?","review":"I hate to break it. But i don't get what's all the fuss about this movie. Yes Helen Mirren gives an amazing performance as Queen Elisabeth II but thats pretty much it. The movie itself is pretty boring. Best director? There really wasn't that much going on. Doesn't mean that the movie is based on true events means it HAS to be a good movie automatically. C'mon. Thank god this movie was short movie, cause if it had ran over 120min i'd probab walk out or fall asleep. All the acting were only 'reactions', The ending was satisfying with a little foreshadowing if anyone picked up on it. Overall.

(BTW, I think Meryl Streep got robbed of another Oscar). The Queen's character is flat and one-dimensional and as the viewer, one cares nothing about her so-called internal struggles.The cinematography was nothing special, the score was practically nonexistent and definitely forgetable, and the MTV-like connecting of real television images and the actors was not a smooth and seamless presentation.And then there's the story itself....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.I'd skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, glorified TV-movie of the week","review":"To be sure, the performances are all high-caliber (although Judi Dench was ROBBED of an Oscar). But really, who cares about this? I really hoped this would have been a deeper character study of the life of \\"The Queen\\", but instead all you get is a sliver as it relates to the death of Diana. I sat in a theater thinking, \\"Is this IT?\\". This is nothing but an A&E-type channel docudrama with higher production values. How it ascended to the level of \\"respectability\\" it has boggles the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible DVD!","review":"If the DVD sold here is like the DVDs sold elsewhere, there is some clever trick done to prevent the purchaser from backing up the DVD using some of the existing DVD ripping software that is out there. I suspect they intentionally degrade the quality of the disc such that it cannot be read bit-by-bit by ripping software. You probably don't care about backing up the DVD, given the questionable legality of it, but the problem is that the way they do this renders the DVD unplayable on many players. It would not play on mine, and I thought my player was broken, and went out and bought another. Had I searched on the net first, I would've found out about this sorry piece of anti-consumer engineering and saved myself a lot of trouble.So, I hope you'll reconsider your purchase both in protest of this practice, and because there's a fair chance the movie won't play for you.

The fictional parts are subtle, the documentary moments are woven into the movie expertly. Acting, writing, direction, photography...kudos to all. Former Princess Diana dies tragically, the British royal family underestimates how fondly the world had accepted her, and the resulting political and personal stress is frustrating to everyone concerned. Compromise, hypocrisy, generational clashes and the crudities and cruelties of our current culture are all touched upon by superb actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a Dull Moment","review":"Before I looked at the lowest ratings, I knew that most of those rating it that way would say this movie was boring. Why? Because it is not a fast-paced, in-your-face, thrill-a-minute movie. But I didn't find it slow or boring. I thought it was an absolutely fascinating look behind the scenes of how the royals think and act. Was it accurate? Who knows, since they live in such a private, sheltered world? But it certainly was convincing. The Oscar for Helen Mirren's performance was well deserved, but all the characters were convincing. Very well cast movie. I have watched it twice all the way through and two more times partially. No, there is nothing complex here and no great plot. Just a really good depiction of how events may have unfolded. After a while you forget you are watching a movie and it almost seems like a behind the scenes peek at the monarchy.

Helen Mirren is an exceptionally great actress and I enjoyed seeing her perform this part. I did not enjoy how much the writer and director left out the fact that the Queen has a sense of humor and enjoys a good laugh. The Queen is a well rounded human being and in this portrayal of her she is depicted as a straight faced, sometimes harsh, woman who cares more for animals than people. A little bit of tenderness would have gone a long way to make this a much more enjoyable experience. That being said I cannot fault the portions of the film that show the palace and castles as a back drop to the story of a woman who has dedicated her life to her people and done an excellent job of it. I have a feeling that the writers' and produces' depiction of Elizabeth is their feelings and not the full measure of Elizabeth.J B-J"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Liked It!!!","review":"Watched this movie with family members, young and old, who thought it would be \\"boring and dumb\\".

Still, the subject matter still has some feel of tabloid sensationalism, with its dramatization of political scrambling in the aftermath of the shocking death of Diana, Princess of Wales.No one the movie seems to care about the tragedy itself - only how to secure their personal positions in the eyes of the public. There was no real grief for Diana, and that is indescribably sad.The best thing about \\"The Queen\\" goes back to what Ms. Mirren said in her Oscar acceptance speech: that Elizabeth Windsor has weathered so many storms in her 50-plus years on the throne. The movie certainly does justice to Her Majesty's indomitable strength, and the legacy that she is leaving for history."},{"rating":"2","title":"nuanced humane portrait of a queen","review":"i found this movie particularly engaging as i lived in london when princess diana died. at the time of diana's death -- as an american -- it was intensely moving and fascinating to not only sift thru our own feelings but to watch a country work thru its feelings toward an exceptional and unconventional princess and the royalty.few actresses could portray the queen with the subtlety and humanity helen mirren brings to the role. equally good is the young british actor who plays tony blair as he seeks to bridge the gap between an isolated queen and her people. overall, a sad, engrossing and occasionally even funny look at this chapter in the history of the british royalty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen - DVD","review":"The movie The Queen, starring Helen Mirren is a very good film, and those who like historical period pieces, and also documentaries, should like this film.The Queen takes place after the election of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the days leading up to and immediately following the death of Princess Diana.The movie basically gives us a behind-the-scenes view of the royal family at this time. It does this by intercutting archival video footage with the actors to enable you to follow the story, and give you some sense of why the family reacted the way they did.Some people say that this movie was more sympathetic to Queen Elizabeth II. However, I believe that this is just a balanced telling of the story, the director wished to tell. I believe no judgments can be made. This movie was another showcase for Helen Mirren, and she deserved the Oscar that she won."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I had not had the opportunity to see this movie when it was in the theatres.

I came away feeling pity for Elizabeth II in her position although she is far better off in the world than I am. It portrayed a difference in personal freedoms, and as someone once told me with knowledge comes responsibility.I have only been aquainted with Mirren's movies in the past two years. I think she is superb as the Queen, she nailed this one all the way. She had me convinced she really was the Queen and I must mention Cromwell. I have been watching this man for a lot of years and he is such a gifted actor. It is pure pleasure watching him on the screen. His roles always seem perfectly suited to him.

Good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Woman Upstages Living Woman","review":"Couldn't help but notice how the movie kept flashing back to Diana who is DEAD, but that's to keep the audience from fully falling asleep.British Royalty, being the parasites that they are, are completely boring! If no one would pay to come to England to see them, they'd have been phased out last century as the deadwood that they are. They are to be pitied. No jobs, nothing to do all day but go to openings of this or that. Poor Charles even got kicked off his polo ponies because Mumsy thought it was too dangerous.I haven't watched this movie in one sitting. Too boring. This is one where you watch it in shifts, if I finish it at all. Helen Mirren did an OK job, but frankly, Elizabeth is very easy to impersonate and many others have done this before Helen. Think of the stupid Naked Gun movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"A politically correct (and therefore tasteless) look at the British Crown.It is very disrespectful of the monarchy and the Royal Family, and early on plays up the death of Diana (who was a failure as a wife, mother, and human being).

I was surprised at the lack of humanity for Dianna! She was a beautiful person, who deserved a lot more recognition and respect! She was ostracized because she was not cold and indifferent like the rest. She was looked down on because she reached out to others and was not afraid to be human. She was a ray of sunshine in a drab grey existence! And this movie centered around a stuffy arrogant spoiled rich brat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting yet boring","review":"While the movie certainly has it's interesting points, the majority of the movie is slow and dragged out well beyond the ammount of content in the movie.While there are some interesting things in the movie it is scattered and they seemed to pull in random facts or points of interest in to the movie to fill the 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most intimate look at the English royal family I have encountered","review":"It would be fair to say that I am not terribly interested in the English royal family and their follies in spite of living here. Having my own Queen and little time for gossip, it does not interest me sufficiently to pursue knowledge about them.But I must admit that this was a super film. The insight that it affords into the workings of the royals, and people in general, the way they deal with things, their relationships with their own and others really fascinated me. It is such a different world, a different experience to anyone and anything else out there, yet in some ways I felt I could still connect with at least some of the characters on a human level. Additionally, it brought back some memories of that beautiful hot summer of '97.A must see, but keep in mind, the English royal family is not England, and not representative of its people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen","review":"This is an exceptional film.

Too bad they wouldn't allow Unlawful Killing, the documentary about Diana's death to be shown in the US, but then, what would you expect? Just keep slurping up the royal swill, Americans, and don't listen to any of those nasty facts about how they murdered Diana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really the queen","review":"While I had heard about this movie and all the hype associated with it, I bought it without reading the description on the back first. I mistakenly and maybe ignorantly thought that this was a movie about Queen Elizabeth's life, but it turned out I was very wrong. I had a very hard time sitting through the whole thing, and while some of the actors undoubtedly put on a great performance, I found this a very boring film. Had I known this was just about Diana's death and the resulting events concerning the Royal family, I would never have bought it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen not a good movie","review":"This was not a story about the queen. It was a story about the death of Diana with a view toward how Tony Blair and the Royal Family may have behaved when Diana died. The acting of the part of Tony Blair was disappointing, the actor playing himself, not Tony Blair, with a repeat performance of his personality as Frost in Nixon/Frost. It appeared to me as if there had been no research into the true personalities of the Queen or of Blair before the filming of the movie. Neither portrayal was credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the acting, not the movie as a whole.","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and was very pleased with it. The movie itself does have a tendency to extrapolate too much of what really went on \\"behind the scenes\\" so to speak that week following Diana's death. The real thing to pay attention to is the acting in this movie. Helen Mirren did an incredible job with this performance. I am looking forward to the release of this film on DVD so I can go back and pay attention to rest of the cast and the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, Witty, and Insightful!","review":"\\"The Queen\\" begins with the newly elected P.M. Tony Blair considering his approach to the monarchy amidst calls for its elimination; meanwhile, the Royal Family (Queen included) continue in their aloof manner and somewhat snobby manner.Then comes the death of Princess Diana - the populace react with an outpouring of grief, while the Royal Family remains stoic amidst their well-known resentment of her divorce and subsequent behavior. The result is a dangerous loss of support for the monarchy.Tony Blair takes the initiative and steadily and skillfully prods the Queen towards a public demonstration of grief, and she finally complies - bringing the Queen and the people closer together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Movie","review":"Interesting movie - it tells the story of which no one could possibly know was happening to the Royal Family directly after Princess Diana's death. The British invented the tabloid press they say - and the death of Diana was certainly no exception.Helen Mirren is great as the Queen herself. Because the movie looks at the inside family drama, you see the Queen as a real person; sadness, irritations, quiet, and occasionally cracking a joke (very occasionally!).Very informative too about the relationship with the Prime Minister Tony Blair. I liked seeing how their different perspectives on the media came together and shaped each of them in a new way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Wanted Or Expected","review":"I did expect a portion of the show to deal with Princess Diana. I was hoping to learn more about the Queen's legacy and her life story.This movie is for the Diana loving devoted multitude and perhaps the conspiracy theorists.Tea anyone? No thanks, cappuccino please"},{"rating":"1","title":"A grand movie!","review":"I certainly understand why this film won Academy Awards - very well-deserved! Helen Mirren conveys more with her facial expressions than most people can with words and gestures. It was a wonderful characterization of Queen Elizabeth II facing an unprecedented situation (Princess Diana's death) and how she coped with and handled her own emotions, the royal family, and the nation. I've watched it several times and expect to uncover even more levels each time I see the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The queen","review":"The movie itself was quite good. Helen Mirren is outstanding, as usual. However, I am rating an \\"item\\"; the blu-ray disk that I received (and viewed after 30 days, so I cannot return it) has \\"skips\\" towards the end.

Which part of the human psyche yearns to cry in great crowds? Is it the hanky sharing? The flowers? The Elton John tributes? Its a mystery. But one thing is certain, we should quit it. If we manage to quell this impulse, and learn to blubber like infants in the privacy of our own homes, maybe we could hold our heads a little higher, and boring movies that debase the population would no longer be made.Sure, What's-Her-Face does a fine job playing a grey old woman who stands around saying things, but is that enough? Actually, if you want to get political, \\"The Queen\\" is pure propaganda. Yet another film industry attempt to simultaneously humanize and glorify our magnificent leaders.

Most of the scenes take place inside Buckingham Palace and at the queen's Scottish estate Balmoral. This docudrama begins just days before Diana's fatal car crash in 1997. The princess is seen only in television news clips and photographs as the film remains fixed on Elizabeth and her relationship with the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair. Helen Mirren's performance as Elizabeth is so subtle and fine it is easy to overlook its greatness. The film\`s best quality is that it tells this bit of familiar history in such a way as to present no villains or victims. Instead we are given a greater understanding of each person involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Them From Themselves","review":"No wonder Helen Mirren won the best actress award. She was absolutely marvelous. This movie takes place the during the week of Princess Diana's death. The movie depicts the behind the scenes wrangling between the royal family and Tony Blair in how the family was going to handle the funeral of the People's Princess versus the fact that she was no longer a royal. How much influence Blair had and how torn the queen was between duty and being a grandmother. I hope that Queen Elizabeth had as much compassion as the film depicted, but I have a new dislike for Prince Phillip - what a jerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Bad Gregg Allman Album","review":"This Is A Good Return For Gregg Allman, The First Album In 9 Years.

This is because I played soccer for the old Attari, which is at least 15 years old, and the graphics were just as good, only the gameplay was more realistic. this game is simple. One guy gets the ball, another guy runs into him, he falls down, end of play. Without lighting it's impissible to see anything. Also, Some things aren't realistic like 80 yard punts. Worst of all, there are no levels. I've played games and even with the worst rated teams, which by the way all of the teams are just as good, all of the games I creamed the other team by over 50 points.

Having practiced MMA on a much more amature level, I can say that the techniques contained in it are both effective and basic.

The story of his life is interesting but he seems to overstate many aspects of his life and fighting carreer. His stories are at times not believable and he makes excuses for every fight he has ever lost. Using excuses such as being hung over, bum leg, took fight too soon, other guy on pain drugs etc., Ken comes off as a sore loser quite often. Regardless of his padding his own stories, it is interesting none the less.The second part of the book is on fighting techniques. This section is well illustrated and worth the price on it's own.

If that's not enough, instead of having a great computer-generated picture on the cover, it instead looks like a drawing.Then we get into the story itself. It didn't have any of the things that made me like the previous Strange Matter books.

Alexis Weissenberg once said that Tchaikovsky's First Concerto is easy to play. However, it takes a true musician to express it musically and understand the music Maturely! Lang Lang is young. I am sure he has lots of time to develop his interpretation skills. But this CD is not the definite Tchaikovsky.

DG is trying to make money of a bogus guy.Sound is no good when playing by CSO under outgoing Barenboim is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sublime Performance","review":"OK. Who hasn't heard Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 by any number of great pianists assisted by great conductors? The melding of Lang Lang and Barenboim is unbelievably beautiful. Maybe it took a conductor who is also a pianist to understand the interpretation Lang Lang chose. I don't know, and in the end, I don't even care. Sometimes, the stars align and a moment in time becomes sublime. Lang Lang plays this concerto evoking images that awaken the listener to a deeper level. The pace is slowed and you are allowed to hear greater detail of passages most pianists have rushed through as though their life depended on a quick finish. Yes, this is Tchaikovsky at his heart-beating best, heavy with emotion and quick as the brain scampers over a lifetime of images. Just buy it. Listen to no one who gives this a rating less than a perfect 5. Go with your heart. That's what Lang Lang and Barenboim did, and I am all the happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"When I first bought the album with great expectation, I cannot get through the first 5 minutes while going to airport. I am so frustrated and stop the disc and change it to Horowitz' recording of the same. I even thining of throwing the album away. I find that the reason to keep is the good sound delivered by CSO."},{"rating":"1","title":"EFMendelson","review":"Quite possibly the most pedantic and uninspired performances of the Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky concerti you could find. In the right hands, the opening movement of the Mendelssohn G Minor (e.g. as played by Rudolf Serkin or Murray Perahia) is one of the most exciting of all the romantic piano concertos. Unfortunately, as played by Lang Lang it devolves into a slipshod exercise of mediocrity. Lang's phrasings in the opening passages of the first movement are atrocious. I would have thought it an impossibility to eliminate the propulsive tension Mendelssohn created with this work but Lang Lang proves otherwise. The 2nd and 3rd movements suffer a similar mauling. As for the Tchaikovsky 1st, you can probably hear a better performance by the average senior piano major at your local state college and it won't cost you as much as this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Tchaikovsky","review":"I completely agree with one of the earlier reviewers, this definently has to be one of the worst interpretation of the Tchaikovsky concerto no. 1 I have ever heard. Lang Lang doesn't have deep insight into the piece. His interpretation is cold hearted with a lot of student-like phrasing which makes him sound very immature. The Mendelssohn does suit him a little better, but I would reccomend other recordings for both concerti. I do agree with the other reviewers that the orchestra is really very good here. I would recommend not spending your money here when there are many greater Tchaikovsky concerto no. 1 recordings such as Argerich, Cliburn, Horowitz, Gilels, Rubinstein, definently not this one. For the Mendelssohn I would reccomend either Perahia or Serkin."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is a wonderful rendition. No modern pianists wish to play these pieces, because most do not have the talent or insight to give a feeling of freshness. Lang Lang uplifts these concertos and shows why they are old favorites. A little heavy on the foot work, but otherwise superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Tchaikovsky 1st ever!!!!!!!!","review":"In his recording of Tchaikovsky 1st, Mr. Lang seems to have misunderstood the difference between playing musically and playing sentimentally. There is almost no phrasing in his interpretation that has got sense. All he tries to do is \\"improvising\\", which is obviously very sad for the composer. Also, in many places (particularly in the 1st movement), Mr. Lang doesn't respect the text at all - the basis!!-. Playing differently for the sake of playing differently or for some kind of excitement is always very disappointing. I strongly advise Volodos' recent version of the Tchaikovsky (with Ozawa and the BPO) instead, which is FAR better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturing","review":"Just finished listening to Live From Lincoln Center the New York Philharmonic's New Year's Eve program With Lang Lang in an all-Tchaikovsky program featuring Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. Absolutely thrilling, with everyone at the top of their game. While I understand some of the critical gloss on Lang Lang, who can be annoying and mannered, the current edition going into 2011 is extraordinary. A masterful artist, but more to the point, a musical charismatic equal to the material. The gulf between a great critic and a great pianist is large, and great critics are more rare. Trust your ears. The only reason I wouldn't recommend an early performance of these concerti is because he gets better every year. Find the most recent possible and follow this star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with great design ideas","review":"This book has great ideas for Japanese inspired homes.

Toy Story 1 on Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis were excellent. Toy Story 2 is not. The graphics are somewhat detailed but kind of blurry. That's ok because gameplay makes a great game not graphics. The gameplay is where everything goes wrong. You see, the run and jump buttons are both the same button meaning you have to hold down the button to run but if you let go Buzz jumps. This will cause you to loose many lives very easily and get you fusturated. If you want a good platform game for Gameboy Color, Tarzan is much better with better graphics, control and a unique hide and go seek mode as well as the ability to use the Game Boy Printer to print out Tarzan Stickers."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets boring quickly","review":"This is an okay game but there's only four levels. Which gets really boring because you finish all the levels and then that's the end of your game. It also gets really annoying because you have to hold down both buttons to run and only one to jump, so a lot of times you jump when you don't want to and lose lives. There are a lot of funner and more complex games with more to do out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been done alot better","review":"The game I feel should be alot better then what they put out.

I am posting this review so anyone who buys it knows that one good way to approach it is to pick the exercises that you need to improve your playing. You don't necessarily need to start from page one and work your way through to end, and you definitely don't need to do every exercise in this book.

The CD is just about worthless, and makes a very good frisbee. The questions are somewhat pathetic and the diagrams suck. But the book also has a coupla good practice exams at the end of the book. Go over those, and you'll be fine. If you have networking experience already this is a good book to get.

The included CD was questionable.My test was 30 questions, non-adaptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrown together!","review":"This book seems to be thrown together in a hurry.

In order to do this work out you need to be an expert. She gives no directions just goes from move to move without even describing what she's doing, some of the moves are her own. It is a very fast paced work out not at all what I expect from pilates. Also this work out is ONLY for those who are working on their abs! Most of the moves are just various advanced forms of sit-ups or crunches. The 16 page booklet is more like a magazine exert with no info and just a few recipes.

Well after I had my second son I couldn't think of a better work out so I searched and searched untill I found it here on amazon. I have been doing it for about 4 months now and I still love it!

I have several exercise videos and when things get more complex or difficult there's always an alternative instruction. It doesn't feel at all researched, instructors usually appreciate that their clients aren't all at the same level of fitness or ability.I also feel that usually instructors switch between the areas going from legs, tums, arms etc, doing so makes the exercise more bearable.

I am NOT a film buff and usually have little patience to get through a 90 min film but this six or nine hour saga (depending on whether you get the original or the expanded collector's edition) is well worth watching again and again. The film brought to life the Gospel message without preaching nor overly simple scripting. The script writing, acting and directing are all top quality. This film series should be watched, shared, pondered and rewatched as much as the Book itself. The Gospel message as presesnted in this film will speak to both evangelical, conservative and liberal Christians alike. It cuts right thru to the core and brings the resurrected Christ of the first century right into imminence.

Buy cowboy music instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissapointment","review":"To tell you the truth, Yoot Tower was a big disspointment to me. I loved SimTower to death, and I was excited for months that followed the release of Yoot Tower. I've build many many SimTowers, and just recently achieved the Tower rating in SimTower.The box for Yoot Tower excited me even more. I loved the idea of being able to build in different locations. But, what I could build was my problem.I don't have a lot of very picky reaons why I don't like this game (like how the regular elevators are limited to 15 floors...) but the problem is with the game as a whole. Ovbiously, when it went from Maxis to Sega, it changed a lot. It changed the entire SimTower theme that I really loved. And unfortuniently, that was for the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"awkward ear pieces, clicking sounds","review":"The only good thing about this headset is that it has a 2.5 connector without needing an adapter. It comes with 3 sizes of strangely shaped rubbery ear piece covers - all of them are way too big to fit in my ear without popping out constantly. The directions say to twist them in to your ear, but they won't go into my ear far enough to even twist. It also comes with 2 thin foam covers that you can use instead of the weird rubbery ear piece covers. But the foam covers are so loose that they keep falling off the ear piece. When I try to use the ear piece without any cover, it is scratchy against the skin. The worst part is that the ear piece continually makes a loud click-click-click in my ear as I carry on a conversation. This headset, unfortunately, will be going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"VOLUME 22 OF INUYASHA","review":"INCLUDED IN THIS INUYASHA DVD ARE THE FOLLOWING EPISODES:EPISODE 64 - GIANT OGRE OF THE FORBIDDEN TOWEREPISODE 65 - FAREWELL DAYS OF MY YOUTH!EPISODE 66 - NARAKU'S BARRIER--KAGURA'S DECISIONOVERALL SOME GREAT EPISODES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It also has an easter egg","review":"I loved it, and I noticed it has an easter egg.if you go th the special features menu and highlight the \\"New Opening Song\\" the press the left button on your remote, an image of the tetsusaiga will be hightighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Make sure you check the dates of any videos you order.

In fact you know he is not acting. Supporting actors are all fascinating and talented.This is not time filler fluff--it is five stars exceptional.Just started season 2 DVD--starts with typical unexpected direction.BBC really nailed this character and this series.

Thank you writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I watched Luther on BBC America and I couldn't get enough of this smart, mystery, thriller mini series. I had to purchase the DVD and watch it with my family and friends. They loved it. We were so engaged that we couldn't stop watching all 6 hours of it contionuosly. If you love detective thrillers and mysteries, then you must get Luther. I love it! The acting is so amazingly great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idris Elba is great but story is cliche-ridden","review":"MINOR SPOILERSThe only reason I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because Idris Elba brings the wonderful intensity and intelligence he had in The Wire as Stringer Bell to this character. However, this series is a barrage of detective cliches that the actor (and the other fine actors) simply cannot elevate. There's the character of Luther, a loose cannon who can be tough and yet is smart and sensitive. Of course there is a scene with police superiors worried about Luther constantly breaking the rules, of course he has an estranged wife with a wimpy boyfriend, of course there's an attractive psychopath who both taunts and tries to seduce him, of course there is a killer who Luther can make break down in tears when confronted with Daddy issues.

Entertaining, informative, just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few laughs, fascintating not","review":"I read this one after finding it mentioned in Bill Bryson's Made in America. Since the former isn't very interesting, it's no surprise that this one isn't either. If you want chatty anecdotes about the inventors and their madness, this is for you. If you want to see how inventors have really made an impact on the twentieth century and living standards, then you'll have to dig a bit harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly readable and entertaining","review":"This is a wonderful little history of inventions book. The writing is in a very reader-friendly style, and even slow readers (like me) will probably breeze through this book in no time. The author does a great job of choosing the most interesting inventions and stories to delve into. The only criticism I have is that the level of detail is often not very deep, i.e. there is typically more indepth coverage found on History Channel documentaries. In fairness though, the book provides a fast, interesting and enjoyable read, and it is likely that more detail would have detracted from those features. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of technology and invention."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No quotation in his book should be assumed to be accurate...\\" if you want facts (vs opinion) don't waste your time on this","review":"The scholar whose work on the Holocaust was the \\"stimulus\\" for this volume, University of Chicago professor Peter Novick, warned that: \\"No facts alleged by Finkelstein should be assumed to be really facts, no quotation in his book should be assumed to be accurate, without taking the time to carefully compare his claims with the sources he cites. . . .[S]uch an examination reveals that many of those assertions are pure invention.\\" (WSJ, May 4, 2007; \\"Finkelstein's Bigotry,\\" page A15)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Industry of denial","review":"This is only fuel to people that already have no simpaty for the jews.

Theres plenty of documentation about it. The guy was bad and thats a fact and his actions paved the impossibility of peace at his time. Denying it doesn't help the Arabs now.This book is bad, full of distorted, or simply incorrect facts, it leads to wrong conclusions, it is used as argument by all sorts of anti-semite radicals. I would give less than a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about exploitation? And the book is not?","review":"Finkelstein, in writing this book obviously is exploiting the Holocaust to sell a book. He is not giving it away as a matter of public conscience raising is he?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing shakedown by shady characters","review":"When you read about this 10 years later, things fall into perspective. Major shakedown artist Melvyn Weiss is debarred and possibly in jail because of his fraudulent class-action suits shaking down NASDAQ companies. Bronfman's business empire seems to have fallen apart due to his bad investments. Congratulations to Finkelstein for seeing through these frauds and having the courage to say as much.It is a well detailed book. I am glad to see it written by the son of Holocaust survivors for two reasons. First of all, Finkelstein cannot be accused of anti-Semitism. Secondly, he has an entrée that other writers might not enjoy. An extremely interesting book for a Gentile to read. One must always stand in awe of Jewish intelligence, but Jewish ethics are another question. Finkelstein calls this one right."},{"rating":"2","title":"What We Are","review":"So much of literature carefully documents and reminds us of what a complicated cesspool we are unwillingly born into. No matter if literature examines the individual or the family or history it is no accident that the findings are most often bleak because life is terribly bleak. This book pointedly reminds me of the inevitable corruption of all institutions. But what is a man to do to escape this cesspool? I don't know of any ship that is sea worthy enough to carry us safely through the turbulent seas of our existence. At bottom must everything be cheap and unworthy and specious? What can we hold on to when there is no God or Government or Country worthy of our trust? I don't know. To tell the truth all that is left, that is if you are lucky, is your family. They alone can provide the comfort you crave and assit you to get through this terrible mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A discussion that needs to be heard","review":"It is not unexpected or unique that America's most successful ethnic group would capitalize on a past tragedy. Finkelstein makes an important distinction: the holocaust industry is the ideological representation of Hitler's judeocide; not the historical attempt at genocide.There is no dearth of bloodbaths in recorded history; especially in the past 100 years. Why is this one so prominent? Why do we keep hearing about what Hitler did to the Jews? There were 45-55 million casualties during the second World War. What about the Romani? The Catholic Poles? Try to find a book on the ten million who were murdered in the Belgian Congo 1890-1911.The holocaust and Israel receive unparalleled attention in our nation's media. If there is no \\"industry\\" or ideological control; where are the prominent critics? Why is the Jewish son of survivors of Auschwitz and Maidenek relegated to the fringe simply by asking some very basic, very direct questions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"another way to deny","review":"Finkelstein is aligned with the \\"elitist\\" left-wing intellectuals who, as he states, deny the enormity of the Holocaust for their own political gain. He is a self-hating Jew who makes an elaborate attempt to disparage his identity behind an elaborate dissertation. One wonders if he published because he was perishing, or that he wrote this to persuade himself that he is not who he is, and does not come from the legacy left to him. This is a sorry excuse for a man who is a survivor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics of this book are hiding from indisputable truth","review":"I am dismayed at all the shallow and baseless criticism this book has received on this site by people who are well trained in rhetoric and illusory speech. Any person with even a fraction of rationale in their minds can see the truths presented in this vital piece of work. Finkelstein's arguments and proofs shatter any form of concealment that so many corrupt and selfish people have attempted to pile on top of the facts. The facts are as they are. Rather than spitting accusations of \\"self-hatred\\" and cowardly sitting there behind a computer screen, do the research yourself and try to disprove what has already been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Perhaps then you may have any semblance of credibility to your criticism.This book is an essential read for every American, for we should be vitally concerned with where our tax dollars are going and who our votes are truly supporting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Have We Not Heard About This Book?","review":"Could not put this book down. Without doubt the author has thoroughly referenced and connected the dots. What is remarkable is that we lived in Switzerland and heard similar stories, but never so clear and never so complete. Everyone with a keen sense of skepticism, balance, and historical curiousity should read. I plan on passing the book to many friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Approach this Book with an Open Mind","review":"For the memory of all those who suffered, this book is important. Those who use the holocaust to pursue their own agendas (however intentioned) do no justice to the dead. Norman Finkelstein's message is no more complicated than this. To make it something else is to deny what happened. It is unfair to use this book as a litmus test of adherence to the official Shoah party line. Remember the first time you saw the tattoo and asked what it was? Do you think that survivor would approve of Finkelstein's book? I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"They deffinitely don't dissolve!","review":"These are sold as sublingual lozenges, however even after 15 minutes they don't dissolve.

However, THIS STUPID CD is not a complete soundtrack for the film. You will only find the pop songs on this CD. You will not find even ONE of the rarer tracks you may have been looking for and expected to find. Whomever the idiot was who decided which cuts to put on the CD needs to look at available compilations. I think you can find most of this over-played CRAP on about a HUNDRED other available compilations. Just another example of how Hollywood and the mainstream music industry generally refuses to take ANY risks at all, and doesn't really have a CLUE as to what's cool and what's not. It's truly amazing that some of the cooler songs made it into the film. How sad that the tuned-in genius who picked those songs didn't get to choose what went into the CD. Enjoy the CRAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Whole CD Rocks!!!","review":"This CD is one of the best soundtracks I've heard yet. I loved the new version of \\"Live and Let Die\\", it all just rocks.

Love You Cusack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Point Blank Hits Its Target","review":"My iniatial disappointments with this soundtrack had to do (mostly) with the songs that were missing. However, someone out there shared my complaint and a second volume was released. Now if we could just wrap up the remaining songs with a volume 3, I would be more than content. The thing is that there isn't an unenjoyable song IN this movie. Its all good. So, let's get on top of that third volume: 1)Fugue In A-Minor 2)Ace of Spades 3)In Between Days 4)Your Lucky Day In Hell 5)Sharks Can't Sleep 6)Little Luxuries 7)Big Boss Man 8)Detroit City 9)Walk Like An Egyptian 10)99 Luftbaloons 11)Doors of Your Heart; and let's throw the \\"elevator music\\" version of \\"Live and Let Die\\" and the original \\"Let My Love Open The Door\\" on for good measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the better half!","review":"Don't let the Vol 2 tag fool you.

I already agree with those ideas. However, I found the book had only limited and overly simplistic advice on how to implement those principles. It also contained a lot of alarming assertions about the permanant damage you will cause your children if you make any parenting mistakes.

In the throes of raising an incredible two-year old, sometimes, I need a little reminder of how to stay on track. Jan Hunt's essays give me that reminder, again and again. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This is a collection of Hunt's essays and many of them say the same thing -- over and over again. Basically, she reiterates that a child is a person too.

She touches on that scenario quite often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and provocative, definite re-read","review":"Having been raised by an extreamist feminist, I recognized many of the accusations made by LaHaye in this book as being genuinely part of the feminist/humanist agenda. Even had I not become a follower of Christ, I would have recognized every statement as being true. What was most eye-opening for me was how accurate the author was in his predictions.

I'm neither. As a Christian who does not identify as religious right, I personally found the book's checklist of political issues absolutely maddening. I don't think there's an inherently \\"Christian\\" way to view nuclear power or balanced budget legislation, and it galls me that someone purports to claim that there is.The reaction to this book will be so tied to the politics of the reader that objectively reviewing it is impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent review of Game Theory applied to PoliSci","review":"This book is an amazing review of Game Theory applied to Political Science in Canada. It goes over situations of historic interest to Canadian Political Science majors and describes how they can be modelled and explained using various Game Theoretic constructs.The only reason I don't give a 5 to this is that there are some typographical errors within the book.

Mr. Clapton dabbled a bit in other musical styles like reggae on that release and he takes that one step further here. He treads into spiritual waters on tracks like \\"We've Been Told (Jesus Is Coming)\\" and the old gospel standby, \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\". \\"Singin' The Blues\\" is a cover of a 50's hit and he goes into more familiar territory on the bluesy \\"The Sky Is Crying\\". There's One In Every Crowd is an often overlooked album in Mr. Clapton's catalog, but it is a quite, nice and easy listen from Slowhand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, sadly overlooked album","review":"This album, has gotten some of the worst reviews from critics out of all of EC's 70 albums. I personally disagree. Its not an album full of long solos so if thats what your looking for then this is the wrong CD for you. It is how ever one of the most personal, eclectic albums of EC's career. It ranges from gospel, sweet ballads, blues/country blues, reggae and rock. I don't really care for Don't blame me an inferior re-write to I shot the sherriff, but other than that I love this album. Don't be persuaded by people who give this a bad review it really is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Get Real Here...","review":"I would have given this 3 stars just to be polite to a man whose music I respect very much but with all of the 4 and 5 star reviews on this site, someone needed to step in and provide some balance. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is nice and EC's cover of The Sky Is Crying is pretty good but I'd lean toward Elmore Jame's original or SRV's before this one. I'm a long-term EC fan, from his days with the Yardbirds on. If I had a penny for every time I've listened to him play a tune, I'd probably own Amazon! So I love the man and his music and I'm not calling this a BAD disc. I'm just trying to put some dynamic range in the rating process.

I like Charlie David, especially in that LGBT travel show. But, I wasn't buying this performance. And have to agree with the 1 star review... the acting was not good, the dialogue was questionable at times, the premise was questionable as well (and I like SF movies), and other than Charlie David and Brett, the dudes weren't that handsome (if that was the what you were looking for).Some of the movie was predictable. I really had a hard time believing the younger self. His pouting kind of annoyed me too.The campus setting was good, the lighting, the cinematography, make-up, sound... all pretty good as well. The music was a little plodding. I guess the directing wasn't bad as well. But the main part of the movie... the story and acting... IDK. It could have been better.

The main problem is that the Flecktones is not a singles band. They shine live on stage. Thus to mostly compile tracks from their studio records does not do them justice.I think Live Art is a better introduction to the band. It's a tad more expensive because it's 2CDs rather than one, but you get extended jams and solos that are just incredible. The additional expense is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band","review":"What can you say about Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. The band is fantastic. Victor Wooten Bass player of the year many times and Futureman who was a leader in using the Cajon in their style of music and the first time I saw it used in concert.The songs are a great representation of their ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist who is not easily categorized","review":"A number of years ago, a friend suggested I give Bela Fleck a try. I bought this and promptly forgot about it. Well, I missed out on a few years of interesting and challenging music. Bela Fleck and the Flecktones run the gamut from bluegrass to jazz and just about everything else in between. The best thing about it is that they make it seem totally natural to combine all these disparate sounds into a wonderful mixture. From the dark intro of \\"The Sinister Minister\\" to the jazzy wanderings of \\"Flight of the Cosmic Hippo\\" this CD has a number of interesting pieces. There were a few numbers that didn't work for me like the disjointed \\"Shocktime,\\" and the too soft jazz of \\"Sex in a Pan,\\" but the overall effect is a joy of making music. And that is always a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The clearest and most sophisticated secondary source for Greek history","review":"Bury's History of Greece is lucid, erudite, as simple as possible (given the complex subject) and comprehensive within its time period.It comes highly recommended by educators Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler.

In fact this has made him a hit with some fans who come to the races just to experince his crashes through a virtual reality rig. he soon become tangled up in a murder mystery and must face his own inner demons.The art is darker and more abstract than in Alita.

Besides I was planning a party and was really in need of something fresh. I was so excited by my purchase that I wanted to recommend it to anyone looking for Christmas music or not.The songs are fun and have a great groove. Some of the tracks are remakes while others are original which I find pleasant as I tire of the same Christmas tunes over and over. And then a couple of the tracks just have a wintery feel so you aren't overburdened with too much Christmas music - for those as sensitive to it as me. The CD is diverse just enough that it's full of surprises, but pleasantly.Two favorites for me are Winter Wonderland and Drummerboy. I strongly suggest you pick up this CD.

For starters the entire cast was great, especiall Charlize Theron. I have to say that she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Plus, she's a very gifted actress. Who ever discovered her must be proud of themselves. Anyway, its a movie that I would absolutly recommend to anyone. I just wish that I knew that if the DVD is worth the money.

I always figured Charlize Theron was sleeping with the costume designer because she was a new-comer, while Teri Hatcher was an established star. Yet, in every scene, Teri is sweating, in sweats, and Charlize is wearing this white body stocking(or not)that looks like it's more make-up than clothing. Their fight scene is my favorite. Spader gives everyone 60 seconds, Aiello cooks, Jeff Daniels steams and Eric Stoltz finds a clue and meets a charming young lady.

The film is dull and poorly scripted, with bland characters and an unfulfilled aspiration to hipness. I'll give that it has an occasional stylish moment, and an occasional funny line, but most of the \\"style\\" seems contrived and forced and the majority of the laughs, for me, were unintentional. Although you have to give it to James Spader -- I don't think he *will* make a movie unless he is going to be having sex with one of the attractive female leads at some point. The theory holds true here, in a terribly unnecessary and out-of-place sex scene. Don't get me wrong, though, it was one of the few scenes I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nouveau-hip rubbish","review":"A hitman knocks out a cop instead of shooting him despite having just committed a double homicide.

This is a sprawling ensemble piece, weaving together low-key eccentrics into a single narrative. It's just that some of them have guns.The cast, especially James Spader and Charlize Theron are top notch, but a crucial change made to \\"lighten\\" the movie tosses much of the plot out the window, robs one central character of his key motivation, and greatly hinders the film. (The letter read in the car originally was from an AIDS clinic ...) I had hoped that the DVD edition would restore the original scene at least in a \\"deleted scenes\\" section if not actually let viewers see the film as it was originally intended, but so be it.A good film for film fans who like their Altman with a twist of Tarantino.

Frank Sinatra is just brillant, but top of the top is the cover of I will survive with that edgy - funky rhythm at the end. The problem is that i cant get their albums in Slovenia!Cake are unfortunately completely unknown here, but that is good for me, cos i can have them all for myself...( ha ha ha )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps","review":"This album changed the way I thought about music. A few Cake albums later, I'm still absolutely in love. The ironic lyrics and compelling use of horn keep me coming back all the time. John McCrea's wit is obvious in every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baking Up a Sweet Sound","review":"Take a cup of good clean rock and roll, mix in 2 teaspoons ska, a half of cup of funk, a dash of hip hop and R&B, and a sprinkling of country. Then bake well for 58 minutes, and frost with some of the freshiest lyrics of the decade and you have Cake's Fashion Nuggett. Although not there debut CD, Cake still manages redefine and stretch the face of alternative rock. I found myself listening to this one everyday and humming the tunes in my head. This CD is definately has sweet and satisfying as a lush piece of your favorite cake in the morning. It is a must for any music lover, its unique and never boring even months after you own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Cake!","review":"Best Cake CD Ever!!! The Distance is a great song. But, there are numerous songs on this album that make it worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have it, what are you thinking!?","review":"This is by far the best cd I have ever bought. Unlike most Cake fans, I became one after I found out I was seeing them with Modest Mouse (who were the reason I purchased the tickets). After hearing Comfort Eagle, I became an instant fan. I picked this one up, and was blown away that Cake could put out more than one cd with so much punch. The music is simply brilliant. It's simple style, along with trumpets and bass lines that actually MOVE, this is one of the best cds I own (and I own way too many cds). The only reason there's a PA on this cd is because John goes a little crazy in the song \\"Nugget\\" and drops the f-bomb once in \\"I Will Survive.\\" All-in-all, it's my opinion that EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A recent classic","review":"I remember when this album came out, i heard the distance on the radio about one million times and eventually i bought the Cd. and then it sat on my shelf until one day in an effort to listen to some thing new, i just poped it in and played it from start to finish. I was subsequently blown away. i couldn't believe my ears, the was that they took rock and added real emothin and horns in a very unska-like way was awesome, this whole album is fantastic, from frank sinatra to sad songs, if you like cake then you should have this album, it is very similar to their current stuff, but more stripped down and somehow better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know why I love this band so much","review":"This album, like every Cake album, is the kind of album that is always welcome, always satisfying, always loveable, and always the best album that could be playing at that moment. No matter where I am, if I hear a Cake album playing (especially this one), I feel compelled to turn up the volume louder and louder. The lyrics are beautiful and always poetic. These lyrics were not written to fit in a song, but instead were written as poetry, and then they were woven into music. The lead singer, John McCrea, has an odd vocal key that hovers between singing and talking, but he executes it best on this album. \\"Prolonging the Magic\\" and \\"Comfort Eagle\\" are good albums in their own right, but this one is the best, in my opinion. \\"Pressure Chief\\" and later albums are great if you are a fan, but if you are new to Cake, try \\"Fashion Nugget\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs ever!","review":"What can I say? Cake just blows everything else out of the water! :) I bought this CD a while back, when it first came out, and I still listen to it constantly, and every last one of the songs is great! I mean, how many CDs can you say that about? ^_^ The lyrics are sometimes wacky, and delivered in a deadbeat voice, but somehow that just makes the music more addictive. The two best songs, in my opinion, are 'Frank Sinatra', which has funky beats and lazily-cool guitar licks, and 'The Distance', a song that gets your adrenalin pumping, with lyrics centering around a race, fast-paced drumming, and chunky bass. Of course, there's always 'Nugget', a commentary on political corruption, that uses hilarious lyrics about squirrels and chicken McNuggets. This great collection of songs make you laugh and groove, definitely a staple for any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fun....but why hasn't anyone talked about VU?","review":"Their Velvet Underground influence is showing...does anyone else think so?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first CD","review":"It was the first Cd I bought, and i was very lucky, this is one of my best Cd's I have. The John McRea's voice sounds great,Greg Brown is an incredible guitar player, and there are a lot of incredible songs like I Will Survive,what a wonderful remake.I just love it how John sings that song,an excellent album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Icing on the Cake","review":"This album is as sweet as they come. Most of the songs are upbeat like \\"The Distance\\", but the slow songs (well, excluding the last one obviously by it's title) you don't even realize they've slowed... Really, if you like Cake (hehe, pardon the pun) and want a CD with some \\"oomfph\\" and \\"YAWWW! \\" thrown in the mix, this CD delivers sing-song qualities that you'll be humming and spinning for weeks (and possibly even longer...) This CD will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absloutly Brilliant!","review":"This album is one of the absolute best. Unlike most bands, Cake's song mesmerize you and leave you wanting more. This album is a must. The only cd that is a tad better than this one is the new, \\"Prolonging The Magic,\\" also by cake. I'll just say if you have a good taste in music you will want the fantastic record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for the most part","review":"I bought this cd for a couple of songs which are cool, the rest are below average. The group, like so many from the past to present, tries to hard to be anti-hip. They become just a bunch of clanging noise. But hey, they're going the distance...Oh wait, they tried and didn't make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats some gooood cake","review":"This was one of the first CDs that started my music 'collection'. And i hav to say its still one of my favourites. The dry humour in their lyrics is enjoyable and every song sounds different. The good songs on this are 'daria', 'the distance', 'perhaps, perhaps', 'i will survive', and 'nugget'. I also have 'Comfort Eagle', though i think FN is better in some ways, even though 'comfort eagle' has less filler. Other songs which are good on the album are 'its coming down', 'italian leather sofa' and 'stickshifts and safetybelts'. 'race car ya yas' is strange indeed. Especially the line 'the land where large fuzzy dice, still hang proudly, like testicles from rear view mirrors'.Overall a very balanced album showing many styles of music by cake; it will not lose its 'listenability' over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"A friend of mine recommended this album and I love it. I had never heard about this band but I really like it now. Amazing songs, my personal favourites are Frank Sinatra, The Distance and Stickshifts and Safetybelts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is great","review":"When i first got this album three years ago, I didn't think to highly of it.

But very, very good!This album is typical of their sense of humour and musical talent!I can't remember when I first discovered them but I am glad I did and very glad I bought this album. Check out their fantastic version of \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\\" and every other track.I just can't sing Cakes praises enough, buy this and you'll see what I mean!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy, different, but will it stand the test of time?","review":"This band deserves praise simply for daring to be different. The problem is, sometimes it sounds as if this group is trying too hard for that quirky appeal. Despite the eclectic sound (the meandering trumpet is an interesting addition, and actually works), this stuff is surprisingly accessible if you have ears that are attuned to late 90s alternative rock.\\"The Distance\\" is an instant classic, and will be on all the compilation albums when this music is old enough to merit nostalgia. As for the rest of the CD . . . well, if you want to know what it will sound like in 20 years, try playing anything on \\"Get the Knack\\" besides \\"My Sharona\\": What were we thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPICAL 90's GARBAGE","review":"These guys have taken the 90s \\"half singing-half talking\\" style to a new level: Just Talking. It is so typical for 90s rock bands to feature a vocalist who simply cannot sing, and yet we accept it just fine. MTV has really done a number on America."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps it's Abba, it's Abba, it's Abba..","review":"The song \\"Perhaps\\", which sounds like a collage of songs is actually half (gasp) Abba's Fernando!

They would have been 'gonged' on The Gong Show in the 70's. I listened to this CD at least 5 times, and I just cannot seem to find the value with these clowns. Yep, the trumpet thing is cool, and the 'I Will Survive' cover is neat, but the rest seems to reek of really bad ALT music. This CD is purely entertainment a-la-Dr-Demento.I respect a lot of the ALT artists (and all the ones that have been 'put' there), however this is seriously taking advantage of a tenuous situation in music - does any old (...) that doesn't sound like Springsteen fit here with many other better artists? Now that TAKES THE CAKE mate!(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sera, sera,sera...Fernando?","review":"I'm wondering if Cake is giving credit to the authors of two Latino songs featured in Fashion Nugget. Half of the song \\"Perhaps\\" sounds exactly like \\"Fernando\\",a hit in Portuguese, sung by Perla about three decades ago in Brazil. The other half of \\"Perhaps\\" is of course Sera, Sera, Sera..which any Spanish speaking person is very familiar with. Makes you wonder whether the other beautiful songs in the album are \\"creative collages\\" as well..Who knows, who knows, who knows ??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake could not write themselves out of an open box","review":"The lyrics to the song, the Distance make no real sense. They are cyphers for some non-human, hollywood-ized feelings. Don't kid yourself that there is any substance, angst or cleverness here. This is pulpy tripe all the way and if you buy it, you need a brain transplant 'cause you've got the creativity and wit of a dead cactus. These lyrics are as contrived as can be. You like this stuff?..., it follows that you're also a big fan of Survivor and Big Brother, and your cousin's been on Cops......twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend","review":"Does not taste good.

I had high hopes for this one, thinking it would combine my likes, but was disappointed. It was shot and acted well, but had no plot and no point. Yes, drugs and sex can be addicting, we know that. Yes, humans eating other humans is creepy, but we've seen that before.

This watch deserves 5 stars all-the-way, no questions asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise not met","review":"I gotta say I was disappointed. Haley of Part One was an interesting character; I was hoping to discover more of her in Part Two. Instead, the story goes in another direction entirely. Now that I've finished the book (and at the risk of giving away the plot too badly), it started going downhill after the grandmother was written out. Moreover, some loose ends are leftover at the conclusion (for example: in Part One, Miss Powell's personal life seems to be loaded with innuendo; in Part Two, she's just sort of \\"there\\" as a secondary character).The last 25% of the book seemed predictable. I went from \\"She seems kinda neat\\" at the end of Part One to \\"Who cares!\\" at the end of Part Two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have read all of William Kowalski's books and have enjoyed the character building through the sometimes juvenile story lines. This book follows that suit in the beginning. This coming of age story of Hailey Baumbauer, a 17 yr old girl living in the remote suburbs of upper new york is absurd. Kowalski does a good job of getting you to connect with the characters early on, but fails miserably at capturing your attention with a likely story or believable plot. This is the first book that I have ever stopped reading because the story line just got progessively worse until I could not bear the misery of continuing to read it. I would recammend this book perhaps for a junior high school or preteen reading level, but nothing beyond that. Anyone with any sense of life and basic story telling will find this to be trully disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hop on board to this new author he is great","review":"I actually got to meet this author when he did a book show at my local book store. His first book Eddies Bastard ranks as one of the best novels I have ever read. This book didn't dissapoint. The book is about a girl Haney Bombauer which through me off because Eddies Bastard is about a boy growing up and after my girlfriend just broke up with me I really didn't want to hear about a girl's life. I went ahead and read it and this book is awesome. I have given it to 3 people and they all loved it. You will fall in love with Haneys personality and the charachters that pop up in the book will make you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"The adventures of a totally fictional girl","review":"I had thought this was going to be a funny book about a girl growing up, but it is actually a weird story of what a man thinks it would be like to be a girl growing up. The plot is completely unbelieveable, even by magical standards. The use of profanity, which is supposed to show how Haley is a tomboy, is outdated and badly timed. The sex scene could have only been written by a man, because a 17 year old girl would have never found that first experience anything but miserable. I was really sorry the book wasn't better as it started out with promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"Neither of the the ink cartridges worked on my printer.

Can you really not have a hot record when you got Jermaine Dupri with production credits and the up and coming Trackboyz backing you? The answer... NO! J-Kwon goes straight for the platnium with his club banger \\"Tipsy\\" which has a fresh beat and sick lyrics that make you wanna just get up and move. Kwon also slows things down with guest R&B singer Sadyyiah on \\"You & Me\\" and this shows the soft side of the young Lou rapper. For the most part, J-Kwon decides to keep things moving as most of his CD is full of songs that you can bounce to in the club. Kwon has defiantly proved himself to be one of the Lou's finest and I hope to see more from him in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Meant 0 stars","review":"I would've given this 0 stars.

The trackboyz produce the entire album and by track 5 you are already tired of their style. But that's not the worst. JKwon completely sucks as a rapper. He has next to no skills. His flow isn't that great and his voice is extremely annoying. The album only has 3 good songs; Hood Hop, Tipsy, My Enemies are the only good songs. JD hasn't found the next it with this guy.

But I refuse to buy a cd that has copy protection on it. This CD features copy protection from Sunncomm and BMG that will not let you rip the songs to your hard drive in the format of your choosing. Instead, it forces you to use a secure WMA format that is copied from the cd. These files are not compatible with the number one MP3 player in the world (iPod) nor the number one jukebox software (iTunes). Don't support copy protection schemes like this. Boycott BMG by refusing to buy these types of cd. The sad thing is I would have been more than happy to buy this cd. I like J-Kwon and most of the St. Louis hip-hop scene. The protection is easily cracked, but I will not put money towards this type of DRM. Please don't do it either.

Tupac and various other artists who were the arhcitects of this movement are rolling over in their graves (a place they would not be if it were not for the ridiculous feuds started between them over mindless crap).

It sounds like they played the vinyl and recorded it and then slapped it on a CD. It's awful. And the worst part is that had I not also bought the \\"Something to Live For\\" double CD set, I'd think that the songs here were presented in the best possible quality. \\"Stairway to the Stars\\" and \\"How High the Moon\\" are in good quality on STLF.

It is not as dark and moody. It is mellow pop.That said, one of my favorites is Just A Touch Away, which was haunting (and yes, mellow.) It had the same romantic touch to the lyrics, though not as edgy. Forgiven was a beautiful live song and the album version is still a great listen.The bottom line is this -- if you want Echo and the Bunnymen in their witty, edgy and yet romantic Ocean Rain era, this album is not going to deliver it to you.

My hopes were high when I learned about Ian rejoining, but after repeated playings that often induced sleep, I found those hopes dashed.Ian's voice seems to have lost it's upper register, leaving him to sing in a low drone as if he's been on valium for years.Frankly, I'm at a loss to explain the 4 and 5 star reviews here.This doesn't even hint at past greatness such as \\"Crocodiles\\" and \\"Ocean Rain\\". The fact that there are currently 30 used copies available here speaks in volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of the Best albums of 1997","review":"Since 1997 was being dominated by too many pop bands/singers, I had to go for new cd's by better, older artists. The single \\"I Want to be There\\" had some mild airplay in Houston, but then if I hadn't gotten this cd at the time, it would be forgotten. However, it's never too late to get a good cd. True, most people who know the Bunnymen's earlier works believe it doesn't compare, but it's good. And while I usually don't like too much mellowness, it's great to listen to when you're in the mood. I think this mellowness was well balanced by the use of strings, along with Ian's soothing voice. Will Sergeant's guitar work is great too. If you already like this band & hadn't gotten this cd yet, get it. Other favorites of mine on the cd include \\"Evergreen\\" & \\"I'll Fly Tonight\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story","review":"I can only add to the plaudits below.

Tim does a great job of covering the basics of \\"How to get started\\" in scratch building model rockets and provides some of the 'hows and whys' of developing unique model rockets that you have dreamed about building. While not much on the ever expanding world of model rocketry electronics, Tim does a great job of explaining just how to improve \\"the speed of balsa\\" (the speed where basic construction techniques fail in flight).

It seemed as though much of the book's focus was on peddling the merits of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy rather than providing workable strategies to assist in the treatment of anxiety. I found the writing to be disengaging with the inclusion of some unusual case studies which did nothing to enhance the quality of the book. I would instead recommend When Anxiety Attacks: The New, Drug-Free Anxiety Therapy That Can Change Your Life by David Burns, a far more practical and user-friendly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a blowhard, self promoting jerk","review":"This book was recommended by my psychologist and I am completely disappointed. In the book, the author basically says since he overcame anxiety then anyone can and that's all there is to it. He doesn't address the whys or whats of having anxiety only his experiences. Most of his anxiety came from public speaking or from approaching women. So his solution is to keep making yourself do the things that make you have anxiety over and over and over again until you don't have anxiety anymore. What a useless joke! This book totally dehumanizes a person and tries to reprogram someone as an unemotional robot. I gave it 2 stars because one case example of a music teacher was amusing so I got a good laugh.

It does however match the picture that Amazon provides pretty well. It is best viewed from a distance,, I'll put it that way. There is a visible seam where the struts of the nacelles attach to the main engineering hull in particular. If you attach the base AFTER the base mounting hull plate is attached as they say to do you risk damaging the model. Best to attach the base to the mounting plate first then screw it on.

These toys are great for collecting and I'm sure kids will love to play with them (but probably not great for small children). Their educational value is in the eye opening Star Trek Universe---once you get involved in the storytelling (indirectly perhaps through the toys) you can't help but see the educational value. Much better than most TV onscreen these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product, poor quality and support from A.A.","review":"The ships design and detail is very good. Yet Art Asylum still wants to design the nacelles as a separate part from the ship. This produces poorly fitting nacelles and sometimes the metal contacts inside them do not meet with the ship, thus they dont work! They NX model suffers from the same problem.The stand it comes with is nice, but trying to attach the base to the bottom of the ship is very difficult. I was sure I would have snapped the stand attachment ball in two if I was not more careful.Support from Art Asylum is horrible & they would not take my call regarding the issue of the warp nacelle. Too bad, they should be supporting their products much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!!!","review":"Fun, fun, fun! Where were toys like this when I was a kid? I'm 34 and lamenting that I'm not 22 years younger. This is great. My major quibbles with the ship are that they use the Next Generation phaser effect instead of the movie fx and why can't they make one that lets you choose what sound to use instead of always having to run through all of them?I hope they make a full-size bridge set like they did with the Enterprise set. Art Asylum could make a fortune if they made a full bridge for the original crew. Also, if they make an Enterprise D or E, I hope they're at scale with the Enterprise-A. I'm sick of all the ships being made the same size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ship, but a lousy base","review":"I gave this ship four stars for the design, but the cheap plastic base it comes with is worthless. It isn't sturdy enough to hold the weight of the ship model. After a few months of being on display, the plastic knob that holds up the ship broke off and can not be fixed. In fact, two other Art Asylum Enterprise bases on other models did the same, and one ship broke when it fell off my shelf because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, you could tell people you built it!!!!!","review":"Good quality model. The paint job is good, and the attention to detail is great!!!! The sound effects are good I guess, if your 8 years old, but I didn't buy it for that anyway.

This is one of the worst conditioners I have ever used! It's called \\"hydrating\\" but it left my hair feeling parched and dry. I wish I had used this on one of my days off because my hair looked so brittle that I was embarrassed to go to work. I did not have time to rewash it, so I had to go with it looking awful.

It's not chemically treated. I'm picky about shampoo, since I wash it everyday, and don't want to dry out my hair and I hate any residue, as it makes my hair very oily. These are the best shampoos though, as I've found that they really clean my hair without being overly harsh.

The conditioner seems like it will work out okay when you're in the shower, but once you're out, the real disaster happens. I have long hair (it is \\"fine\\", but there is a LOT of it.

That is about the only redeeming quality about the product. I have used hotel conditioners that made my hair less tangled and softer than Organix Passion Fruit Guava conditioner. After using slightly less than a palm sized amount of conditioner (a lot, I know), my hair still feels like it was sucked up and tangled by a vacuum. I don't typically use that much conditioner, but it's necessary with this brand.I would have given it 1 star, but like I said, I like the smell. Everything else sucks.Edit - Oct. 20, 2011After using the conditioner for about two weeks, I noticed another downfall. My hands are very sensitive, and the conditioner actually makes my hands itch. Perhaps I should've known since it's so fragrant that it might irritate my hands. Beware if you have sensitive skin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Wanted to Like This","review":"I purchased this because I love the bottle and it smells great.It does get two stars for smelling great and the packaging, but it doesn't really condition my hair what-so-ever. I have color-treated, long, coarse hair. First of all, I feel like I need to use about 1/5 the bottle each time to actually get it to work through my hair. Then, after I rinse it out, I think it actually tangles my hair more--I spend a good 10 minutes combing tangles out of my hair every time I wash it, which isn't usually how I like to spend my mornings. I feel the hairs breaking because of all these knots, even though I try to be careful, and it really makes me angry.Buy this if you want your hair to smell good--but if you want it conditioned, and easy to comb, looking to something else instead. I prefer Herbal Essences over this for conditioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a conditioner that I expected","review":"I usually think a conditioner should make your hair soft and bouncy .

It definitely doesn't help with tangles - if anything, it makes them worse.I do color my hair, but not sure why that should make a difference in how the product works (it should at least condition a LITTLE).

Based on the information I read it seemed perfect. I bought the Coconut shampoo and conditioner and was very disappointed. I have fine, heavily colored hair. The shampoo made my hair hard and straw like. The conditioner was more moisturising but I still had to put in a lot of leave in moisturiser afterwards to compensate for all the flyaway dryness this product caused.

Unfortunately, it does nothing to fill the hole I fear I'll always have in my heart, the empty void that can't be filled by anything purchasable.

I noticed my hair felt like it had been stripped by harsh cleansers after rinsing the shampoo. From roots to tips, it was squeaky and felt raw. The matching conditioner was no more impressive. The first time I used it, the bottom 3-4 inches of my hair felt stiff even after using styling products. On the second try, I conditioned twice for 3-5 minutes each time.

I will disclose: my African-American hair is relaxed & I used the Coconut Milk conditioner as my protein conditioner & then followed up with a moisturizing conditioner (Mizani Moisturefuse Moisturizing Conditioner Size: 8.5oz). I was able to comb through my hair with this conditioner in it with much ease. My hair was nice and soft after rinsing the Coconut Milk conditioner out of my hair. All of this was BEFORE I used the moisturizing conditioner. I expected a hassle but never got it.

I would think that keratin products would be more effective than any others because keratin is so well known for the positive things that it can do to hair, this was awful though. After using it my hair was not smooth at all-- i had to use an excessive amount of leave in conditioner after the shower to be able to start brushing through the knots. I ripped out so much hair on my brush after using this and my head was in pain from all the torn hair. After using it I even went back to the bottle to doublee check that I used it properly and that this was, in fact, a conditioner... I don't understand house they can even call this a conditioner because it made my hair worse than not using it at all.

The most disappointed factor of this product is that it made my hair EXTREMELY DRY and tangled.

My hair is just as tangled."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this conditioner?!?","review":"I'll start off with the good: the smell. And that's where the good ends. The shampoo is so drying and harsh. The conditioner looks thick and creamy, but does nothing to relieve that dryness that the shampoo causes. Usually you can comb your fingers through your hair when the conditioner is in, but I'm lucky if I can get a brush through my hair. I spent at least 10 minutes combing out knots from hair...knots that weren't in my hair before I used Organix.

I would describe my hair as long and thick it's not naturally curly more like wavy with lots of frizz. I have the hair type that stays bone straight when I use a flat iron, no type of humidity can cause my hair to frizz. This being said I bought this product with the hopes that it would make my hair more manageably and reduce the frizz.This conditioner is very thick and rich almost like paste, it was kind of difficult to squeeze it out of the bottle. After I rinsed the conditioner out I noticed my hair was a lot more tangled than usual. Once dried my hair felt course and my ends looked fried and kinky. My ends where so bad that no matter how any times I went over it with the flat iron it stayed the same. This conditioner did not seem to deliver any kind of moisture what so ever it actually made my hair look more dry and damaged. I will not be using this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy. ever.","review":"This has to be one of the worse things I have ever purchased. I thought since it was organic it would be better for my hair. but all it did was strip it of all its oils and make it feel like straw.

Dont buy. and if you do decide to buy it... then just remember, i told you so (:how this product is getting anything more than one star is beyond me though. I despise this product.

Still looking for that amazing life-changing product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coconut Milk Conditioner Not Good","review":"I absolutely love the shampoo, but I use a different local organic conditioner since this product does not soften my hair enough either.

Big bottle, smells good, very thick. Now the cons. For a product called Organix, I expected organic contents. Not so much. My hair fell out after using this conditioner. The product contains \\"cones\\" (dimethicone I think) which I am allergic to. The \\"cones\\" leave your hair shiny, but smother your hair if used regularly. It does leave my hair (what's left of it) very soft when wet. There is no moisture when dry. All in all I'd give this conditioner a negative star if it wasn't for the pros.

The translator made no big efforts to find the correct names of places, books and movies. And she also does not help at all if you don't know France and Paris: many places are cited, and you will not know that Beaubourg is an modern art museum if you were not there (luckily, I was over there while reading it).The same occurs for \\"Forum de Halles\\", which is a huge underground mall, and for \\"Stand on Zanzibar\\", which was translated back from the French version, resulting in \\"Everyone to Zanzibar\\", clearly showing that the translator did not even looked for this book name in the internet (that shows no results).Quite interesting ideas, easy to read (you do not need a lot of philosophical background) with such poor translations... more footnotes would have helped a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking but intense.","review":"A thought provoking book. Do not be shocked however if you find yourself reading it extremely slowly. The text is wordy and thick at best but often times necessarily to bring its points across. If you are not an avid reader, enjoy abstract thinking, or want to learn more about the differences between Simulacrum and Simulations avoid this book.This is still a great read although convoluted at times so all others should enjoy. But those who are not well read have been warned.Then again if you looked for this book odds are you are ready for this. I only wanted to warn those with out college education or advanced vocabulary to so that they wont lose their appetite for knowledge from heavy text, such an event would be regrettable.The text is heavy, full of valuable info on what it pertains and much like this review it sometimes seems to repeat facts redundantly.

I decided to experiment with this album and have been thus far utterly dissatisfied. As the title implies, this is a soul album. They should have left \\"ambient\\" out of the title because it does not apply. The soul tracks are pathetic, the lyrics are painfully stupid, and the vocalists need some help too.

But when I started playing some videos such as Wicked Game and The Funeral of Hearts, the video would become stagnet, get black squares and started fading in and out. After a minute of doing this, the video would freeze and then the sound would die shortly thereafter. The ticker on the DVD would still play though. I thought it was just my DVD player, but once I tried it again on two others in my house, I knew it was defective.

It doesn't look too great though. If you get it and it is too small, try snapping the prong off and putting a small piece of folded paper between the prong and base, it'll add a bit of room between the prongs and will work. If you want something that'll work out of the box, don't buy this. If you don't mind fiddling a little, then go for it.*********UPDATE************The duct tape and super glue started to wear off, my brush started to fall out of the holder.

It wouldn't respond to anything, even the off button, and I kept having to unplug the darn thing and plug it in to get it back to normal again. It would do this with both DVD's and CD's. This gets to be a pain in the butt when your entertainment centre weighs a couple hundred pounds and the plug is way back there behind it. I was also disappointed with the random feature. You could play 5 CD's at random but it had to be 2 songs from each CD before it would randomly pick the next. Why 2 songs? I wanted random, not pairs. Otherwise, it seemed to have great picture, but even the cheapest DVD players have great picture.

His voice is an instrument and did not belong on this CD. The music was of porn movie quality, the mixing was poor, the genre was inappropriate and the only redeeming quality was Darius' voice (especially a capella)Why? The only quality again was his voice. Why then not simply cut an a capella spiritual CD. It couldn't sell any less volume.Was it a musical statement? What was the statement? Perhaps that a performer the quality of Darius can even make absurd decisions.I simply do not see anything redeeming on this CD except for Darius.

But I just recently heard news of Darius Rucker's solo album, and knowing he always had an excellent voice, so I decided to download a few songs. I'm not too into R&B, but he is GOOD! I can't get enough of \\"Wild One\\".Yea i know, it's not at all cool to like Hootie anymore, but any R&B song that catches the eye of a KoRn fan is definitley worth checking out.I'd actually like to hear him do an R&B version of \\"Let Her Cry\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"darius in rare form!","review":"i love the sound of darius' voice anyway, but this cd showcases his strong voice in just about every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving with Darius...","review":"I saw Darius Rucker's video \\"Wild One\\" on VH1 and the song sounded hot.

I drove home grinning from ear to ear, playing it loud and wanting to go see him live. You just want to stand in a club swaying, clapping, feeling. His vocals take you with him. I suggest songs 1,2,4,5,8, and 11. There is even a ditty with Snoop Dog...come on, how could you go wrong:-)? Take a listen and then take it home with you...on the drive back, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daruis Rucker Delivers","review":"When I first saw the video for \\"Wild One,\\" I had to have this CD. Wild One is great, and if you expecting Hootie, don't. This is a very soulful cd. The standout on this cd are Exodus and Sometimes I Wonder, a mellow track with another Hidden Beach artist, Jill Scott. I think a new duet team has emerged. I was also crazy about Ten Years, it sort of left off where he went in his Hootie days with Let Her Cry. The last two cuts on the cd are other nice mellow jams. Somewhere is a song you can just listen to and play again and again. Finally, who thought you could take a member from Hootie and Snoop from the LBC and come up with a banging track, well Daruis has done it. I am looking forward to more solo material from this man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program my five year old is addicted.","review":"This is probably the best begginers art program I have ever seen.

This art program was bought for my five year old who is into scrapebooking with grandma. There are some sections that I find somewhat hard like the make a quilt. There are other sections that are for everyone in the house to do like make your own piture or Frankie's tent where you can make pitures that will go into a story/song/movie that is where most of our ride piece have come from.

First of all I was concerned because we have Windows 7, and not all software that is older works with it. No problem, though, this works great on Windows 7. You will need the disc to play this one, so keep it handy. One thing I noticed right away is that the characters in this game talk a lot. They kind of go on and on so prepare to click through it. Aside from that this has some great features.My daughter loves \\"making movies\\" and showing them to anyone who will watch. There are lot of ways to make art and I was surprised at how much you can really do. This game has pretty much any art form you can think of and educates at the same time about different art.

His Grandpa Joe ( who lives with Charlies faimley). And Mr. Willy Wonka ( The owner of the choclate factory). The plot starts out when Willy Wonka puts four golden tickets in four choclate bars. The lucky people who find them get to go on a tour of his misterous choclate factory. The whole story takes place in Willy Wonkas Choclate factory, in present times. The person who makes it through the tour with out geting into trouble, gets a life time supply of choclate and candy. And there is one more thing that you will find out at the end.

Will Charlotte and Lucy escape the count's evil plan with the help of Hildi, the kitchen maid, their old teacher, Max, a new freind, and a crazy doctor? Or will the Count and his sidekick Snivelwurst get the better of them? This is a truly bizarre and funny story you are sure to enjoy. The reason I gave it only four stars was because I have read the Golden Compass and Subtle Knife before I read Count Carlstein. They are the most amazing books I have ever read, though. This is a hilarious book you are sure to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty gothic satire but not Pullman's best","review":"A parody of gothic melodramas,COUNT KARLSTEIN, could be confusing to the presumed target audience of upper elementary and middle schoolers. The book is told from the viewpoint of several different people and Pullman's writing here is not as well delineated as in his later books. Lots of characters are quickly introduced and I found myself thumbing back to remind myself exactly who was who, especially in the beginning chapters. The plot is over the top and exciting with lots of fun surprises revealed in the closing chapters if the reader is patient enough to wade through the rather cumbersome beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Inch Hook & Loop Sanding Discs, 8 Holes, 40 Grit, Box of 50.","review":"Everything would be fine but I didn't get what I ordered.

Unfortunately, I used it at the first signs of a diaper rash (my daughter has been getting a diaper rash on and off from the heat this summer, so I used it after a diaper change when her butt looked like it was hot, red, and irritated) and after I sprayed it on my poor daughter instantly started screaming and shaking and squirming. She is used to diaper rash sprays - we use the California Baby Diaper Area Wash - and it was obvious this reaction was to pain, not the surprise of the spray or coldness or something. There must be something in it that either she is allergic to or something that really stings an irritated butt.

Don't get me wrong I am a great fan of Elvis' work and share and feel the connection along with millions of other people. But I don't like to see this mawkish nonsense go unchallenged.

If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT.

Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be. I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny. The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions.

In the first few chapters the writing is strong and engaging, particularly as she poignantly shares the truly painful experience of her son's death. But the book slowly digresses into a travelogue of events and name-dropping. I kept thinking...\\"She's trying to include every possible name that might have something to offer if there's ever a future campaign.\\" She also tries too hard to convince us she's \\"just a normal gal from North Carolina\\" who considers everyone \\"family.\\" I certainly agree with her thesis that we should all try harder to connect with the people around us.

From early childhood as the daughter of a U-2 pilot in Japan to her life as a mother and political campaigner Elizabeth Edwards has reached out to connect with nearly everyone she has met.

The chapters dealing with the loss of her son Wade were heart wrenching. Yet, I think they would also be a comfort to those who have exerienced such a loss.

It is almost as though she needed to fill pages, so we are forced to yawn our way through the end of the book. It is a shame -- Edwards is such a gifted writer. I hope she will write more in the future, but from a personal point of view. She has great potential, and much to offer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"English Majors can turn a phrase","review":"English Majors can certainly write! As a breast cancer survivor I thought the book would be about her journey through breast cancer. It is and it isn't, but in between are insights that only some one in the top political ranks can have and insights that we all have. Some of her short sentences sent me to reading them again and again because they expressed so well experiences we all share. My thoughts and prayers are with her with her chronic condition of breast cancer. With more time on her hands not campaigning, and only 2 small children I am hoping she uses her gifted style on a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Term Great Value","review":"I was hesitant at first to spend that much on a bulk purchase of envelopes. But these will save you a lot of money and frustration in the long term. You save money on shipping since these can be used to ship First Class Mail, and you don't have to keep purchasing new envelopes week to week or month to month. The shipping price (when buying the envelopes) adds to their cost, but they come in a big box; I can imagine it must cost what the seller is charging for the shipping price. The Shipping was prompt. I made an order on Jan 21 and I received the product on Jan 26. Not too shabby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selection","review":"I have used some other brands of padded mailers that just did not hold up very well. This brand has a stronger adhesive strip. Some brands,such as SCOTCH that I have used would tear at the corners, not have adhesive to each end, and just felt flimsy. I was having to use packaging tape to make sure they stayed sealed. So it is very nice not to have to worry about the ones that I received. There is a nice selection of sizes for sending CD's and smaller books. Even the padding bubbles seemed to be of better quality. I would order from this seller again. Only a one day delay, noted with UPS, in the shipping.

It is easy to push it onto a schrader valve too far so the lever won't lock in the up position, and you risk damaging the schrader valve if you try to force it. It is also easy to not push it on far enough so you don't get air into the tire. What is not easy is attaching it \\"just right\\" so it works. The sweet spot between these two extremes is so narrow that I hit it in only 1 out of 10 tries. From now on I am using a screw-on air chuck (as on Lezyne pumps) and have found them to be much much less hassle. ToPeak makes good pumps, I just wish they made a screw-on air chuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"got this as a replacement for a bad hose on my old Zefal pump.

Although Streets Disciple and Fabolous have yet to drop, \\"Amerikaz Nightmare\\" is the best album thus far in 2004. Shyne's \\"Godfather Buried Alive\\" definently met and exceeded expectations since it was not tampered with as much of the late great 2pac's music was. These two along with AZ \\"Final Call,\\" the Terror Squad album, and various mixtapes are the only albums to stay in constant rotation, otherwise it is strickly old-school flavor. On another note, as far a consistency from album to album being a group Outkast and Mobb Deep are the epitomy. Both groups from album to album have always had a solid, time-tested, and consistent sound. Not to make this review too long as many are, most of the readers just want a brief reason why they should or should not by the album, but the album is very hot overall, definently consistent with the sound of previous Mobb Deep albums. P.E.A.C.E"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah...","review":"I love Mobb Deep's older stuff, and I don't expect them to create completely dope albums every time they come out with one, but this one didn't do it for me. Too commerical, like a lot of rap these days. I like \\"Win or Lose\\" and the Kayne West song, but the rest just seems like \\"yeah yeah, new album...whatever. now give us our money\\".Every group changes over time, but it seems like nowadays, good rap just turns to pop. But I guess thats just how todays culture works.I highly recommend The Infamous and Hell on Earth over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"From CCNA to CCIE. Great book on routing protocols","review":"If you work with any of the IP routing protocols in Cisco networks (or any other vendors for that matter), you will find this book an invaluable reference tool. The book covers every modern routing protocol in great detail, including IS-IS, OSPF, and BGP. There is also good coverage ofMPLS. One thing I found refreshing (for better or worse) - it's uncluttered. Every chapter is laid out neatly, so it is easy to use the book as a desktop reference or a Cisco certification study guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reference: OK, Study Guide: Not even","review":"I rate this book as being average as a reference, and poor as a certification study guide. It's a good starting point for those who have very little knowledge of routing protocols. It's extremely lacking on depths, scenarios and configuration examples to even be considered as an exam study guide or as job-aid reference point.The only reason why I bought, and spent time reading it, is its coverage on IS-IS and MPLS, which is not easy to come by."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pump, but came with one of hte legs broken","review":"as in the title. it came in a big box, but somehow one of the legs was still broken. doesn't really effect the pump at all, so i didn't return it. all in all a great cheap pump so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not working above 90 psi","review":"I bought this pump for my bike's 700 x 23 tires which require for my weight a pressure of 115 psi. Shamefully this pump was not able to get air in the tire above 90 psi - even when I put my whole weight on the handlebar (fearful of a serious explosion ;-)) nothing happened.I picked a Topeak JoeBlow Max since I was very happy with a very similar model of the same brand of a friend of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far it's a great pump for the price....","review":"I've used this a handful of times to pump up mountain bike tires. I noticed that my conventional dial and digital tire pressure gauges seem to read a different pressure than the gauge on this pump. For simplicity sake, I use the gauge on this pump and have had no issues to date. It's built well for the price and seems to work great for tires that need up to 65psi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike pump","review":"This thing rocks. Very easy to use, but it's kind of scary how many psi you can pump into your bike tires. I actually stopped before hitting the recommended psi pressure of my tires because I thought I was going to end up on TruTV with a horrible reenactment of myself getting smacked in the face with a bunch of rubber. Oh yeah, and 2 days after I finally pumped up my tires, someone jacked them.

I recently built two road bikes and inflating my road bike tires to 100psi is so much work. I have to use all my weight and more when the tires reach 85 psi...I wonder if Amazon will replace this item after 6 months of usage..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after first tire ...","review":"When I received this pump I was pretty pleased with the way that it looked, and it did appear to be a pretty decent looking pump. I was able to inflate the first tire, and the gauges appeared to report the correct PSI. I unhooked it from the rear tire, and began to inflate the second tire and began pumping. I was after a couple of pumps that something sounded like it \\"popped\\" near the PSI gauge, and then I was no longer able to pass air through the pump into the tire. Thankfully Amazon has a fantastic return procedure, and I was able to purchase a second pump and it was on my door less than 2 days after the first pump died. I picked up the Serfas TCPG Bicycle Floor Pump, and it is a much better pump for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars here!","review":"it doesn't work, its made for an entirely different style of tubbing and they don't explain that in their notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best for the $$","review":"People have posted some reviews about having difficulty pumping to > 100 psi. I haven't had this (or any other) problems with the pump. For the money, I think this is the best bike pump out there. I have even had to return two previously for issues.

NOT a 120 psi pump!","review":"Called the company when I had trouble getting more than 90 PSI from this pump. They told me that the label was misprinted! This is a 90 PSI MAX pump, not the 120 PSI printed on the label. These pumps should be recalled!Also, the connector is a pain. It's difficult to connect a presta valve compare to others I've used (Cannondale)."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard to use","review":"I have used the pump that is a step up from this one and have had no trouble getting my tires to 85 psi. I was not able to comfortably use this one; apparently the barrel is a little bigger, which means it pushes more air, and therefore is harder to use. It is probably ok for people of above average strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to inflate above 60 lbs pressure","review":"I used this pump for 2 years and hated it.

I've got a few pump before, and they were all crappy. This is not just only works great, it has the psi meter to measure the pressure. It's much cheaper to get here on Amazon than in the bike store. If you are looking for a pump, then I recommend getting this one. Great price!

Look for another pump unless you want an epic workout filling your tires..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as my Schwinn from 1974!","review":"My 1974 Schwinn air pump had a reservoir which was nice to hold pressure when you remove the pump from the tire valve. Other than that, this pump has it all. It's air volume is very good. About three pumps to fill a brand new 27x1-1/4.Another unexpected but VERY HANDY feature. This is the first tire pump I've ever had with a long enough hose. It even wraps over the top handle to secure on both sides. Nice.Amazingly, it even seems to have an accurate gauge. Probably a lucky sample, though. Get a Syracuse gauge to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"I wasn't sure wether to buy a \\"cheaper\\" pump and save the money but when I received this product I was very pleased.

Once again, great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Overall I am satisfied, but the valve stem attachment is a little cumbersome (hard to attach), but one attached it does work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made and Good Deal for the Price","review":"You can tell the floor pump was made with thought; the air line mounts are placed to where it keeps the pump handle from sliding out when carrying it. For the price it is a well-made, decently heavy duty pump that will not break on you within the first few times of use like some of the cheaper counter parts will. Inflates my mountain bike tires to 60 psi with little effort. Quality purchase and can be used for a lot of different types of inflation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing special - It just works","review":"If you want a simple, reliable, and economical floor pump, you don't need to look any further. It's easy to use, works like you'd expect, and I've not had any problems with it at all. On top of it's basic utility, it also provides the means to store its accessories (alternate hose tips) directly on the pump so that you don't need to risk losing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Blow Max \\"Blows\\"","review":"I've had a Joe Blow Sport pump for 5+ years and it was great. Decided to get a 2nd pump, one for home & family use and one to leave in the car. Based on my old pump & positive general Joe Blow reviews, I bought a Joe Blow \\"Max\\" from the LBS last week, and it blows !Once I get up to 80 psi, I really have to LEAN on it for each stroke to get up to 110. I mean my feet just about lift off the ground ! (I weigh 170)I got my old Joe Blow pump out and tried it ... zip zip zip right to 110 no problem.I am on my way back to the shop to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valves Are Bad, Replace Every 3 months","review":"I've gone through 3 Joe Blow pumps in 9 months. The overall pump is sturdy but the valve falls apart with only minor use in a very short period of time. Lucky for me my local bike shop let me swap them out for free. It's really a crying shame that this company doesn't get it, the valves are just cheap plastic and not on par with the rest of the pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money - but not as good as Sport","review":"The Max II delivers a good value for it's money, it feels solid and has the ability to pump a considerable pressure with ease. Important for my choice for this product was the feature that you do not have switch heads or anything for different types of tyres (presta/schrader/dunlop) .The pressure gauge can be clearly read and the hose feels sturdy. For my purposes (MTB / Road bike and everyday-use-bike) a very good choice for the money, mostly because you don't have to switch heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for road bikes","review":"Originally bought this pump for my mountain bike and it works fine. Have also used it to fill my car tires and works well on them too although takes a ton of relatively easy pumps. Last month bought a new road bike and after my first ride and a few days in the garage tried to bring the tire back up to 100+ psi. OMG, I weigh 200 lbs. and after the first 95 it is so hard to get anything else its almost not worth the effort. If I put all my weight into it and literally lift my feet off the ground with each pump I can get a additional 1 lb. Multiply this stressful effort times 25 pumps and I can finally get 125psi. This pump is garbage for road bike needing anything above 100psi. DONT BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires Excessive Pressure","review":"This pump requires excessive pressure to pump, even at low pressure. At first I thought I had a bad presta valve on my tube, so I didn't return it. Sadly, it exhibits this behavior on all bikes. I've used the next model up (friend owns) and it is much easier to pump. I wish I bought that one. Big disappointment with this. Two stars because it is functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best yet - not","review":"I've used quite a few pumps over the years. I must say I am very pleased with this unit. I'm not sure how long it will last. It's mostly made of plastic so don't abuse it but functionally, it works great. It gets a tight seal with little effort and releases smoothly.Update: after having used this pump for several years I can report it still works okay; however, the plastic threaded fitting where the tube connects to the pump has failed. I managed to get it back on but it's very weak. If the fitting was made of more durable material this would not be a problem but as it's rather soft plastic it's a failure waiting to happen.Update#2: As predicted the fitting has failed completely. I tried using some pipe thread tape to make it work but the tube kept blowing off the fitting when under pressure. It is now history after less than 3 years of light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presta side is useless","review":"Like P. Bahniuk said in his review, I had a hard time getting this pump to go any further than about 80 psi on my Presta valve tires. It felt as same or worse then pumping up a tire with a portable bike pump. Needless to say this pump is useless for my needs.Other then this the pump looks solid and very well built, but I can't say much about its durability since I'm returning it the same day I got it.Again if you have a Presta valve tubes, don't take a chance with this pump. move on to something known to work fine with Prestas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your mouth-it's easier","review":"I rarely write reviews but wanted to spare folks the time and expense of ordering this pump. I will be brief and to the point. I am a serious cyclist and buy good equipment. When my old pump gave out- I jumped on Amazon to get a new one- fast !! This one seemed like it would work- dual head, 120 psi max etc. Here's the deal. The dual head is weak and very hard to fit. The lock lever is awkward to use. If you require 120 psi- you are going to have to jump on this to get it there ! This is at best a pump for the beach cruiser and even then the head really makes pumping your tires up more of a task than it needs to be. If you have kids bikes or a beach cruiser- save your self some $$ and go to Walmart. If you are a cyclist- this pump is not for you. Went to my LBS and purchased a serious pump with 160 psi max and smart head for about the same price-works like a dream. Now I have to spend $$ shipping this one back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Junk","review":"Bought one of these a few months ago and it's been hanging in the garage waiting for me to need to use it. Due to an injury I have not been riding my bike.So today I *try* to use it for the first time. The stupid plastic screw-on ring on the Schrader side of the valve broke as I was operating the locking lever. Of course all the air was let out of my tire by the time!Don't buy! Total junk! This plastic valve is a weak link in what seems to be an otherwise OK pump design.I submitted a ticket with the manufacturer. Depending on how they respond, I will update my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until it started leaking","review":"I used this pump for about a 1/2 year until it started leaking, Now I can't get any air at all into my tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it day I got it!","review":"Disappointing! I couldn't get it to clamp onto the valve stem, and after 20 min of frustration and having all the air released from the tire, I sent it back! It's a shame, I've heard they're good, but I surely couldn't get mine to work, and there's no way I'm going to deal with it everytime I need air!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"bought this and couldn't pump up my tires to 110psi. i had to put all my weight on it and still could barely use it. do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"I've had this pump for 2 years now. I've had to replace the gauge twice. Now the plastic handle part has broken and I have to hold it into the metal tube for it to work. Replacing parts via their support is a slow process - and then the part just breaks again!This floor pump is just poor build quality and will not last. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pump I've owned.","review":"This was the first Topeak product I've owned and it will be the last. The pump states that it is rated up to 120 psi, but it really maxes out around 65 psi even though the gauge says anything higher. For presta valves the head is nearly useless. I bought this pump to use with my road bike, but ended up buying an adapter so I could use this pump's Schrader head. Overall it was a waste of money and I plan on contacting the manufacture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presta nightmare","review":"This thing is junk, if I needed to air up something with <60#'s...then maybe!

Then the hose came off. When putting it back together it was never the same. It did not hold pressure after that. The guage was never accurate. 5lbs off from day one. Then a plastic piece that connects to the barrel broke and the whole thing ended up in the trash after 6 months of use. You get what you pay for $28."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"We bought this pump previously, but my husband accidentally dropped it and in trying to catch it pulled the top off. It's a good basic pump, so I ordered the same one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Features but Poor Construction","review":"I have had many pumps in the past where there is an auto sensing nozzle for presta and schrader valves which fails very quickly. I have had a Ravx and Blackburn Air Tower 2 which I replaced the nozzle with the Joe Blow TopPeak Twin Head replacement and love it. I needed another pump and since this seems to be the only brand with the twin head, purchased this pump. Immediately when I received it, I noticed that it was a very poor construction. Be warned, you get what you pay for, or maybe less with this model. The plastic base wobbles and the air gauge is inadequately attached to the pump. It is suspended from the base, but in no way fixed to the pump at the top and twists. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have made this purchase and looked for another model or brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months and only has a 30 day warranty","review":"Title says it all. Three of the six caster holders on the base of the chair have broken in approximately 2 months. These are little plastic rings molded into the base that you put the stem of the caster wheel into. This results in the caster wheels falling out of the chair base and makes the chair both unsafe and uncomfortable. The only way to repair this is to replace the bottom star on the chair. However, since we are beyond the ridiculously short 30 day warranty we were told we would have to buy another lower half ($25 plus S&H). Bottom line you get what you pay for. We will not be repairing this chair since I can only imagine that it would break again in short order. Spend a little more for a quality product and do not buy this chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely useful book, a little US-centred","review":"The book covers a broad range of topics relevant to choral conducting and choral music, an excellent introduction for someone new to the topic, and mostly practical advice (especially in the rehearsal techniques section).When it gets onto the 'planning and management' sections, I'm frequently reminded that this is a book from the US (for example, discussion of Junior High School choral groups and glee clubs (which is not a concept I know anything about!), but this is a minor comment as the information is still valid for UK conducting experiences.At the end of each chapter there is a suggested bibliography for further research - very helpful if you want to explore a topic further.Now it would just be nice if this book were easily available in the UK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"butchered","review":"This was a miniseries but was cut down to 90 minutes.

I wanted to like this book, it's a great concept! The first chapter is very gripping, however, I just wasn't impressed with anything that followed. While the book is short, it seems repetitive and boring. Furthermore, the characters are very distant and unconvincing. While the entire book is spent following Chuy's ghost and listening to his thoughts and feelings, I never get a feeling of who he really is/was. Another downfall of this book is all the Spanish words thrown into it. Luckily there is a glossary included in the back, but since I *had* to know the meaning of every Spanish word I came across, I was constantly flipping to the back of the book. While it's interesting to study languages and cultures, I don't really think the words added anything to the book and they slowed down the flow of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"he's done it again","review":"i have always been a fan of gary soto, he is an amazing writter, so amazing i cant even describe it, byt he takes hispanic life and turns it into something beautiful so other people can truely see what our culture is about. hes done it yet again with this book the afterlife.

The flat panel (and somewhat heavy) speakers aren't really that bad, but the sub isn't that good. It distorts very easily and I dont reccomend this to music- people.

My OEM speakers didn't have a woofer so i was excited to see the sound difference. Like other reviews have said all the bass comes from the woofer and all the treble from the fronts... i mean ALL though. The mids and highs sound terrible, not even a hint of lows from the two speakers so these only sound good if you are sitting across the room, but then they wouldn't be PC speakers.I know these are only $15 but I prefer my old cheap oem ones with no woofer because the mids and highs are decent and the lows are there but not profound. These are probably good to hookup to your gaming system to help if your TV doesn't produce good lows but for a \\"PC\\" setup... I don't recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for the price, but not for the extremely discerning","review":"They sound really good and they look techy too. The sound is a bit \\"tinnier\\" than I would have liked, but the bass from the subwoofer is great. It comes with a Y-adapter for use with left/right audio cables (like on a Playstation or something). There's a power button, a volume wheel, a bass wheel, and a headphone jack on the right speaker. The bass is automatically reduced along with the volume. The subwoofer plugs into the outlet, the right speaker plugs into the subwoofer and audio jack, and has a permanent (but long) cord connecting to the left speaker. The blue light (on the new model) is a bit gimmicky but looks neat nonetheless. The speakers are magnetically shielded and the subwoofer is not, but it's supposed to go on the floor anyway. The AC adapter is much smaller than usual (and more convenient). For the price, they're a steal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Price, Cheaper Sound.","review":"These are bargain speakers, they are very inexpensive. Here's the thing, the sound like bargain speakers. They crack at high volumes. This is not simple distortion, this is staticky garbled noise. These speakers are adequte for most games, but the don't cut it for music, the trebles crack, and sound tiny. the base sounds empty and garbled. These are not good speakers, they are accepable for low fidelity, low volume listening and for minor sound effects, but anything beyond that is unaceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad sound","review":"I bought these speakers to replace the very poor speakers that came with my system. I didn't want to spend too much for a new set, so I thought I would give the Cyber Acoustics a try.Well, I've learned my lesson, because these speakers sound even worse then my old pair. The base is overpowering and has an artificial pitch. Don't think that just turning the base down will help either; all you hear then is the loud hum it makes.The sound range says it is from 35hz - 20000hz, and that may be true. However, it sounds like the satellites are only 10000hz-20000hz and the subwoofer is 35hz-1000hz.I think you should stay away from any Cyber Acoustic PC speakers. They sound terrible; it's as simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for a low price","review":"After breaking my old speakers, I got these and what sold me was the IPOD connection having an easy access.

But for a tight budget and being a student, these speakers are perfect. Compared to my old speakers that were \\"Insignia\\" which cost 50 bucks new, these are much better. I would highly recommend these speakers to everyone who is looking for a good quality low priced speakers. Based on the sound quality, my friends think i paid much more for these speakers.

The closeups very effective. But it's the singing that counts and Karl Bohm's masterful conducting. It never surprises me to find the best performances when Bohm is involved. This is a powerful and passionate cast.Gwyneth Jones is glorious. Her voice is huge and expressive and she always delivers a well acted and involved performance. The rest of the cast is equally as strong. Gustav Neidling, Josef Greindl, James King and the bigger than life Martti Talvela."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Fidelio meaningful","review":"I too saw this Metropolitan opera production on TV. It is further proof that the production can make all the difference. It also shows that anachronistic productions can make preeminent sense. My first experience of Fidelio was an older, traditional production on VHS, I believe from Glyndenbourne. It left wondering why Fidelio was in the repertoire.This production helped me to understand. It is set somewhere between 1950 and 1970, judging by the dress and guns, in a unidentified fascist state.The only weak spot in the casting is that Florestan (played by Heppner?) is not physically convincing as a starving prisoner. But his singing is fine. Other characterizations are superb. Pizarro (played by someone I don't recognize) is suitably evil.

It worked for .025 seconds but by the time I squeeled and threw it up in the air to look at it -it had shut off again. JUNK< JUNK< JUNK! You get what you pay for. Don't waste your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"At first it seemed ok, despite bad indoor color, blurry images, etc. It was good enough for web thumbnail images, and what do you expect this [cost]? Then a month or so later it started going haywire. Sometimes it would not even turn on. Other times it would turn on, but then shut down as soon as you tried to take a picture. At least I got a USB cable out of the deal. Based on this experience, Argus is the Yugo of digital cameras. Don't waste your time on this...plastic junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't hold your breath","review":"If you have Windows 2000 don't even think about getting this camera. The drivers do not work and the manufacturer won't support you. Their updated drivers do not work either. However, if you have XP or 95 or 98 you'll be fine; the camera pratically sets itself up in fact. The users manual is ONLY on the CD, nothing except a quick-start guide comes printed. If you can figure out a digital watch, you'll have no trouble with this camera. Despite its shortcomings: no preview window, indoor shots come out very green, the flash doesn't throw more than 6 feet, max resolution is 640x480, ANY amount of jostle distorts the picture, and the 4 second lag - despite all that, this camera has its up side: it can hold a lot of images right out of the box, the battery life is good, and the daylight pictures come out nicely. This is a decent camera for kids or for your online auctions. I will never buy another Argus camera after my experience with this item however."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best goth albums of all time---","review":"this is one of the most essential Goth albums of all time...the opening wasteland in my point of view is the best Goth song of all time. the Album includes great songs as Severina , Blood brothers , and love me to death. if you are into bands as The sisters of Mercy , U2 , The editors and HIM then you have to buy this Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"far from comprehensive","review":"The music included in the set speaks for itself. Simply some of the greatest and most important music ever recorded. However,the collection falls short in an important area. If you already have a pretty good Armstrong collection and are trying to fill in the holes don't bother with this set. Almost all of the rarities are missing. It's basically a low cost duplication of material commonly available in other sets. You won't find Satchmo's 1926 sessions with Sippie Wallace or the Lil Armstrong Serenaders session or Satchmo's sessions with Erskine Tate's Vendome Orchestra or any of the other numerous sessions he played on with other artists in the twenties. It seems that once all of the American labels got their Armstrong boxed sets out over the last few years these enterprising folks from Holland simply copied what they'd released and combined the results into this set. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly enough power.","review":"The MiniSync cable is nice. It allows you to power the Zen Xtra while connecting it to your computer. The power adapter that comes with the bundle is tiny though. It only provides 400mA of current. The player will not function on that. It needs to be able to spin up the laptop hard drive that it has inside. The power cord that comes with the device provides 1.5A, almost 4 times what this power adapter is capable of.Don't buy this bundle, instead, buy the MiniSync by itself for charging your Zen Xtra while connected to your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pared-Down Beauty","review":"It's hard to improve upon Mahler's composition, but Schoenberg was also a master-orchestrator as well as composer.

Before I started using them, I was all into testing and switching from one from product to the next -- that's all changed now. I'm a loyal customer and wouldn't dream of changing my regime. I must say that even though I'd faithfully used the foundation products, I hadn't used the Bare Minerals method to do my eye makeup until just recently and have fallen in love once again. Wow! I'm getting older and knew that I needed to adjust my colors and technique just a bit. The Get Started Eyes was a perfect way to get started. I'm a brunette (hair's almost black) with very fair skin. These colors were perfect for me. I've already gotten compliments from friends and rave reviews from family members. I find the directions easy to follow and simple to do.

I do believe I will like the eyeliner if ever I can find the right brush.The only eyeshadow color in this collection that I liked was the Vanilla Sugar. The Peach Puff is orange, the Soft Focus is far too dark for fair skin, it looks like a bruise. I have no idea who can wear these colors but I wouldn't think that anyone who has a fair complexion could.Save your money and buy the eye shadows individually so that you can better choose colors that blend with your complexion.I was very disappointed becuase I have fallen head over heels in love with Bare Minerals foundation and Clear Radiance.

This book is a series of reprints of old (really old, like 1960's) popular mechanics articles. There is no instructional material to speak of in this book, just a series of patterns with minimal detail. I put this book on the bottom shelf underneath old woodcaring magazines, the only reason I didn't throw it in the trash was I had spent the price of a good book on it and hated to see that go to the landfill.

The left speaker just stopped working one day, with no sign of any damage anywhere on the speakers. However, I later discovered the problem was with the wire -- it was probably damaged due to improper storage on my part.Aside from that, the sound quality is good, though they don't go very loud and the woofer can be boomy at times (and there is no way to adjust it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean sound, but highs are overdone","review":"I agree these are a bargain at $20. The bass is fairly impressive for only a 3\\" subwoofer, especially when placed on the floor. The position of the woofer makes a big difference.I wish they'd tone down the treble output since there's no manual control. Extended listening can be fatiguing. The searing highs give great detail and stereo imaging, though. I can now hear quantization noise (crackling) in 8-bit WAV files that I couldn't hear with my previous speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"these can't hold much sound. Though the bass speaker is cool and on-light is cool, they just don't come through with the sound I was hopping for.

But if you'd like a decent little speaker set that won't cramp your space and which makes the most of the little volume it can pump, this is nice.The subwoofer is wood (OK, particle board) not plastic, so you get a nice resonant low end. It's a good value for the price.You might even want to consider this as a travel system for your notebook computer...it seems this new model has a USB power tap so you don't need the wall-wart. Mine is a wall-wart model.DVDs, gaming sound, music, it does it all. It won't do it at ear-splitting volume and the little subwoofer won't rattle the room, but for what it is, it's nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off great...","review":"When I got these speakers, I was surprised at how impressed I was at their quality for the price. Though I've heard better, the subwoofer was pretty nice. The only thing that changed my mind about them is how easily they began to fall apart- And by that I mean, the second speaker often went in and out and I had to adjust and actually tape down the wires a certain way for them to produce sound! It became ridiculous. Also, when other electronics got to close to it made that horrid buzzing sound... I wouldn't readily recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"connector broken in a little over a month","review":"For the money, these speakers sound pretty good. My only complaint is that they stopped working properly in less than 40 days. The subwoofer connector on the back of the main speaker is extremely cheap. it keeps coming dislodged which turns the subwoofer off leaving you with only two tweeters for sound.in short, i wish i hadn't bought these speakers because they don't work. i wish that i had spent a couple extra bucks and gotten something higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Great Sound","review":"I bought these expecting sound that'd be better than cheap 2 channel speakers, but instead I was eager to the turn them off to end the slaughter of my music. The songs from the satellite speakers were muffled and dull, whereas the subwoofer couldn't handle any amount of bass when the volume was turned past 1/4. The construction is cheap plastic, the wires feel cheap, the satellite speakers feel as they are hollow and the sub is downright sloppy. I understand these are cheap speakers, but I feel you'd be better off getting a comparable 2 channel speaker system, the quality will be superior.Overall I was unsatisfied with this product due to its poor sound quality. Since it played music and was easy to hook-up I'll give it a two star rating. Just consider your other options before committing to this set of speakers and don't make the mistake of purchasing them without hearing them first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I recently needed two sets of speakers, one for my new media computer and one for my home office; both are in bedrooms.I got theLogitech S220 2.1 speakersfirst (a little pricier).

No, they are not going to be as good as high quality speakers, DUH! But, they are excellent for the price.

It's a rock classic, unlike any other type of rock band I've ever heard, immediately easy to listen to, yet also holds up well after many listenings. It's music for slow, hot summer days, when you want to just kick back and down a couple brews with some friends. Consider it summer porch music. Another point in its favor: every song on the album is strong - not a single loser. I've never understood why this album has never gotten more recognition.

The flavor of this CD seems to be slightly cheezy yet bland. Unfortunately it sounds like they have main streamed thier sound alot more, and have traded in some of thier funkier grooves for a more \\"commercial\\" and user friendly sound. Perhaps the most dissapointing aspect is the weakness of the Horn section. They have definately taken a blow from the personnel change in the trumpet section. The lines are not as tasty or arranged quite as well as they were under Greg Adams hands, and the lead trumpet sound is not as solid as it once was. In addition, I feel that the drummer was a poor choice for T.O.P. He playing is strait sounding and the electronic effects on his set gives the whole group a commercial 80's sound. Sorry, TOP I've been a fan for years, but this CD is a let down in the music selection and style. Hats off though to Rocco and \\"The Doc\\" for thier always stellar performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfactory all the way","review":"Isaac Stern is, arguably, the best interpreter of classical music there is. His fleshy vibrato and excellent phrasing incorporates his feeling into this set. The Brahms is superb as Stern expresses love, grief, confusion, depression, and eventually redemption throughout the CD. His duo with Eugen Istomin of the Beethoven Violin Sonatas are the best in my library. Same with the Schubert with Daniel Barenboim as his accompanist. Bartok could have been brushed up upon. The intonation was just a tad off. The Franck CD is superb. The Bartok is THE main source for this piece because of Stern's collaboration with the actual composer. All in all, this set ends Stern's legacy with his favorite encores; the best played upon them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I already have the book called 10 smartest decsions a woman can make before 40 so I thought since I have read that one about a 1000 times why not venture and see what this is all about.

The only criticism I have of this album is the absence of \\"Bad Girls\\". If they intended to make this a veritable 70s dance collection CD, this song should not have been omitted or skipped.

The omission of hits like Bad Girls, Love's Unkind and Love To Love You Baby and of great album tracks like Queen For A Day, Working The Midnight Shift, Lucky and Journey To The Centre Of Your Heart detracts somewhat from the promise of the album title. On the other hand, the inclusion of the magnificent MacArthur Park Suite makes up for a lot of what is missing. And this extended version of I Feel Love is worth the price of the album.

Yes some of the other verisons of x-men stink but this one sure doesn't come close to that. I was hooked from the start, Mystique is such a mysterious and in depth character. And I am a women by the way so this isn't just for men, trust me. Yeah there's a lot of boobage, big deal. It's a comic book, there's support to be boobies. My boyfriend loved this too and just because of the sexy blue woman in there, the polt was interesting and just a great change for me. I recomend spending the 14 bucks and giving this a try, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes \\"self-absorbed\\" and \\"inane\\" to new lows","review":"I wasn't sure it was possible in our Jerry Springer world, but Lehr has taken the \\"fun\\" out of dysfunctional! Despite its racy subject (sex), this book is grindingly dull and unreadable. Even skimming it is torturous, given that Lehr has no writing talent and no command of the English language and grammar. (Enough with the hyphens, use of \\"his/hers,\\" and swear words!) I've labored over who-cares memoirs (like Katy Lederer's Poker Face), but Lehr's book redefines the category.I'm left wondering: Which is more ludicrous--that Lehr thought anyone would be interested in reading about her pathetic, immature relationships or that a publisher paid her to write about it? It would all be laughable if Lehr didn't take herself and her situations so seriously. No such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Give Me a Break","review":"I think it's interesting that most of these glowing reviews are from Lehr's hometown, L.A. and that they typically don't include more than two lines.

But she needs an editor and several years in Iowa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have a lower rating than 1 star?","review":"I found this book to be utterly disgusting, and it seems to only serve as a showcase for the author's devout narcissism...I mean, PLEASE spare me the details of her first anal sex probe, intercourse with a bathtub (HUH??) and carelessly wiped ass. Not sexy, just gross. Moving on to the writing style, I found it puerile and bland. What was the publisher thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star","review":"Are you kidding me? Who wrote these 5-star reviews? I'm guessing the answer to my question is: \\"her friends.\\" This book has lines like: \\"Tom was upset, and I was upset. We had a great time.\\" How anyone could sit down and read this entire book is beyond me. Reading about this self-absorbed woman and her husband were almost more than I could take - ugh! Will her next book be about their messy divorce? Please publishers, spare me the details. I do not want to be punished again. Save your money for real writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"A co worker handed me Jennifer's book and said \\"it's kind of like reading someone's diary.....\\", which piqued my interest even before I opened the cover. I found Jennifer's story to be insightful, interesting, humourous and candid. It was well written and a pleasurable read. I enjoyed following Jennifer's journey in trying \\"to get equipped\\" for her sex/love life. There were times when I felt that she was writing about me (which was kind of spooky). I also believe the best things in life are worth working for and I admire John and Jennifer's dedication to each other in searching out the path for true happiness with each other.

I sneaked it into the DVD player while he was in the separate room with his baby daughter. He brought his daughter out to the living room where the music was playing and he seemed absorbed in faraway thought.

For that alone, Tom Kennedy and Alex Harz deserve much praise. It is a remarkable achievement. What makes \\"?\\" a distinctly unnerving viewing experience are those very ideas and perceptions of human existence. This film holds true for people of all ages and from all strata's of society. \\"?\\" opts for a deadpan humor, coaxing us to laugh at these pathetic people not out of affection or understanding, but rather simply as a response to life as they see it. On a first time viewing the sheer despondency of these characters seems to overwhelm the humor, but watching the film again, the humor seemed far more blatant. Obviously this is not a movie for everyone, since this bleak view on human life is clearly not shared by all. But still, this is a work which is undeniably a masterpiece of sorts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Elegant Curve","review":"Before reading this book,I rarely imagine about how elegant can bridges be. Mr. Calatrava brings those imposibilities to people,especially those who never dream. Maybe I should not talk too much,because words can not bring Calatrava's thoughts to the readers precisely.

Each is introduced with cheap sound effects or maudlin music. The reader is hopelessly overdramatic, mispronounces words like \\"coquettry\\" and cheapens the narrative with dripping emotion and weird rhetorical lifts in his voice. Worst of all is the dialogue which, as if in a radio play, is read by a variety of voices, women for female characters, men for male. Accents are over-wrought, turning the dialogue of masters like Twain and Fitzgerald into caricature. These great stories should be read and, if they must be read aloud, done with respect rather than fear that listeners might be bored without cheap theatrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the DVD-LS90 and the H03","review":"We have owned this dvd player for 13 months.

After looking into having it repaired, (cost being from $95-160, depending on what was found) we decided to purchase the LS80 ($155) as we had this model before and had no problems for over two years until our toddler son dropped it and it subsequently stopped working. After reading the reviews, I am not alone in having the \\"Error H03\\" message and a nonfunctional player after the 12 mo. warranty has expired.

It works great. I bought LS91 as a spare. It lasted 1 day before developing a crack where the hinges are. Before I returned it, I tried all kinds of DVD with different formats. Some formats do not play on LS91, I guess that is why it's cheaper than LS90 although when you compare the specs from manufacturer, they are identical. It could be that the LS91 cuts corner on the quality of the product to make it cheaper (maybe that is why there was a crack developed after one day although the LS91 I got could be a lemon to start with)."},{"rating":"1","title":"HO3 finds me","review":"This was a pretty good product until the HO3 error message hit.

The album does not suffer from the overproduction that I feel happens when Bill Laswell involves himself in any project. The texture is nicely layered and everyone plays out, but with an undeniable cohesivness. It's worth spending the $12 sum just for track two which begins with a great drum solo, transforms into melodic mayhem, and rotates around a motif which sounds like a post Barrett Pink Floyd flag waver wich actually sounds good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Good little notebook to hold any notes.

During some games, movement was hindered by a constant pulling to one side or obscured by random screen scrambles.Secondly, the controls are not the same. It's impossible to play most of these Intellivision games correctly with a Nintendo-style controller. The sports games were impossible. Without the original controls, most of the original playability was lost.Lastly, the games seem gutted or \\"dumbed down\\" for this device. It may be just my faulty memory, but I remember many of these games being more involved.

Unfortunately, the film is just that horrible. The heavy-handed melodrama, constant sappy ballads, hammy overacting (except for Andie McDowell who was actually pretty good) and an endless flood of overwrought sobbing and breast-beating just made it unwatchable.

Crusoe's enormous industriousness is still impressive, even though one must allow for the fact that he had absolutely no time restraints. Yet he never got into a funk, always remained busy, a lesson for us all. It was far more religious and proselytizing than I had ever supposed, with many, many paragraphs on God, religion, morals, etc. And it is obvious why most editions leave out Crusoe's return to society, as the battles with the wolves and bear are kind've silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic","review":"I never read this one somehow.

A man from a middle-class upbringing leaves it and ends up stuck on a tropical island. This story would inspire Swiss Family Robinson, Castaway, and probably Lord of the Flies. Mr. Crusoe is a white, Englishman with a wife and kids. After the wife dies, he leaves the kids to go on his own and to serve God. He ends up stuck on an island by himself. There he encounters cannibalistic natives, and one of their intended victims. The former scares him, and he essentially enslaves the latter, teaching him to call him Master.The book is not that interesting, as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but cashing in","review":"Everybody knows the story (that's why it's a classic) but few normal readers know the real story. Indeed, Crusoe is stranded on an island but, in fact, he uses his middle-class background to attempt to make profit and he ends up owning the island!! Sorry, that ruins the traditional idea of what the novel is about but really it was a way for Defoe to cash in...Robinson Crusoe is also a very boring read (unless you enjoy reading microscopic details of making wheat) because of its language and because nothing much happens and also all the religious stuff. If you're not religious you'll hate this, if you like modern novels you'll hate this - but you still have to appreciate the impact that this novel has had (on the minds of children anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ THIS!","review":"Boring, tedious, verbose, rambling, yawn.

The book has a strong religious theme, as was Defoe's intention. However, this version of the text censors out some of the language against what Defoe called the Papist Church (or the Roman Catholic Church) as well as some items which would be considered racially insensitive today (but leaving in much of it as well). I don't understand why this version leaves out some of those parts, as they completely change the story that Defoe intended.

But after what happened, I won't be taking it any more for now.It was mentioned by one doctor that it is unclear what this product may have contributed to.

A total headache when your rushing out to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well... for a week","review":"This product worked great for a week. Then, I couldn't get it to turn on. The instructions say to call the manufacturer in the case of problems, so I did so. They told me to press the button really really hard. I pressed it as hard as I could but it would not turn on. Then they said to submit my information (proof of purchase, nature of the problem, etc) to get a new version of the coffee maker which does not have this problem. So, I did so and got a brand new coffee maker. I never got bad service from the seller or the manufacturer, but this product was really sub-standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"So wonderful that I bought two!","review":"I love this product. First, it's much cheaper than other single cup brewers, and this one will let you use any brand of pod so that you can buy what's on sale. I also like that it has the option of using pods or grounds - I haven't seen others that can do this. I have one on my desk at work (that others use, too) and one at home for that one cup at night when I don't want to make an entire pot (no more wasted coffee at my house anymore!). One of my co-workers was so impressed that she bought one, too. I've had both of mine for over a year, and they have each been used several times a week and still make a delicious cup of coffee every time. I still can't get over the price. I would agree that the only drawback is that some of my mugs don't fit, but most of them do."},{"rating":"2","title":"great single cup of joe","review":"I received this machine for christmas because my wife knows that i usually get one cup of coffee in the middle of the day at work. This machine is easy to use and works great. It works using the home cafe pods well, but i tried the Melitta java pods, and i got brown water. The Melitta pods state that they are designed exclusively for use with \\"the one:one coffee maker\\"You can get most coffee flavors using the Home cafe pods though. Pods may not be the most cost effective way to make coffee, but it sure is easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pro-Stalinist, postmodern nonsense.","review":"Kotkin has tried to do too much with this book. What could have been an excellent history of the making of Magnitogorsk becomes an overdrawn, theoretically flawed attempt to make insights of questionable value. The heavy reliance on Foucault leads nowhere (as all work based on Foucault's writings does), and results in some ridiculous and useless speculations which I don't even want to entertain. The main premise is that in spite of the fact that Stalinism resulted in the death of millions, it was still progressive and forward-looking throughout. Go figure...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history","review":"This is an incredible work of scholarship that is also incredibly entertaining.

However, there's one small inconvenience. While the size of scanner window can accommodate about three lines of printed text, only one line is scanned each time.

This will greatly save scanning time and muscle strain. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"I admit I'm a sucker for technology. But this is pretty cool. I've only had it a couple of days, but with practice the accuracy is very good, much better than I expected actually.

I've returned to school part time and I think this will save a lot of time, allowing me to scan in terms and definitions to study on my PDA. This also is definitely a good price.

The 600 makes many errors when scanning. And, while it's easy to edit the errors once you've beamed it over to your PC, it's incredibly time consuming.

Kids have fun with it. But there really should be more games. The Barbie version has quite a few more. There are only 6 games, and two of them are just locating letters or numbers on the keyboard. Granted, it teaches them how a real keyboard is laid out, but I was very disappointed that there was no counting game. They call it counting, but it's not, it's just locating a number. For example, they will show 3 apples and then say, \\"3 apples, can you find the number 3\\". That's not really counting.Other than that, it's cute, and not every toy has to be 100% educational. Even without the counting, memory or music games (that barbie has), this toy is a lot better quality, and kids still have fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Educational Choice for the Princess in Your Life","review":"I bought this laptop for a four year old and she absolutely LOVES it.

It kept her busy just punching the keys for some time. The screen is a little small so she doesn't pay attention to it really, at least not right now, maybe later.

The opening was really cool. It got the scariest when I got to the school and little zombie children were chasing me around with knifes.I played this game with the lights off and I slept with the lights on. This game is about a normal man named Harry, who is looking for his missing daugther Cheryl in a town called Silent Hill I think that this game is not for the queasy at heart, this game contains scenes of violent images and has a lot of jumpy parts.Unlike Resident Evil, which I do love too, the control are not awful, and Harry is just a regular guy, with no experience with a gun, and he has no idea what is going on, which makes it 10 times scarier than ANY Resident Evil game. I think if you want a game as close to a horror movie as possible, this is the game for you. Go buy it when you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible game. Brand new $20 on konamis website","review":"To start off this game is insane. It gets into your head like no other form of entertainment. I haven't played this for about 2 years yet I still have dreams about it...not nightmares just crazy dreams. This game has incredible atmosphere and upon playing it you will forget about its dated graphics and be totally immersed in the story. That said, this isn't for the faint of heart, but its INCREDIBLE!. Anyways the people who are selling this game for $40+ dollars are ripping you off. Buy it new on Konamis website for $20...actually it might be $30, but still its way cheaper than what all these people on amazon are trying to sell it for...$70? *shakes head*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy but not gory","review":"Silent Hill was a fun game and not overly long. The anticipation of the monsters sneaking up on you was worse than the monsters themselves. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy suspense and chills rather than blood and gore like Resident Evil. The dialogue was a bit silly and the big monsters were not very scary but the general uneasy feeling you have as you explore the game was exciting. There is such a feeling of relief after you complete anything in the alternate universe and it is daylight again. I wish the endings made more sense but it was still worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best horror game ever!!!!!!","review":"The original Silent Hill was a superlative addition to the horror genre. I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series, but Silent Hill is a pure horror game. RE is horrible, but the events are caused by scientific experiments gone bad. SH is linked to black magic, drug use, self-loathing, and paranoia. In this game, you never really know whom to trust and believe. Even after playing the game about 50 times, I still was not sure exactly what was going on. This is a game you could actually write a dissertation about (Don't laugh-- I've heard of people doing this).All in all, this game ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't play this game after midnight.","review":"The first day I got this game, I played it until way after midnight.

I did like the settings however in the fog and snow and using the flashlight, I think that added to the suspense but resident evil 2 and the nememsis does scare the hell out of you at times where silent hill never did. Once you play resident evil its hard to surpass that quality in graphics and gameplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm....WHATTTT","review":"so...im lookin at this...and i see a pic of a boatWHAT THE HELL DOES A BOAT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS GAMEi hate boats...i was gonna but a new sealed copy.....now i wont cuz of this boatthanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"because Resident Evil is stupid","review":"Although outdated, this game is a true classic. The Silent Hill series is an intelligent and more sophisticated alternative to Resident Evil. While it may not have the same level of fun as blowing the heads off of hordes of zombies, the rich, unsettling environments combine with eerie sounds and genuinely disturbing (as opposed to just plain gross) monster designs will draw you into the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"still freaky after all these years","review":"just went back to dust off my copy of silent hill that i beat many moons ago... playing it now at first i was taken aback at how chunky the graphics were. this wasn't how i remembered it. the silent hill i remembered was vivid, disturbing, and insomnia inducing. it was a town i went to visit but wouldn't like to stay in.now i noticed the repeating textures and areas. the pixelated gradients in the shading. and of course the famous annoying controlls that had me cursing at the damn pink pteridactyl swooping onto my head again.but by the time i got to the school i'd assimilated myself, i was back in silent hill. now i'll probably stay till the end of the game.there are so many thoughtfull details that absorb you and take you to another (very scary) place. the dated graphics don't matter. this is a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Scary can a game get?","review":"There is a diffrence between fear and surprise.Resident Evil{My favorite gaming seris}surprised you.This game put me on the brinkof [wetting] my pants.The sound is the scariest thing of thegame.Espically the air raid siren.Everything about this game isgood.{It has 5 Endings!}I reccomend this game once Amazon gets somecopies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Hill","review":"This game is not like any other.

Alternate endings make the game more exciting each time you play. AWESOME GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Silent Hill doesn't jump out at you from all sides, or leave you in boredom. Instead, Silent Hill is a slow leaning curve into gaming hell.Harry Mason is off on vacation with his daughter, Cheryl.

When he awakes Cheryl is gone. His search for her will lead him through Silent Hill's diserted streets into a hellish world, where the town's secret is found.Silent Hill is a good, disturbing game who's puzzles may be the best part of it. They aren't all the search and find type. Most of Silent Hill's puzzle actually take brains *gasp* to figure out.With a good replay value, Silent Hill is a definate buy for the sirvival horror game fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Chilling","review":"Oh my god, this game was scary! The designers did a brilliant job in setting up a sort of drowning, oppressive atmosphere of fear and darkness. I played this game with the lights off, and couldn't get to sleep until I turned the lights on that night!The graphics, while a bit grainy, support the dreamlike state of this game. The lighting effects used were simply superb.And the sound is the clincher. There isn't any real music to speak of, just the background sounds of a nightmare world. This even furthers the creeping dark that pervades every scene in this game.The plot, while confusing, is very intricate and extremely brilliant. I asked an English grad student to play this game once, and we talked about the story...there are so many complex layers, it could easily the plot of a well written horror novel.I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but sweet","review":"I must admit, i didn't think much the first time i put this game into my playstation. after playing for an hour or so though, i was completely engrossed in the deep horror story of Silent Hill, since then it has become one of my favorite games"},{"rating":"2","title":"love by any other name............","review":"i love this game.it is scary.....sad.....and just the best ever.the stoy line will have you hooked.it claws at your emotions.the sound if off the wall freakie.the graphics are very good.They picked good voice actors.I do not sugguest this game to anyone who scares easly.other then that PLAY THIS GAME~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychological Horror at it's best","review":"A creepy, weird, gruesome, grotesque game. Plays much like the old Resident Evil games, and if you have played the games after this one, I recommend you check this one out. It was the one that started it all after all. The graphics are not necessarily good, but they aren't bad. They are just PS1 graphics, and they have aged pretty well. The gameplay is a bit more sluggish in comparison to the newer versions.

The controlls are horribal and you have to use a flash light for most of the game! Even when youre not in total darkness you can only see about 6 feet in front you! Now I'm a huge Resident evil series fan and I would definitly choose resident evil over this game. One of the most disturbing thing about this bad excuse for a game is that they have nude zombie children that stab you with kitchen nives what the hell is up with that?

I should have listened. This is a poorly executed version of Resident Evil with none of the careful prep or imagination. I would rather dig out my eyes with a dull spoon than have to watch any of the video in this one again. Some of it was interesting. Most of it was confusing at best--all of it was inane. I loved all of the rooms without any possibility of ever entering them. You don't find that in Resident Evil. If they have a room in Res Evil, there is a reason for it.

What is all the talk about this game being SO scary? There were a couple of scenes that made me flinch ever so slightly but nothing that made me jump and gasp like RE does. Putting something in fog and darkness DOES NOT automatically make it scary! Some of the puzzles were somewhat interesting to solve but did not require a lot of time and effort to do so. I can only say that this game is MEDIOCRE at best. For those of you who found this game SO scary I suggest you play Spyro or the Crash series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Hill","review":"Well I have owned Silent Hill for about 2 days and im already loving it. The Whole game gives you the creeps. Its like Resident Evil with better and more difficult puzzles,easier controlls,better story,better scary elements. Its scarier then any movie I have ever seen.

I even had a good time doing it.

Anything more than casual reading will see the pages plumb fall out.While there's a certain amount of poetic justice to this - it's a reminder, a propos of Hegel, that the material instantiation will fall away, leaving the essential, conceptual core in its wake - that's cold comfort after paying $35. I would recommend, if at all possible, that you try to find a hardcover edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the binding...","review":"Having finished all of the labyrinthine Phenomenology of Spirit, I ordered his Science of Logic. Having received it in the mail promptly and in good condition, I began to peruse through the 'matter in hand.' Not 5 minutes had passed before it began to 'sunder' itself away from its binding; before I finished Hegel's prefaces entire chunks of this text were splitting apart from itself. I don't understand how the publisher could have thought this could hold up for all the use it inherently would have to go through for a proper study of this text. Study Hegel, yes. Study the green and white \\"Science of Logic,\\" not unless you want to read it with the 800 page book falling apart as you glance through the table of contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for trickster pseudo shamans","review":"It might be useful to know that while these books are written as first hand accounts of actual events there is much to be questioned in them. First most of the accounts of the amount of time he spent in the \\"village\\" seem to be greatly exaggerated. Those of us who remember when the books of Carlos Castaneda came out, and who cared enough to look into his claims, soon uncovered them as a hoax. Stand warned, the differences between these books and those of Castaneda is that Prechtel did seem to have \\"some\\" actual contact with a shaman and did spend \\"some\\" time in the \\"village\\" however from there it become impossible to sort out what is fact and what is fiction and if you are reading it as fact you are likely to be disillusioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"America's Game is a wonderful series produced by NFL films that follows each Superbowl winning team through their season. The other reviewer seems to think this series is about the Superbowls themselves, which it is not. I highly recommend this series to fans.(Check it out on Hulu for free!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Actual Game","review":"This is a 55 minute documentary about the season leading up to Superbowl XXIII. The game summary never mentioned Tim Krumrie's game changing injury or the 49ers' amazing defensive stand when the Bangals had 1st & Goal inside the 5 and walked away without scoring. This is one of my most disappointing purchases - especially considering the product description at the time explicitly stated that it was the actual game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Dissapointment","review":"This is total false advertising. The dvd contains a lot of information about the 49ers 1988 season, but almost nothing about the actual Super Bowl. The Bengals are barely even acknowledged, while only a few minutes of the game are actually shown. It hardly mentions anything that happends before the final drive.This should have included informatin about both teams and shown the entire Super Bowl from start to finish. Instead it makes it seem like Super Bowl XXIII only had one team and the game only lasted a few minutes. What a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative introduction to submarine life & WW2 Warfare","review":"There is little I can add to the previous reviewers' coments in praise of this terrific little book - all of their comments are precisely right on the money. I, too, read this book at the age of nine and it led to a life-long interest in the boats and my own service in ballistic missile submarines circa 1980. Oddly enough, the atmosphere of cameraderie and professionalism White portrays in his book turned out to be a surprisingly accurate reflection of actual submarine life, albeit cleaned up for a more innocent audience. In spite of a couple of technical errors (which really don't detract at all from its strong points), I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up Periscope - Great submarine WW2 yarn","review":"This is a very good story about a young man on an important mission against the Japanese in World War II. He must be ferried on a submarine which has its own problems. The author also wrote Silent Ship, Silent Sea, one of my favorite stories. This book has been out of print for awhile and has always been overshadowed by Beach's Run Silent, Run Deep. But check it out if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"This was a great read. For a 1956 submarine thriller novel White is masterful and cunning. The story is very well planned and presented with wonderful writing. I would love to read something one these same lines for todays world. If you can stand the idea of reading a book from the 50s, you will love this book. Original price was 50. WOW, wish they were all that cheap now-a-days."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Router Table (only?)","review":"I've been reading router review articles and web sources for some time now. I bought this model, because the PC7518 is obviously the industry standard high-power router to stick in a router table. All the accessories, router lifts, etc. come standard for this model. For me, it's too big and heavy to use in hand, so there was no reason to get (and pay for) a fixed- or plunge-base -- I just wanted the motor, and that's what the 75182 model is. Mine is going into the router table and staying there, so it's the best choice for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Router","review":"This is the second Porter-Cable router I have had and they are great work horses.

So some of the packing was in and around the inside of the fan motor, and also the power cord was cut by the motor moving around in the box. The second one was better but the switch and the strainrelief was not the same as the first motor. I hope the second one is a new motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"Assumed it was the router to buy, but the runout at the collet was so bad, my table started walking away with the router on.

Is a major let down, before you purchase a series it should be divuldged that some episodes won't be allowed to download, or will only download the edited for t.v. versions, and then let you decide if you still want to purchase the series. I am very disappointed that I cannot finish the Darkest, Before the Dawn (NOT AVAILABLE??) Two parter, but have been charged for the episode that follows. This is bogus, and not an issue solely found on Amazon, other streaming services I have also practice this underhanded policy.

Like Cold Mountain, it is sad. I suppose that what happened to the Indians being routed out of their homes and moved west was just a story until you read this heart breaking tale of what happened. Frazier makes all the details come alive. Certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirteen Moons better than reviews","review":"The early reviews knocking Thirteen Moons were off the mark. I think the reviewers did not understand the culture of the times and simply missed many of the subtle points Frazier makes. Sort of like a non-golfer reviewing a golf book and missing the point of \\"chunking a shot\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good to Put Down","review":"Thirteen Moons is a most extraordinary story, set before, during, and after the Civil War (War Between the States, for you Southerners). The action takes place mostly on the frontier of the day, in the Smokey Mountains and environs. The plot is excellent, combining a tale of survival, with history and discovery. There are few books that include the Cherokee point of view, as well invading immigrants' activities. It had me completely absorbed, and resenting intrusions, like eating, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate reality","review":"Thirteen Moons gave me what I want from good fiction; the chance to sink into another reality. Charles Frazier so aptly depicts another time with geographic details and vivid and complex characters. It is effortless to enter the world he has created on paper. His poetic phrases and the depth of his character, Will, stroke the mind. I actually enjoyed it more than Cold Mountain, and appreciated the somewhat lighter tone. The story ebbs and flows just like real life. It is beautiful writing of a fulfilling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"Great book. I thought it was even better than \\"Cold Mountain\\". It kept my interest all the way though and I loved the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abridged version is confusing","review":"I bought this book as an audio book, abridged.It was confusing. Stick to the unabridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book would not download","review":"I truly enjoy the rapid dowloading of books to my Kindle. I've purchased, downloaded, and read many books this way. But this book would not download, no matter what I tried and even with the assistance of live tech support. If anyone can tell me how to unlock this book, I would love to read it because I've already paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Cold Mountain, but still good","review":"Probably one of my favorite books in life is Cold Mountain. When I saw that Mr. Frazier had written another book, I was anxious to read it. It was very good. Very, very good.....but it was not Cold Mountain. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, don't get me wrong, but I doubt I would list it among my favorite books in life....but then, only a very few books make that list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Wait or the Read","review":"I so looked forward to this novel after including \\"Cold Mountain\\" among the best books I have ever read. \\"Thirteen Moons\\" is a yawner and a major disappointment from an author who brought us so much with his first novel. \\"Cold Mountain\\" the film did not come close to capturing the essence of Frazier's words, so don't judge that book by the film. I waded through 400+ pages of \\"Thirteen Moons\\" and waited for something to catch my imagination and interest. It never happened. The love story? - In a strange way, it reminded me of Harry Chapin's classic \\"Taxi,\\" but again, Chapin did a far better job of touching my heart than Frazier did. Unfortunately for Frazier, there are far too many more novels worth reading to come even close to moving \\"Thirteen Moons\\" onto the 'must read' list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectation.","review":"After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirteen Moons","review":"I also loved Cold Mountain, one of my favorite books, and could hardly wait to read Charles Frazier's new novel. However, I was very disappointed. Yes, he writes beautifully, but I agree with other reviewers that the story was dull and uninteresting. I wasn't convinced that Will truly loved Claire, because their relationship was so shallow. I'm sorry I can't recommend that anyone spend time reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Well worth the wait from Charles Frazier. Lush and wondrous description of the physical terrain. Nice to experience the story of the Cherokee Nation from a different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"First half okay","review":"The first half was pretty good, the second half was not. Is this what you get when a successful author (Cold Mt.) gets paid in advance for a second novel. (Shades of Sarah Gruen & Ape House)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening Sweet","review":"I agree with every word from the Washington Post review above.There was something sickening about this book. It was as though the author, previously praised for his writing, blatantly attempted to top it, but instead went too far over the top. Narrative description is filled with sickening sweet similes and metaphors, like a cup of coffee with ten spoons of sugar. With every line, instead of telling the story, we have to traverse all these similes, images, and metaphors. There can be too much of this. It slows the pace to a slither. Few books turn me off enough to the point that I'd say I'd never re-read it, but this is one of them. Not to mention a plot that made watching that paint dry a real joy. It bored me to sleep.If anyone doubts what publisher marketing can do, look at this one. There are thousands of books light-years better than this that never get recognition due to marketing and exposure. I think I've had my fill of this author for one lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who the hell is Claire?","review":"a mysterious girl named Claire.... we never found out who she is, whatmakes her tick... is it possible Mr.Frasier had no idea either?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally agree","review":"Yes, I like Cold Mountain\\", yadayada, but I found this the worst drag of reading I have experienced in a long time. I read 350 pages out of 400 and just closed it once and for all. There is totally nothing to this book other rambling and poor characterizations. The author rode his reputation into this book and ultimately damaged it in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production problems","review":"I recieved two copies of this book. All pages on both books were not cut correctly leaving and uneven set of pages showing. I was told (by Amazon) not to send the first book back because of the frieight costs. However the second copy arrived with the same problem. I have now been told that the further charges are due. I have responded advising i don't want the books and will send them back at your cost. Please sort this out. Will you repay the return frieght if i send them back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalization","review":"Doesn't Charles Frazier know that the first letter of every important word in a title should be capitalized? If he's making basic capitalization errors on the cover, well that doesn't give me much faith in what's inside. I'll bet it's pretty lousy. I say this is a terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about a zero star rating!","review":"Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story. Could/Would not finish--too many \\"better\\" books waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but I'm sooooo bored","review":"I've read all the glowing reviews here and I will say that I loved Cold Mountain. I'm only 1/2 way through Thirteen Moons and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to finish it. It is so boring that I read pages and pages and realize that I have no idea what I've just read! It might as well be a book on economic theory for all the pleasure it is giving me."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovetoread","review":"I didn't like Thirteen Moons as much as I liked Cold Mountain and Nightwoods, however the story was good, and interesting. Fraizer takes us on a look at how the Indians in the mountains were living, and how they were betrayed by the United States government. It also gets lost in the gentlemen's love life as well. I did indeed like learning more about Indian culture, something which our government could have care less about, or these people would not have been forced from ther homes and sent out West. It was a new take on an old moment in the history of this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing effort","review":"This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort. I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end. The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out. I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting at first, then a total downer","review":"Starts off with a very real depiction of life at the place and time of the novel. That's the interesting part. It slowly devolves into an (spoiler) unappealing read. I found myself asking, why keep reading this, I have better things to do and read. And at the end, an old man with his memories doing futile actions against the modern world. What's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Much Better","review":"Since Cold Mountain is one of my favorite books in recent memory, I was expecting the same long, descriptive and provacative passages in Thirteen Moons. I was sadly disappointed to the point I almost didn't finish the book. It did not hold my interest. The story jumped around a lot and I thought the character development was weak. I did not get the feeling of time and place when reading this novel. Maybe it's not fair to compare his sophomore effort with Cold Mountain, but it seemed like some one other than Frazier wrote Thirteen Moons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"Loved Cold Mountain. But this book - very long and slow and boring. This book could have been a barn burner, but it just plodded along and never really had any moments of excitement at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I absolutely loved Cold Mountain and found it hard to put down. I found it difficult to pick this book up. Charles Frazier is so vivid in his descriptions you truly feel as if you are standing beside the main character. The only problem is the book doesn't take me anywhere. It just seems to drone on and on and I found myself getting bored reading it. Sorry but for me this book lacks the excitement of his first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ConstantCritic","review":"I have read all the reviews of this book in order to see if I have somehow missed the point. There is no argument that the author has impressive skills in creating a mood, a picture or an interesting anecdote. His first work was a Civil War version of the Canterbury Tales and each encounter added to the content of the whole and to a suspenseful conclusion. This novel wanders aimlessly, giving no satisfaction either to the plight of the Cherokee or to the substance of the main character or his relationships. The meanderings are irrelevant to any insight to the main character. His relationships to the other characters are shallow and lead nowhere. I had the feeling that Frazier tired of his story just as the colonel tired of his life. The ending is as boring as the previous 200 pages. Perhaps Frazier should write short stories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it twice","review":"A love story. Set in the 1800's and full of history.

I was only a bit comforted to find I was not alone when I read a review from the Washington Post that suggested the book would put millions of readers to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Moons","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I had enjoyed reading the author's previous novel, Cold Mountain. 13 Moons had some interesting information about the American Indians, but I'm not sure if the information was fact or fiction. The book seemed somewhere between a novel and a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Shallow Storytelling","review":"What a disappointment!! Very superficial character development- one really gets no sense of Bear or Will beyond the simple chronicling of events. Extremely boring-I forced myself to finish this. I expected to gain insight into the forced emigration of the Cherokees, personal survival or depth of character,etc. but this read like a newspaper article rather than a novel. Nothing of depth except trite aphorisms which seemed unoriginal. I can;t believe anyone would call this a great NOVEL.Infuriatingly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"This is probably the most boring book I have read in my life. Charles Frazier did an immaculate job with Cold Mountain, however \\"Thirteen Moons,\\" was very disappointing. I'll give the author the benefit of a very well researched book that takes place in Appalachia. The author does give vivid details about the environment in which the story takes place. Sadly there is no plot and no real feeling of attachment to any of the characters in the novel. There are so many great reads out there. Don't waste your time starting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Stellar. The first person narrative of that comprises this story was compelling, and expertly done. I would typically not consider myself a fan of storylines set in frontier America in the 1800's, however, Frazier, like an actor who \\"dissapears\\" into a role, thoroughly immerses the reader in beautiful prose using the vernacular of the day. The themes are uniquely American - manifest destiny as American pushes west from the original 13 colonies, north vs. south, and the compelling and ultimately tragic story of the systematic relocation of American Indians from east to west...One of those books I am sorry to see end."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Tension and Arousal Needed, Great Story Telling","review":"I am a reader who enjoys how a story is told as much as a good plot. One of Fraziers talents is using restraint, yet nailing the point through understatement. From a story-telling aspect, Frazier is excellent, but the plot did wander and without much tension or arousal in most aspects. I want Frazier to tell another love story. I'd read it just to hear his approach. Listening to Frazier on CD is even more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and flat characters","review":"I started this book because our book group is reading it. The character is flat and self-absorbed. You get to the point that you don't care what happens to the character because he is so dull. I don't finish it because there was nothing of interest to keep me going.......You feel nothing for the characters... so why read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring \\"story,\\" but a very good word master","review":"I do wish Frazier would have had some sort of plot in this novel, because, as in \\"Cold Mountain,\\" his skill with prose and description is outstanding. Actually, I think he would do better writing prose poems instead of novels. I read the first couple hundred pages waiting for the story, and then the rest of the boring book waiting for the end. I just wish I didn't feel obligated to finish reading books I start."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved Cold Mountain, but this book was a crashing bore","review":"Every negative thing you've heard about this book is true - unfortunately. While Cold Mountain easily ranks among my Top 10 Favorite novels, this definitely ranks among my least favorite. What a disappointment. Yes, the book has it moments where the writing genius prevalent throughout Cold Mountain shines through, but those moments are few and far between. Call it the sophomore jinx, or attribute it to the fact that the $8 million Frazer received as advance quenched his creative fire. Call it what you want. This book just doesn't add up and is a waste of your time. The story line and Native American history is fascinating, but the novel meanders and plods, and just never gains any sense of rhythm or momentum. There is little evidence of the writing chops that earned Frazier the critical acclaim he so richly deserved for Cold Mountain. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Empty Story","review":"I am a fan of Cold Mountain, but I have to say that I am disappointed with Charles Frazier's latest novel, \\"13 Moons.\\" I have tried to read this book four times, and I cannot get past the second chapter. I feel the book is so empty and full of useless writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This book was different than i thought it would be.It gave a lot of insight about the times of the early settlers and indians.Woman had a rough time trying to cope with men.The way the character told the story about how he lived was interesting. The way you became a lawyer back then, it was a wonder anything was settled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite nitpicks, an excellent novel","review":"There is a review of Thirteen Moons at About.com that I agree with for the most part -- the novel builds your expectations for a story of (failed) romance, but instead becomes, in its last third, a sort of fictional autobiography in which the narrator, Will Cooper, seems content to reside in reflection and quirk much more so than his persona does in that great first portion. I agree too that it had the potential to surpass Cold Mountain. That said, the novel is still greatly evocative of lives and lifestyles lost to the progress of westward-bound Americans. My only complaint is that I wish Frazier had taken as much time to conclude this great story as he did to build it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rambling mess","review":"I really thought this book would be better than Cold Mountain, which I enjoyed. As I got deeper into the book, Frazier's narrative got repetitive and unfocused. The story, while interesting at the start, kind of fell apart and got monotonous and boring. Frazier has a hard time with character development. His characters are wooden and Will keeps changing his story. Frazier could have done so much more with this book rather than dwelling on words like \\"slanting sunlight\\" and \\"moist poplar leaves falling to the ground. It seems like he just said to hell with the story and faced an approaching deadline without doing any more research on the cherokee nation. I don't know if I'll be able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something too?","review":"Like an earlier reviewer, I wonder what I missed that others did not.

I recommend that you not waste your valuable time reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"One really wonders just what happened here. Although the first 1/4 of this book is tolerable--if farfetched--the remainder is simply bizarre. It is rare for me not to finish a book but this was ridiculous! What a waste of time. Did enjoy Cold Mountain, tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved \\" Cold Mountain\\" and kept plugging away to see if the plot(?) improved or the characters became more real. Too \\"artsy\\" in the long discriptives. What is sad I bought 2 copies and sent them for Christmas presents before I realized the book was not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirteen tries","review":"That is about how many times it took me to get this book started. Charles Frazier obviously loves the Appalachians and their history, but he shouldn't be the one to write about them.He tried to have folksy prose, which is appealing when written by Mark Twain and others with the talent to pull it off. Often a sentence would start off wonderfully, but end up running on and destroying all of the effects. Frazier was obviously in need of some editing, but probably loved every word too much to cut it out.Instead of letting his characters speak to each other, he wrote their thoughts directly to the reader. This made it feel like a lecture and not a story. Many of his characters thoughts actually felt like Frazier speaking to you. This helped make his characters flat. If people did not find them that way, it is probably because they have a better imagination than Frazier.There will be people who like this book and his style, but I am very sure that this book will be forgotten over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirteen Moons","review":"This book on my iPad Kindle was a terrible read.If I had purchased it in hardcover I would have returned it.What a waste of money and I am pissed off at myself for paying the outrageous price this e-book cost me.;("},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice game, but buggy","review":"My nine year-old daughter liked playing this game, but the program is filled with too many bugs & glitches.

Lily Harper isn't an exception although she is exceptional.This is a great story of love, hurt, forgivness, and survival. I truly enjoyed ever aspect of this book, and I am glad to see that the woman is sometimes the survivalist and the man is the one lost in the wilderness. This is a very enjoyable novel, and a very quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Liked the Dogs...","review":"This story was slow to begin with, then excruciatingly slow with the rescue and Matt Star's agony in the wilderness. Lily Harper is NOT charming; she's boring, silly, and screams a lot like a teenager with PMS. The dialog goes too far explaining things to the reader as if they're too slow to understand this formula read without longwinded explanations and, in the end, the one character I truly did have interest in, Betsy Collins, turned into another Lily. Just what we need.I will give Michaels kudos for making the dogs Buzz and Gracie so smart, loyal, and likeable. She proves by her treatment of those two characters that she is a dog lover, and that scores big points in my book. Still, sorry Fern, you've written a few good books; unfortunately, this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and immature","review":"I can't believe anyone would like this book. I agree with others who said the dialogue drags, adds nothing to the plot, and seems as if it was a high school student's first attempt to write. This is not worth the time. The characters and plot are underdeveloped and there is nothing to keep you hanging on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Lily","review":"I really liked this novel. Fern Michaels is one of my favorite authors.

This time around reader gets a new slant through a bit of \\"magic\\" or \\"supernatural\\" of the spiritual world. The clever usage of an object of charm brings about the fullest meaning of the word \\"charming\\" to streghten the book's title. Added to the fun of this book is is the inclusion of characters from other Michaels books and series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"What a wooden, unenjoyable book. All the exposition is in the quite unbelievable dialogue. Two significant characters make quite unbelievable changes in personality. The \\"wish keeper\\" is whatever the author wants it to be at the moment. Wholly unbelievable and unlikeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't beleive this book was rated so highly by others!","review":"I was astonished to see how highly this book was rated. It's the worst book I've read in a long time. The story line had thepotential to be interesting but the author failed to bring it tolife. The characters were one dimentional and the dialog between them was just silly. It read like a high school student's first attempt at a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and forgettable","review":"Dante's Inferno, despite a fairly intricate plot, fails to deliver much suspense or mystery. Most of the developments upon which the story twists and turn were formulaic and predictable. Sylvia's character is one-dimensional, and the adventures in which she participates would never be remotely possible in a real life setting. The other characters simply hover around Sylvia, who calls the shots for police, forensics, FBI,other psychiatrists, and the rest of a large but poorly defined cast of supporters. Even sociopath John Dantes comes across as wooden, as he helplesslessly becomes enamoured of Sylvia while trying to manipulate her. This is a long book not worth the effort it requires to reach the \\"climax\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller","review":"This is one of those \\"can't put it down\\" thrillers!! I didn't want to read it; just the description of it scared me! Once I started it, though, I could not put it down!!!! And yet, I had to put it down every so often just to come up for a breath of fresh air! That is how good it was! Books usually don't scare me, but for some reason, this one did! There was just a \\"feeling\\" about this book, but I would have not missed reading it for the world!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fiery psychological thriller!","review":"The fourth outing for Dr. Sylvia Strange is the best one yet. Although the plot of \\"Dantes' Inferno\\" might seem familiar, there is enough that is new to keep the reader interested. John Dantes is a particularly interesting villain, both for his brilliance and his passivity. We're never quite sure what he's up to, if anything. Watching him match wits with Sylvia makes for excellent reading.Unlike most thrillers, this is an intelligent book, interweaving an above-average plot with an allegorical depiction of Los Angeles as Dante's (note the similarity to Dantes) nine-circled Hell. Throw in the psychological study of \\"Dantes' Inferno's\\" twisted bad guys and it's clear that author Lovett is one smart lady. I look forward to returning to this series in the future.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"},{"rating":"2","title":"The little magnet that could","review":"Great little magnet that can pick up most nuts and bolts that drop into the engine bay.

I didn't read the fine print and thought this was a walking stick size pole. Go to your local hardware store to buy this. Don't bother with it on line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Should You Buy This Book???","review":"Why this book, when there are several shorter books on GP, and its principle author, John Koza, has written two other, more general and equally voluminous books on GP? This book addresses how to evolve program architecture, that's why! Living organisms didn't grow arms and eyes through simple mutation. It required more subtle genetic operators. Traditional genetic operators (as used in genetic algorithms) may be sufficient for evolving solutions to optimization problems where the structure if not the specifics of each solution is pretty much the same. But to effectively evolve program structures, you need architecture altering genetic operators. This book provides motivations in computer science, foundations in biology, and explanations in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Vangelis is suprisingly unique","review":"L'apocalypse is a strikingly intriguing mix of jazz, flowing ballads, and deep ambient themes. His sounds, although somewhat relying on the quirky 70's new age instruments, can be surprisingly effective in conveying moody soundscapes. I particularily like the two last songs because they conjure up a fantastic imagery in their sounds, and I believe that they may be some of Vangelis's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work of art recorded over 4 decades ago","review":"This brilliant work of art remains one of Vangelis' best releases. Recorded over 4 decades ago, Vangelis succeeds in producing a profound ambient music. While Brian Eno (of course an excellent artist in his own right) seems to get all the credit for ambient music simply by coining the term, Vangelis was creating such music before Eno, and unlike Eno's background-level ambient works, Vangelis puts the profound ambient in the foreground. Creation du Monde (2nd-to-last track) is one of my all-time favorites. How could any listener not be moved by this piece?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"First off Amazon won't let anyone give minus stars!

It's fast paced and suspenseful, I had trouble putting it down. Unfortunately, this version contains only the first 20 of 31 chapters and leaves the hero with the following paragraph: \\"Mental torment gave way to acute physical pain and that again to the merciful blankness of negation.\\" Very frustrating. I was able to find the end on a free internet site. I wouldn't recommend this particular version."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One of the best books about the law of atraction and parallel universes I have read\\"","review":"This is one of the best books written about the law of atraction, Gregg Braden explains in simple words what he understood is written in the Isaiah Scroll! He has traveled to many countries, in search for Sacred Writtings that shed some light into a special way of praying, and taping to paralel realities! He's gone to Tibetan monasteries, Egipt, and other places, looking for answers!! He has knowledge in Shamanism, and to his opinion he sees a lynk between Shamanic knowledge, what the Isaiah Scroll says and documents of the Essenes, I do share his opinion, and found his book very helpful in my studies about paralel universes. The book also talk about healing, global peace and unity!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but a bit disappointing.","review":"I found that the author seems to have taken other peoples ideas and wrote them down without doing his own research. Some of the things he tells you are a bit misleading, but probably not on purpose. The author seems to be mixing a bit of New Age and Christianity together. The book does have some interesting theories that I have not read anywhere else before. To bad it was all out of one chapter! Before you decide to put his theories into practice learn what prayer is really about first. To do that read the book 'Mighty Prevailing Prayer'. Then decide what is the best way to approach each situation that requires prayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bends easily, Nice handle","review":"The stainless steel fork is pretty thin and bends easily. Mine arrived bent into a complete curl. The box was crushed in shipment. It was easy to straighten out but one area was bent into a right angle and wouldn't straighten out completely. The metal is just too thin and soft but the points on the fork are very sharp. I really like the wood handle. It is nice and long with a comfortable grip. However, it comes with hand wash and towel dry instructions. \\"Do not soak or immerse tool in water.\\"So the handle is nice but the fork itself is pretty weak and bends easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Product","review":"While enlarging the shower area of a bath to accommodate rolling a wheelchair directly into the shower stall I was faced with the problem of how to install the shower curtain and still be able to open the door to the bath. I didn't like the idea of having the door swing into the hallway because it is difficult for a person in a wheelchair to close an outward swinging door. I saw the Medline cubicle track products and decided to give them a try. They worked better than I expected. They are easy to custom cut to the lengths needed, install easily because being aluminum they are very light, and the shower curtain glides unobstructed the length of the track, even better than most shower curtain rods. The 90 degree bend in the track enables pushing the shower curtain to the side wall completely out of the way allowing not only unobstructed entry into the the shower area but also the shower area to dry much more quickly. I am very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Powerful!","review":"I could hardly put this book down, from the opening prologue right to the end. There's a lot to like about this book--a heroine who's had a rough life, but isn't a victim. A hero I just fell in love with--and a great cast of supporting characters. This book tackles a difficult subject matter with wisdom and honesty. I'll be looking forward to her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Yawn. I found this book to be really ridiculous and trite. Its content and one dimensional- stereotypical characters oversimplify the issue of drug abuse.

If you are looking for basic concepts to pass the AP Chem exam, then this may be the book for you. Most of the stuff they cover is basic. However, if you are looking to make a 5 on the AP Chem exam, consider buying another book. Most of the topics are not covered in depth enough to get those last few points needed for a 5. Also, the questions in the book are definitely lacking. Not only are there no free response questions (which count for 55% of the AP exam, FYI) but the multiple choice questions are lacking in quality. They really don't resemble the ones on the AP exam. (Trust me, I would know - I got a 5 on the exam last year.) If you are looking for a wordy book to help you get some of the basic concepts down, go for Barrons. However, if you are trying to reach for a 5 or get some really good multiple choice problems, you might want to try the Princeton Review instead. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AP CHEM!!??? YEAH THIS IS GOOD!","review":"This book provides a clear, firm and eloquent explanation to all aspects of chemistry tested by the college board. The Textbooks are long and dronning, this one- if you use it well will garantuee you a pass! I recommend studying about 2 months ahead of the exam, and then reviewing in the last 2 weeks. This is so you can look over the problems at the end of the chapter and redo them to highten your understanding. I would likely say i nearly failed all the class tests, but using this guide, and SOLELY relying on it, i managed a 5!!! My smart friend who got 100s on tests ended up BS ing with Kaplan- which DUMBS it down, like this book, but doesnt to the level of the Exam.

It really helped me on the experimental parts (i.e. common colors or smells of chemicals, etc). I did not take any of the practice tests in this book because I knew and heard that they were insanely hard and depressing. Instead, I took the practice tests out of the Princeton Review AP Chemistry and scored a 5 on both of them. I recently just received my score and I got a 5!

It basically covers everything you will need to know for the test, although I would not recommend using it alone for preparation. If it is used in conjunction with an AP Chemistry class, it will be sufficient to earn you a good grade on the test. If you are in an IB, Honors, or Regular Chemistry class, other review books may be necessary.

I have used it exclusively for the HDD so I can record from TV and watch later. I have to say for me it was worth the $300 just for that. I love the HDD. That being said, the rest of it is useless. The DVD player used to work to play DVDs but now it does not open properly. Also, at any given time the unit will get \\"stuck\\" on \\"Load\\" and no buttons will work at all. Then I have to unplug the whole thing and plug back in again. The VCR has never been usable, as the sound has never worked on it. So, the HDD has been priceless to me, but the rest of it might as well not even be there. I am getting cable digital soon, so won't need the HDD recorder anymore.

What you are left with is a deeply personal and truly felt picture of a friend who sacrificed himself for his art. Kafka comes across here as a saintly martyr for literature and art-a suffering genius who found salvation and meaning in his work. Yet Brod is careful not to paint too dark of a picture; he is attuned to Kafka's tremendous humor and satirical wit. In short, he was a man sensitive to the pain and absurdity of the human condition, in all its beauty and pain. An outstanding portrait of this cutting edge artist who wrote for the crickets and is now secure in the literary pantheon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Excrement for the OW!

One, full time homemakers are not viewed as contributors to society. Two, many feel they have to have Martha Stewart's homemaking skills in order to be hospitable. Both are false and this book helps the reader see past the trappings that prevent many of us from inviting people into our home. This book gives great ideas on how to open your home to guests regardless of decor or food budget. It presents a mindset of ministry in opening the home to guests.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that the authors sometimes come across as superwomen who open their home out of a sense of obligation.

So performers have worked hard to re-create the authentic sounds of these songs, using counter-tenors and lutes to catch the sonorities. But few singers want to acknowledge that Elizabethan English was pronounced considerably differently than English is today. These performances are therefore revelatory. Hearing a song as familiar as Dowland's \\"If my complaints could passions move,\\" rendered more like \\"Eef mine comb-plints coo'd pass-ee-ons moave\\" is both shocking and delightful. Les Witches and the singers here give lively, vivid accounts of these works, articulated with clarity, and recorded immaculately.

So, I would hook up the system and after a few errors(I made wrong turns just so I could get it to recalculate....right!) it got me out of the town and home. I would just add destinations, but had no real address and it got me there. I tried the other features and they worked to some degree. Reasturants were lacking. I think its best to ask people where to eat and rely on additional resources to identify attractions/sights to see, but over all this is a great addition.

Very intelligent and interesting characters, including the children.

I have older recordings on LP where she is accompanied by a smaller ensemble which better accentuated the deep feelings in her song. The ensembles lead by Lino Chavez and Andres Huesca, are composed of harp, jarana (a small, 4 stringed guitar), guitar and guitarron (base guitar). The harp and jarana perform improvisations that are surprisingly complex: note the use of fugue, counterpoint as well as harmony while the guitarron keeps time. The track by Los Tres Ases is very rousing.

As a woman, I think many of her poems might be more accessible to other women, since many of her themes are female oriented (love, marriage, children, even the GYN visit). Some highlight: \\"Knots\\": (oh yes how I too have wanted to escape), \\"Blizzard\\": (good stream of consciousness), \\"Shadows\\": (a great sestina!), \\"To a Daughter Leaving Home,\\" and many more too numerous to mention. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because I think there are too many poems in the collection that are repetitive in theme- lots of \\"Am I growing too old?\\" and \\"my parents are dying/dead- now what?\\" Maybe when I'm 64 I'll appreciate those melancholy themes more, but at 45, I think not.

It just got sort of boring - I finished it but didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of a magnificent series.","review":"Although I greatly enjoyed all of the Lymond Chronicle books, I believe this to be the best of the series. The sweep of the narrative, and the scope of the book are facinating. Also, the book goes into a world I knew very little about, the early years of the Ottoman Empire. The depth and complexity of the characters is overwhelming. Would that more historical novels plumbed the depths that this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of the Kindle version","review":"This is a review NOT of the book but of the Kindle version of the book. The book itself is excellent. BUT, the Kindle version omits the maps and the character list at the beginning. These are essentials for reading a Dorothy Dunnett novel. This was my first Dorothy Dunnett novel, AND my first Kindle book. Dorothy get five stars, Kindle gets two. This was not prepared well for the Kindle format. Had I not had a copy of the book itself, I would have been unaware of these omissions. I trust that future Dorothy Dunnett novels will prove as wonderful as this one. Kindle is a great technology, and the preparation of materials needs to be undertaken with the same care that has gone into developing the reader itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Deadman's A Manual of Acupuncture","review":"Not possible to find a better English language reference source than this book. I have used the book in hard copy but prefer it on CD. Quick to find items using CD and a notebook and CD weigh less that the actual manual. The pronunciations that come with the book on CD seem accurate, depending on the area from whence your Chinese comes. Good background data for all point locations and rationale for their use.Note that when I had a specific question about his work, Peter Deadman was quick to reply and clarify the descrepancy, which had already been addressed in later editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 80's metal","review":"This fist Warlock/Doro album from 1984 is rockin'. If you like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and heavy metal of that style, check out Warlock. Blazing guitars, speed-thrash drums, and scorching vocals. Flat-out awesome album, pretty hardcore for 1984."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best exercise video for people with MS!","review":"I know many people with multiple sclerosis whose lives have been changed by practicing Dahn Yoga. A few of the practitioners who were previously confined to using wheel chairs or assisted walking devices now are able to move their bodies more freely and comfortably.

Dahn Yoga for MS is giving people their lives back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real help for people with MS","review":"I had the pleasure of going to the introduction gathering for this DVD which has just been released. The DVD was developed utilizing the feedback of many people that have MS and have greatly improved their life by going to the Dahn Yoga classes that were designed especially for people with MS and other similar \\"life complications\\". Hearing their stories of how they have improved and seeing them actually performing the exercises at the gathering fills one with wonderment of how the human body has many unknown ways of helping to repair itself. For those people with MS that cannot attend the MS yoga classes given in many cities, or that want to practice at home, this DVD gives them a chance of greatly improving their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for Health","review":"I was just referred to this DVD and I think it's amazing. Several of my good friends' moms have MS. Two of them are currently doing yoga and other low impact forms of exercise and they are feeling better. I know that with this focused, proven system of healing exercise, my friends' moms will be able to improve their health just as some of the inspiring folks from the video have. I plan to give this video to several of my mom's friends this holiday season. It seems like it's perfect not just for people with MS but also for people who may need to modify their exercise regimen for whatever reason. I feel great that this video exists to empower people to regain their health and happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dahn Yoga","review":"Video says it is suitable for wheelchair users, but rarely shows how.

I ordered one and had ahipped halfway around the world only to find out that it was hardwired for 50Hz operation only, and clearly incompatible with our 60Hz supply.I wrote TrippIte to clarify and they did declare that they designed it for the more popular implementation of 230VAC/50Hz rather than for both 50 and 60Hz.Fortunately, Amazon allowed the item to be returned even beyond the 30-day return period with a full refund after listening to my explanation.I give both Amazon and TrippLite for handling the situation well, I give 1 star to whoever wrote the specs for the product page."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline began here","review":"Yes, indeed...after two largely excellent solo efforts (both of which have since been ruined with new drum and bass tracks by the way--sickening and shameful) in which Ozzy seemed to be keeping up artistically with what his former bandmates Black Sabbath were doing without him, he blows it here. This has a few decent riffs, but nothing more; this is the stupidest and most cornball cheese-metal that had ever been associated with anyone in Sabbath up to that point. 'Bark At The Moon', indeed! Talk about lack of subtlety, it's all over this wretched thing. Well, this sadly isn't the worst record Ozzy would make (they actually would never even be this good again), but kids and burnout metalheads continued to buy his records (in larger numbers than even the vastly, immensely superior records that Black Sabbath were releasing) into the early '90's. Sure. While bands like Venom, Death, Bathory and true metal outfits couldn't get arrested. It figures."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good","review":"i agree to \\"bill M.\\". i'm a person who has never listened to the original ozzy albums, and this is the only bark at the moon i've heard. and i like it a lot. i think people who have never listened to the '83 and '95 versions of this album, will like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Original?","review":"If it's not the original, not worth a dime. Thanks to previous reviewers for pointing this out. I tried to locate the original on Amazon, but don't see it anywhere.

I'm new to Ozzy's work, so don't know how to rate his releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original recording - good, This - not good","review":"The 4-star rating is for the original album, before ozzy became all greedy and such. It brings a tear to my eye to see this happen to some very good metal albums.

Even BARK AT THE MOON is very good. But to learn that Ozzy , for a great part of his career, did no write EVEN THE LYRICS for his albums is something shocking.In BARK AT THE MOON, free from Kerslake and using Bob Daisley as a last moment replacement, he credited himself as the sole composer for all the songs, that were, in truth, written by Daisley and Jake E. Lee....Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!! This is *NOT* the original recording!!!","review":"Ozzy and Sony have done it again. Another 5-star album has been ruined! This reissue was remixed with some guitar parts deleted (for example, the first half of the intro solo to \\"Rock 'n' Roll Rebel\\" has been eliminated.) The keyboards in the beginning of \\"Waiting for Darkness\\" have been boosted up so loud that you can barely hear the churning guitar riff below. These are just two of the things that have been changed. \\"Bark at the Moon\\" has been drastically altered. \\"Centre of Eternity\\" has been drastically altered. I can't believe they would have done this after the fiasco with the Blizzard and Diary reissues. Once again, there has been no mention of the altering on the CD's sticker or advertising. No, Sir, I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORD HAS TO GO OUT ABOUT THIS....RE-RECORDED ALBUM...","review":"This is correct, Sharon and Epic have done it again with putting new drum and bass parts in the album.

The title track is also different. Ozzy's vocals also echoed alot on the original album but not this one. Also in the booklet of credits it says all songs written by Ozzy. Nope.That's not true other people helped him. Its in the original album credits. Sharon and epic Ruined a heavy metal classic. Disgraceful to ruin a legend's work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

I've always got the impression that it's underrated. The songs are all well written and enjoyable. \\"You're No Different\\" says a lot musically and lyrically. One of Ozzy's best songs I think. \\"Waiting for Darkness\\" is a killer track that really stands out. That song really has got some power behind it. After this album the others never quite matched up. Ozzy's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only his absolute best!","review":"110 stars if that was possible.YEAH!Ok sure it is not like this is a huge classic but it should have been!Ok this remake remaster thing only deserves 90 stars because annoying kinda.But like the original it is the definitive ozzy album.The opening and title track is so fast and great vocals.Definatly great the rest are not hugly great by many BUT EACH IS 90 AND Blow torchers.Get IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Osbourne Howls Too Little","review":"First of all,let me say I am an Ozzy nut but I try to be objective.Bark At The Moon is the biggest dissappointment of Ozzy's career. Jake E. Leeis no Randy Rhoads on guitar, and most of the songs are uninspired. Rock N Roll Rebel is the one stand out on the album. Often overlooked in the success of Ozzy's first two solo albums is not just Rhoads playing, but the fact Osbourne had a great songwriter to help him."},{"rating":"1","title":"asdf","review":"if you like Jake E Lee's playing, then you might as well grab this album, otherwise, its a throw-away release with one or two standout tracks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Ozzy Album","review":"This album is kind of different than Ozzy's previous two or any to follow. It is very good though. It is a little more pop oriented, and a little more moody. Jake Lee's guitar playing is just as good as anything, though. Center Of Enternity is the best song on the album, and one of Ozzy's all-time best. Some lame songs, like So Tired keep this from being Ozzy's best album ever . I love all of it, though. The title track is one of Ozzy's most famous songs, and it is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhodes gone, Ozzy still great","review":"This album has several great things about it. First, the songs \\"Waiting for darkness\\" and \\"Bark at the Moon\\" are some of the best of eighties hard rock. Also, though not as great as Rhodes, Jake E. Lee can pump your heart like any of the great rockers. What is missing from the album is Ozzy's total range as a vocalist. The upper range is not used nearly as much as previous or follow up albums. Still, this album is pretty much better than most early eighties albums and and is a must for all hard rock/metal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major setback after 2 brilliant albums","review":"This one is not that bad. However, it lames so much when compared to Ozzy's two previous albums. Jake E Lee does a decent job, but he fell way short in trying to recapture the magic that Ozzy had with the late great Randy Rhoads. \\"Bark at the Moon\\" is a great song but the majority of the other songs in the album are simply not in the same league of Blizzard's and Diary's. There was a lot of expectation before the album came out back in '83; unfortunately, it certainly did not lived up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy Anything Remastered","review":"I'm an Ozzy fan,(Thank you Bob Daisley) and when I lost my Bark at the Moon Cd. I bought the remastered version, played part of Bark at the Moon and in the trash it went. Then I was talked into giving it another try so I bought another remastered Bark at the Moon. I listened to the whole song and gave that CD away.I think this remastered stuff sucks. It's different musicians trying to play the originals. This gives Ozzy the profits and he doesnt have to share with the original band members. Then to make up for this fact they add a couple of songs most people hadnt heard before. Even the songs that are added to make the purchase of these remastered Cds (all of Ozzy CDs) seem like a deal, are pretty old. They are great songs But I had \\"B\\" side recorded back in 1979 /1980.If you are a die hard Ozzy fan who loves the originals, Look around and buy the \\"original\\" recording.

This record does not have it. This one was the first studio release after \\"Diary of a Madman\\" and it shows. Ozzy clearly suffered from the loss of Randy Rhodes. He had limited time to find a worthy replacement, so we were subjected to Jake, I couldn't write a song even if god himself wrote it for me, E. Lee.A couple of these songs are gems. Three of them actually, \\"Bark at the Moon\\", \\"Rock and Roll Rebel\\" and \\"Center of Eternity\\". Everything else is bad.If you are going to buy Ozzys stuff may I suggest in this order; \\"Diary of a Madman\\", \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\", \\"Ozmosis\\", \\"Tribute\\", or anything he recorded with \\"Black Sabbath\\". Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up and Down","review":"This album has 3 great singles but not much else going for it. The title track is an obvious great song, which shows that guitarist Jake E Lee can play very well. Rock N Roll rebel is also a decent number, so is the last track Waiting for Darkness. But like Ultimate Sin after this album it is just filled with weak songs. Come on now Centre of Eternity, Slow Down and So Tired, sound lame today. I know that all the Ozzy fans reading this will shout bloody murder but come on. The keyboards really kill the metal aspect of both is album and Ultimate sin following it."},{"rating":"2","title":"jake e.lee rules","review":"Bark at the moon was a hard-rocking album.Jake e.lee had to replace a talented guitarist in Randy Rhoads.Ozzy really could have done a better job with the vocals,but it is still classic ozzy!

On this CD they've replaced that song with 'Tomorrow, Tomorrow'. The only possible reason for this is that 'Spicks and Specks' was originally a monophonic recording which had been electronically reprocessed for stereo for this 1969 album. I still recommend it, but it takes enough away from the original that I'll pass on it . . . OK, I have two of their original 1969 albums . . . and besides, the song is on their CD 'Bee Gees Their Greatest Hits The Record'. The Best of Bee Gees CD is a must for fans...for what is on it!

But my all time favorite track on this album, and of the entire Bee Gees' musical catalogue was and is and remains \\"The First of May\\" -- there has never been a better more nostalgic and reverie of life provoking song ever been written or performed by The Bee Gees nor by any other pop/rock group.If you can get only one Bee Gees album/cd - make it this collection. You won't regret it ever. \\"When we were small . . . and Christmas trees were tall . . . now we are tall . . .and Christmas trees are small . . .and you don't ask the time of day . . and guess who'll cry come First of May?\\" -- Thanks Barry, Robin, and Maurice for this song . . . and for all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of ONE Of The Best","review":"I consider the Bee Gees among the best rock music has to offer. Their singing alone was impressive, but consider the quality of their songs. During the first phase of their career, captured on this album, they wrote melodic songs that stick to the mind and cause one to hum them endlessly, much like their four countrymen from Liverpool, the Beatles. The Bee Gees weren't loud, weren't trying to be \\"progressive\\" (most of the time), weren't out to impose any messages: their songs for the most part were about normal feelings. The arrangements here are very agreeable, too. Avoiding the excesses of that time, the Bee Gees' songs have the basic band plus minimal instrumental additions. BEST OF THE BEE GEES is a great musical deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good albumn...well worth having in my collection","review":"one of the best albumns produced for those who love good music that blends harmony and meaning together....it is well worth adding to any collection of fine vocal groups and arrangments"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Place to start","review":"This is the best overall collection of their early work, containing hits from 1st, Horizontal, Idea, and Odessa as well as some non-LP singles.

The script was terrible, character development poor, acting okay and there were NO special effects for an end of war movie.

If we stay out of the sun, well, not a hell of a lot happens. There ain't no way ozone depletion melts the planet. Now on the other hand if the Earth's iron mantle stops rotating and we lose our magnetic shield... Then we melt from microwaves in moments. I think they confused the two protective fields.I liked the movie because it was an attempt to cast Armageddon in a different light. It's not about world cataclysm, rather how two individuals - and really one, for it's all about Cisco - try to keep a shred of meaning in the sheer hopelessness of the situation.

I know they were shooting for a romantic, this-is-the-end-of-the-world-let's-make-love scene....but it simply didn't work.The sound of vehicles passing by thoughout the entire movie will have you looking out your window for unexpected visitors.Apparently Skype is still around when the end of the world happens and everyone is using it.The only believable \\"apocalyptic scene\\" is when a guy gives up and jumps off a balcony.

There is a sense of despair and giving up as everything is gone. That's a great moment but it's unearned.

How about the lack of Tony and Geezer? The band, led by noted guitarist Brad Gillis, is skilled, but they are not Sabbath. There's very little chemistry in the playing, leading me to the sad conclusion that this is not much more than a novelty item of the same variety as Pat Boone's \\"In a Metal Mood,\\" or \\"Apocalyptica Plays Metallica for Four Cellos.\\" It's not worth listening to more than a few times at the most. There are a couple tracks that rescue it from total oblivion. The relentless, mid-paced chugging version of Symptom of the Universe is more venomous and menacing than the frantic and screechy original rendition.

These renditions lack the intensity that only Iommi can bring to them. Take for example the uninspired version of Snowblind. Its obvious Brad Gillis could care less, and really, why should he? He was a good player who sounded just like a million other guitarists at the time. Gillis just does not came close to Iommi's wall of sound, sledgehammer approach that makes his compositions stand out from the pack.

Your body may be a wonderland, but John Mayer's body of work is a snoozeland. The album blends wonderfully together because it's all one big long song called \\"What America Wants To Hear For Some Unknown Reason.\\" Please people, if you're going to listen to this stuff, get some headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for what?!","review":"John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\" has been recorded with little imagination. At first, you'll get excited thinking that you'll get more songs like \\"Love Song For No One\\" or \\"No Such Thing\\" but honestly halfway through the album can get you dozing off to wonderland. 2 stars for the light voice Mayer has and another one for the effort, but the album (for me) failed to create an impression and I thought that after listening to the whole CD over and over again, it will soon grow on me, but it wasn't to be. \\"Room For Squares\\" must be substituted with an album from Rob Thomas or Stephan Jenkins from Third Eye Blind. Try those two instead. Mayer is nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"I try to be open minded","review":"I am usually open minded when it comes to music, i saw him play on tv, i think it was jay leno. He seems to know what hes doing with his guitar, but his voice is just plain annoying. I tryed to listen to the whole song, but i couldn't. Changed the channel, went back, changed the channel, and so on. I gave him 2 stars because his guitar playing sounded good. Maybe i'm just not a fan of that kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Collins anyone?","review":"To me,mayer sounds more like phil collins,not dave. compare the sound when they go high in \\"I cant walk\\" and \\"No Such thing\\"...very similar.thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the only way to get the bonus tracks","review":"This is essentially the \\"Room for Squares\\" CD with \\"Lenny\\" and \\"Wind Cries Mary\\" added at the end. Both are live tracks recorded in the \\"X Lounge\\" in Birmingham, AL for an audience of contest winners. Those two songs were on a bonus disc given out at one point with purchase of the CD and can usually be found for download at one of your favorite online spots. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I was turned onto this CD by a very music-savvy individual, who shall remain nameless, and have been enjoying it ever since. Yes, John Mayer's voice may remind some of you of Dave Matthews, but who cares -it's working for Dave. As far as I'm concerned, John Mayer is a very talented singer/songwriter and I hope he goes far! I love this CD & highly recommend it! (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an AWESOME CD!!!","review":"(...) this CD is just plain awesome. Every song is beautifully constructed with a thoughtful, mellow feel that I only wish was heard more often. Most of the themes can be related to by almost anyone (especially \\"83\\"), and the music is amazing!! Definitly buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Indescribable","review":"I bought this cd in early June on a whim after to listening to clips of it here on this very page and it has now jumped up to one of my favorite cds of all time. He is simply an amazing musician. My opinion of John skyrocketed last night, if that were possible, when I drove 4 hours to see him play in Ann Arbor, MI. He is simply the most amazing showman/entertainer I have ever seen and I have been to a wide variety of shows in my day. Every person in attendance in the small, intimate club atmosphere was totally engrossed in both his songs and his hilarious banter between songs. But this album NOW. You will not regret it. However, there will be no substitute for a John Mayer live show. He said himself last night, \\"Most artists believe the cd is the primary product and the live show the support product except for me. So go to the back of the bar and pick up your very own John Mayer home game after the show!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I just purchased this album on the advice of a music-savvy friend of mine. It is a great album! The songwriting is mature, intelligent and solid. His voice is reminiscent of Dave Matthews, and the style is close to David Gray -- so if you're a fan of either, you'll love John Mayer. The music has a jazz quality mixed with rock. I'm telling all my friends to buy his latest album -- this guy is definitely one to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"So wise for one so young---","review":"This young man must have an old soul, 'cause he sings with such purpose, passion and meaning. Every track is enjoyable and it's good to read in the liner notes that he acknowledges his debt to Michael MacDonald. Frankly, I think Mayer goes his mentor one better with this sure-to-be-remembered debut CD. Most single artists cannot hold my attention track after track, but the gifted John Mayer is a refreshing exception. A must-have for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"One So-so Song and That's It","review":"John Mayer sucks. The garbage that I refer to is Your Body Is A Wonderland and every other song on the album. A blantant attempt to lure in female fans. A musician friend of mine once complimented Metallica for being successful with zero \\"chick factor\\". This song is all chick factor and explains the relentless comparisons to the older but equally boring Dave Matthews. He also loses points for that stupid entrance on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where he, Gwen Stefani and Steven Tyler collectively ruined the Police's reunion by singing \\"backup\\" front and center..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from start to finish","review":"He did a fab job.

Funny, I don't recall Stevie Ray Vaughan aiming his music straight at yuppies and preppies, or singing songs with laughably overwrought titles like \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\" I mean, I'm not just another mainstream hater, but this guy is so bland and inoffensive he makes the Dave Matthews Band look like Slayer! Life for most of us is mundane enough, I don't really think we need music like this to make it even more so. Get a Queens of the Stone Age album for Pete's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no","review":"I cant believe how much this guy copies Dave Mathews.

This is boring, bland elavator music ( something your grandma would like). This is definetly music for the average \\"square\\"!! This actually makes my Eminem album look refreshing! Don't waste your money on this album IT's [bad]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great guitar, awful singer and performer","review":"I too can't understand how anybody likes this guy. I first heard him on ACL as well, and thought \\"what is he saying???\\" I couldn't (and still can't) understand a word that he sings. It wasn't until I heard a DJ say \\"Your Body Is Wonderland\\" that I could figure out the title of that song. Then I saw him on a PBS special and admit... he's an awesome guitarist. But I can't get over his horrible mumbling voice, and the fact that his stage presence... oh dear... he's soooo hard to even look at with his goofy facial expressions (is he in pain? passing gas? I can't tell) and his awkward mannerisms. That makes trying to understand the lyrics even more difficult.I guess he's either a love-him-or-hate-him kind of performer based on what I read here. I have to give him a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfulness of Sound","review":"John Mayer is Dave-Matthews lite, and given the fact that I'm not a particularly huge fan of Dave Matthews that isn't saying much to me. This is girls music to me, let me rephrase that, teenage girls music. It's so indisputably awful, that only white teenage girls could listen to this and not want to throw up. All he writes about is love, and while that may be off the beaten angst path, that doesn't make it good. He's just spouting off inane lyrics that really mean nothing at all, and once you actually try and draw meaning from them, they mean even less. As you can gather, I despise John Mayer and all he stands for. I like upbeat music, I like Phantom Planet and other power pop groups, I can even stomach a little Dashboard Confessional, I don't know why. But John Mayer is pure fluff, and it's terrible fluff at that. I am done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"There's really great music being made today but you won't find it from this poseur.

I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album - not iPod Friendly","review":"I love this album, but was really disappointed that my CD-Rom Drive in my computer won't even recognize the audio side of the album. That's because, as I gather, I have iTunes installed and apparently it doesn't like iPods. So for that, I give the Dual Disc 1 star. I don't see why I cannot enjoy the tunes I buy in a format (or device) of my choice.I did like the DVD featurette of John's home video of recording the album/touring/about to hit it big. A nice time capsule."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this...","review":"My wife got me this cd for my birthday because she liked what she heard. Though my wife and I don't always agree when it comes to musical taste I was mildly excited. Well...how can I say this without sounding like my wife wasted fifteen bucks and I wished I had every cent back so tat I coud select another cd. Okay, here it goes (hope I don't sound bitter): This cd is CRAP!!! For some reason, maybe its the boyish good-looks but I can't help thinking of Shawn (Sean? Shaun? Who cares) Cassidy when I see this guy and his music did nothing to shake that awful image. I found myself singing Da Doo Run, Run in the shower the next morning. Unluckily, I consider throwing away a cd a mortal sin Luckily, shelving a cd for its mortal life I do not. Here's to Mayer never putting out another cd again. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayer Shmayer get your own style dammit!","review":"I hope that the people who are writing these reviews understand that the only reason this guy has gotten any hype is because the only people who listen to him are highschoolers whose taste in music doesn't go beyond brittany and NSYNC. I bought this CD at the recommendation of a friend and personally he couldn't have been more wrong. Out of all the tracks there are only 2 that are noteworthy the rest are trash-if only this CD had a erase option on it. There are moments on this CD where you can swear that he is trying to be like Dave Matthews which coincidentally he enjoys ripping on at his concerts-so much for respect. If I were you I would avoid this CD-check out some other noteworthy artists such as Norah Jones, Howie Day, and Jack Johnson. Sure they may not be as popular as Mayer but at least they have their own style and don't need to ride another persons coat tails to stardom...."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUPID EDITOR","review":"The editor of these reviews needs to be fired.

I could have watched the Fox News Channel for over 2 hours straight. Any of those experiences would have been better than listening to this drivel.I went to a party the other night and someone had this album playing on the stereo. I cannot overemphasize how horrible this album is; how in the world this won a Grammy award is beyond me. When I first heard \\"No Such Thing\\" way back during the summer, I thought he sounded like Dave Matthews, only with the serial numbers filed off.\\"Room For Squares\\" needs to be retitled to \\"Dumpster For Squares,\\" because that's where someone needs to put Mayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't criticize, just buy!","review":"I've had this CD for a couple of months and I just need to say to anyone who is thinking about buying this CD and is being influenced by negative reviews -- don't be! There is absolutely no reason to negatively criticize this. John Mayer is a beginning recording artist who is expressing himself, how can anyone criticize that! His writing is very enjoyable and done with skill. The songs become catchier everytime you listen to them. His voice's timbre is very unique and like nothing you've most likely heard. I LOVE this CD. But again, my biggest liking to this album is the writing -- just wonderful!Try it, buy the CD. Here in Baltimore, his concert sold out fast. The Grammy for best new artist will probably be given to someone who's been getting more exposure with the teens and MTV -- but John deserves it!Favorites on this disc include: No Such Thing, City Love, 83, Love Song For No One, and Back to You."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get it...","review":"...perhaps because I am not a college age female pop fan. I agree with the reviewer who calls him a Backstreet Boy with a guitar. There is very evident musical talent, but it is lost amidst vapid lyrics and pop cliches. \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" comes nowhere close to the kind of sensuality found in Dave Matthew's Band's \\"Crash\\" it seems trying to attain. I really liked \\"No Such Thing\\" when I first heard it, but it has lost its appeal with repeated listening. The rest of the CD just didn't appeal to me or really catch my attention. Hopefully John will continue to develop his songwriting skills to go along with his playing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the review, listen to the album","review":"I just bought this CD, after seeing John Mayer on television. This album is amazing -- an incredible combination of pop, R&B and just great guitar work. The lyrics are sweet, but not precious. Contrary to some of the insipid reviews this album has gotten on Amazon, there is nothing bland here. On the contrary, this is beautiful, soulful music. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Mayer is brutal. He has no unique style or talent. He has attempted to copy the style of Dave Matthews and is very unsuccessful.

This sounds EXACTLY like BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS and they have been creating GREAT music like Mayer since the late 80's. Its just ashame the BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS are so underrated and unappreciated. Like I said Mayer has good stuff but let's not forget his sound has been around. It's ALL-relative"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Phenomenal !","review":"How great is John Mayer?!?! The greatest talent I've heard in years, John Mayer has worked his way up to the top fast, and not without reason! Amazing lyrics, a versatile voice, an uplifting and funky sound, and an outlook on life that speaks to all of us twenty-somethings who are tired of the pop scene, every track on this album makes you nod your head and say \\"Yeah, I've been there.\\" Personal favourites: My Stupid Mouth, Not Myself, St. Patrick's Day. If you don't have this album yet, get it now, it'll be one of the best purchases you've made in recent memory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying John Mayer's music","review":"John Mayer's uncanny ability to lyrically touch upon the many facets of falling in love has made me fall in love with him!I love his acoustic guitar playing. Overall, there's not a song on this album that I do not like. Interesting fusion of jazz and ballard rock.After this album, I'm certainly a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"This Mayer album was musically pleasing. I especially liked the song \\"My Stupid Mouth\\". But I recently checked this Dustin Joel guy out in the Music Downloads section. He's gonna give John a run for his money, so check it out everybody. I did a search in Yahoo for his label Dudebox Records and bought an album. Excellent stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Room for This Square","review":"Although John Mayer has been unfairly labeled by critics as a \\"Dave Matthews wannabe,\\" that certainly won't distract you from enjoying his debut album. Mayer offers a mature, original style that's all his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"something special","review":"John Mayer's music is something special in today's market of pop music and angst filled or angry music. His music pulls back to the basics... great guitar and great lyrics.There's something about his playing that doesn't sound to complex for the listener but is by no means simple. It's catchy and yet impressive. The lyrics themselves compliment the music because they are so thoughtful and real. They're emotional without being sappy.This music pulls you in and touches your soul. It reminds me of how music was before all the technology to fix things and the vast pop marketing. Just music that makes you stop and listen and words that touch your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"SRV, Eric Johnson, Phil Keaggy, Duncan Sheik...","review":"Well... I will just say the musicality of this album is wonderful... A nice fresh sound. The lyrics work for me, and feel heartfelt. However, the musicality is what shines. Great voice... more reminiscent to Duncan Sheik than Dave Mathews in my opinion. The overall sound reminds me a lot of Stevie Ray Vaughan (check out his version of Lenny... good stuff), and a smooth guitar tone of Eric Johnson, with acoustic stylings of Phil Keaggy...Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I have been waiting for....","review":"Having ground to a halt with my music and very little out there to keep me going, i stumbled over this absolute GEM.Put it in the car, in the living room have it in every room.I was singing this in no time and can't put the thing down.Clever lyrics, foot tapping tunes, and a few to howl in the bath. Quite simply, \\"you cannot fault it !\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Just add 4 guys and you have N'SYNC. I bought this cd for my girlfriend because I heard that it was sentimental and stuff, but that was the biggest mistake of my life. His songs are terrible. I hear all this stuff that his lyrics are genius as is his record. Honestly, have you listened the words. The guy sings about georgia and neon. I will give him one thing, he is a good guitar player, but brilliant he is not. This is a piece ... aimed to the likes of college radio and 17 year old girls. When listening to this I wanted to .... John Mayer isnt brilliant, his lyrics are not that good, and he cant sing good at all. Please in the name of all that is good in the world, dont buy this, I beg of you. Hes not that good, it is just superficial rock with no point."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong with you people?","review":"How can this guy be mentioned in the same breath as Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, and Howie Day. His songs are unoriginal and his music is teenie-bopper top 40 cheese. Sure it remotely resembles the horrible album \\"Everyday\\" that Dave put out, but that's where the comparisons end. This guy is so over-rated. If you're 15 and in to cheese, buy this album, but if you like original acoustic ROCK (not pop) that differs from song to song, check out Jack, Dave, or Howie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I first got into John Mayer after a friend and I were comparing artists we liked and she likened his sound to Dave, Jack Johnson, and Dispatch, all of whom I love. That was before No such thing became such a big hit, and I decided to buy this album, and his first one as well, and let me just say, I have not once regretted that decision. John has an unbelievable gift for music and songwriting that really shows in songs like Your body is a wonderland, No such thing, My stupid mouth, and Comfortable (from his first album). If you have an appreciation for music that is artistic and meaningful and expressive, then go for John Mayer's first two CD's. You will NOT, repeat NOT, be disappointed. I recently heard (I believe from Billboard) that John is working on a new album due sometime this spring, and if he continues to keep up the great work he's already begun, this man will be as huge as Dave in a few years. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"As with many I see I was deeply upset by one customer review, I mean a comparrisen to The New Kids on the Block is down right disturbing. John Mayer has a wonderful voice, and his lyrics are truly enjoyable. He is a very gifted guitarist. I am surprised I have not burned a hole in this Cd. He is a unique artist that deserves praise. He is so different then many of the songs on the radio today. I am not a fan of the Backstreet boys and to even compare him to them makes me a little upset. I am so much more respect for him than many of the \\"Pop\\" singers today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"I can't believe people buy this tripe!

When \\"No Such Thing\\" was released I was attracted to the catchy lyrics and infectious rhythms. I had heard \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" a few times and absolutely loved it. So I took a chance and bought the album.I could listen to Room For Squares every day. My favorites on this album are \\"3x5\\", Love Song to No One\\", and \\"Great Indoors.\\" Mayer has a creative way of writing lyrics and a unique musical style that combines blues, and rock. I would recommend it to anyone and am trying to convert my friends to be John Mayer fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Collection of Songs","review":"So several months after its debut and after the saturation play of \\"No Such Thing\\" on V-H1, I finally yielded and bought the CD, thinking it would be one of those albums where all the songs sound the same and it would have just one good song, it's smash hit single. I was wrong. While the songs do share a common sound that evokes memories of Seals & Croft or England Dan & John Ford Coley, they do range in style enough to keep you thoroughly entertained. I have no idea how old John Mayer is, but he's clearly wise beyond his years as these lyrics indicate. Unlike many of the equally precocious alterna-rockers, these songs are able to dispense wisdom without a heavy dose of anger. This is a very promising artist who, if he continues to get support from his label and programmers, can look forward to a long and impressive career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip to be Square!","review":"I just bought \\"Room for Squares\\" and I'm glad to report it is an excellent cd. John Mayer has the good looks of a pop star but his songs are smart and immediately likeable. I had heard \\"No Such Thing\\" on the radio and liked it but I wondered if the rest of the cd would be any good. After hearing the next single, \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\", I knew then that I should buy the cd. Along with the two previously mentioned songs, I also like \\"83\\" and \\"Love Song to No One\\", to mention a few of my favorites. After hearing this collection of songs, I am eager to hear more from a talented young man that is a very hot commodity. I recently tried to get tickets for his concert here in my home town and unfortuantely it was sold out!! Oh well, I'll just have to sit back and turn on the cd player. I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par","review":"I like John Mayer's music, so this isn't a stab at that. The cd just did not live up to my expectations. His acoustic versions of songs are a lot better in my opinion than what is on the cd. The \\"Your body is a wonderland\\" sounds awful next to the acoustic version. The one really redeeming song on it was \\"My stupid mouth.\\" It is really catchy and fun, and sounds good electric. The tone of the other songs needs an acoustic guitar to really get the full effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a New Reviewer!","review":"This is one of the best CD's I've heard in years and I think it plays to young and old alike- the sound is a cool, mellow, jazzy blend that sticks to your ribs. I think the Dave Mattews comparisons are way overblown. To put Mayer in a box with DMB and David Gray pegs him as unoriginal which is just dead wrong. It is his originality that is so inspiring!I've burned a whole through this CD- it does not get old and I've passed it along to several friends, all who rave! Definately, a bust buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to all these reviews and go out and buy this fun CD!!","review":"I will mainly reiterate what's already been worded quite well by others here. the first track which had radio play \\"no such thing\\" trx #1 was the freshest and most melodic song i've heard on radio for ages. when my radio station star 98.7 (LA) played it, a slew of callers asked \\"who was that?\\" john captured the interest of many many listeners. he's a new talent that may not be innovative, but his sound is refreshing and has great pop hooks.i think he focuses on the joy of childhood/boyhood. at this point, i'm more impressed by his songwriting abilities than in his lyrics, which are sophisticated sometimes, but also a bit immature at times. but hell, this is a young man who obviously has a tremendous future ahead of him as he experiences more life and puts his pen to paper and guitar to fingers!Yeah for fresh new real talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for originality.","review":"The music's fine, some would say good.

After all, the one or two tracks on the radio might be great, but what if all of the rest of the songs suck? I gave John a chance, and I am so glad I did. Into almost every song, he has put so much thoughtful effort, and it translates into one of those CDs you will play incessantly in your car for months. This album will appeal especially to those of us who are just venturing out into the world on our own, as John manages to poignantly capture the confusing and exciting experiences of becoming an adult (i.e. a \\"quarter-life crisis\\" as he puts it). Any age group, though, will be impressed with his musical skill and the fresh mix of styles that he incorporates into this consistently pleasing CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd alive","review":"fyi i'm not under 13 i just did that cuz i didn't feel like logging in. Any way this is the BEST CD EVER!

Never before have I heard such invigorating, haunting, passionate and beautifully imaginative melodies...especially from such a young, talented artist. My favorite tracks are \\"Back to You\\" & \\"Great Indoors\\" with the remaining 10 tracks being tied for second place. I hope the gifted Mr. Mayer is welcomed by the lackluster play list of American radio. An artist of his magnitude and brilliance should be heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz meets folk music","review":"I loved this CD and honestly I think the people that didn't like it, don't appreciate this type of music.I really liked it, but hey people have different opinions.I would say anyone who likes acoustic guitar, and nice melodies will enjoy this. Comparing this to Dave Matthews though, in my opinion, is a mistake. Mayer's band has no horns, no fiddler, and most of Mayer's songs are upbeat.Anyway I hope someone finds this helpful.--A fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"i got into john about 18 months ago and all i can say is what the hell is that editorial review on about. I think that john carries an inspiring message to all those out there who have questionned themselves throughout their life. \\"Your body is a wonderland\\" just sucks the aspiring female in, and makes you think that the partner you have now may be nothing compared to joins soft american voice.i think that overall with catchy bouncy tunes like \\"no such thing\\", \\"neon\\" and \\"love song for no one\\" and romantic ballads like \\"YBIAW\\" \\"3X5\\" and a favourite of mine \\"83\\" this album is ideal for any of you DMB lovers or someone whose just looking for some damn good music!!a perfect accomplyment to Johns latest live album \\"any given thursday\\"go on buy it, you'll regret it if you dont!Char."},{"rating":"1","title":"too mellow for me","review":"i bought this cd on a recommendation from a friend and i had it before there was any radioplay of john mayer. to be honest, i couldn't even listen to the whole cd. he sounds too much like the dave matthews band. it was way too mellow and redundant. it just made me sleepy when i listened to it. i ended up giving it away to someone else who would appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting combination of talents","review":"What does it take to create a John Mayer in the lab? You'd take the song-writing of David Gray. You'd then add a bit of Ben Folds sense of humor. Finally youd add a little of the ballad writing profciency (especially on the last track, St Patrick's Day)of Barry Manilow. Yes thats right. I said Barry Manilow.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"souful lyrics+catchy tunes+cute artist= great album!","review":"I first watched Mayer on an MTV special while late night channel surfing. I, being a teenage girl, first noticed how cute John is! I sat through show and fell in love with his songs. My fav song on the album, \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", is the story of my life! I bought the album and left it in my cd player for months. Every song on it is catchy! I can't wait for another album to roll out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"This is overall a good album. Great songs accompanied with good music.

Kind of like I hate the way David Gray bobs his head when he sings. I know that probably doesn't make sense to anyone but me. Sorry. I also think he has a sexy voice; but doesn't live up to that voice in the \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" video. Anyhow, I think he has potential and will probably go far. And the album is pretty darn good. All those grammy nominations can't be wrong, can they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"God, I hate you so much John Mayer","review":"Why would anybody like this guy? He's so amazingly bad! He slurs his words, has horrible lyrics, and makes me physically ill. Sure, he might be skilled at playing the guitar, but does that matter when he has the most irritating voice and lyrics ever? It makes me so angry to see his video, with him making out with a hot chick. I should be doing that! Man, how do people get to like this guy? I give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure torture","review":"I find it extremely hilarious that the media hypes this guy up to be some sort of intelligent singer/songwriter who people should take seriously. This music is flat-out sappy, saccharine, safe, middle of the road junk. It's for the suburban, trendy, crowd who don't like to be challenged musically because their brains are incapable of handling it. The song \\"Your Body is Wonderland\\" wreaks of Michael Bolton! John Mayer is too feminine. He plays the sensitive type to attract mindless legions of female fans who know jack about real music!! Oh well, while the mainstream crowd keep listening to this sappy pop piffle i'll stick to my Nirvana, Bob Marley, Beatles, The Clash, albums. You know....music that's innovative and creative? Something sorely missing in todays mainstream music culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Bland... This album represents everything that is wrong with popular music today.

Dave Matthews should take this guy to court for ripping him off to the point of even copying his knock-kneed stage moves. If you enjoy Matthews (safe, bland music with lame non-sensical lyrics), you'll love this. How such bloodless, passionless music that sounds if it were made by a eunuch could have such a large female following is very bizzare."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Disc","review":"Think Michael Franks, but more \\"poppy.\\" Think Dave Matthews, but not trying so hard. Think Seal, but not as deep or ethereal. Listen, this is just great music. No big deal, not gonna change your life. But it will make you beam from ear to ear with every listen. The musicianship is top-notch and the recording is pristine. My only beef with the recording is that it's a little bright, but the warm, accurate, and \\"live\\" bass and midrange are wonderful.This is fun music. You probably won't sit and listen critically like you might a great jazz or classical disc, but you'll find it being left in your player more days at a time than you ever imagined. And if you play it at a party, (which it is perfect for), there will be an ever-forming line directly to you of people asking, \\"Hey, who is this... this is so great!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Music","review":"John Mayer is like a breath of fresh air for true guitar pop.

To me, not only does he have some comparisons with Dave Matthews, but also to Dashboard Confessional. My favorite songs on this CD are \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" and \\"Love Song for No One\\"...but every song seems special for its own reasons. I have to wonder why he skipped a number 13 track though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayerhem!!!","review":"I feel that this albulm is one of those few works where you can listen to it all the way through and not have the desire to skip over any of the tracks. It is nicely laid out and and the band makes the albulm a fully congealed and viscous work. The opening track, \\"No Such Thing\\", transports the listener to a time when they were so desperately stifled by the pressures of making ridiculous choices during their final year of high school. These choices were supposedly going to be the major decisions of their lives and placed many unnecessary stresses onto people. The majority of tracks on this albulm have a theme that is highly relatable to what an individual is either currently going through or has gone through and for that certain songs such as \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", \\"Back To You\\", and \\"83\\" resonate such a strong chord. This albulm brings an artist of great talent and even greater potential to light."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna scream at the top of my lungs","review":"This is the freshest music to come out in a long time; just a guy with a great voice singing to wonderful guitar riffs. There isn't a bad track on the CD, but the stand-outs are No Such Thing, 83, Neon, 3 by 5, and City Love. His voice is a little bit of Dave, Seal, and Sting all rolled into one, yet it's still individual. By the time \\"No Such Thing\\" gets to the ending chorus where he sings, \\"I can't wait for my 10-year reunion, I'm gonna bust through the double doors,\\" I was cheering. The words rung so true. And that was only the first track! Put the top down, crank it up, and start singin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"John Mayer's cd is one of the best i've heard for the longest time.

I've been moved more by Disney soundtracks. He lacks any passion and everything recorded sounds like somebody held a gun to his head and forced him to write this album. Not much seperates him from Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand except his consistent mediocrity.Seriously, the only people that would be upset by this review are the ones that confuse physical attraction with musical talent. If he had the latter, we'd be hearing much more about his sophomore album.If you like his hit single, I'd recommend listening to Ben Lee or Promise Ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT CAN I SAY","review":"THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD.

It's just like \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" and \\"No Such Thing\\". Some of the songs are more acustic, but that's not always bad. John Mayer has a excellent voice and range. To sum up, this is a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limitless talent","review":"This guy is one gifted young musician. His phrasing, his expression, his chord changes, his sense of dynamics, his youthful sincerity as he conveys the truth in his reality, it's all there.I'm 62 years old, a guy who played guitar in a rock band, a bass in a jazz band, who sings it all, and who plays classical piano, and for me Mayer is a special talent. What an ear! Buy it and listen. He's selling an emotion and it works, it really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! If you like trash.","review":"This is the pinnacle of fluff-pop.

If you want a great singer-songwriter album, both musically and lyrically, try Beck's \\"Sea Change.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo for \\"Squares\\"...","review":"The Dave Matthews comparison is quite relevant. Here is a guy that is playing and singing music directly targeted to the post-hippie Matthews contingent. He brings nothing new to the table, only his apparent Berklee education. Guess they didn't teach him how to write decent songs, did they?I for one think that up until the recent Glen Ballard-produced \\"Everyday,\\" Matthews and Co. were marking their own trail. If Mayer has his way (and he's been a hit with the frat boys so far), he'll get a chance to tread the same ground. I don't care if you're Jimi Hendrix - if you don't at least attempt to create something that is uniquely yours, you've invalidated your art. Mayer not only doesn't try that here, he shamelessly drinks from the same well as every other college-age singer-songwriter. I don't mind if people like his music, I just don't wanna hear them tell me he's up to something \\"hip\\" or \\"cool\\" or \\"edgy.\\" This is the same old song."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest lyricists of the modern era.","review":"Room for Squares is just brilliant for everyone. It is easy to listen to, sing, along to and relate with.Every song has a different edge to it and while some critics may feel he is a little self-indulgent it makes a refreshing change to the f-ing and blinding \\"sung\\" by rappers and nu-metal bands.John Mayer is a wonderful songwriter and conveys it all with brilliant tunes and a relaxing voice, almost like he is singing it to you over lunch. It is a different mix, but one that works so well.If there was only one CD I could take onto a desert island, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"Love the album.A mature work from a guy so young.

The big problem with this CD is not, as the Amazon.com reviewer quite correctly (and humorously) point out, the pretentious, \\"look at my deep thoughts\\" coffehouse lyrics. With John, it's as another reviewer pointed out, the same \\"look at me ma\\" jazzy chords. Unfortunately, they're not some of the cool jazzy chords that most rock's peppered with, but the entire CD is one terrible smooth jazz chord after another. This isn't musical complexity, it's pseudo-jazzy blandness. The only people we have to thank for this kind of nonsense is John Tesh and Steely Dan (although Dan actually tried something new from time to time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer Rocks!!","review":"I have been waiting a long time to hear a CD like this! This CD is one that you can sit down and listen to over and over and over and never get tired of it! This is one of the few CD's in a long time that is great from beginning to end! The first song is the one that really pulls you in--\\"No Such Thing.\\" After that, it is all uphill! His music sings to you and his words talk to you. It touches you to the soul!

I rarely find collections of songs that I can listen to over and over again from one end to another and not grow tired of hearing. John plays a soulful guitar and sings his songs from way down inside. I don't know his motivations, and frankly don't really care where he derives his inspirations.

However, Mayer has crossed the line. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off. But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room For Squares.","review":"John Mayer. Well This album is not very good one. His voice is annoying and perhaps sounds a bit too like Dave Matthews ( who I don't like either). He knows how to play a guitar and I give the album credit that it has good musicianship but the songwriting is terrible. I though that person that has these skills could write a decent tune but jeez. The melodies are okay but the rythm and the lyrics. Don't get me started on the lyrics. Most of the lyrics are so bland and shallow and especially the hit single your Body Is A Wonderland I mean could it be more corny than that. This man has obviously talent for playing but he needs to find wider range for his voice and try to write better songs.

The comparisons used were intriguing: Dave Matthews, et. al. Popped the disc in, though, and was the most disappointed I have ever been with a cd. The music was cheesy and overorchestrated and the lyrics were even worse. It's like someone took the journal from that moody girl in the back of your high school English class and went to town with a thesaurus. Come on guys. If you can honestly tell me that \\"I want to run through the halls of my high school/I want to scream at the top of my lungs\\" is a good lyric (or even remotely similar to anything that deserves a record contract), I will die of shock. Oh, and stop with the Dave Matthews comparison. He sounds more like Michael Bolton on a bad day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background music","review":"I bought this CD on the strength of \\"83,\\" which is a marvelous song. Unfortunately, the other cuts don't live up to its promise.

There are plenty of OTHER reasons to hate this album. Mayer is whiny pop-soft-rock at its worst.

Mayer plays guitar like a champion, and he can sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good in it's own way","review":"Like Sheryl Crow, Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan, John Mayer does not have the best conventional-sounding voice. But as is the case with these particular artists, it's actually quite appealing in it's own way, and so are these songs. So it's a little on the poppy side? Big deal-it does what music is supposed to do-either make you feel good or make you think. On both terms, this CD is quite a success. Any one who has doubts about John Mayer's talent should have caught his accapella (just himself and his guitar) perfomance of \\"Your Body's A Wonderland\\" on the 2003 grammys. He'll certainly be around for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I am quite fond of this album, and I have been listening to it continuously for months after a friend receommended that I give John a listen. I find that some of the songs toward the end of the album seem to drag a bit for me, but the vast majority of this newcomer's music is upbeat, humorous, and well crafted. Personal favorites would include \\"Why Georgia\\" , especially for while driving, and \\"Neon\\", for its jazzy influences. All those who have a taste for quality singer-songwriters should lend an ear to John Mayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer, not to be compared with Dave Matthews Band","review":"This album is amazing. The lyrics are a bit humorous, and there are little inside stories about his relationships with women. Unlike other albums, you will fall in love with every single song in this one. I think its degrading to call him \\"another Dave Matthews Band\\", because it really isn't. I'm not much of a Dave Matthews fan, nor I favor the lyrics... I mean, if you listen to the lyrics carefully, they're kind of perverted. John Mayer is an amazing artist that uses a string of metaphors, and puts real life monologues into song. I don't think many artists can pull that off. Don't you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is in a class by himself","review":"If I can put it in a nutshell, this guy is unique. He is just being himself and not what the industry wants him to be. This is the quality I like about him...\\"No Such Thing\\" caught me early one Saturday morning when I fell asleep in front of VH1. The melody and the chorus is what really stirred me. His guitar licks get you going in gear. Imagine that waking you up on Saturday morning...\\"Room for Squares\\" will be a classic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the quarter-life crisis","review":"I've never felt so much connection with anyone's lyrics as I do with this album. As catchy as \\"No Such Thing\\" is on the radio, it does not begin to describe the depth of the rest of the album both musically and lyrically. The intro to \\"3x5\\" alone is worth buying this album for. I can see where comparisons to DMB come from, but John Mayer is his own powerhouse. His songs speak to me and for me, and I can't stop listening to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer; The Best EVER!","review":"John Mayer is incredible. His live shows are amazing!! And his unreleased stuff is the best I have ever heard from an up and coming artist. He's going to be big, I'm telling you that much. I particularly love this cd, I've worn it out I've listened to it so many times! 3 x 5 and Back to You rock!To all those who think he's just like Dave Matthews, or what have you, is insane. John is more original than 99% of the musical acts out there!\\"You want me to play a Dave Matthews song? You know, that's just like getting someone else's mail. It's like if I go to the mailbox and pull out a letter addressed to Dave Matthews and think 'No, that's not for me', and put it back in.

He has a wonderful voice, and excellent lyrics. I write songs myself and only wish I could write songs that have the same feel as his. This CD is excellent and I am sorry for myself, that I didn't become a fan of John Mayer a long time ago when he first started. He is almost the most underrated singer I know. Well this CD is awesome, every song on it is the best, it hasn't left my CD player since I got it, and neither has Heavier Things. I definately recommend buying this CD, if you are a fan of this type of music and know good talent, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm interested in music again...","review":"Before John Mayer burst onto the music scene, I was REALLY bored with what I was hearing on mainstream radio. \\"Yeah, yeah\\" and various ways of saying \\"baby, i love you\\" just don't cut it for me. I love John's \\"smart\\" lyrics and his rich voice. I've almost had to stop listening to this CD in the car just because I get so into what he's saying, I forget to pay attention...But anyway, he's at the top of my list and I reccomend him to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one talented \\"kid\\"..","review":"I read reviews here before buying Room for Squares and wasn't sure if I'd like it. Turns out I REALLY like it. Thoughtful lyrics, catchy guitar hooks, skillful playing and John's interesting voice make this disc stand out in what seems to be a sea of bad popular music. Some reviews below diss him for sounding like Dave Matthews but I have no problem with it. You can't sum this guy up by saying he mirrors anyone in particlar. I hear Dave Matthews, Go West...maybe even Michael Franks at times. Not bad company with which to be compared. I would like to hear a little more variation in the music perhaps but it's good enough for now. I expect his music will become more diverse as he grays. But for a kid his age, or a kid of any age, he has created a wonderful album. Buy it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja vu","review":"Ok. Every review I've read of John Mayer's CD, Room for Squares, likens his voice to Dave Matthews, Sting, Stevie Ray Vaughn, among others. While I don't entirely disagree with any of these comparisons, there is a lead singer of an 80's pop band who I believe more closely compares to John Mayer's voice styling. Do any of you folks who came of age in the mid-80's remember the British band, Go West? If you can find a sound clip of the band (or if you still happen to have the tape), listen and compare. Especially the songs, Neon and Love Song For No One. Even some of the music is similar. Catchy, pop-type tunes. Granted, John Mayer's music has much richer acoustic sounds (less of that techno-beat that 80's music is known for) and is seemingly more developed as a musician. I truly enjoy John Mayer's CD but it causes déjà vu back to my high school days. Not necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Cool!","review":"Who the heck is Ricky Wright? I don't know what world he lives in, but in this one, you write about what you know well. If John Mayer knows himself, then more power to him.

In fact, my kids and I enjoy the song a lot and hence we bought the CD. \\"Why Georgia\\" also is fairly catchy. I also like the liner notes and the Periodic Table of the Elements graphic on the CD. But, the remainder of the album is all about looking back on the good ol' high school days - something John Mayer has been out of for, what, three years?The album has a very monotone sound with the same tempo and feel and same chord structure song after song. I imagine that the lyrics have some relevance to those in the teen/ early twenty set - probably the group that he is aimed at - but I don't get it. As an example, having John dream about what it will be like to go back to his 10 year high school reunion just does not resonate.Maybe John Mayer will be worth listening to when he actually lives life for a while. In the mean time, buy his CD single and forget the album"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't what it's cracked up to be!","review":"I bought the low priced album because I liked the first song which plays like crazy on the air waves but I couldn't even get past the 4th song without yawning and believe me, I get my sleep! Pass this one up. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Heart","review":"OK, John, im sorry but a 2 was reluctantly given by me. I know of several of my friends that greatly enjoy Mayer's music, but personally, I find it rather bland. Yes, he does have a unique and talented voice, however, his lyrics lack on the inspring side. Without true inspiration, all you have is a good voice with no heart. That is what John Mayer is. Perhaps inspiration will be found by him in the future, but I doubt it. So if you enjoy mindless uninspiring music then buy this CD and listen to it. But I enjoy musicians that offer something in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer keeps it Real, and Simple","review":"John's aweseome guitar playing capabilities, mixed with his smooth voice and deep meaningful and FUN lyrics make this title album of the year for me. 8 months after I purchased it I am STILL listening to this and his other album, Inside Wants Out, almost every day.From deep and personal song meanings, to generalized statements based on his own experiences that anyone can relate to, or as he says, use as an excuse when the going gets ugly.Buy this album, you will not be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY VOICE!...","review":"John Mayer has the prettiest voice on earth!! I've had this cd for a few months now and i have been able to listne to it over and over again-without getting sick of it!... i wish he'd come out with another cd cuz i'd probably love it even more!... WOOOOOO GO JOHN!... PRETTY VOICE!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"This is one of those CD's you can listen to over and over again- i've had it for 6 months now, and even though i listen to it almost every day i havent gotten tired of it. Buy it- you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"this cd is very well-done. i fell in love with john mayer a few months ago, and since then, i've saw him live twice. his lyrics make you feel like he is speaking to you on such a personal level. beautiful songs. get this cd, just because it's totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars just because....","review":"I havent heard all of this cd, but what I have heard is pretty good. I admit, that i think its a little to teeny-bopper, poppish for my taste, but one thing made me take a more respectful look at John Mayer. I saw him on Austin City Limits with Buddy Guy and with Stevie Ray Vaughan's old band Double Trouble. He tore into some blues on that show. I was in awe. I never knew SRV was his main influence in music. Just for that, I give him 4 stars, just because of the blues influence alone...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this CD","review":"I have been playing this cd over and over in my car ever since I bought it, and am still not tired of hearing it. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have I Been?","review":"Listening to my John Mayer CD, that's where. I had to go for 2 weeks without my CD when I went on vacation in January and my CD player broke. This is not that kind of CD you get tired of after the first few times through. John has been in my car's player since the day I bought him. And I wouldn't have it any other way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the kid a break for crying out loud....","review":"This is a great \\"pop\\" album.I've heard the best of the best, from the Beatles to Fleetwood Mac and Jackson Browne, and this is without a doubt, one of the better pop albums to come from a male artist in the last decade or so.Comparisions to Dave Matthews aside for the tripe they are, this young man knows how to write a song. From the catchy \\"hooks,\\" to the strong musicmanship and guitar work. My only complaint is that lyrical content is a bit ego-centric. But hey...I bet they said the same thing about Dylan, too.Time will tell if John Mayer is here to stay. Until then, enjoy his extraordinary talent and stop the inane comparisons. There's room on this planet for both Dave and John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"I haven't been this happy with a CD in a very long time. Every song is fantastic; for several months it's virtually the only thing I've listened to. The lyrics are thoughtful and funny--he creates a great story. I saw him in concert this summer and it was a great experience. I'm looking forward to his next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer is amazing but this is a less than great album","review":"i am a huge fan of John mayer but i must admit there is some songs that he shouldn't have put on this album..But there is alot of excellent songs on this album...John mayer is an amazing songwriter with a soulful voice..his voice is smooth and he sings with a intimate vibe to his vocals..this grammy winning artist's next album i hope will live up to my AWE of him..great tracks on this album:1. Your body is a wonderland...BRILLANT...amazing track so beautiful soo sexy...this guy is an incredible song writer2. no such thing..great track3.83..great track....4. my stupid mouth....the name says it all5.city love...a sexy and cool track..6. great indoors....he has a sexy sound that fuses jazz, pop, folk, rock all into one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"When everything (Alternative Rock and the likes) seemed to be mushing together to form one big sound, John Mayer came through with a breath of fresh air. His music is original, upbeat, and clever. Another review said \\"he just talks about georgia and neon...\\"... HELLO? It's a Metaphor. Anyways, this is a great album, I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love John!","review":"John is amazing. I too fell in love with him well before he became mainstream. The man is so talented. I give him props for writing his own music and actually playing his instrument. I have had the chance to see him in concert twice and it was without a doubt some of the best shows that I have ever attended. His songs are very heartfelt, and it is easy to see where he is coming from. He does not sound like a carbon copy of anyone. You will hear his influnences in his music, but that is because they are just that, an influence. If you have respect for the true singer songwriter then this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for derivative garbage","review":"This album sounds like a frat boy trying to be sensitive. Insanely generic. Don't buy it unless you like sappy hot-tub jazz. There is no soul in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this dude plays with dolls","review":"Okay I've been hearing people talk about this guy and his great music, and now I've heard some of it... well, he needs to be vomited upon. Whatever happened to rockin' and rollin'. La-Dee-Da is what this is. He needs a slot on the Lawrence Welk show."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm sorry...","review":"but there isn't anything that great about this disc. it's not entirely bad...it's just a little low on the replay value. to prove my theory, i am going to wait a year or two and see how many copies of it start appearing on the racks of all my local used cd dealers. unless you absolutely love what you hear of him, resist the hooks and do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews + Dave Matthews + Dave Mattews","review":"Is this Dave Play or Cold Mayer or John Matthews? I can't keep track anymore. Dave had a couple good tunes. I don't understand why anyone cares anymore or even wants to copy him so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coke Mayer","review":"...He writes sub-standard \\"been there, done that\\" singer/songwriter pop that seems to be all the rage these days. As a solo act, Mayer had something interesting going with his music but his arangements on here are terrible at best. The music is tired, dull, and like I said before, treading on familar ground..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but pretty damn close","review":"Not only is Mayer far and away NOT a Dave clone, this album is an unbelievably intelligent and thought out recording, something you dont see every day or even every year anymore...Theres alot of humor and sarcasm in the songs if you know how to listen for it... The only downside to this album is the occasional mismatch of music and lyrics, notably \\"Your Body is A Wonderland\\". The happy skippy music distracts from the incredible lyrics, and might have been served better toned down a notch.No Such Thing, Stupid Mouth, and Neon are worth buying the album for alone. Why Georgia, 83 and Great Outdoors are fantastic too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrics to relate to...","review":"Incredible lyrics engage the soul while the catchy tunes keep the blood flowing. Loved track 2 so much I bought the whole cd. Very grateful I did and would rec. this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy's gonna be big!","review":"I have a few albums that I'm able to just put in my car and keep there for several weeks of driving without ever getting old. Even without my favorite John Mayer song (Comfortable) this album is still awesome. Every song jumps out as an honest testament to life and love. \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" and \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" especially cannot be missed. I can't say enough how much everyone needs to experience this album! I'm so glad to have caught John Mayer on his rise to being a household name!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great young singer songwriter","review":"The amazon.com reviewer did not do justice to this great young singer songwriter. John is an amazing guitarist, and the cd does not do him justice at all(hence the four stars). If he is playing in a town near you go see him now, before he explodes on the music scene. The first time I saw him over a year ago there were maybe 10 people at the gig, now he is playing to sell out shows in Atlanta and 5,000 in Athens. Seeing him live is an amazing experience, worth all 10-15 bucks you will pay.John's music is hard to describe, a bit of jazz mixed in with pop lyrics that touch my heart and make me want to find a guy who will tell me he loved me even in \\"grey sweatpants and [with] no makeup\\". Influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughn, John Coltrane, and Dave Matthews (John recently came out of the closet on this one) John Mayer is an act you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome singer/songwriter","review":"I think this CD is just great. At first, I didn't really pay attention to John Mayer, but after listening to the CD, I fell in love with it. I don't think he tries to be like Dave Matthews at all. He's genuine, in my perspective. The fact that he writes his own songs just adds to that. His voice is so calming and smooth, and his words are unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its worth a listen....","review":"I have to admit that at first I didnt want to listen to John Mayer because all I could see was a Dave Matthews [knock]-off. But when a friend of mine gave me a copy of this album and I listened as a courtesy.. and I found myself liking it more and more and got to where it was all I would listen to. To compare John Mayer to Dave Matthews is an unfair. The only serious comparison to make is that they both play guitar and both write songs about women. John has his own style and he is worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"you just won't understand til you hear it","review":"seeing john mayer in a smoky bar is what the experience is all about. his shows will blow your mind, his voice will make you mad, and his energy will make your mouth drop to the floor. but if you can't see him live, the next best thing is this album. those of us who know john's music are proud of what he has done with these tracks and are proud of where he is headed, although as someone mentioned before, it will be painful for us once he hits the big time...he's been our best kept secret. if you hear this cd, you will not be disappointed. and if you are, well, you're missing out on something great. something phenomenal, better yet. check it out...john's the man!!!!! it'll prove to be the cd you just can't take out of the player, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great hooks","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the first review of this wellcrafted and down right fun cd. First of all,\\" No Such Thing\\" is such a breath of fresh air, compared to most of the mindless drivel on pop radio today. And while I am a fan of Dave MatthewsI think comparisons are unfair. I think Mayer's sound is Uniqueand stands on its own merit. The songs are pop for sure but thereis great guitar work and his lyrics are more insightful and certainly more understandable than some. Great guitar riffs andhooks and just plain good songs. Certainly a welcome sound in Todays era of Technopop and Boy Bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for squares","review":"John fits right in. More of the same watered down pop princess guitar work from this overrated loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off buying Dave Mathews Band *gasp*","review":"Yes, good guitar playing, decent lyrics... but what this boils down to is a poor version of the Dave Matthews Band. I'm not a huge Dave Matthews fan, but I can spot a band-wagon rider when I see one and John Mayer is one of them. I recently saw him play in New England and he just didn't par up. The crowd was aching for the opening act to come back on...."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a supposed heartthrob, he got some big ol' lips.","review":"Where would Abercrombie and Fitch, the Gap, J. Crew, and other stores that sell overpriced preppy clothes made by impoverished third-world children be without John Mayer? His music provides a perfectly bland accompaniment to the tough decisions that plague our nation's youth, like whether to get a rollneck sweater in pumpkin, cranberry, or periwinkle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is Trite","review":"I haven't heard a CD this boring or uneventful in so long. If I wanted to listen to Dave Matthews, I'd listen to Dave Matthews, if I wanted to hear a singer/songwriter who can actually play guitar I'd listen to Ryan Adams. The fact of the matter is, is that this cd just isn't very good. I'm not quite sure how you build a huge following on insipid tunes such as these. When I saw John Mayer in Memphis, I honestly thought he had bowel problems. His facial expressions are utterly mystifying. When the power went off on the stage he was playing, due to technical difficulties, perhaps John should have taken it as a sign and left."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, SELF ABSORBED And AIMLESS","review":"I bought this Cd when it was at its \\"introductory $6.99 new artist\\" price(ironically, it was his SECOND cd album!) - where it remained for several months till it was elevated to $12.99...DUNNO WHY...he's NOT the new \\"JAMES TAYLOR\\" as has been implied - JAMES TAYLOR is still kicking ass as a recording artist(thirty some odd years later!) and no one else can ever top him in his genre...JOHN, enjoy your fame while it lasts! Your Grammy was awarded only because you topped the heap of boring, indifferent and aimless artists the season this Cd was issued. You'll be history soon...your music is SO BLAND. JAMES TAYLOR won a GRAMMY too, and he's the REAL ORIGINAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I KNOW ELTON JOHN LIKES HIM BUT:","review":"HIS VOICE IS SMOOTH BUT EVERY SONG SOUNDED THE SAME, IT WAS PRETTY BORING.....MAYBE HE'S BETTER IN CONCERT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoustic wannabe rubbish.","review":"This guy sucks. His music sucks, his stage presence sucks, his lyrics suck, his voice sucks, his playing style sucks, his chord progressions suck, John Mayer sucks.[b]This aint nothing but disposable frat boy music. I hate the fact people look up to John Mayer as a blues guitarist. LOL. Blues? He makes my face blue is as close as he gets! This album was nothing more than a chick flick attempt. Sorry John Mayer.....your music sucks![/b]Highlight: Plays perfect in a gay bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer is so hot!","review":"John Mayer is the hottest guy I have ever seen. His song \\"your body is a wonderland\\" is SO TRUE. Listening to John Mayer reminds me of a combination of Mozart, the Beatles, and Justin Timberlake. You have to buy this CD!! The only bad thing about the cd is the stupid boxes on the CD. Whatever those mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for Squares","review":"Horrible!! Same tempo in every song..They all sound alike!!

This is the artist for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, sweet, satisfying music","review":"I tried out Mayer's cd on a recommendation that described him as Dave-ish. Well, maybe in the sense that his music is lyrical and soulful he is in the same nameless genre as Dave, but the comparison doesn't need to be pushed too far to make Mayer significant. Mayer's \\"Room for Squares\\" is pure pleasure--that rare cd where I don't have to skip any of the songs to get to the ones I really like. But he is not Dave. He is in his early 20s and his music reflects his youth. It is about small personal issues, the stuff of everyday life. Mayer is not extreme in his musical style, but his music is beautiful and soulful and cathartic. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE JOHN MAYER","review":"I love this CD. It has instantly become the best one I own. I think John Mayer is amazing. His music is so relaxing...I could listen to it all day. It is my favorite. I never go ANYWHERE without it. Everyone should get this CD because it is so wonderful. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD in my collection","review":"No Such Thing is a quailty album start to finish. Each time I listen to the album I find a new \\"favorite\\" song, from Why Georgia Why?, to Neon, to Not Myself. This album is always a good listen. John Mayer is a rising star and will be heard from for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Acquired Taste: Not For Everyone","review":"Considering how much I love this album, I was compelled to write a review after rreading amzaon's unfair review.What makes this album good is the provoking guitar and overall jazzy feel of the album.Yes, the lyrics are mostly just John Mayer musing about different aspects of his life, but does that mean we should get animous towards him? Not at all.A very good album to have with you on a long drive or just for some good easy listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds his own!","review":"...Mayer's sound is excellent in it's own right. Funny thing is, when a friend played this for me, he mentioned the simularity to Dave Matthews' vocals. I replied yes, but the voice is better, ... It is great to hear \\"kids\\" making music like this again.If you like classic rock with a touch of the bluesy sound, buy this one. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite new singer-songwriter","review":"At first listen, you may think that John Mayer's album,\\"Room For Squares\\", is just another pop record by just some guy that just wants to make money. But if you really take a listen, you will discover that he is one of the greatest new singer-songwriters around now, and that he is well mentally beyond his years. I HIGHLY!!! recommend this album to ANY real music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coverup","review":"When I first heard his songs on the radio, I thought he had a wonderful voice and great guitar playing to go along with it. So I made a huge mistake in buying this CD. Aside from the 1 or 2 decent songs, the rest are monotone and slow, plus all of his songs sound the same! Please, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite CD","review":"I just love this album. It has great music and great lyrics. It is definitely one of the most favorite CDs of mine. I was just reading one review by an editor from Amazon.com. It looks like the person does not like this CD. I just feel sorry for him because I think he is missing a lot. I did think John Mayer's voice sounds like Dave Matthews, but so what? All songs are still very original and good. Best of all, John Mayer's songs make me smile. They are fun boys' songs. Especially, the ways John Mayer describes his girlfriend and himself are so comical yet beautiful. John Mayer does not use fancy words like Sting does (don't get me wrong, I love Sting too), but I can totally find one romance world in his music. It is just sad to see some people spend too much time on criticizing, and cannot simply enjoy what is good. Well, maybe that is their job. For those of you who have not heard this CD, just ignore the editor's comments. This is a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"for that car ride...","review":"its the perfect I just got off of work on a friday afternoon and im driving home with the windows down in 70 degree weather CD...doesnt get much better than that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"oh my gosh! i love him i love him i love him! when my cousins told me about john mayer i was sceptical even though they always make great choices in music.when i first heard john i couldnt belive my ears. not to mention when my cousin showed me a picture of him. what a hottie!now at least 2 and a half years has passed and i still listen to him everyday except now with friends,my sister, and even my parents. no matter what style of music you like you are bound to love john mayer!(esspecially this cd)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD","review":"This by far THE BEST Cd I have.

Now I know I should really re-think my friendship with the guy, this album falls totally flat. There is absolutely nothing at all original at any moment in these 14 songs. The lyrics are sappy and uninspired (it sounds like poetry a pimple covered 14 year old would write, then read and discard). It is obvious that this guy was a big fan of Dave Matthews in college, so he decided to become his cuter and less-talented clone. My advise to John Mayer is to quit his day job and go work for Calvin Klein or something. I guarantee he will be on a where-are-they-now segment of VH1 in 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY ROOM FOR MAYER!","review":"John Mayer finally hits world wide appeal with \\"Room For Squares\\". I bought this album before the first single \\"No Such Thing\\" was a hit.This album is well written, produced and arranged. Mayer is in top vocal form who keeps being compared to the Dave Matthews Band which is completely false. Mayer has his own style and vocal performance.Songs like \\"Neon\\" and his latest hit \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" are in no way the same boring drone of Matthews Band who keep churning album after album out with the same song and sound.Mayer is his own man, with his own style. This album is completely solid through and through. A nice enjoyable treat.Someones review compared him to \\"New Kids on the Block\\"!...Oh please. People like this - you can show them a Monet, then a Velvet Painting of Kids with BIG eyes, and they would see no comparison.This album is a definite recommendation for Adult Contemporary Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is like new but.......","review":"it took a long time for me to receive it which was a real bummer. the CD itself was in great shape and exactly as described by the seller. maybe they had a busy week?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cd","review":"I love John Mayer at certain times. He's kalm and has a certain whit to his music. It's the perfect easy listening cd for dining with my girlfriend or reading a book on the train.I actually prefer this album over his newer album but that's a personal choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"I bought this CD for the song \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" and found the rest of the songs to be just as good. John Mayer covers the gammet with slow, soulful melodies, as well as kicking it up a little with other songs. If you're preference in song voice is quiet and strong, this CD might work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome except the lyrics","review":"Beautiful voice, great, chilled out acoustic guitar playing, nice melodies, some of the songs have that instant classic quality to them, as if they are songs you are going to remember for awhile. The one problem is that the lyrics are kind of mediocre. You think someone with his sound would have more poetic ability, but the lyrics just don't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"This guy sounds as if he's never learned how to enunciate ANYTHING. He swallows vowels, consonants, and any life that might be in his \\"music\\". He's definitely not brilliant, nor do I understand how people could possibly listen to the entire CD, much less appreciate it.There is some promise in his guitar playing, if only he'd keep his mouth shut while he was doing it, we'd all be better off.Save your money for something a little more moving. You'll thank me for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really hyped to get this CD, I've always loved John Mayer and Room For Squares is one of my all time favorite CDs. His voice is fabulous. But, when my boyfriend finally bought it for me, it was only mediocre. Room For Squares had an even number of slow songs and HAPPY upbeat songs. Heavier Things just seems like kind of a slow drawn out disc. Bigger Than My Body is wonderful, but I wasn't really able to get into the other songs. They were just really slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least I Slept Good","review":"Gosh, if I was able to give this cd a 0 star, I would. This cd is sooo bad. Who is this guy, anyway??!!! The only good thing about this cd is by the time the second song was played, I was in LA-LA land. The best sleep anyone can ask for. Like everyone on here, I feel his song \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" or whatever that ... was, makes it the worst song of the decade. Can you imagine a guy telling you that your body is a wonderland? I can't and if it happens, I am keeping away from him!!! You should do the same...keep away from this cd. Trust me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for mouthbreathers!!!!!!","review":"I borrowed this cd from someone who actually bought this.....and this person was actually an adult! I can't understand what anybody sees in this kid, but they must see something as this has sold a couple million copies. This muzak is so bland and soul less.....that it's almost unbelievable. It's never good when a music academy brat attempts to bare his soul.....under the guise of singer/songwriter. There is nothing distinctive here......except the parts when he sounds autistic. The guitar playing, topics and lyrics are so generic......when listening it seems you are stuck inside of a advertisement for the Gap or Abercrombie and Fitch. I don't recommend this cd to anybody over the age of 15..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal with this guy?","review":"When he sings, it sounds like he has a large bathtowel crammed in his throat.

John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\" is an excellent album.it is mellow, but upbeat in a way. I can't seem to take it out of my cd player, i listen to it all the time. He is a a great musician and should be credited so. Why do i give it 4 stars you ask? because there is one song that i don't quite like, but that is MY opinion. i think that anyone who even bothered reading this should definitely buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ships in 24 hours, drips for an hour","review":"Wow, I didn't realize anything this mediocre could get produced by a major label. Obviously good intentions, but there are no surprises anywhere in instrumentation, tonal changes, energy, or pace. My strong bias is not to write negative reviews, but this sounds like music and lyrics for a very young person locked in a fetal position in their dorm bed, reminiscing about a life that has hardly begun."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"If you have any prior sense of music, play any instrument or are in any means influenced by the works of musicians who write and sing music based on soul and hardship, heartbreak and life, and not about sissy highschool relationships than this is definetly not the album for you. To musicians, his craftmanship and prue subject matter in his songs, i.e. your body is a wonderland, is awful, and awe astounding, but being that the music industry is in it for the quick buck it is no wonder such a pop teen orientated artist is such a hint. Ive fallen for such *** before but ive graduated highschool and i feel that my music should move along with me, but it seems johns hasnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Over the past month or so, I've been hearing myriads of people raving about how great this CD is. Having finally bought it, without hearing any of it before I did, I have to say that I don't see what's so spectacular about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's a bad album at all. All I'm saying is that this is not anything to get that excited about. I liked most of it, but there was nothing that blew me away. What I heard was standard lite-pop/rock. The lyrics are nothing outstanding. The guitar playing is good, but nothing special. The backing band is actually really banal and boring. I guess after hearing so many people rave about this album I was expecting something groundbreaking. Instead, what I hear is almost mediocre, and definetly not impressive. There's promise here, but no delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the ... critic reviewer thinking??","review":"Ok I don't know why you are insulting John Mayer's music. This is my favorite CD, which I had a hard time giving up last night when a hallmate wanted to borrow it. But I did give it to him in order to spread the John Mayer-love.

I LOVE this CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much beyond the singles","review":"The two songs you hear from this set on the radio are pleasant slices of pop.

Now, I'm off to try to use the CD booklet as a means of rolling up a fatty."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAYER IS GENIUS","review":"As a first album of wide release, this is the bomb. Basically, John's soulful tones relate to a wide spectrum of the listening audience making him one of the top songwriters of his generation. Mostly this album is full of wit and great guitar playing. I encourage anyone who has listened to \\"Wonderland\\" and danced along as it played on the radio to check out the who playlist on this album. Very personal and insightful. John actually wrote all of these songs and if you have ever the chance to witness him in person...go. He is electric and spins a great feel to all in the crowd. His group left me speechless..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful CD-still today!","review":"Room For Squares is an awesome CD. It is still on high rotation even though it is a few years old. It is a great CD for people young and old as my sister loves him and so does my mom. John Mayer has a quirkiness about him that pulls you into his music. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Jack Johnson, Howie Day or anyone that has a similar sound you will love this CD too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The editor have a very particular opinion.","review":"No doubt the editor was in the middle of a bad day when he wrote this review.

JOHN MAYER IS AMAZING!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the main review (jerk head)","review":"If you like rhythm and enjoy nice melodies, then grab this album. While it may not be for cranking up on a Saturday night, it fits very nicely into most other nights of the week. Who analyzes lyrics like this reviewer anyway? Let him try the latest REM album...The jazz influences are great - and we should encourage more artists like Mayer as well as Pete Yorn. Not tear them down because they don't fit some mold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning, and anticipating even better","review":"...As a college student I can relate to the lyrics, although they might not be as deep and meaningful as some, they are real. Even though \\"My stupid mouth\\" may not be some of his best work, and he maybe sounds a little too close to Dave Matthews...I think that his talent is obvious. I've listened to the CD inside and out for the last few weeks and each time \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" is over I feel satisfied, yet I want more. This album is a great start for John Mayer and I look forward to even better from him in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer is AMAZING!","review":"I'm shocked that so many people are giving this album poor reveiws.

This album leaves NOTHING to be desired, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to listen to.","review":"I'm not a huge music buff, but did like some of the tracks enough to buy the CD.

Okay, so there are some catchy tunes (and by catchy tunes I mean simplistic, repeating, 3 chord wonders), but any avid music fan can tell you exactly from which artists Mayer gets his stuff from. I bet if I try real hard, I, too, can sound like Dave!Summary: If your biggest worry in life is how to catch the eye of the guy you pine after in history class, buy it. If not, be true and go get some Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's young and having fun...","review":"I think Louis Armstrong was the person that said that there are two kinds of music- 'good music and bad music'. Well, John Mayer seems to have created a new kind of music- 'hollow'. This guy needs to sit at the feet of real musicians if he wants to have a career in music. I hope John does not end up on the ever growing scrap heap of pop stars because he does have potential. However, this album is premature. Hopefully, John Mayer will someday look back on this album and be able to say \\"Oh God, what was I thinking\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"I will say that John Mayer is an accomplished guitar player. I think he has the potential to be a good song writer. However, he just didn't show it on this album. I listened to every song on the album and was, well, bored. Nothing stood out, nothing really made me think, \\"Wow, that was a good song.\\" Nothing stuck in my head and I had no desire to listen to the disk again. You know how occasionally you listen to an album and it influences your life or it makes you think? This never came close for me. Sorry John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a free promo cd","review":"Damn, I got this cd for free when I worked at a music store. It was an instore play and no one wanted to play it.

John's only 25, and yet he's captivating audiences from the age of 15 to 83. He's only bound to mature his ability, but for a debut album, this ROCKS! He most certainly has an old soul as I remember boys at that age and most were never that deep or soul searching (not that I am THAT much older). He has managed to capture the essence of what makes music popular...relating to others thoughts, desires and histories and making it sound catchy and then adding a strong blues edge and influence. I can't even say that he is a spokesperson for his generation because when I saw him live, I was amazed at the diversity of his audience. I had listened to him before he hit the mainstream and wish that those of us who enjoyed him then would have been able to keep him secret from the rest of you, but since the secret's out, buy this CD and you won't take it out of the CD player..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear Candy That's Good For You","review":"There's not a lot to dislike about John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares.\\" The disc is consistently pleasurable throughout -- and there's nothing wrong with that!\\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" comes as close to blissful pop perfection as any song I've heard in a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Devastation","review":"Beautifully illustrated with color photos, this book vividly describes various catastrophic events that have occurred and continue to happen throughout the world.

After taking it out of the box I was surprised to see that it was slighty rusty with little speckles of rust on it. I was intent on returning it immedetiately to get the black on instead. However the cardboard box that it was packaged in got completely torn to shreds by my impatient kids that didn't understand why the bank that they had wanted so badly had to get returned. So they immediately in tempts to \\"save\\" their bank put money in it knowing it would only open at ten dollars. At around 4.30 the cents part stopped working, appearing to have popped off its track on the inside of the bank. Now I have a bank that cost 25.00 that doesn't work.So all in all, save your 25.00 and buy a different bank. Because this one is not worth the price of 25.00 I'm just glad I bought one to test before buying another one (Spending 50.00 on banks seemed a bit ridicious at the time and I'm glad it did)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in more than one way","review":"We purchased one for our toddler's birthday.

I use them as in-ear-monitors for playing live drums with my band, and every day at work hooked up to my Zune. The best thing is the cable is replaceable, so they're not garbage if you ruin the cable. I snagged the cable on a sharp piece of metal at work and caused a short. I bought a $20 replacement and they were good as new. The earbuds are super efficient too so they can get LOUD!!!!! without distorting. You can get better ones but you'll pay hundreds more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound, Need to get used to them","review":"I am very impressed with the sound quality of the Ear buds. The bass response is suburb and the mids and highs are excellent. It took a little while to get used to the way they fit your ears. The most difficult part was finding the tip that fits your ear comfortably and issolates the sound. Try all the tips in the case before you judge these. If the tip is too large or too small, you will not get the seal and the bass response will suffer.Overall, these are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it possible to have too much bass?","review":"In one word: Yes. It is possible to have too much bass.I previously owned a pair of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10s. They were the best sounding earphones I've ever owned (although the fit could use some improvement).I bought the Super.fi 5 Extended Bass because of all the good reviews. And as a lot of other reviewers have stated, the bass is amazing on these earphones. It's loud and punchy.Unfortunately, man cannot live on bass alone. The mids and the highs lack punch and presence. I listen to a lot of \\"bass heavy\\" music like techno, hip hop, electro, dubstep, etc. I like a lot of bass. But it shouldn't come at the expense of other frequencies.If you are looking for earphones with solid bass but better response across all frequencies, I would recommend the Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10s over the Super.fi 5 EBs. Still really good bass, but also good mids and highs as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, Not Durable","review":"My second pair in 18 months has failed the same way: the wires near the jack get weakened from bending (I guess) and 1 channel goes away unless you keep the rubber boot bent with your fingers.

Not recommended for wear during workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in-ear headphones for bass","review":"These in-ear headphones are excellent. I like to be able to feel the \\"punch\\" in the music, and these really deliver. The bass is strong, but tight, and does not distort the sound. They fit very well and I can get a good seal. I only have one quibble; I first bought these in 2005 and after almost a couple of years, one of the wires became defective and so I could only receive sound in one of the earphones.

I bought the HP 49G+ expecting it to be top-of-the-line, but it was a big disappointment and I decided to return the calculator within the 30-day trial period. The documentation is so inadequate that I was unable to use very much of the calculator's capabilities and gave up trying to learn in frustration. The User's Guide lacks an index; however, the manual on the included CD does! The HP 49G+ and the manual is very user un-friendly - for example, if you are in the financial mode, there is no obvious way to exit back to the calculator mode and the manual does not tell you how (press the NXT key).

So, here are the pros/cons compared to previous HP calcs:PROS:* Keyboard vastly improved over 49G, though not quite as good as 48G/GX. Few complaints here.* Hard leather case. No worry about smashing the screen like there was with the 48G's soft case.* Very quick. No delays between calling up a menu or in scrolling through the UI boxes. Very nice!* Includes USB connectivity cable and software.* Great price: $125 is what I paid. That's pretty good compared to what I paid for my 48GX and 49G brand new.CONS:* Leather case fits tight, so it may actually turn on without you knowing it.* Plastic cover for 49G was convenient.

The final straw is that it eats batteries like they are going out of style.Mine died completely last week after a short period of little use. It is remarkable how bad this product is compared to the past models.

I also have to remark that key registration on screen is deficient.

The keys don't always register (HP told me that this is solved in currently shipping models; this remains to be seen, I had two that didn't reliably register keystrokes). Even worse, the calculator crashed. Yes, it locked up during a routine task, and had to have its batteries removed (and memory reset) before it would respond to keystrokes. I exchanged my first 49G+, and then returned the second for exactly the same unacceptable behavior.If you want a calculator for light use, graphing, no programming, this might be a good one to get. If you want one that is reliable, I suggest that you look for a used 48GX or 48G+, at least until they work out the bugs in early production versions of the 49G+.

There is a free 3rd party program to make the ti-89 as good an RPN calculator as any HP (and I've had a lot of HPs).If you're looking at this calculator because it has a graphic equation editor, buy the ti-89 because there is a free (or much better but a little money) third party program to do graphic equation editing on the ti-89 (it's actually better than the app in the hp).Also, the TI does not have graphing issues, is simpler to use, has a huge user base, and is well documented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing to happen to HP calculators","review":"I will make my point in less than a few sentences. This calculator is the largest mistake that HP Calculator division has ever made. It is simply a build on the HP48ish code with some speed improvements - that I can accept. What I CANNOT accept is the sorry excuse for a keyboard and user interface. My calculator died just after a few months. From what I read online, HP lost the ability to design the old style reliable key interface in the 48G series graphing and the 32SII series scientific. I'm glad I still have my 48GX and use my 49G+ warranty replacement as a neglected backup. What I want is the same form factor as my 48GX with much more speed and fancy features (todays graphics) with the same reliability - not too much to ask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't trust the results due to the poor quality of the device","review":"I cannot trust the answer this calculator provides due to the bad keyboard. The problem with the keyboard is that not all key presses are recognized by the calculator even though the key was firmly pressed. What this means is, unless you very careful and double check you calculator usage, the answer cannot be trusted. From this point of view, the calculator has negative value!Btw, this is my second HP 49g+. I used HP's warranty and returned the first as defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This calculator is terrible. At first the keys didn't register then they release a firmware upgrade that has keys registering twice or more, for instance I press 1 and I get two or three 1s on the screen. Many people including myself at first would think that complaining about the keypad is just nitpicking but the keypad is really so bad that it makes the calculator nearly useless. Also the key presses make a loud hollow sound which tends to be distracting in a quiet environment such as a classroom during an exam. Next, considering the processor and software running on this calculator hp could've made an effort to put an improved display on it but they didn't. I give it 2 stars because the CAS is really genial although the documentation is so bad, it makes it really hard to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst calculator from HP !!","review":"I use HP calculators my entire professional life. This is the worst one I see. I purchased TWO HP 49G+. One for myself and the other for my son. The first one failed within one month - my son told me that it has funny characters on the screen. Mine just failed (4 months old). The thing just won't turn on and have some black vertical lines on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a pile of junk.","review":"A $150 calculator that I am going to trash. I had the same problem with the keyboard (terrible response); I struggled with it for about a year and then called HP. My warranty was out, so Hp suggested I install an update, which I did.

This is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Graphing Calculator","review":"This calculator is a very useful tool for advanced mathematical courses.

Corum, for those of you who are not familiar with Moorcock, is an incarnation of the Eternal Champion. In this trilogy, Corum is called into the distant future to assist in the battle against the Fhoi Myore. While there, he learns some important lessons about love and belonging.I have to confess that Corum is probably my least favorite of the incarnations of the Eternal Champion-- I like both Elric and Hawkmoon better. All the same, you have the general elements of Moorcock greatness-- brooding reluctant hero, the companion & his cat, and a strong tie in to historical myth and legend.Start with the Swords Trilogy, and not here, if you have read no Corum before. The backstory is helpful to understand character motivation, if nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the original","review":"This movie is so funny. It matches the original so much.

Boring subplot focusing on the non-actor \\"Mini-Me\\". We don't care if he supplants Scott as Dr. Evil's favorite son. Fat Bastard character is unnecessary and excessive - does Myers think he is back in \\"I Married an Ax Murderer\\"? After reading some of the other reviews I believe this movie goes over great with a younger crowd who can't understand the spy references, whereas a more mature audience who appreciates the spy satire of the genre so evident in the first movie, are here sorely dissapointed.

I found this one just replayed the a lot of the old jokes and they just weren't as funny second time around. The DVD seems to have more extras but again I don't think they're as good as the previous DVD. The deleted scenes weren't great and you can tell why they were cut, they aren't that funny. I was really disappointed with the commentary. It too wasn't as funny as previously and seemed a bit forced. I don't like commentary where you don't have to actually watch the film to listen to it, a lot of it was like that. The Dr. Evil biography was funny, but I'd have trouble watching it over and over. The music videos were great, but will you buy a DVD for the music videos? Probably not.

This is the type of movie that just may have you doubled over from laughing so hard and I very highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves a good laugh and is not insulted by bathroom type humor!

Remember Wayne's World 2?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could Give 0 Stars I Would.","review":"How do you insult a brilliant movie like Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery? Simple. Make Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Every joke that was in this film was not only used in the first movie, but repeated over, and over again in this one. The scenes with Felicity and Austin were nothing but fantasies a 13 year old boy would have. (Hey, now I know who wrote the script!) Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was a great movie and a hysterical spoof on James Bond. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me insulted my intelligence as well as Mike Meyers self respect. If you feel that you must see this movie, go ahead. But don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another disappointed fan of the first movie","review":"I was quite eager to see this movie when it came out because the DVD of the original Austin Powers movie is one of my very favorites. But like many other reviewers, I was sorely disppointed in this sequel. Although it has some new and legitimately funny moments, it is mainly just a retread of the first movie. I mean they took ALL of the jokes that were really funny and fresh in the first movie, repackaged them, and repetitively beat them into the ground. That was bad enough. But they really ruined this movie with some amazingly juvenile gross-out gags. Not my cup of tea, baby! From reading the other reviews, I'm amazed at the wide variety of opinions on this movie. Probably better to rent this one before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Gives?","review":"This is very bad comedy. I liked the first film but this is a parody of a parody. It is the worst thing that a comedy can be (BORING). The picture quality and sound are first rate (the colors really jump). The best thing on this DVD are the music videos, particularly \\"American Women\\" (IT ROCKS) Almost worth buying the video just for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't regret...","review":"I don't understand how this movie gross over $200 mil. I didn't see it on a big screen, but I'm glad I didn't. So, I watched it by renting it at Blockbuster, and I totally disgusted by bad actings, no plot(not even a comedy), and mostly I hated what he's name a dork from SNL.. constantly repeating the word yeah baby... He's totally not that funny and I want to say to him to shut the hell up.. To people considering purchasing the video or dvd, listen to me don't waste your money you don't have to make him a dork from SNL rich.I wish I could give it no star review but 1 star is the lowest rate I could give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shag yourself rotten....","review":"....with Austin on his second cinematic romp through time that's even better than the first.

The content in this movie is quite adult oriented, but yet a great laugh. Even though there are many spin-off's of the first movie (ex. shh and zip it), this movie gets better the more you watch it. You can't just watch it once because I too didn't like it at first, but the more you watch the more you pick up the humor! VERY entertaining! Buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nutty Reviews","review":"I saw the movie a few days ago after waiting several months to see it. I was excited when I popped the cassette into the VCR. After all, the first movie was incredibly funny, sharp and a bit zany. This one was terrible. Midway through the film I thought, \\"Perhaps this is part of the joke...that the movie is making fun of itself by starting off terribly...\\" I was embarrassed for having rented it. The jokes were forced and silly; the product promotion was sickening. That's okay though. I still feel that Mike Myers is an excellent comedian, I just wonder about two things. First, in his heart of hearts, does he really think he made a good movie? Or does he (Myers) know that he rushed it, and came out with an inferior product? And, seond, how in the world could so many people have enjoyed this movie? Some reviewers went as far as to call it the \\"greatest movie ever.\\" Perhaps for children yes, but for any thinking person? Eh-eh. You have to be kidding me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"When it appeared in theatres back in summer '99, I thought this is one of the good sequels that was just as good as before. Vanessa Shagme and Fat Bastard were both a plus to this new movie. Doctor Evil and Austin Powers still act the same, and still make me laugh. Michel Meyers didn't loose with this one. The story line made sense (unlike the one after this one)and it was one enjoyable movie. I recommend that you get this one, because it will make you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recast of the first Austin Powers, less the originality","review":"Liking the first Austin Powers, I gave this a try. Unfortunately, I found little new from the first. The same basic jokes. It had a couple of good one liners, and the character of Mini-Me saved the show from bombing completely, but all in all hardly worth seeing. The only new jokes were so far \\"over the top\\" that they didn't add, just detracted because of the lengths they had to go to get there. All in all, this makes a poor followup to a great original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"The first Austin Powers is one of my favorite movies because there is nothing else just like it. It had many clever references to culture that make it funny every time you watch it, and the sayings from it were hilarious. \\"Saucer of milk, table two.\\" This one is MUCH more lowbrow in its attempts for laughs. Much of the humor in it centers around anuses and their products, and frankly is more disgusting than funny. The Spy Who Shagged Me seems like a movie put together by a person who had read about Austin Powers and tried to force a second movie out of it. None of the brilliance of the first movie is present here."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont get why people like this movie","review":"i love comedy movies but this is kinda stupid. Mike meyers is incredibally annoying in this movie. the first one was a little better. The only reason this movie did so well is because mtv promoted so much and every little teenie bopper had to run out and see it just because mtv said to. For real comedy go with dumb and dumber or ferris beullers day off they are ten times funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Austin Powers Movie Is Enough!","review":"This second spy/Bond parody movie then becomes extremely repetitive and boring - the same old childish jokes using sexual innuendo, potty-humor, and over-acting. Robert Wagner continues as #2, a drab role for a former star. The 'plot' centers around Austin having lost his sex drive and has to return to the sixties to get it back. Somehow we also get a cameo Jerry Springer appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spy who put me to sleep(1 star is too much)","review":"I would call this the worse film ever made, but some of my favorite films have been described as the worse film ever made so I cannot put this film in that category because even the title of worse film ever made gives this film too much recognition, got it? First of all, what was the point of MINI ME? The only gag was that he is short..OH a handicap joke, I'm laughing so hard!! How Funny!! Putting a handicapped man in the film for everyone to laugh at, gee Mike Meyers your fabulous..and the guy is a terrible actor anyway..2nd thing is, the scene where Austin, in a split screen, is talking to himself from 10 minutes in the future is so badly put together that it makes The Patty Duke show seem like cutting edge technology..Oh and gee Austin Power's assistant takes on a lesbian lover with a uni-brow, will the pure genius comedy ever stop? Mr. Meyers your 15 minutes of fame is over,please, please, go away, far, far away from my dvd player as possible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult Film with a gross twist","review":"My Arkansas son in law loved the film, but the rest of the clan gave it a thumbs down.

Mike Myers playing three roles was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Movie","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major letdown","review":"I saw this film hoping to see another great spy parody, but I was very very disapointed. The first movie was very funny and it had a lot of great spoofs and jokes, but this one just recycled some of the old jokes and tryed to parody pop culture. I sat through this whole movie and the only funny part was when they were in the tent. The rest was just a very bad \\"comedy\\". If you want a funny spy parody I suggest that you see the first one skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is gross","review":"This movie is grosser than the first and the third is probably the worst. Gross out humor is not funny or amusing. Movies like Austin Powers appeals to the lowest level of intelligence. It is a shame that college students finds this garbage funny. There are scenes that are too disgusting to describe.The story centers around Austin Powers and his arch rival Dr. Evil. Dr. Evil has a clone called Mini Me. I gave this film two stars instead of one because Micheal Myers was generally funny as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unoriginal.","review":"Dumb swinger secret agent- beautiful assistant he falls in love with- dull yet wacky enemy. Sounds alot like another movie I know of, what was it called, oh yeah- The First \\"Austin Powers\\". The original was very funny and original, it was a slap in the face to most comedies at the time. Unfortunitely, \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" is basically the same thing, except Austin Powers goes back in time again. Its so predictable, because it is all the same gags as the first Austin Powers. Now all these kids are quoting this movie, and think that it is so hilarious, it was hilarious the first time it happened, then they basically made a carbon copy. Also, the original Austin Powers was a flop, not many people saw in the theatre, but word got around, and every body saw it when it was released on video, which is the making of a great comedy. If you already own the original, you dont need to buy this, because you pretty much already own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"remember pet detective, Truman ?","review":"Just when you thought comedies couldn't go any lower, Austin Powers does.The Truman Show (although not a comedy) was funnier than this.

Another Saturday Night Live disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno what I was thinking...","review":"Acually I hated this movie. I saw it 3 times and I just don't like it.

Probably I wasn't in the right mood. I mean, I love slapstick comedies, and I've liked the first Austin Power, but this is nothing compared. The storyline is nonsense, there is no clue beetween scenes and a lack of originality. However I'm looking forward for the next Mike Myer's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I liked this movie because it was funny for more than just the juvenile humor, although it did have quite a bit of that, too.

You will love it if you enjoy parodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, but too much of a re-run","review":"Maybe I loved the first movie so much that I was bound for a letdown. I felt 'Shagged' spent too much time repeating the same jokes that were in the first movie. I hope there is a third movie, but that they find some new material for Austin. There's certainly no shortage of spy themes to spoof."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time....","review":"This movie is so stupid it's hard realize it without watching it!

His greatest creation continues to be Dr. Evil, who eclipses our hero in interest here. The humor ranges from dry and witty to the truly revolting. The make-up that transforms Meyers into the disgustingly obese Fat Bastard earned an Oscar nomination. Not for every taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST EVER","review":"I cannot tell you how bad this film is. There are not enough words in the english language to describe how DISGUSTING this \\"blockbuster\\" manages to be. The character of \\"Fat Bastard\\" is a sickening stereotype that enrages me so much I pass out. The \\"Plot\\" is contradicting, illogical and erratic. Everything about this movie makes me want to buy every copy and destroy them. I would destroy every print of this film in the whole world if I could. Austin Powers is one of the most annoying characters ever created. If he is supposed to be British why does he have such a stupid name? No British people have names like that. Especially in the '60s. He was obviously born in the '30s or late '20s. People didn't have name like that then! Duh! Every single character in this movie is a PATHETIC stereotype and I advise you to steer clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD stear clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst films I ever seen!","review":"I remember when this film came out all the hype it got,why! This movie isn't funny at all and either was the first one! Mike Myers has to be one of the worst actor we have today,maybe with the exception of Adam Sandler.

Anyone that buys this movie has got to have a single digit IQ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw me a fricken bone here!","review":"Mike Myers, a comical master, wrote the script for Austin Powers. Further, in this film, he plays Austin Powers and his worst enemy, Dr. Evil. Simply put, this is a farce on James Bond films. If you have seen all the Bonds, you will actually recognize Dr. Evil and Mr. Fuji in Austin Powers.Like Pussy Galore, Austin Powers has the bad lady, Allota Fagina.I loved this movie...it made me laugh hard. What I love most is Dr. Evil...everything about him....his wierd grey suit, his deformed facial scar, the way he holds his finger to his mouth...and most of all...the therapy session he has with his son Scott.(only a genius could of drafted those words together)What is the movie about? Bad guy wants to rule the world, good guy had to stop him.Lots of good one liners in this film...can get a bit boring imbetween good parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy","review":"This movie is brilliant, the extra features are the best that I have ever seen on DVD, and I thought that although it was not as original as the movie and certain scenes were reused (eg \\"Shhh\\"-> \\"Zip it\\" and \\"Mutated sea bass\\"->\\"magma chamber\\" but the Shhh/Zipit was taken from Myers previous Axe Murderer movie anyway) the film was still funny and brilliant in it's own right.Somebody commented on killing Vanessa... Are you serious? Since when have bond movies starred the same girl twice in a row? She was lucky to get a part at all! Heather Graham, whilst not the best actress in the world, is perfect for the role.As for not being as much of a bond spoof and more of a continuation... Did anybody spot the \\"hollowed out volcano lair\\", \\"ursula andress emerges from water\\", \\"moonraker moonbase\\", and that's just for starters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Austin Powers 2: Horible ,crude GREAT!","review":"Hello you may have read some of my previous reveiws before but this is the reveiw of one of my favourite movies. 60's swinger Austin Powers is back but where is Vanessa Kensington? Well if you havn't seen it I won't spoil it for you,but if you enjoyed the first movie you will love this one. Unfortunatly the reason I didn't it the full 5 marks is that in parts of it some of the humour was ofensive ,but don't let that put you off. Austin Powers2 is still a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A funny man decides to be sick and gross instead","review":"The first movie was good, but rank. This second movie is rank, but rank. Other than a fresh and attractive leading lady, there is nothing here but bathroom humor, worn out sex jokes, and long close ups of Dr. Evil's facial expressions that got old in the first 5 minutes of the last movie. Meyers is a very funny man, but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this movie should've never been made.","review":"I liked the first Austin Powers, but it wasen't worth all that money to make. It got so old after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing.","review":"Highly disappointing. Seemed like the move was one big commercial (either for a Beer or a Car or a certain British Airline), got to love that product placement revenue! Jokes must have been the out takes from the original move. Skip this move and see the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"If you liked the first Austin Powers, rent it again. The second one only offers a few more sexy women and dull, boring jokes (if you can call them jokes). One of Meyer's worst films. Get So I Married an Axe Murderer if you want outlandish comedy. Not this. The funniest thing about this movie is the paradies my friends make about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Oh Behave!","review":"Of course, Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me is as groovy or as daring as the first movie< but it is well worth a look! The movie has a groovy storyling which comes back to Austin Powers who is back to save the world from Dr. Evil, but it isn't that simple this time, because the Evil guy has stolen his mojo! So call in the sexy Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), a couple a guns, a large dick and a daring idea - the twosome decide to take on Dr. Evil!Awesome, funny, and cool but definitely not as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is one of the funniest movies ever","review":"Look.

You might want to rent it, but certainly not own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin doesn't really put the \\"SEE\\" in sequel","review":"The second installment of Austin Powers was, as the rule goes, not as good as the original. The film played like a younger brother trying to be popular by coining all his older brother's jokes. There are plenty of times that that I found the film trying way too hard to be funny--almost to the point of being \\"Naked-Gun\\"esque. Myers, however, was of course great as he adds another character to his name in the credits. This movie wasn't a total loss, by any stretch though. The addition of Mini-Me and early plot twist involving Vanessa Kinsington were inspired. However, let's hope that Myers and Co. can get their script-writing mojo back if they decide to throw us a third bone, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!","review":"This movie was the worst. They should have left it alone with the first one. Most movies are not made to be sequels. This was one of them. Im glad I didn't see it in the movies, because I would have been mad I spent $8 on it. To keep it short and sweet, what were the thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never had mojo to start with","review":"While thoroughly bawdy, the original \\"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\\" managed to hold enough charm to be entertaining. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this retreaded story.There is really nothing new here, and bawdiness for its own sake isn't really funny. What few chuckles there are in the film are more than counterbalaced by groans. Mike Myers does a decent job in protraying multiple characters, but this could have been easily done in a few SNL skits rather than wasting a lot of celluloid footage in the effort.The somewhat open ending left the possibility of a 3rd Austin Powers. All I can say is I HOPE NOT.Without a doubt, Wayne's World was MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, how about...YUK!","review":"This movie was one of the biggest wastes of time. I rented this movie thinking there would be enough of a balance between stupid and funny to keep me entertained. Was I wrong! This movie wasn't good enough to be entertaining nor sensible enough to be funny. The stupidity totally outweighed the funny. There were some good 1-liners in it but other than that, I was bored to tears. I get more entertainment walking around the city and I get that for free. This was the first and will definitely be the last Austin Powers movie I ever waste time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too, Too Bad, Baby!","review":"The first movie was cute...This one (like Austin himself), ate SH$T! Mike Myers went overboard with a good joke and ruined the whole thing! Offensive does not always equal Funny....My Score: GROSS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the biggest letdown I've ever experienced!","review":"Now, first off let me say that I absolutely adored the first film. The jokes came thick and fast, they were actually funny and it had Liz Hurly to boot. The sequel however, has unfunny jokes that come thick and fast, no script structure and virtually no laughs. I laughed literally at 3 instances in this movie. And it wasn't even a laugh; it was a smile at best. What the producers seemed to have learned is that instead of actually putting jokes into the script, they can simply have Myers walk around and do that accent for 2 hours. This is passed off as comedy to Americans, who seem to find this highly amusing. Thus, after leaving the theatre, I was greeted with a chorus of irritating 13 - 18 year old males saying (in the worst possible accents) \\"Shag me, baby!\\" and \\"Oh behave\\". Now they may think this is cute, but trust me, it gets annoying after the first 500 times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN YOU SAY ENOUGH ALREADY?","review":"We've all seen the original. Yeah, everybody loved it. Don't ask me why. Aside from a few good James Bond-spoofing jokes, I thought Austin Powers was thoroughly unenjoyable. That's my humble opinion. My not-so-humble opinion is that Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me goes too far (Fat Bastard's stool sample...the horror...). If you want to see a funny movie, go rent Clerks, Wayne's World, or even Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. If you want to watch yet another game of \\"how many ways can we hide Mike Myers' private parts,\\" this movie is for you.Incidentally, there were some funny bits, but they didn't come close to saving the rest of this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Movie of 1999 so far....one of the best of all time","review":"This was definitely the best movie of 1999 so far (possibly with the exception of The Matrix) The jokes are non-stop throughout the whole movie and you will be cracking up weeks and weeks after you see the movie. Plus all the jokes are hilarious to use in conversation. I truly reccomend this movie for anyone looking for great, long-lasting laughs. Also, I don't think that there is any reliance on the first movie when it comes to the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Shagadellick Baby","review":"It is hard to believe that a sequel can be better than the original, but Mike Myers has outdone himself in this very funny movie about the 60's. Austin Powers has given the english language a complete new dictionary baby and everyone will be getting down with it once again as it enters the world on video. Do yourself a favour and add it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT AS GREAT AS THE ORIGINAL BUT STILL VERY, VERY FUNNY.","review":"Most sequels do not live up to the original. And with comedy it can be fatal to watch. But it is only a sin when it isn't funny. This movie IS!!! Sure some of the edge form the first film is missing and it, at times, feels like jokes strung together. But these are funny jokes.

Mike Myers is already such a sick-looking guy and this movie has portrayed him to be the God of sickness.This movie can really drive you mad.

If you happen to watch the sequel to Wayne's World after the second Austin Power's you can see that the plots are the same. Main character looses something, main character has to go through a journey of some type, as of the archetype Hero's Journey, and then the main character has to make a sacrifice. I though that the jokes within the movie was nice, but, it doesn't rate up with the 1st austin powers. It is a must buy if you don't mind a little repetitition. I have to admit, i was laughing my a$$ off. :-) Groove People!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old jokes, Such a disappointment","review":"I found this movie to be extremely disappointing. The jokes were almost 90% copies of the first movie (which was Excellent): the shh scene, Mustafa being very badly hurt, the introductory nudity coverup scene, Austin getting his butt caught in closing doors, etc etc. The \\"Just the Two of Us\\" scene was funny for a few seconds but also was so out of place and an effort to get a cheap laugh. The formula can only work so many times before it gets repetetive and dull. There were a handful of funny scenes but this was clearly an attempt to make a movie around the funny jokes and lines from the first film. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie is like Mini Me","review":"The movie itself is like Mini Me. Spy who Shagged me is the EXACT same as the first movie, but about 1/8 as funny. I mean come on this whole movie looks improvised and it is the same old stuff. You will end up with the same taste in your mouth if you just buy a little talking Austin Doll or something. Cuz all he does is spout catchphrases. Geez. Hopefully the next one will GO somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin Powers: The goof who bored me!","review":"Were it not for the great music and the attractive female stars, this film would be completely unbearable. Whether it is intended to be a comedy, a satire, it doesn't matter, it is complete and utter c**p. I never expected a class actor as Tim Robbins to perform (be present) in a piece of garbage like this. A complete waste of time and money. Buy the great soundtrack instead. The 1 star rating is actually too much for this movie (if you can call it a movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD who shagged my wallet","review":"This overrated comedy is a mediocre attempt to make a parody of a James Bond moovie the moovie is outright boring the story and the dialogs too childish. However the moovie merits from one of the best scores I've heard in moovies for a long while and the DVD edition especially is a showcase of this medium capabilities. This edition benefits from Dolby digital sound and extras like the video clips of three songs from the moovie's score , notable among them the super hit \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" by Madonna. Apart from that there is a documentary a feature length commentary and the cinema trailers. All in all if you are in for extras this DVD does it for you interactive menu and deleted scenes included but if your interest is more substantial, this moovie is really nothing to be remembered and you will barelly watch it more than once unless of course you are a Heather Graham fan !"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable story line full of used, well worn cliches","review":"I could not wait to see this movie based on word of mouth hype. What a shocking disappointment. It was singularly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The dialogue was diabolically bad. Even in its basest form, a total waste of money. If you must see this out of curiosity, rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD widescreen only stinks","review":"This is a really funny movie but does not offer the choice of switching to a full tv screen. With all the extras packed in they should have included a full screen or pan scan version. WIDESCREEN ONLY DVD's STINK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original, Recycled","review":"This movie really is funny. It's just as funny as the first. The reason I rated this movie so low however, is that the reason this movie is just as good as the first is because most of the jokes were IN the first one. Mustafa slowly dying, Dr. Evil telling Scott to \\"Zip it\\" (Shh! in the original), it's all the same. Then they got rid of Vannesa horribly, trying to pass her off as a Fembot which essentially destroys the first movie (why would they want to get rid of her anyway, I mean, she is FINE!). Taking away Austin's \\"mojo\\" leaves him a lifeless character which makes every scene he's in seem to D-R-A-G on forever. Everything that was good about the first movie is lost (except of course for the recycled jokes all through the movie). Had I seen this movie without ever seeing the first, it would have been OK, but between the lifeless Austin, the absence of Vannesa, and the re-used jokes this movie is utterly horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austion Powers","review":"Great movie although there are alot of people who seem not to agree, any way i laughed my a** off while watching this movie and its ones of those movies who gets funnier every time you see it so thats another reason to own the dvdA lot of people say this movie isn't as good as the first i totally agree, the first had a better shape and the jokes where fresh and thick but this one is funny too and its not like were talking about something artistic here , its Austin powers and yes it stupid actually the funniest thing about the movie is its stupidity, major plot holes are there intentionally to make even more stupider let alone the plot it self \\"Austin lost his mojo!!\\"Point is great funny movie worth buying so go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M IN THE MINORITY - THIS FILM LEFT ME FEELING QUEASY!","review":"I really didn't like this movie. I thought it was stupid, inane and disgusting. It was nothing like the real 1960s and I didn't like the stupid name of Felicity Shagwell. (Translation: Happy and Good in the Fine Art of Sexual Intimacy). It was such a dumb film. The opening is a tip off to this because Austin Powers is involved with a mechanical woman who explodes at point of contact (you know what kind of contact). Genital, sexual and gross out humor fill in the large expanse of blanks in this disgusting film. I didn't like the other characters Mike Myers played in addition to Austin Powers -- I hated Dr. Evil and I just could not abide his obese personality, F.B.The infamous stool/coffee scene was so disgusting I actually vomited in the theater. I was nauseous throughout the film and that scene was downright vile.The only good thing about this stupid pathetic farce of a film is Elvis Costello. He provided some nice music."},{"rating":"1","title":"If This Is What The Sixties Were Like...","review":"If this is what the sixies were like, I feel sorry for the people who lived through them. This movie is the absolute worst! First off, it had no story. It was about a sick guy trying to get his \\"mojo\\" back form \\"Dr. Evil\\". That's all I have to say about it. Most movies I go on about forever, but this one I can tell in two words! It wasn't funny at all, either. I bought the video, (and no I'm not sorry I wasted my money on it because I'm don't want to be stingy), and I just watched it once. It'll probably stay in my video compartment forever, because I'll never watch it again! This has to be one of the worst movies of the summer, and I can't understand why others don't say it is. Bottom line: Don't buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike the Original, this was lame","review":"Unlike the Original movie, which was great, The Spy Who Shagged Me lacked the quality \\"edge\\", if you will, that the First movie mastered so well. The story line was lacking and it had a look of being thrown togather rather haphazardly. To be blunt, my impression was that this movie sequel was simply intended to make money, and not tell a sequel story to the great Austin Powers. I would have thought there would have been a better effort in creating such a sequel to the International Man of Mystery. Stick the Original, which is by far much much better-and funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preety good but stupid","review":"This movie was funny and entertaining but some parts were just plain stupid and boring. Otherwise I recommend it. Also the DVD has so many awesome features to keep me interested. Great package!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-rent the first instead of this","review":"The first Austin Powers was so much better. This is just not funny. It drags and nearly all of the humor is replicated from the first Austin Powers. The humor is more base and low-brow as well. Just not very clever. The DVD production is quite good though. Somehow I managed to see it a second time and I dislike it even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"have a concert in your living room!","review":"There are lots of live cuts and discs from lots of artists, but they're typically not the same as being at a concert. Most discs just let you hear the lesser quality than studio sound... and a few wolf whistles, and that's it... but this 2-disc set shines above the rest.If you close your eyes, you'll think you're at an outdoor concert. You can hear the members of the audience singing along and the sound of the acoustic guitars and the voices in harmony is fabulous.Previously unavailable tracks (except through bootleg circles) such as \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" will blow you away with the depth of the meaning of the lyrics and the picture painted with the words. Single classics such as \\"Closer to Fine,\\" \\"The Power of Two\\" and \\"Galileo\\" are also presented as live cuts. Whether you've been a fan for the past 10+ years or if you just recently started hearing tracks from the girls, you won't be disappointed in this fun, melodic and rockin' live set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I love a good live album much more than anything put together in a studio but I'm normally sceptical of a \\"best of\\" live album that picks and chooses from a number of venues and dates. This release is definitely the exception and is a winner from start to finish. I could maybe do without the track from their early days (which has historical interest but is a definite flat spot) but every other song is a fantastic version of a stellar song. Higlights include an intimate \\"Power of two\\" and a thumpingly good \\"Tangled up in blue\\" which is my favourite version of this oft covered classic (if you haven't already, check out the Indigo girls guest performance on Joan Baez's \\"ring the bells\\". Their version of \\"Don't think twice\\" is a small slice of heaven).Surely after a few years, some great albums and some greater concerts it's time this release had a follow up? A two disc live selection that picks up where this album left off would have me queing up ready to buy it on the release date."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCH A RARE FLOWER...

Awesome renditions of \\"Galileo,\\" \\"Land of Cannan,\\" and \\"World Falls.\\" Also includes some cool covers, especially \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" and \\"Midnight Train to Georgia.\\" Includes some really early stuff, like \\"Back Together Again,\\" which was recorded in a basement in 1983. Cool bonus track at the end of the second disk (a solo of the rock-out \\"Touch Me Fall\\"). A few songs seem too long and dragged out, such as \\"Dead Man's Hill,\\" and do we really need two versions of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\"? Even still, this album rocks. Recommendation: a must for any folk-rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Brilliance!","review":"The Indigo Girls are actually one of the few artists these days that actually sound better in concert than they do in the studio!

It's one of the few good live cds out there, combining folk, rock, and a few dozen other kinds of music. Mostly original songs, but there a few very well-done covers in there too. It has a lot of variety, so just about anybody can find several songs they'll like. But for the same reason you'll probably find one or two you don't like. My favorites are \\"Chickenman\\", \\"Down by the River\\", \\"Dead Man's Hill\\", and \\"Joking\\".

Although his contribution to this book is little more than a foreword, it is Ireland through his eyes, and through the eyes of the people who adore it.The images are amazing, from the quiet fields to the pubs, it shows Ireland in all it's lush culture. It is a book that photographers can admire, and people of Irish descent can hold close to their hearts.

The latter is particularly impressive in stereo, opening up the song and revealing its complexity. Every track here is in stereo except one. The splendor of \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" and the charm of Lulu's megahit (number one in the U.S. for 4 weeks) \\"To Sir With Love\\" never fails to impress. This was Lulu's most prolific period chartwise, and this CD finally presents these tracks in first-rate sound quality. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I think this game is a must for the gamer that has friends or siblings. One of my biggest problems is having to take turns playing, but not in this game. The cooperative mode is extremly fun, and also takes down the difficuty. This feature more than makes up for the small multiplayer modes, which are still very fun. My personal favorite is the \\"king of the hill\\" mode where you and your buddies battle to stay near a flag the longest. The main game is short but still fun there is always a suprise to find. So if you need a good multi-player game get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"I bought this game a few years ago, when it first came out. It was SO BAD and it still is. I have to admit, i saw the commercials on tv and the game looked pretty cool, kinda like turok, but it isnt. The controls are horrible, making it impossible to shoot accurately. The graphics are too fuzzy and dark, making it extremely hard to see ememies. There is really no story to why you are running around shooting bugs. Its really sad, you can tell acclaim got the idea for this game when starship troopers was out in the theaters, and rushed to get it out as quick as possible.

If you have played Turok, Quake, Doom, etc. then you have played this game. Not only that, the levels are short, there are very few weapons and the control options are bizarre and take some time to get used to (pushing left/right on the control stick causes you to strafe in that direction, not turn! ). Aiming and performing delicate maneuvers is a chore and the environments look like cardboard cutouts. The sound is nothing extraordinary. Acclaim should have taken a look at Medal of Honor and applied the same detail to a game that had potential, but ended up as a mediocre shooter. This game is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh... what IS this crud?","review":"This game just doesn't feel good. (Quake II for the N64 feels good. Turok 2 and Turok Rage Wars feel good.) But everything about the interface and gameplay is just plain awkward.Aside from gameplay, the game's interfaces are all very poorly done. Want to change your controller options? You have a choice between Regular, and Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 -- but there are no diagrams to explain what those different options even mean!And even if the feel of the game was good, and the menus weren't confusing -- the missions are poor. In my last game (and I mean my *last* game) I spent the last 5 minutes running around thinking \\"what am I supposed to be doing now\\", until my character became accidentally lodged in a wall and couldn't break free. Boy, that's good fun.There's not even a demo or opening animation to watch at the beginning of the game.How the venerable Iguana studios (creators of the Turok games) let this half finished crock out the door is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never been a reader Intel I started reading Linda's books ever and I can't put them down","review":"I am one that only likes to read nonfiction and I have found these books are the most enlightening and inspiring just fantastic books and I am going to be so sad when I read the last one of Linda's books She needs to get to writing so I'll never be done"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a joke right?","review":"$14.99 for a video you can watch for free on YouTube From muppetstudios?

And even my low expectations weren't met! I appreciate that the producers thought the whole \\"marriage market\\" angle would provide oomph. Instead, however, it simply interfered with the audience learning what we might have about the life and times of these people.Give us more insight into the freedoms and limitations of the times, of the intricacies, the passions, the boredom of the day-to-day routines. Give us more on the insights the modern-day people are gaining.

I made it through about fifteen minutes. There was nothing whatsoever attractive about the Regency Bucks. I'm not talking about their looks. Their behavior was horrendous. They were loud, rude and vulgar--and this was just the first night. I had to laugh at hearing how each wanted to meet \\"the right woman.\\" How about starting by trying to be \\"the right man\\" for a decent woman? During the first meeting with the women all they could do was talk about who had a big ass and who might be pretty if she ditched her glasses.Who chose these participants?And I don't buy the argument that, being modern men, they had trouble adjusting to the confines of the period. Even in modern times, people are usually on the best behavior when starting out in a new situation.Honestly, if you love Jane Austen, this will seem like a National Lampoon parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not see the point","review":"I passionately love history, particularly British history, and I really looked forward to viewing this show. I have to say, though, that I am disappointed and was very bored watching these people try to look like they were living in a different age. They were, for the most part, very unappealing, and while I love \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and Jane Austen's other works, they were fiction. I guess I just found the jump back and forth between centuries too much to empathize with as I did not care at all who these people married, who they bedded, how much wine they drank, etc or what century they were pretending to live in. But I will give the concept an \\"E\\" for effort and realize that I am in the minority - in this case, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming...","review":"I loved Regency House Party being a fan of Jane Austen...Once again it shows what hhapens when you mix centuries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak entry in the PBS House series","review":"The brilliant idea behind the House series is to take \\"reality\\" television into a new sphere. The two I saw before this, Manor House and 1940 House, were wildly entertaining as well as full of sociological and cultural insights.Unfortunately, Regency House Party trashes the concept. It is little more than \\"Big Brother\\" in period dress. Essentially, they've just brought a group of rather uninteresting people into a matchmaking situation. The setting and costumes seem nothing more than trimmings, and the cultural lessons are abruptly inserted at regular intervals.All that would be acceptable if it resulted in some form of entertainment, but it does not. Almost all the participants seem bored to tears as they're put through their paces, and the viewer is left with nothing. What little drama there is seems artificially created in the editing room.I suggest you pass by the door of this House and move on to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't they put subtitles on these shows?","review":"We were frustrated with trying to understand what these people were saying.

It's a very different mix, possibly a different performance.

Nothing of the sort - there are very few incites here, mostly half-baked nonsense. He seems to have very little understanding of true human nature and has no respect for the Other. This book came highly recommended by a friend, I would not have ordered it otherwise.

Not the \\"greatest book I have ever read\\", as many of you say, but I did really enjoy it. There is a relaxed and mystical feel to Kerouac's descriptions and lyric writing that is unique. This style may be compared to Steinbeck's first three pages in Of Mice and Men, but there is no other Kerouac. However, I may have to read it again now knowing that Kerouac may not have been as \\"beat\\" as we all thought (the recently published The Long, Slow Death of Jack Kerouac, I believe that is the title).

Well, Kerouac changed all that for me. My perceptions of what writing is, what fiction is, what the purpose of writing is, and perhaps the meaning of life was completely changed. Obliterated by this one man. Beethoven wrote \\"there is nothing higher than to approach the Godhead more nearly than other mortals and by means of that contact to spread the rays of the Godhead through the human race.\\" Kerouac approached the Godhead so closely, and distributed those rays so perfectly that even the laws of grammar bent themselves to his will.

Probably because he loved Dean. At any rate this is what On the Road is ulimatly about. They do race around the country and share a variety of misadventures, few compelling, but it's a love story. I didn't like it. Well, for several chapters I didn't like it. More than several. But then all the jazz and the benzadrine and the cars and the road and everything just kind of draw you in and you can't stop and you want to read more and you want to turn on some blues and just keep reading and it's getting late but you're still going to Mexico with Dean and Sal and then it's over.I'm not sure I can define the beat generation for you.

I just wish that more people in this world could appreciate the mastery of Kerouac and the depths of the philosophy of the beats. Again, i would recommend this to anyone, as the adventure and Twain-like tomfoolery of the group will appeal to most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great road novel, started the beat generation","review":"Great book, fast moving, way ahead of its time.

A lot of things that people like, and keep on about, don't appeal to me (The film Citizen Kane, football EVERY Saturday, Ernest Hemmingway, television, I could go on), that's how taste goes. I can only say that when I read On the Road back in 1962 it made me realise that I wasn't the only one who felt the way I did. That was part of it, but also it was like you know how people speak of reading the Bible should be - a revelation! Suddenly I wasn't alone with my pain in the world. The early 'Sixties were drab and boring (maybe everybody's mid-teenage years feel like that?), here were two guys escaping from that drab, boring, routine.

I did not like it. By the last chapter of the book, I had traveled with Sal Paradise (the main character) from the East side of America to the West side of America about five times. Very tiring!! The book was extremely naive. It had no depth. Kerouac's definition of \\"beat\\" seemed to be sex and alcohol and apathy. I don't understand how people can live in dream land all their life, and tune out reality-- tune out the poverty and racism and corruption of the world around them, especially when they are SEEING IT. The characters visited Mexico and all they seemed to notice was jungle and [prostitutes]. A tad shallow. The whole book described Sal and Dean's life as a joke; time to play and not worry about anything cause they \\"know time\\" and they can \\"dig\\" it.On the Road, if you're reading Kerouac for the first time, may disappoint you.

Salinger, and he could actually write a story. This book reeks of a smug self-centeredness that belies the fundamental philosophy espoused by the beat generation, a philosophy that involved seeking a deeper spiritual meaning than those embraced by traditional American goals of fame and affluence and power. The Beat Generation's best author was Ferlinghetti, in my opinion.

Today everything is available to today's youth in mainstream society - drugs, friendship with \\"benefits\\", cynicism, underground communities on the internet. So the newness of non-confirmism has been absorbed and is readily available. In fact, it's hard not to read this book without seeing all the societal and personal consequences - AIDS, the devastation of divorce on children, deadbeat dads, drunk driving accidents, hippy sellouts.

I have listened to both these and Muller surpasses Dillon's enthusiasm tenfold. I'm afraid Dillon was chosen more for the business idea that a pop icon reading Kerouac equals higher sales rather then adept narration. Dillon's attempt on the masterpiece is so vapid it's hard to fathom listening to hour after hour of it. Muller on the other hand is quite the opposite. He brings the characters to life with narrative ardor. He takes the listener with him on the great Kerouac journey. Muller draws you into the homily with sublime storytelling skill and you find yourself amongst Sal, Dean, and all the others along for the ride...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sal Paradise and Dean?","review":"I put my rating as a 1 only to get some attension. Most people say the same thing about this wonderful novel so, I want people to hear about what Sal and Dean represent. They are the people that we struggle to be, and they live their lives with the passion we all strive for. They're what people have to learn to be like and accept. Life \\"on the road\\" is a choice and sometimes we must substitute that road for our own passing. In the end we don't want to be left looking back from a rear view mirror, watching our best friends walking away, alone. Sal's lesson on \\"the only people for me are the mad ones...\\" transpires through the search which I too have been desperately awaiting. If Kerouac was still alive today, I would hope that he would be somewhere in Denver looking for (\\"Dean\\") Neal Cassidy, and sipping the best wiskey from the back of an old Ford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tisk, tisk, tisk....","review":"I am truly disappointed in this work. The book is a clumsy read at best. The first third of the book is especially gruelling and un-interesting. I can understand the \\"live for the moment\\" attitude and the need to experience life, but this is all really a tired act. Kerouac's characters do not grow from their experiences nor do they offer anything more than pseudo-intellectual insight into their world. It is even more painful that so many people term this \\"the greatest book I have ever read\\" or \\"the greatest novel of the 20th century\\". I would venture to say that not only is it neither, it is not even the best American novel of the 20th century. Steinbeck wrote with much more passion and color and Salinger captured the purity and innocence of youth more capably. I have given this book two stars, one for being definitive product of a misguided philosophy and one out of pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Literature, It's a History Lesson in Arrogance and Stupidity","review":"I've tried to read this book at three different points in my life. I read it again recently, thinking that I was too young to get it when I read it as a teenager and that this time around it would make sense. I still can't stand this book. Basically it's a bunch of drug-using, abusive, adulterous, self-centered, arrogant, pseudo-intellectual eggheaded jerks trying to freeload as much as they can with no regard to anyone or anything but themselves. No wonder this book was so popular with rock stars.

Go talk to some idiot on drugs and you'll hear the same thing. I had hoped for so much more but was greatly disappointed by this book - I could pace the floor of a 7-Eleven and get more enjoyment than I got out of this flimsy road-story. There were times when Kerouac's words sounded quite literary and lovely but the times were too few."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got to agree with a few of the reviewers....","review":"I just dont see what the big deal about this one is. It is incredibly boring. I wanted to like it too. I tried to like it. But a \\"lets hitch-hike around the U.S., get drunk, etc.\\" book just didnt end up doing it for me. And thats all this book really is. Back and forth across the U.S., same parties and stories over and over. I forced myself to get 2/3's of the way through before I gave up. There was nothing new in this book even when it was first published. Everyone knew about lovable losers and drifters and had for decades before this book was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting point","review":"This novel is a good first read to the uninitiated of the Kerouac writing style.

A good starting point for the new beat reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pointless","review":"As far as I can tell, this book is about girls, hitchhiking, and partying.

Nothing unusual but good. Of course the novel is really stunning, the best one I've ever read. Funny and a bit sad and always optimistic (though Sal Paradise often tolerates frustration and has not what he expected to), nevertheless it's full of life, love, excitement. One of the most romantic, and at the same time, realistic vision of America. Kerouac's language is magical.

The only other thing that comes close to capturing the sense of desperation of the young was the movie \\"Swingers\\", which seems to reinvent this book in a slightly different manner. \\"On the Road\\" is truly brilliant, not to mention an inspiration to anyone looking to make a long road trip, and is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"righteous, spiritual book","review":"This book was a revelation. Shed yourself of all tired encumbrances and just go! No one's going to do it for you, it's a decision all your own. Kerouac, through his fictional incarnation Sal Paradise, describes the yearning, sadness and rapture associated with being on the road. Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) is the embodiment of all of this and Paradise finds redemption through experiencing America with Dean. This book reminded me of a saying by John Wooden of all people. When asked what he found most gratifying about coaching, he says it was never the destination, it was the journey on the way toward the destination that he enjoyed the most. Look for the poetic prose, the frenzied observations, and Sal's feeling of grandeur and beauty when traversing the vast expanse known as America. And most importantly, enjoy the description of the kind of transport that can be had only by feeling jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Knowledge","review":"Kerouac is the master. He is like a drug. Insane thoughts, feelings and senses coming from every direction. Do not be concerned. He will make you high. No memory is needed. It all seaps through your skin until you become aware. The perfection is incredibly real. And you know it all - every last crumb! He is there, in your head. He has been there your whole life and now he is letting you know yourself. Like he was the child watching, not missing a step, while you were too busy to notice. Don't stop - he hits you like a rush and the relentless wave changes you for good. Go, Go, Go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit the road Jack and don't come back no more!","review":"Being into music and movies of the late 60's and early 70's I ofcourse had to read \\"On the road\\".

The book was part of a Contemporary Lit class, and I could not believe how boring it was. They would hitchhike, meet interesting characters, tell enough of the story to intrigue, and then they would move on, drinking, riding, and missing the big picture. The repitition, the blandness of what should have been an incredible journey, went on and on. Perhaps at the time it was written there was a little novelty.

On the road, allowed me to place myself along side Dean and Sal as they made there way through and through to the West, to the East, back again , and South. It was Dean Moriarty who I took a particular liking to, thanks to Sal's(Jack) jazzy styles. Dean's child-like behaviour of absorbing it all, then explosively releasing in sharp detail.

I couldn't bear reading it any more after the first two chapters. The whole thing is written as what seems to me as an unfinished thought. I've heard that this was supposed to be a documentary item of an adventure but to me it was more like the ramblings of a doped up poet wannabe.Jack Kerouac wrote this book, or so I've heard, on one continuous roll of paper. It seems to me that there may be some truth in that because there is no end, just run-ons. I forced myself to read the rest of it, hoping that maybe it would get better. But alas, it (was ver bad). What is worse is the ending let me down even more.The whole story is about Sal Paradise, yes that is really his name, and how Sal hitchhikes back and forth the continental U.S. meeting up with his poet friends.

When I'm paying for a book, I'd like to think it's been edited and I don't have to struggle over incorrect words and missing punctuation. When you see free e-books with these kind of errors, it's understandable.

It's written for anyone who either does not travel, doesn't have the balls to travel or doesn't take chances in everyday life.

Then last winter, on a complete whim, I picked up On the Road. As the story and cliché goes: the rest was history.There is little need to detail Jack Kerouac's greatest work. Simply put: On the Road is the most important prose in American History and should be required reading. It's changed my life, my outlook and my appreciation for the power of the pen. This brings me to the reason I wrote this short piece. Why in God's name does this book not have a 5 star review? I'm completely disgusted with anyone who would give this anything less.

Their means of exploiting others was to steal. The author makes himself a hero of the times. What modern American would haul his butt across the country, all but penniless, stealing gas along the way? We settle down, get jobs to raise money, and stay near the spot where we earn cash, not because we want to, but because this is simple economics. Most would never steal gas or food, least of all glorify the life of a bum. The author's style has been compared to that of the impressionist painter's. More than not, it is an unfocused wasteland. This IS one book that should be read, though. We see a glimpse of those times and a precursor of the hippies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Either you get it, or you don't","review":"This book has no middle ground.

To the gray suit, the pragmatis, and classicist, this book will leave you scratching your head, saying, 'what's the big deal?' To me, this book represents endless possibility, of not knowing what the day will bring, but not sitting around to wait for whatever to happen. Along the way, it's the people you meet and the stories you'll tell that will let you discover whether you have lived life, or just wasted it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT","review":"This book is for sure the most beautiful ever written.

Really good and just melancholy enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has a lot of power, but I wouldnt call it enjoyable","review":"This is a novel that does not have any kind of plot you could describe, or a real narrative drive. It mostly deals with the theme of the pointlessness of life set against the context of cross country travel. The characters are all running from \\"Real life\\" and any kind of obligation or responsibility. It is depressing because nobody in this book seems to have a purpose to their life.

Sal Paradise is a character that all readers can truly identify with. His longing to find his place, to find someone to love, and the pain he feels when having to say goodbye are all emotions that hit close to home. After reading \\"On The Road\\", I feel as if Kerouac truly knew me personally, because he writes about so many of the emotions that I myself feel.

Yet it didn't make me want to travel anywhere, just to experience my own everyday adventures with something like the wide-eyed wonder of Dean.

At the time I had a female friend that was very enthusiastic about this book, so I decided to give it a try. After reading it I realized that I probably had the luck of finding it where I did because the previous owner had thrown it out the window in anger, frustration and disgust. This book is terrible. The writing is monotonous. It was a struggle for me to keep the pages turning. There is no plot, but rather Kerouac just strings together events. The characters are unlikeable and shallow. The book is entirely undeserving of its reputation. But despite that, I recommend you read it. Why? Because with more voices telling the honest truth about this book (that it stinks), fewer will be pressured into the \\"Kerouac Cult\\" by all the wanna-be counter-culture \\"intellectuals\\" that fawn over this kind of trash.

He'll squeeze a weeks worth of activites onto a page, and then proceed to draw out the most boring of evenings over an entire chapter.However, if you can look past all this, this book is great. The characters are likable, yet imperfect. The scenery is ever changing. And the plot is a meandering path of sex, wisdom, humor, and love.It's a book about freedom.

Its been 40 years and the self indulgent amoral lifestyle they promoted has passed. Many of the \\"beats\\" are dead and the others have conformed.

The point of the book missed me completely. Perhaps, it is because better stuff has been published since that time. Maybe you had to be there. As an icon to a decade, there was little in the text that was peculiar to that time. Furthermore, the author laid no foundation by portraying convential life in the 40's, leaving no opportunity for the contrast to appear. The writing itself was poetic, rhymic, and at times creative.

What we've substituted for experience in 2002 is consumption of material matter replacing those outer experiences and encounters with things that really matter little to our growth.Little did Kerouac relize what profound affect 'On the Road' would have to future generations, discoversing what's really wrong with mind in 2002.

This is one of the most shallow, hollow books that I have ever read. If You want to read a real classic try The fountainhead by Ayn Rand or The Godfile by an underated ,talented new writer Frank Turner Hollon but please, for your own good, stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Road","review":"Boring and way too repetitious for my taste. No real story line that I could make out. No character depth on any of the major players, including the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I get it...","review":"all the poetic reviews were a setup. How could you people find this romantic? There are no great stories here. Only boredom. Watch paint dry. Thats as exciting as it gets hear. I hope you dont have to read a dry as dust book like this to tell you that being a drifter is fun. Cause if youre looking for insight, it aint here."},{"rating":"1","title":"- take your money elsewhere","review":"Ok, I heard all the hype about On the Road, mostly from reading Jim Morrison biographies and such during my teens, so when I was in college in '91 and hanging out at my favorite spot, the Broward County Library, I decided to look it up. And you know what? I thought it was the single most over-rated piece of garbage I'd ever read. I couldn't even finish it and believe me, I tried several times. I thought from previous reviews that I'd find a kindred spirit in Dean Moriarty, but he simply grew more and more pathetic as the book wore on. Kerouac sure made a statement with this book - too bad the statement was \\"I'm an insipid bore.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The beat stops here","review":"I guess I am not intellectual enough to get into this novel. It reads more like a journal than a novel. How could this garbage be considered one of the most important works of the 20th century? If this is the Bible of the beat generation no wonder the beat generation receives barely a notice in the annals of American History. At least Hayden and Hoffman had an agenda. What was Kerouac's agenda? Get drunk, do some drugs, make love and groove on the people. What a waste of intellegence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beat Style Tedious and Without Purpose","review":"This novel is interesting, but I found the style to be tedious and unsophisticated to no real end. While many may enjoy the romanticism of the life of these vagabond writers, I find the beat philosophy--both literary and personal--amazingly misguided. Rebellion against society, especially one as oppressive as 1950s America, is noble, but it must be marked by some true insight. The Beat rebellion, I believe, is summed up by the anecdote that Keruoac refused to wear a tie and jacket to his readings. Clothes do not a movement make, and this is certainly no real rebellion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth shatteringly stupid - for the sophmoric pseudo-philosopher seeking false authenticy","review":"This book belongs to a sub-genre of bad American writing best labeled \\"beat off books\\".(the many votes declaring my review not to be useful suggests that people would like more details, but since this is, in fact, a beat off book, I'm not sure that it merits extended treatment -all puns intended)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is your brain on drugs","review":"An excruciating read. The only scene in the book worth any merit was the scene in the jazz club.Kerouac was a conservative that wanted to see how the other half lived. I am tempted to say his cognitive dissonance played a major role in his alcoholic downfall.If you walk the walk, talk the talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding, right?","review":"OK, I tried to read this several times with no luck. It is quite possibly the most boring non-story ever committed to paper. There is no plot, no story, no sympathetic (or otherwise engaging) characters, no compelling reason whatever to read this book. It is essentially a rambling tome about the author and his acquaintances drinking, traveling, talking...it's banality is absolutely stultifying. Yeah, yeah, I have heard all of the claptrap about how it broke new ground and the rest of the bloated claims, but in the final analysis, it is a boring book with no story to tell and nothing to recommend it. It is far more interesting as some symbol to a lost generation than a book. Buy it if you feel that you need some hip, pseudo intellectual credentials on your mantle, but spare yourself the agony of actually trying to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wut the..","review":"this was a horrible book. i dont see the point of reading this. i mean, there really is no purpose of this book.

Although I enjoy the passion of a man in writing such a book, the story line was rather bland. It seemed as if the same story was regurgitated over and over again. Sal goes to New York, gets drunk, goes to Denver gets drunk, goes to San Fran., gets drunk, goes back to New York and does it all over again. If this story intrigues you at all I highly recommend reading Henry Miller instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"on the road","review":"\\"on the road\\" is a book that i will hand my to son or daughter when they begin final passage to adulthood, it has been a solid rock in my growing and changing and given me more insight and knowledge of this world then i could have foreseen before i began reading it, its a book that i cant describe without thinking deeply and is what drew me to delve into the world of literature moreso then i ever had before in my life. it teaches love in spite of everything handed to you, deep compassion for the human race, adventure and the truths of life; it inspires the search for truth in the world and in yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of Prose wrote a Great book","review":"Jack Kerouac wrote this book more than 50 years before i was born, but it still holds a timelessness that the reader can relate to. The book is a recollection of the author's lonly and exciting journey across the post WWII America, looking for life, excitement, and the answer to the question we are all looking for, but can't be found. I feel this is a must have for any reader who yearns for the freedom of the open road."},{"rating":"2","title":"sparks and sparks of imagination","review":"Reading \\"On the Road\\" took me to another time, another generation where money was not the singular most important thing in life, but it was life itself that was worth living. Kerouac and his hero venture into the land of freedom, the great outdoors, the enchanted hallways of sin and passion. What they uncover is the need to live every moment as if it were their last. As if nothing mattered but the answer to the question being asked. What beauty this story has to offer the person who wonders about the edge of sanity and the end of youthfullness. Imagination and realism is the true gift that Jack Kerouac offers us the reader, and asks only one favor from us in return, read without fear and judgement, and continue to question what does not appear to be evident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomorrow Never Knows","review":"If you don't allow yourself to enjoy this brilliant narrative, then you are unable to, as another great narrator John Lennon put it, \\"turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream.\\" This story is about living for the moment; not three-and-a-half minutes from the present, but this EXACT moment. Most of us are entirely uncapable of this. I am. Much as I try, I cannot inhale eternity in a single breath, and then repeat this with every breath I take. As innovative as his spontaneous prose was, I'm tremendously glad that he couldn't shrug off the immensely major, earlier influence of Thomas Wolfe (my other favorite writer), though he tried to work away from this comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changing masterpiece....","review":"Kerouac's On The Road is a classic example of one man doing what everyone else secretly wants to. His trips across the country have inspired many to follow his lead and just live. Although that Kaerouac's lifestyle is much more difficult to achieve these days, his book still leaves a huge impact on whoever reads it. A must read for anyone who wants to get the most from life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the fascination with this book?","review":"I have tried hard, and read several books by Kerouak, but still can not understand anyones fascination with him. In my humblest opinion, he is the worst writer I have ever read. He lacks description and his viniet is nothing but a description of life as a drug attic. i am sad he shot himself without something better to have left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"a classic bore","review":"That the novel had no discernible plot until about two thirds of the way through didn't really bother me. Episodic stories can be interesting if well-written, but this was not. Despite Kerouac's use of the slang of the period, I found the language boring. Bland and pedestrian, but not in a terse, stripped-down way a la Hemingway. The supposed jazz influence that one hears so much about did not translate well. I could relate to the protagonist's youthful restlessness, yet I did not really feel it. I felt as though he and I were both being dragged along instead of seizing the day.This book really reminded me of those stories that people tend to tell in which they realize halfway through that it's one of those \\"you had to be there\\" experiences. The one redeeming factor that lead me to give the book two stars instead of one was character development, the book's sole strong point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"On the Road is filled with inspiration for any body that has ever dreamed. It brings you back to an art loving,enlightend generation that we seem to have forgotten in this time we are in now. If you know the feeling I'm talking about when you read poetry...When you see a magnificent performance...When you see the irony of life for the first time...If you know what it's like to get drunk off of all these things...If you know what it's like to be high on life, I strongly suggest you read this book. This book is for writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all a matter of perspective...","review":"Genius or ramblings? Read it for yourself and decide. When I got to the line \\"the only people for me are the mad ones...the ones...who burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars\\" (found in the early pages of the first chapter), I was hooked. BB King once said that it's not the notes that are played that are important, it's the ones that are NOT played. You'll either hear what Kerouac was saying and be moved by it or walk away thinking he was a semi-literate fool. If you're looking for a linear, consistently paced book with logically developed characterization and an \\"A plus B equals C\\" sense of structure, don't go anywhere near that book. If you think that Miles Davis was a genius, buy it RIGHT NOW...and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME, MYSTICAL AND CAPTIVATING!","review":"This is one of my favourite books of all time. The characters are rich, deep, and possess an off-beat mystical sense of wonder. Follow the trail of frenetic characters, Sal and Dean, as they set out on a wild ride across America. For those who are freedom lovers and remember the nostalgic days of the Beat movement, you will love the escapades and adventures encountered in this book. It is a journey into a search for self-insight and life's true purpose and meaning. Based on the Beat movement of the 50's, the reader will be exposed to the mystical wonder and beauty of life, compassion for humanity, and encounter a world of drugs, sex and jazz. The characters are so vibrant, the actions so real, you will feel as if you are actually there, along side these dynamic characters. Do not miss this book; it is a terrific adventure in an era when freedom meant \\"doing your own thing, in your own way, in your own time.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I found this book very boring and hard to get into.

Kerouac's style is at its pinnacle in this novel, as far as I'm concerned. He still had tinges of his Wolfean style from \\"Town and the City,\\" but had not yet gone totally over the egde into the wild style of later works. This novel is pure Americana, the story of a man -- he wrote this in the book -- who could bum into town as a hobo on a train, shower and put on a suit and go into the finest places. Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) is an American icon. Deni Bleu is my personal favorite character from the book. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"It's amazing for one reason: I just didn't get it. The whole book, the whole point. The whole Beat movement apparently. It was a quick read but not really funny or deeply serious. The character moved a lot, had friends that were a tad seedy, and never grew up. He never concluded anything, never had anything solid to call a life. If the beat generation was that hollow...I guess I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY OVERRATED","review":"\\"On the Road\\" is a good title because that is all that happens in this book. The characters are going here or going there, and very little happens in between. If anything, I was left with the depressed feeling that during their cross-country trips, absolutely nobody seemed to care for or love these characters. They seem totally on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - I guess I missed something","review":"As a 46 year old man, I had never read \\"On the Road\\" - I first listened to it on Books on Disc on a recent trip - and I thought, must be the medium and the narrator. Then I read it. Well, I was looking for enlightenment, insight, a real internal awaking... and what I read was a long, disjointed story about a dude with no backbone being lead around by a psudointelectual jerk with no respect for anyone but himself. What a total disappointment - if this is what my entire generation based itself upon... then no wonder we are electing whom we are electing."},{"rating":"1","title":"immensely stupid","review":"It is impossible to imagine why any reader would enjoy this book unless they too long for Neal Cassady to tickle their prostate. This wretched exercise in homoerotic mythopoetics is almost exclusively based on Kerouac's infatuation with Cassady, a by-all-accounts beautiful young man who was, meanwhile, little more than a bisexual, car-stealing, alcoholic, drug-addled punk.Towards the end of the book, as Kerouac lies ill in Mexico and Cassady, quickie divorce from his wife in hand, abandons him to head back to New York & marry anew, we can't help feeling that Kerouac's gotten what he deserved.But the epitaph for this \\"novel\\" must, inevitably, be Truman Capote's brilliant bon mot, On the Road \\"isn't writing; it's typing.\\" An immensely stupid and unwarrantedly respected piece of dreck.GRADE: F"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this so called American classic.","review":"I had heard so much about this book that I felt compelled to read it.Although I've read various plotless novels before they always more than compensated with great character development or questioned the readers views.But \\"On The Road\\" is plotless, characterless and formless.With 50 pages to go I felt that maybe kerouac could pull the threads together but I was to be disappointed.Perhaps in the 50's this was new age hapless wondering without any of the social responsibilities of the age but to this 90's reader it seems very trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Garbled Rambling","review":"I don't need to say much, because I see I'm not alone here.

I camped around the U.S. for several months, spent time with people from all walks of life. Along the way, I helped others and others helped me. Kerouac's book promotes extroverted self-exploration, while Pirsig's book encourages healthy introspection. Regardless of your age, if you are independent, read these books and hit the road. You will be delighted with what you discover about yourself and reassured in what you experience with others.

Kerouac wrote a masterpiece with this and time will show that, as more people are affected by it.The last few chapters are magical and the last page is perhaps the greatest piece of literature ever written. You should hear the CD box set, where he reads this page aloud. I believe he realized what he wrote when he recorded that page.

It wasn't very good. Kerouac is a crazy and surprising s.o.b. to have pulled off making this into a classic. The writing style for this novel was mediocre at best. This book only remains popular because of the sad existence of the angst-filled pre-teen mindset that seems cling to some people well into their twenties. There was (and is) no plot. It read like a person writing a letter to a friend that recounted his daily life. Or like a Diary. I was very disapointed. (p.s.

You know that this book changed lives. You know that this book epitomized the beat movement along with Howl and (with qualifications) Naked Lunch.That's the problem. It's not a horrible book. In fact there are some great passages, but after all that hype it can't live up to its reputation. Mostly it's Kerouac trying to follow Cassidy around country and getting lost.

It lacks any one relatable character, and instead spews out 15 generic young men's names as if from a database, which are difficult to keep straight since the author doesn't make you care about any of them.Your own journey of self-discovery is interesting...to you; rarely to anyone else. Kerouac, in his youthful ambition, failed to realize this.If you get down to the bare bones of Sal's \\"journey\\", he is a typical early-20-something, unsure of what to do with his life.

He's like chocolate syrup: a little can make your ice cream taste even better, but too much will make you ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"How 10 dollars can change your life.","review":"As a longtime blues enthusiast and player, I cannot say enough about the awesome experience this album is. I challenge anyone to come up with a more gut-wrenching blues performance ever than Roy's Bluz. I have listened to this track countless times, and I am still amazed by the dark emotional, indeed disturbing, aura of this performance. The personal tragedy of Roy's life only serves to magnify the reality of his blues. In summary: if you don't know this album, then you don't know the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Fire","review":"Roy blistered and smoked on the Telecaster and he displayed his talent on this album. The guitar sounds he produced on Roy's Bluz astounded me. Some parts of that tune resemble someone cold cranking a stubborn, 1961 Plymouth Valiant on an icy, Detroit morning. Caution: Your fingers may spontaneous combust while playing air guitar to this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"\\"Can we have a warm New York welcome, please, for Mr. Roy Buchanan!\\"... When I first heard this album, I was 15. And a budding guitar player. I heard it in the backseat of a friends car sitting outside our bands' practice place... and all I remember was my mouth hanging out... stunned. Twenty-five years later, it still sends chills down my spine. Of course, the solo on Roy's Bluz was meant to overwhelm you, to show you all of Roy's chops in a nutshell. But listen to Can I Change My Mind... so smooth, so tasty... Hot Cha... same thing. Over time I have realized that part of the charm of this album is the Hammond B3... always lending the tasty backbone to Roy's licks... One of my top three albums of all time... maybe number one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of The Best","review":"I was 16 when I first heard this album in the back of a friends car. I was a budding guitar player who thought he had a grasp of the medium... Man, was I wrong. I was in tears after listening to the first solo on 'Roys's Bluz', especially coming out of it hearing \\"you ought to be ashamed\\"... The first time you hear it you will feel ashamed that you have waited so long to buy this album. My all-time favorite Roy song is 'Can I Change My Mind', a sweet cover of an old Alton/Hortense Ellis Ska number... I cannot recommed this CD highly enough. You will not be disappointed. My number ONE Stranded Island CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"One town is just like another.","review":"From the description of this book I thought it would tell historical incidents of Arkansas' small towns. Wrong. In this book, each town has a version of the same stereotypical characters: farmer and his wife in their kitchy style house, owner of the general store/gas station, etc. Dull. Dull. Dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing","review":"I thought I was getting a historical account, a factual historical account. Unfortunately it's a blend of about 30% fact and 70% farce, and the narrative bounces between the two. I've read a lot of bad books, this was one of the worst because I expected and hoped for so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple review","review":"I was intrigued by the title of the book so went to the 'quick view' to read a portion of said book. Here's my take: This is (at best) poor, undisciplined writing. To be fair, I only read the first 4 or 5 pages however, that in itself was a task. The writer strayed around the subject so often that I couldn't help but wonder if this was a book he wrote that paid by the word. The topic is very interesting and I'm sure that had the author been given legitimate editorial guidance the book had the potential to be a wonderful journey. As it is, I wouldn't buy this at any price - too difficult to follow much less to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quig's thoughts on the book Let Us Build a City Together","review":"I have not yet read this book and can't say if I ever will. I purchased it to see how and whether or not it would work. It helped me to learn some things about how to purchase books from Amazon and how to manipulate my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"An extremely interesting synopsis of the birth, life, and death of eleven Arkansas communities at one time aspiring to own the coveted label of \\"city,\\" this book is all the more interesting if you have had the chance to have travelled through several of these mere wide spots in the road on occasion. While the author's incessant tangents seem to be the product of a deep seated need for a vehicle with which to exhibit his wealth of worldly knowledge, this annoyance aside, his ability to raise common people to the rank of folk heroes, if only on a local scale, is indeed unsurpassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting. Don't know how they did that.","review":"Interesting subject - I thought. Don't know how it was so boring. Even I, a voraciuos reader, could not get engaged in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anchors Aweigh - enjoyable family movie","review":"The flow of the movie, the music, brilliant dancing and good feeling it engendered.Very enjoyable. Good family viewing. An excellent production of a movie of the 40s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Gene Kelly/Frank Sinatra movie is a must see!","review":"I have been a fan of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra for a few years and this movie is one of the best. It has Gene's INCREDIBLE dancing (w/ Jerry Mouse and Frank) along with Frank's swooning voice (I Fall In Love To Easily/What Makes the Sunset?). One of my favorite songs of the movie is That Kiss and The Susie Song, they are both filled with comedy and entertainment, as is the entire movie. Any Kelly/Sinatra movie is a plus in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love too easily with Anchors Aweigh","review":"Anchors Aweigh is an MGM classic. When you watch it you'll never forget Gene Kelly's dance with the animated mouse, Jerry, Frank Sinatra's crooning of \\"I Fall in Love too Easily\\", Jose Itrubi's brillinat playing of the piano, and Kathryn Grayson's operatic \\"Jealousy\\". I don't think this is Kathryn Grayson's best role, but she sure does a good job. Some other songs that I haven't mentioned are \\"If You Knew Susie\\", \\"Waltz Serenade\\", \\"All of a Sudden My Heart Sings\\", and \\"We Hate to Leave\\". I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and if you're a fan of Frank, Gene, or Kathryn, you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic musical!","review":"Sinatra, Grayson, and Kelly all show off their amazing talents in this movie. Many scenes are enjoyable for children, such as Kelly doing the waltz with a little girl and also dancing with Jerry mouse! Kelly taught Sinatra to dance for this movie. In fact, Sinatra is amazingly good. Grayson's voice is beautiful, and Jose Iturbi spices up the movie with his piano skills. Definitely something you'll want to see....."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best videos I've watched.","review":"I believe that this video is one the tells the real story about the United States Navy in World War II. It not only tells the story but it makes you feel like you are there right next to the brave men and women of the United States Navy. It puts you in there place and it gives you the real sense of being on a naval ship during the 1940's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Magical Moments in MGM Mishmash","review":"For those who grew up watching Gene Kelly's \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" and \\"On the Town,\\" the MGM mishmash of \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" (1945) will prove a disappointment. Nevertheless, there are some magical moments. The film's highlight is Gene's breakthrough dance with Jerry the Mouse - a stunning fusion of animation and live-action. Along the way, Frank Sinatra sings a few memorable numbers amid the Technicolor splendor. However, you must keep your finger on the fast-forward button to encounter these gems. Running 140 minutes, it's obvious that the editor fell asleep at the Moviola. Though directed by the usually reliable George Sidney, one wishes Kelly had more creative control over this unwieldy project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good!","review":"The reason I saw this movie is because Gene Kelly was in it. Overall I don't think this was his greatest movie but its good. Bascially the movie is about two sailors on leave in Hollywood. Sinatra is a shy character who follows his worldly friend Kelly. Anyway they run into a girl named Susie (Kathryn Grayson) who is trying to make it big as a singer. Anyway as it turns out they promise her an auditon with José Iturbi. Overall this movie is ok but I have seen better musicals. Personally the music is great! The best songs are \\"I Fall in Love too Easily\\" and \\"All of a Sudden My Heart Sings.\\" My favorite part in the movie was the whole Gene Kelly and Jerry dance part. Overall I think this movie is worth a watch. So I suggest you see this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Good Stuff.","review":"Classic Thorogood. A few repeats but plenty of new material and riff's to justify adding this disc to your library. Keep on rockin, George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I like the old George Thorogood. Although this is not bad, it's not great. Love Doctor is my favorite song on the CD. It has the pazzaz of the George Thorogood of yesteryear."},{"rating":"2","title":"the hard stuff","review":"this album sounds pretty good. If you like his stuff from the 80's you should be pleased with this one. try downloading it on emusic. Also there are a lot of great blues albums on this site. it's fairly cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality good - price too high","review":"I really needed these cartridges and since they are no longer available locally, this was my only option. But $75 for 2 black ink cartridges. Someone really knows how to hit you in the wallet. When these 2 cartridges are empty, I'll just have to retire the printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"It's been a long while since I've herd this CD maybe 5 years but I do remember I loved the whole thing. The one song that I even still remember just about all the lyrics to it \\"You're Pretty When I'm Drunk\\" an unforgettable funny song. This is the CD that got me hooked on The Bloodhound Gang.-VickyGeez"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good thing","review":"This was the Bloodhound Gang's first CD. It was not very good. Actaully, I did'nt like one track on it. The only good part was the track where they made fun of Axel Rose who is one of my favorite rockers, but it was funny. That is what the one star is for. Otherwise the rest of the album is weak. If you want to hear a great Bloodhound Gang CD, get \\"One Fierce Beer Coaster\\", it is great. It shows how a group can improve from a lousy album"},{"rating":"1","title":"sellouts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think one fierce beercoaster is a better CD. compared to this sellout CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ive heard from Bloodhound Gang","review":"I was excited about this cd...then I started listening to it. If I wanted Beastie Boys I would have bought Beastie Boys. Its nothing but lame 80's rap loops and a few butt rock tracks. Nothing like the Bloodhound gang of old. What happened to the techno/pop? What happened to somewhat punk? The only good song on the cd is Kids incorporated. I would consider this their joke cd since about half of the tracks are garbage and only 40 seconds long. One word...lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"un-able to listen to this","review":"this is without a doubt the worst album i have ever brought... EVER! i'd say its worth buying just for a joke, light up a couple of spiffs and laugh at the poor quality of this awful disgracement to the name 'music'. The only track worth listening to its the one about the transvesite, made me crack up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it","review":"The song \\"Bad Touch\\" is a great song that one can really move to, however the rest of the album is weak both musically and the groups technique. The album is also very offensive to those of us who believe in Jesus Christ, and had I of known of their demeaning and hateful treatment of Christ, I would not have bought their album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I downloaded this album with high hopes it would match my high expectations after buying one fierce beer coaster and horray for boobies. What i heard is hardley even listenable. It's way too much like punk, and it seems childish even for the bloodhound gang. One fierce beer coaster is much superior to this album in every way. I must stress that unless you want to piss someone off by giving them a crappy gift, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad they got better","review":"Like many others, I discovered the Bloodhound Gang via The Bad Touch. I bought Hooray for Boobies and thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny lyrics and catchy tunes. Then I got it in my head to try their other CDs and I ended up with this one. What a disappointment! The lyrics aren't nearly as clever and there's not a decent tune on the whole CD. I'll keep my eyes open for future releases, but I'm not going to touch One Fierce Beer Coaster and I can't wait to sell Use Your Fingers off to the used CD store."},{"rating":"2","title":"the original cracker/honky tongue in cheak rip off artists first cd(sort of)","review":"this was the original incarnation of BHG. beats,rap rhyms,odd 70's/80's TV remarks and beat rip offs funny as hell lyrics!! most poeple say the original version of any band is the best version or the only version of a band i agree but they managed do very well still after restructering after their record label dropped them and acouple founding members left to form wolfpack(mike daddy long legs bowe)and skip-(tiny)-o -potomus )they never got the sucsess BHG did but the BHG change a bit and manage a few hits and the bad touch super hit"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"After buying One fierce beer coaster and Hooray For Boobies, I found that i wasn't too impressed with this CD. I'm, not one of those fans who saw The Bad Touch on MTV and called myself a Bloodhoundgang fan. I can sincerely say that One Fierce Beer Coaster was as good if not better than Hooray For Boobies. When I got Use Your Fingers, I was disappointed that it was early enough that the band was entirely different. I really miss evil, Q-ball, and spanky. Also, I love Jimmy's rapping and I found that Long Legs didn't impress me as a silly white rapper. Though this CD had its moments, mentionably \\"You're Pretty When I'm Drunk,\\" \\"Legend in my Spare Time,\\" and the muffs' \\"Kids in America,\\" I think I'll stick with the newer Bloodhound gang..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick, but somehow very funny","review":"The humor that winds this album is sick and shovenistic, but somehow, it all works together to make the entire CD really funny. The best way to describe it is Suburban Rap, with more than a little stupidity thrown in. Before you know it, you'll find yourself singing your fav. lines wherever you go. Although a few of the songs (like Kids in America) were more anoying than funny, others (like Pretty when I'm Drunk) had me and many of my friends laughing away. Overall, I think this is a great album, and if not easily offended (especially females!!) I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good quality","review":"Bought this to replace the one I had from verizon. It lasted litterally less than 2 weeks.

When I read about Monro's career, I was surprised that I'd never heard of him before, but I knew that I liked what I heard. I was also impressed that Sinatra supposedly said Monro was his favorite singer. At any rate, I bought this album for my mom as a gift, and she loved it! Honestly, I wouldn't mind having a copy for myself. There are two CD's included, and each selection is either a hit or a popular, well-known song. That's my idea of a great collection!

Both women's careers peaked at this film (Carrie Fisher's acting sucked in star Wars-and Kirstie Alley's comedic talents never rose past the level of a stoic Klingon in Star Trek III ) If you are need of serious hilarity, you should try this movie.

I knew I needed a mattress that was firm enough that my baby couldn't suffocate in it and one that was soft enough to be comfortable. This was the best I could find. We've had it in both my son's crib and his toddler bed. It is more quiet than other less expensive mattresses because it has the side air vents, we've never had a problem with keeping it clean. It still looks brand new and has no sagging or dip in the middle like some of my friends crib mattresses do. I bought a cheaper one thinking it was comparable to put in the crib for our second baby, but it is awful it makes a ton of noise whenever the baby moves and has pockets of air that pop up.

We have always been at war with Eurasia. Or was it Eastasia?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story Told Well","review":"Louise Erdrich is among my favorite authors. She weaves moving, human plots together with the intricacy of a well-told poem. Her landscapes make one gasp and her characters make one believe. So it is through this biased lens that I picked up Four Souls, read it, and also loved it.Fleur Pillager walks to Minneapolis to kill John James Mauser. That's the premise, but along the way she devises a punishment worse than death. See Mauser stole her family's land and clear cut the prized trees, leaving her family as poor as destitute as the rest of the Ojibwe in Northern Minnesota. What's her plan? Nurse Mauser back to health from his poison-gas induced illness and get him to fall in love with her.It's such an accomplished story told beautifully that I really can't add to it in a longer review without giving away more of its magic. Please, read this one, and Tracks the novel about Fleur Pillager that precedes it.- CV Rick, February 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Narrative Magic","review":"I've read tantalizing tidbits about Fleur Pillager in other Erdrich novels and stories, but here I got to meet the real woman, in all her magnificent flawed beauty. I especially enjoyed the storytelling when it came from the old Native Nanapush, one of the narrators who combine to tell the story ofFleur's revenge on a white land speculator. A priggish white spinster is one of the narrators, each of whom is affected by the vengeance motif. A poetic and highly satisfying reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bones Book","review":"I own the 1989 version of this book (don't know if there's any other version). It has a spiral binding so that the pages lie flat, all 105 of them. The cover is a drawing of a hand holding a pair of musical bones in the proper position. I own several books on how to play bones, and this is the best by far. It teaches you how to hold bones and how to play them with a pair in each hand. The exercises are excellent and easy to follow, and there are many, many exercises, so you will never get tired of doing the same ones over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a better world?","review":"This is the best book of its kind I have seen.

We're in the 'hate it' category. The characters talk SO MUCH - it takes forever to get to the games. Some areas have very little instruction and our 4 year old has no idea what he is supposed to do, so he just ends up clicking anything and listening to more TALKING. He either ends up frustrated and walking away or playing the only game he can figure out over and over and over. I gave it 2 stars because there is one game our son likes to play that has taught him a little bit of mouse control. If we hadn't received it as a gift (and need to keep it around in case the gift-giver ever wants to see it), I'd be checking in to the satisfaction guarantee. This game is terrible. There are so many great software titles out there for this age group (the Reader Rabbits, and Blue's Clues ABCs for example), I wouldn't waste my $ on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Years of Trouble - Clarified","review":"This book made me aware that caffeine, dairy and sugar were wreaking havoc on my pituitary gland, and producing symptoms that the doctor couldn't interpret beyond \\"food intolerances\\". When I followed this book, my back troubles disappeared, I found new strength after about a week, and could climb in the mountains again. Even though I haven't followed the book perfectly as to its diet, I have still had the knowledge I needed to put myself back into shape where the symptoms back off and I can function again. I can't help wondering how many people with who knows what kinds of symptoms would benefit from this book! My problem came from the pituitary gland - yours may come from gonads, adrenal, or thyroid.

Radio quality isn't the best, the cd player is ok. Our biggest complaint is that it doesn't keep time.

Apparently, in an attempt to make the new models light and the displays large, Canon sacrificed durability.In some cases Canon will \\"waive\\" the LCD repair cost.

I had it now for a few months and should have followed my first instinct when I took it out of the box. It is too small and quite uncomfortable since there is no real grip. The picture quality is pretty good as long as you are not using the flash or the macro feature. The LCD is already scratched though I am anal with my equipment (I still have and love my 1980s A series camera which still looks almost new though it has been around the world with me a few times).By looking at the prices now, I am disappointed that I did not go with the G6 or one of the Olympus SLR style cameras but fell for the \\"portability/cuteness\\" factor: size DOES matter.

The problem with the 230 was that the switch from picture to review had movie in between and many times would be on movie when you wanted picture. The SD500 corrects that but provides a wheel that is diffiult to manipulated. There is a small smooth elevation on the wheel that is supposed to help but is very difficult to grasp. The ability to switch from photo to review is almost sufficiently difficult to wish that I had ordered a different camera. Who designs these things?

My overall impression is that picture quality is quite good at representing color and details. Up to now, the only minor shortcoming is that the default setting of exposure makes all pictures taken look darker than reality.

Funny thing about the Canon warranty - it states that damage to the LCD is \\"assumed\\" to be through misuse. I'm getting the runaround trying to get it fixed - maybe they'll fix it, maybe not.It seems I'm not alone. A Google search shows cracked LCDs on the SD500 are a very, very common problem.

I can get the new sd1000 for 166 (today, hopefully less on black friday) not sure if this is a flaw that others experienced, but the camera worked very well during the 2 years I had it.

The only thing I would like to change about it is the zoom isn't too much, only 3x and the videos you take are so huge you can't email them. They have a compact version of the video you can take but then its so small when you send it you can barely see anything.

There's not a bad track on this CD! Every one is a winner! Must listening for all 10cc fans, and for those unfamiliar with the group. Deserves a spot in any CD collection. To paraphrase the opening song on this album: \\"One disc from these guys, is like a bunch from any other band\\" ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"innovative and melodic","review":"This album is brilliant, merely for containing the epic 'une nuit a paris', this is true genius. Impossible to do justice in describing here, it is a mini-opera, with oodles of creative ideas, melodies and cliches galore. A piece of genius. This is followed by the equally epic 'I'm not in love', which has been elevated to godliness.The album really rocks hard with 'the second sitting for the last supper', which has an excellent riff.There are also other really nice ballads, like 'brand new day', which has Kevin singing really high and 'the film of my love' my fave track on the album, which seems really overlooked by fans. It must be Graham Gouldman's best lead vocal and the melody is just so catchy and tuneful, while being comical at the same time.'Good news' is a b-side bonus track, that could have easily made the album. 'Channel swimmer' is also good, but more obviously a b-side.Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Coaching","review":"If you are interested in learning about coaching and partnering with clients to create change - this is a book for you!

Since we were away for Christmas, we called the company, were on hold for 20 minutes, then told them the problem and that we needed a new battery sent to our home address. They took down the address and said they would send it. When we returned home from our trip, no battery had arrived. The company then left a number on my mother's voice mail (where we were for Christmas,) and said they needed info on where to send the battery.

Edward starts calling on Niki for curiosity's sake until the curiosity turns into love.Lori Wick ties up all the ends nicely and brings this remarkable series to a close in the wonderful book, the Pursuit"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and awkward","review":"This is the first and last Lori Wick book for me. The Characters were shallow, simple puppets moving through a prescribed series of very boring events. I found myself skimming through great portions of the chapters involving characters I can only assume were part of other books in her series, but which I found extraneous and irritating here. There also seemed to be a serious lack of real research for a historical piece, with anachronisms abounding. I found the protagonists simplistic, and their actions overwrought for the situation. The twin's grandmother,(the villain here) was very one-note, with no attempt on the author's part to make her a real person. Instead she appears as almost an afterthought used to explain the ridiculously melodramatic and circuitous actions of the boys mother. Not worth the paper it's printed on, or the time I wasted forcing my way though it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work","review":"I have read every book that Lori Wick has written and I must say I know that she can do so much better then this. I was more intrested in characters from the previous books then I was in Edward and Niki.

We picked it up for our 4-year old son because he is interested in learing Spanish. He quickly got bored of it (within a couple weeks) and has learned practically nothing from it. He doesn't like the explore mode. He is used to playing different activities like in his preschool games. That's what he enjoys.

Mind you, I don't have a wimpy computer - my computer should be able to handle something like this (I use much more sophisticated programs each day: Illustrator, Flash, Dreamweaver, 3D Studio Max) and yet, this silly little CD-ROM seems to stall and cough each time I put it in the drive.

My biggest concern is that there is constant loud background music in almost all features of the game that apparently cannot be turned off. The music is inoffensive, but it makes it very hard to hear the Spanish. Turning up the volume only turns all of it up, so the whole game ends up being too loud for our small house, and still my daughters can't quite make out what they are saying.My other concern is more a matter of personal taste - the whole scenario is surreal. A rabbit goes into a tree and then enters rooms in a dollhouse. I guess this wouldn't bother most young children but somehow the animation seems just slightly off to me - a little dark, or strange, or something. Not bad or spooky, just odd. I have never seen other Jumpstart products, so I cannot compare it in that respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of vendor issue","review":"The \\"rabbit\\" version of JS Spanish is only available from one vendor, which apparently is in the habit of shipping the \\"dog\\" version/\\"classical\\" version, which they sell in another listing for $8 less as a \\"value line\\", rather than the version ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressive","review":"I also don't understand the glowing reviews of this program.

Juan for instance has no direct translation toEnglish--Juan is Juan--but yet the program definitely implies that ittranslates to an English name.

If I plug a dead controller into slot #1 or #3 it doesn't do anyting.

When I received the charger I found that after I carefully read the instructions I was able to insert the controllers into the base without too much trouble. Sure a little patience is needed, but nothing that will require any extra meditation. Also, my wife (who isn't the most tech savvy person around) figured it out with ease (so now she can play Super StardustHD whenever she wants).Ultimately this device is well built and is definitely much better than charging your controllers with your PS3 turned on all the time.

I've heard the complaints of many through the years, about how \\"...(he) just doesn't do it as good as in the old days\\", meaning the shredding style developed when he was in Cream. I beg to differ. The man returned to the soul of the music that motivated him to play in the first place. This is a display, not only of his immeasurable ability to play a guitar, but to use it to communicate in a way that his voice alone could never do. The acoustic solo on \\"Can't find my way home\\" is short, sweet, and among the best I have ever heard. It isn't surprising to hear Clapton say that this was the one band he was in that he \\"would have paid to see\\".

Only six songs, although extended jams, this document serves as a testament to his blues playing prowess, herein flavored with the spiritual influences of Blind Faith. Not the stunning sting of his work with the bluesbreakers, nor the plaintive desperation of Derek and the Dominoes, and certainly not the freshness and comfort of Ocean Blvd., this record is Clapton tired and sad, as if lying on his death bed, oozing smooth, effortless blues.

Pure greed and devious machinations in the Osbourne camp perpetrated this atrocious maneuver, however to remove Bob Daisley's hand entirely from the two albums would have created the need to write entirely new songs, so he gets the last laugh in at least some way.

I honestly dont know what the hell is happening to Ozzy these days. Ever since \\"The Osbournes\\" he's been gaining legions of fairweather fans, alienating true fans and now screwing musicians over too! Its sad and pathetic. These people are rich as hell, but they're still so damn greedy that their own money isnt enough, they want Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake's money too??

I read an interview recently on Blabbermouth.net where he basically blamed Sharon for that release, stating that he didn't even know it was being done. He claims that after he found out about it, he told her that he wanted the original version restored and that he \\"wouldn't have done that.\\" (the link is in the comment below the review)Get the 1995 out-of-print cd or the upcoming Legacy Edition that will include a previously unreleased live disc of a concert with Randy Rhoads.

How do you think Picasso or Monet (or their admirers) would feel if their art was altered, then re-sold as the originals? This is just as bad as picking up a compilation CD of yesterday's 70's or 80's hits, only to find out the songs are not played by the original artists, but by some cheesy wedding band or subpar studio musicians.

This is a cheap re-issue without Bob Daisley & Lee Kerslake. Even worse, Daisley wrote almost all of the lyrics on Blizzard and Diary. I have pledged, never again will I spend so much as a penny on anything Osbourne related. Boycott the re-issues. If I want any of the non-fake Ozzy albums, I will buy them used. This reissue is about as cool as an AOL CD.Ozzy, while having a bit of talent back in the day, is now as commercial as Britney Spears. Most anything he has done lately is written by hired songwriters, his band is basically a bunch of hired goons. This is coming from a guy who used to talk about how great Ozzy is, as with the other 50 or so \\"boycott this garbage\\" reviews here. These re-issues are the nails in Ozzy coffin, and effectively demonstrate his (and Sharon's) lack of respect for his/their own legacy.

I can just see Sharon \\"Yoko\\" Osbourne cackling in the control room when they RERECORDED half the album. Sounds nothing like the original. Since it's a different album, then it should have a different title. How about \\"Diary of a Insane European Woman\\", since Sharon's fingerprints are all over this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the old version, not this one","review":"The original version is a classic, a must have. Randy was unreal and Ozzy voice is piercing. Bob and Lee are instrumental with their tracks, no pun intended. However, Bob and Lee are removed from the newer CD versions and and the new drum and bass tracks just don't sound right. How can it, when you add new drums and bass with current technology over 1981 recording techniques (and it also sounds like it was done last minute)? Plus the fact Bob and Lee were there with Randy putting it all together; the vibe was there big time. I hope that everyone will work out their differences and we'll see a Super DVD or DVD-Audio, or some super high resolution media released of the original version of this. For now, find yourself the Diary of a Madman remaster version from 1995."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats up with this?","review":"You actually still can buy the real version of this album on this site if you look hard enough.This version however is strictly for the die hard Ozzy fan who wants 2 versions.Everyone else should buy the 1995 remaster which features the original musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy's Hardest Album - A Real Classic","review":"From the album cover to the lyrics, this album represents Ozzy's darkest hour- and I believe the structure of the songs really brought out the best in Randy's guitar techniques. It's obvious that Ozzy's brought a myriad of influences, both strong and subtle, into this metal masterpiece. Having collected most of the articles written about the Madman, I can see subtle melodic influences ranging all the way back to the towering classic Paranoid - from the angst-ridden blues/jazz artist of postwar Britain, the late Michael Beverly, to Clapton's wailing Ocean Boulevard classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care for the re- remaster myself so.........","review":"I was going to settle for the two cd import with blizzard and diary thinking it was the 2002 versions but at least it was 8.99.

I strongly suggest getting the two cd import from Aussie land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning","review":"this cd and \\"blizzard of ozz\\" I kind of think as one CD since Ozzy recorded both at the same time. I keep reading how this cd is \\"inferior\\" to the blizzard cd but I disagree. I like both of them equally...\\"Little Dolls\\" is kinda lame but other than that, it's great. The slow break in the title song is very cool as well as the ending with the choir...it just sounds so EVIL(ha ha). I bought this remastered CD last week after not owning or hearing it since I bought the vinyl album in 1982 when I was 12yo. I really miss Ozzy's 80's music... I'm gonna buy all of them. Long live Ozzy... and watch his show on MTV!! And as far as the controversy about re-recording the bass and drums with his current musicians...I can't tell the difference for one second ...!!!! It's Ozzy's music, he must have had a good reason ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy's masterpiece...","review":"The first one('Blizzard')was great,but this is a work of poetry,intense,haunting,dark,and better than anything Danzig could ever hope to put out.This is the true follow-up to Black Sabbath's'Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath'and'Sabotage'.The line-up for this one is superb,while Ozzy provided some of his best vocals since'Paranoid'."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.","review":"Ozzy must have had one too many beers when he thought up this one. So what if you owe Kerslake and Daisley royalties, that doesn't mean that it's required to re-release one of your best albums(much less ruin it along with Randy's phenominal guitar work)! Just make some more copies of the 1995 remaster, and leave it alone. It's hard to find the previous Ozzy remasters from seven years ago anyway, now I'll have an even harder time trying to find a copy with this on the shelves. This is an utterly disgusting way to try to make more cash, especially when you already have enough money to wipe yourself with. And in my opinion Ozzy really doesn't deserve all that money. He never was much of a singer, and I can bet he didn't write half of his material. The majority of the talent was in the rest of the band no matter what lineup, and this was the best lineup Ozzy had, and now, thanks to Ozzy and Sharon, this masterpiece will never be the same. Thanks a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"Diary Of A Madman was on of the first albums I ever purchased and has always been one of my favorites. But this re-recording is a disgrace. Michael Bordin is a lousy drummer. He kills the opening to the song, \\"Little Dolls\\". The bass playing is nothing to write home of either. Ozzy, you need to be fair. If you're going to remove Bob Daisely's bass lines you also need to remove his lyrics and write your own. See how far that gets you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Diary of a Madman","review":"They took off the original bass and drum tracks, which couldn't have been improved, and re-recorded them twenty years later under totally different conditions, and ruined the whole album - which is a real shame because the original album was actually perfect. This is just incredibly bad taste and proves that Ozzy is not an artist in any sense of the word. Along with Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake handed Ozzy his solo career on a plate, and this is what they get in return. That's gratitude for you. Screw you, Ozzy, you suck. You not only screwed over your band, you screwed your fans, too! This isn't Diary of a Madman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"The original album, left alone, is 5 stats.

There is no way to know this looking at the outside of the cd, one has to read the buried, \\"new\\" Blizzard lineup in the liner notes, also know that Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslak were original members of Blizzard, and then figure it out by seeing two other guys besides them playing bass and drums. Pretty sneaky! It would be like buying the White Album and learning that Paul and Ringo's parts were replaced in 2002 by the two guys who play them on Beatlemania. A total ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure rubbish","review":"Simply put, I had to give this a one-star review because there is nothing lower that I could have given it. While Robert Trujillo does an admiral job in recreating the sounds of Bob Daisley's bass lines; the mockery that Mike Bordin makes of Lee Kerslake's drum tracks is a disgrace.The only reason I can think of for wanting to buy this re-master would be to gain a greater appreciation of the work of Misters Daisley and Kerslake. From a purist's point of view, this release is pure rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"addendum","review":"At least the signature riff of this album is still intact. Lee Kerslake's killer opening drum intro to \\"Over The Mountain\\" remains in all its glory. The riff is followed by a sloppy, obvious edit and then it's onto the inferior overdubbed drums and bass. Did the Osbournes truly think they were going to fool anyone with this nonsense, let alone Kerslake himself or any rock drummer on the planet? Lee, I say you and Bob continue the good fight and get what's owed you. Your drumming is still on this record, try as the Osbournes might to repeatedly deceive us, Ozzy's true and now former fans.There is an informative and interesting article on the debacle that has become this record. Since Amazon guidelines prohibit including URL's, do an online search for a review of \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\".

By an earlier version and hear Randy the way Randy wanted you to hear him, not the way pop superstars Ozzy and Sharon think you should hear him. Ozzy is such an idiot. How someone that can put together such a great group of musicians, year after year, can be so stupid is beyond me. Not to mention, this album is huge. You don't just go and replace people and mix down the real star of the band. Anyway, if you can find an earlier version of the CD, buy it. It's a great album when it hasn't been tampered with, other than raising the volume a bit. It's a shame people continue to support Ozzy, when all he has really done for the past 3 decades is ride the coat-tails of the person standing to his left."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just makes me angry.","review":"Im extremely ticked off at Ozzy and Sharon.If they gave half a damn about their fans they would rerelease these albums in their original glory with the original musicians.This is the worst thing ever to happen to music.Ever.This is worse than Milli Vanilli.Doesnt Ozzy Osbourne have a conscience anymore?Is he on drugs again?That would explain this cruel treatment.I used to have this on vinyl and it was great but it got scratched.I demand that Ozzy will come to his senses and rerelease this with the original musicians.This is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry, but I had to see for myself","review":"I bought it even though you all warned me. Let me be brief.I can forgive the missed drumbeat during Randys solo in \\"Over the Mountain\\". I can forgive the off-time bass and drums in \\"Flying High Again\\". But I cannot forgive Mr. Trujillo for adding his own bass lines to the beginning of \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\", how dare he think he can improve the playing on that song. Bob Daisley never overplayed anything unless it fit the song well. I cringe when I hear those bass notes he decided to add to that song. ...The cd does sound great. Let's just put it back with the ORIGINAL musicians. HELLO???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds better....","review":"Wow I can't believe all the negative feedback. I think Sharon and Ozzy's decision to re-record the bass and drum tracks strengthens the disc greatly. Overall, it has more power to me and I actually prefer this to the original. Randy's guitar is brighter and the whole disc is a lot louder and clearer than before. Seriously. The bass and drums sound better too...not as thin. Also, I'm not a huge fan of this BONUS TRACK gamet thats taking place these days but 'I Don't Know [live]' is a great little selection and it's quality is also amazing. Highlights include, Over the Mountain, Flying High Again, You Can't Kill Rock And Roll and Diary Of A Madman. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Assed follow-up to a Classic","review":"I can't believe all the Reviewers who enjoy this album, cuz Personally I find this album to be Dull Sounding compared to Ozzy's legendary debut.\\"Diary of a madman\\" sounds VERY rushed. The band was trying so hard to meet that deadline before the tour kicked off. And from listening it Becomes painfully obvious.I pull \\"Diary of a Madman\\" off the shelf for only 3 songs: \\"Flying High Again' and \\"Over the Mountain\\", which is a BLATANT Re-Hash of \\"I Don't know\\". The title track is good, Randy played a fine intro. The Rest of the songs are Un-Interesting Filler.Don't get me wrong y'all, I love Ozzy, but I wasn't feeling \\"Diary of a madman\\".Sadly, This was Randy Rhoads last recording before his untimely death, A mediocre set of songs to end a Brief and Amazing life.Fortunately enough Ozzy redeemed himself with Guitar whiz Jake E. Lee (who in my humble opinion is better than Rhoads.) and returned to form with albums like \\"Bark at the moon\\" and \\"The Ultimate Sin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half an album with no credit where it was due","review":"IN response to the previous reviewer regarding Bob Daisley's and Lee Kerslake's contributions. Their parts were removed and dubbed by other players owing to Ozzie's non payment of royalties. There may be an ongoing legal situation here. I also fully expect this review to be removed if Ozzie's people read it. However, I hope that many people read it before he does have it removed so that they are made aware of what a misery-guts Ozzie really is. Do the work, get paid what you are due. Employ the staff, PAY THEM!!! Incidentally, Bob's parts were dubbed by Rob Trujillo ... I cannot and will not ever understand what could possibly possess people to comply with a request to play overdubbed bass and drums on a piece of work which was made many years ago and was outstanding in the first place. Shame.from Pete in Sydney, Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy's best","review":"I feel bad when I see low reviews of this album, or when somebody says it was a bad album. It may not be as rockin' of an album as Blizzard of Ozz, but the music is so well mixed and Randy was at his best work during this album. It's not all just distortion and headbanging like the previous album; there is more skill and theory involved, like in songs like Diary of a Madman, or You Can't Kill Rock'n'Roll. The music is very varied on here. It is Ozzy's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone deserves their money back!","review":"This is really pathetic. By taking a great album and stripping out the original rhythm section, they sucked out all the chemistry of the original players -- Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake -- and, as if that weren't enough, put on inferior re-recordings that don't even do the music justice. I HATE this \\"remaster\\"!Memo to Sharon and Ozzy: You're loaded now. Cut the crap, negotiate in good faith and reinstate the original mix. You've not only done a disservice to fans and newcomers with this sorry excuse for a remaster, but you've in effect committed fraud. Nowhere on the outer CD tray card or cover does it say that the music's been rerecorded; in other words, you have to buy it to find out. You both ought to be ashamed of yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for \\"this\\" not original","review":"Don't mess with a classic.....this & Blizzard of Ozz are the best 2 albums EVER made!!

I bought both albums when they were brand new. The biggest mistake Ozzy made in his solo career was getting ride of Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake. That was until Sharon and he made these awful remasters. Go to a record store and buy used copies of the originals. It is amazing what greed can do to rich people. Ozzy should be ashamed of this. It was bad enough when he (and Sharon) put pictures of his new band on the original album sleve but to not even put the real music on the cd reisue is a bad joke. This is a 5 star ripoff of a great album. And I mean 5 star in a very bad way."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUTCHERY OF A MADMAN!!!!","review":"dont buy these butchered versions of \\"blizzard of ozz\\" and \\"diary of a madman\\".history has been destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"_BIG_ Letdown","review":"I loved Ozzy Osbourne's Blizzard of Ozz a whole lot. What a great album. This one is a big dissapointment though. There are two pretty good songs, and I do mean pretty good: Over the Mountain, and Flying High Again. Over The Mountain regurgitates a section of I Don't Know, and it is so obvious, that I wonder why there haven't been complaints. Besides those two, the rest are a pain to listen too. Cheesy ballads like You Can't Kill Rock and Roll, and Tonight, are just pathetic and you hit the skip button pretty fast. Britney Spears' Baby One More Time CD is much better than this one, and I am not even close to exaggerating. Skip it. Get No More Tears, maybe Tribute, and definitely Blizzard of Ozz. And before I get bashed for this one, listen to both CD's before you say that Diary is better than Baby One more Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time investment or price","review":"I am a software engineering professional, Rational methodology certified, worked with unified process for over 12 years, and a veteran project manager.

He does a good job in linking social conditions to organizing strategies and tactics. The book gives the reader a sense of the progression of ideological movements in the United States over time. It is very inclusive as it covers organizing among the white working and middle classes and African Americans. It also touches on gender issues and issues of sexual orientation. It is inclusive in another way in that it covers different organizing approaches such conflict organizing as opposed to consensus-building; and locality development, social planning and social action.

For the first 45 minutes or so I thought it much too sentimental and stereotyped, but then the characters started to come alive and I got to like them, aspects of their philosophy, and this charming book, quite a bit. How can anyone hear of How Love Came to Big Joe Portagee and not enjoy a laugh? Or not be touched by the faithful and tireless dedication of the Pirate to save for and buy a gold candlestick for the church after one of his beloved dogs recovered from illness after he prayed to God to save it (and so what if it died of something else soon thereafter).

I didn't totally understand this book. Maybe I would if I read the Bible more. I love the connections that Steinbeck makes between humans and nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck at his best...","review":"This was the first of John Steinbeck's books that I ever read and is still my favorite. The sweet humor that comes through is more a result of the book's wonderful writing style and wording than from the plot itself; although the combined character traits of the paisanos work perfectly together-from the genius and comedy of Pilon to the morality of Danny the story that emerges is charming but not sentimental. The reader from Boston seems either too young or perhaps just not astute enough to realize these subtle shadings of character. Also in regards to his review, nowhere in the book does it say that the paisanos were Mexican immigrants, only of Mexican heritage. I highly recommend Tortilla Flat to anyone who appreciates Steinbeck's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book brimming with love and goodwill","review":"This is heart-warming book, innocent and with a genial air that tangibly touches the reader. I was really surprised to see that it was so humorous unlike Steinbeck's more somber works. It is the story of a young man called Danny and his many friends. They don't work, have many adventures on account of their insatiable love for wine and women and one completely falls in love with them within the first few pages. The book has some very profound philosophy and the ending is masterful. It never failed to both make me smile and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remind me of my spare times","review":"Nice reading and some times is amazing how close me and my friends can argue just like they do in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tortilla Flats","review":"Tortilla Flats is an interesting and informative story, . . . . and of course well written by John Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tortilla Flat","review":"Classic Steinbeck, the colorful cast of characters make this tale of human interaction come to life. A great read if you like stories primarily focused around real people."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is about friendships, I don't want any!","review":"Steinbeck portrays a pathetic group of acquaintances. An addiction to booze is the motive -with few exceptions- for every kind action. Tortilla Flat is good for a taste of reality, but not one that fills you with conviction to be a better friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early California Counter-culture","review":"John Steinbeck was an American classic. His two seminal books, East of Eden and Grapes of Wrath are, in my opinion, both on the top 10 list of American fiction. But readers would be making a big mistake to stop reading Steinbeck with those two novels. The author with this, his breakout book, shows the tremendous breadth of his abilities. This book could be read as pure escapism with a loveable group of unreliable scoundrels. It could also be seen as an early example of beat writers, albeit with a slower pace. But it belongs on all American fiction lovers shelves. It is one of those reads that will stay in most readers hearts and souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage early Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck has set many of his stories in the Monterrey, CA area where he himself is from. Tortilla Flat, though not flat at all, is part of that town and inhabited by Paesanos. People who are a mix of everything. They are poor, have to scrape their money together except for main character Danny, who inherits two houses. This wealth does not do him a lot of good however. He attracks people who go and live in his house. They really want to help him but they can't always. For them he is almost like a saint. But he cracks and when he is gone the one thing that holds them together is gone and they go their way.It's short (about 150 pages), easy to read and sometimes funny. As always with Steinbeck he knows how to create atmosphere and you identify with the people, even though they are no angels at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny-sad","review":"If I weren't so moved by this book, I'd probably say, \\"Typical Steinbeck\\". It is so, but what strikes you isn't the fact that it is a typical Steinbeck novel, but that creates a lump in your throat, especially towards the end, when Danny dies in his attempt to conquer the monotony of his own existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This book's main goal is to show that even petty thieves who live for the pleasures of wine are human and beautiful in their humanity. Along with a plethora of awful habits, these peasants have lovable and desirable qualities that make the reader want to love and hate them at the same time. Overall, this book does not demonstrate what Steinbeck is capable of, yet is it humorous and attractive nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny? I missed something.","review":"I had this book on my shelf for the longest time, meaning to read it, because I like a lot of Steinbeck's books and because when I was a child my family used to go to a campground in Arizona called \\"Tortilla Flat.\\" So I finally sat down with the book and started reading it. Not only was I more and more annoyed the more I read it, but I realized I had actually read it before and hadn't found it one bit memorable. Irresponsibility, constant drinking, and skirt-chasing just don't seem funny to me. I didn't bother to finish it, nor did I give it to someone who might like it better--it went out with the trash.Steinbeck was probably good and drunk when he wrote this pointless book, but you're far better off reading East of Eden, The Pearl, or even Grapes of Wrath (which must be one of the most depressing books ever written)."},{"rating":"1","title":"who cares about a bunch of drunks?","review":"Plot: Guy inherits 2 houses.

Perfecting the techniques of creating the SUCKIEST BOOK OF ALLTIME is not as easy as it looks. One of his earlier books, he obviously hasn't quite gotten the knack yet, horrendous it may be. it It may have seemed like a good idea, but writing a book on a couple hobos doesn't quite make the great thriller it looks at first glance.

The story, based on an actual situation, describes how 20 Christian children used their wits and compassion to hide 10 Jewish children from the Nazis during World War II. The children's experiences are truly an adventure, yet do not trivialize the Holocaust. Although I do not recommend teaching young children about the Holocaust's grim details, this book opens the discussion about people's responsibility to one another regardless of differences.

There simply is not enough time to just sit down and read the entire big Robbins. So, read Companion Robbins, learn all of tables and study the photos and diagrams in big Robbins, and skim through big Robbins for pertinant details in the text and highlighted areas.

The track 'Miracle Man' (his stab at tv avangelist Jimmy Swaggert, who actually got caught with a prostitute)is great...since Jimmy used to bash and label Ozzy and various other acts as being nothing but \\"devil worshipers\\". Great stuff. Other highlights include, 'Crazy Babies', 'Breaking All The Rules' and also interesting but not as good is his song about serial murderer Charles Manson 'Bloodbath in Paradise'. Greatly executed and thought provoking metal/hard rock. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakk \\"Wylde\\" makes this album \\"Wild!!!\\"","review":"This is the first/debut with guitarist Zakk Wylde. The great thing, and the pointer is that this album blows away the\\"glam\\" period Ozzy did with Jake. This is somewhat aparty cd, but there are some great songs here. \\"Breaking all the Rules,\\" is heavy and rocks, along with \\"Miracle Man,\\"and in particular, \\"Fire in the Sky.\\" This song is one of Ozzy'sbest, and the guitar solo{OH MY GOSH!!!} is one of the bestsolo's I've ever heard. This is a great CD. The reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because the production could have been better, {especially since it's remastered!} The drums seem drained out in some places, and the \\"talk voice\\" on \\"Miracle Man\\" is way too loud. Other than that, this album is part of Ozzy's History, so get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best","review":"This is one his best cd's and it makes me mad to see these other people talking bad about it.

I'm honestly NOT a fan of his playing, but he's good enough for this outing.\\"Miracle Man\\" is definitely a classic, along with \\"Fire in the Sky\\" and \\"Breaking All the Rules\\". I'd say, if you're a fan of Ozzy's singing and vocal style, this is a great album.But the guitar playing isn't very good most of the time, even though it's tolerable at least (it would become a screechy, annoying mess on the No More Tears album). For here at least, the guitarist knows not to go overboard and keeps things somewhat simple. It's not as good of an album as the previous four (Blizzard of Ozz through Ultimate Sin) but it's memorable for Ozzy's vocals alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"The songs on this album are corny, Zakk Wylde's use of pinch harmonics is annoying, and Randy Castillo blows. At least Ultimate Sin had some decent ideas. Miracle Man? Stupid. Bloodbath in Paradise? Retarded. Demon Alcohol? Worst song I have ever heard. When listening to this, I am embarrased for Ozzy. This is without a doubt the worst thing he has ever produced. Thankfully, Ozzy's next album would be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tin Drums","review":"It's a little surprising that Ozzy would choose to redo the drums and bass on his first two solo recordings, yet leave this release intact. The drum sound on this recording is simply unacceptable, and the entire production is hopelessly murky, even after a remaster (clearly only AAD). I hope whoever produced this record is no longer employed as a music professional. Poor Zakk Wylde hit the big time, only to have his debute butchered.In terms of song writing, Ozzy was off to a weak start with Zakk. Miracle Man and Tattoed Dancer are great songs, but the rest are as mundane as anything Jake E. Lee came up with on the Ultimate Sin. Perhaps a few attempts to write with Zakk finally resulted in Ozzy's decision to hire other writers by the time of Ozzmosis. It was really sound decision making, because Zakk is an amazing player, if not the most original writer, and it would be a shame to lose him. He's as much a part of Ozzy's sound now as the legendary Randy Rhodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince of dorkness???","review":"Ozzy was never any good solo, more like pop metal.

The drums are much flat, Zakk's guitar is sometimes unhearable (very low). the sound is murky and emotionless. Of course, we have here the Ozzy's quality in compositions. The bottom line: the material is good, but the production flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Ozzy's weakest albums","review":"No Rest For The Wicked was definitely a comedown after the decent The Ultimate Sin album. This is Ozzy's first album with Zakk Wylde on lead guitar and although his playing is impressive, the songs for the most part aren't very good. The first three tracks: \\"Miracle Man\\", \\"Devil's Daughter\\", and \\"Crazy Babies\\" are the strongest tracks on the album. The track \\"Hero\\", which was untitled on the original release, is also a decent track. The rest of the album consists of unmemorable songs like \\"Breaking All The Rules\\", \\"Tattooed Dancer\\", and one of Ozzy's worst tracks ever, \\"Demon Alcohol.\\" The band is top notch, as they are all on of Ozzy's albums, but the songs aren't up to par. I would recommend this fans of Zakk Wylde for the excellent guitar playing but otherwise Ozzy has made much better albums than this one, particularly those with Randy Rhoads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"No Rest for the Wicked is one of Ozzy's best releases. As with Blizzard and Diary, there are very few weak tracks. Zakk Wylde is a good addition on guitar. While no Rhoades, he has his own style. Randy Castillo is solid on drums. Ozzy is an under-rated vocalist. Critics complain that his voice is thin and weak, but metal isn't about singing pretty. Charisma can get you a long way. Ozzy's voice is distinct. Miracle Man is a rip on an evanglest preacher who would regularly condemn ozzy. Another song is about the Manson murders, Bloodbath in Paradise. No Ozzy fan should be without No Rest for the Wicked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy at his heaviest!","review":"\\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" sees Ozzy getting back to straight Metal. I didn't like the rather commercial, kinda glamour-Rock records \\"Bark at the Moon\\" and \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" that much, so this album is one of my favorites by Ozzy. There are no really outstanding tracks and the first time I listened to it, I didn't like it at all. It takes some time to get used to, it's not as catchy as some of his other albums ( like \\"No more Tears\\"). After all, I think it still shines as one of his best albums since \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\". It suprised me a little that \\"No more Tears\\" was so much different from this. But all the songs are worth listening to, there isn't a weak song on the whole album (that doesn't happen too often with Ozzy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I hate this.","review":"This is nothing compared to his previous works.

After Randy Rhoades death, he was replaced by Jake E Lee but he left the band also. Zack Wylde was the new guitarist and Ozzy took a new direction, however this was before his comeback with No More Tears that put him back into the limelight. No Rest For the Wicked is the heaviest of his '80s discography. It's also very fast paced and upbeat, in my opinion Zack Wylde's a lot better guitarist than Jake E Lee or even Randy Rhoades. No Rest For The Wicked was almost forgotten and it only had one minor hit, \\"Miracle Man\\". \\"Demon Alcohol\\" and \\"Tattooed Dancer\\" are my personal favorites. It's not my absolute favorite or probably not even in my top 5 but it's a step up from his last 2 albums and a good underrated gem, it's only a sign of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing of the Guard","review":"With Challenger, the New Earth saga comes to a very nice finish. All plot lines are tied up (some unfortunately so), a new ship and crew take over from the Enterprise, and all is well. All being well is the problem. I dont know if this was set up to be a story on it's own, or a launch of yet a new Star Trek series. As a finale it comes short of target, but works great if it is an introductory tale of the Challenger and her crew. This particular ship and crew I wouldnt mind seeing again, just like those of the Excalibur. These new faces are fun, a refreshing change from the same adventures of Kirk, Spock, and company. I hope a visit to the Sagitarius cluster comes again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have it!","review":"All due respect to Bilboard magazine and tyhe Joel Whitburn books but Cash Box charts are just as important - and the Country side as presented by CB has alot of detail you won't find in BB, which seems to have gotten mass acceptance as the *only* source.Don't expect the same format you find in the above-named competitor's books - not as much detail, but still a fun framework to study - and haer all those classics in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"a confusing christie","review":"I found this book to be just as delightful as most of christie's mysteries. Poirot is at his best, Hastings muddles along complicating things and there's plenty of bright young people in love to make this a cozy mystery. The end however is a bit confusing. Without spoiling it for other readers, I found the plausible motives and cast of villians to be a little disconcerting, especially given Poirot's propensity to blame each innocent attendant before finally throwing the curtain back and revealing the true murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book with a shocking ending.","review":"In this story, Agatha Christie out does herself. The many character developments and plot twists make this Christie's finest work.

The actual story is excellent Christie, but this version has a lot of errors and most of the book ended up italicised-- very hard on the eyes. Definitely buy the book-- just not this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lethal Links","review":"I am alone in trying to solve these novels before the end? Reading Agatha Christie novels leaves me constantly backtracking to find clues. This time I struck pay dirt!I solved the murder based on circumstance and irrelevant clues. The real reason for the guilt of the murderer is actually based on the suspect revealing a hidden fact early on that no one else knew. The problem with many of these clues is that they assume facts that the reader does not know. In this case facts that the suspect knew that no one else knew could have easily been bad perception or a deceit played upon the suspect.In any case just sit back and enjoy the intrigue of a beach side golf resort in roaring twenties France."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me reading","review":"A South American millionaire summons Poirot, in fear for his life, but before Poirot arrives, the man's body is found in a shallow grave on a golf course.Plenty of plot twists and kept me reading, in spite of Poirot's annoying habit of keeping his deductions to himself and Hastings' patronizing attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story telling","review":"I have read more than a dozen Agatha Christie mysteries (including her most famous ones), and so far Murder on the Links is my personal favorite. I like the fast pace of this story. No excessive dialogues between characters that don't have much to do with the murder. Rather than taking on chapters after chapters to develop the characters before the murder, the first murder takes place very early in the book, before the main characters show up. Then we get to follow Poirot's deductive process in solving the crime as all the suspects and their relationships are introduced one by one. The book is pure joy and I stayed up late to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Conversion","review":"The first part of the text is fine, but then the conversion program missed an end italics and the bulk of the book is in italic. Very annoying and hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prime Example of the Little Grey Cells","review":"The second Hercule Poirot mystery, The Murder on the Links, by Agatha Christie is a good example of the method of its detective and his little grey cells. The cast of charaters is small and there are some wonderfully complex twists but the main pleasure to be derived from this book is setting up Poirot in counterpoint to a more \\"modern\\" detective who uses less of a psychological approach and more of the blood-hound method examing the minutiae of the scene and following the scent. Hercule Poirot would definately not be a avid \\"CSI\\" watcher. The story also contains many romantic elements, another popular genre used by the author, that generally work better here than in other of her books. A good mystery, if not a Christie classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick With It!","review":"I've recently started reading the Christie mysteries I've missed along the way, including this, her second full-length Poirot. I found it tough going at times, somewhat confusing...but I've rarely been so blown away by the denouement of a whodunit! I can only imagine that this was the book that cemented Christie's reputation after her debut with \\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles.\\" Sure, the writing is old-fashioned (it was written in the late 20s, after all), but the intricacies of the plot and the way Christie keeps you off-base and guessing until the very end are simply stunning. You may not have heard of this Christie (it was new to me), but it truly ranks up there with \\"...Roger Ackroyd\\" and \\"...the Orient Express\\" for sheer suprise value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, pretty well designed","review":"This is a pretty narrow diameter pump. If you have narrow tires, that will be fine, if you have a mountain bike or other larger tires though, be prepared to make close to 100 pumps to fill your tire (about 120 pumps for a 2.25 in wide tire). Connection to the tube is great, and it seals on the first time with no leakage. The base of the handle has an internal mechanism where in the closed position you turn it a quarter turn and it locks in place so it won't accidentally extend when you aren't using it. This sounds great in theory, but when actually pumping you can sometimes feel it trying to catch as you finish each pump. Not really a problem, just a little annoying sometimes. Still, despite all that I think as far as functionality and ease of use, this is a great little pump. Very durable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good for emergencies","review":"This thing is small and light. That means that it is easy to carry around to pump up flats. It also means that it takes an awful lot of pumps to fill a 26\\" x 2\\" tire. You should have a regular size pump at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by Other Reviews","review":"I was truly surprised to see the low ratings for this book. I am a J.A. Jance fan mainly of the Joanna Brady series, not so much for J.P. Beaumont, however, I really liked this book. Yes, it is a bit darker and more intense than her other series tend to be, but I loved the idea of an ex-sheriff working cold case files. I did find the sexual content was a little dark and too explicit for my taste, but I liked the characters and the basic story. I will be reading more of Brandon Walker series in the future, and hope that some reviewers will give these books a chance. J.A. Jance does not let a reader down, in my opinion. Another good read by a talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Chance","review":"DAY OF THE DEAD was my first Brandon Walker and sad to say the last one J.A. Jance has written in this cold case series. We know how it is to be bored with retirement when one's spouse has entered a new and challenging career. Golf holds no interest for Mr. Walker and he is given a second chance when an invitation arrives to join The Last Chance group of former law enforcement officers who study unsolved murder cases.Thirty years have passed since the body of a young girl was discovered baking in the Arizona sun, which reminds one of the child who was ashore on the Texas coast. There have been no answers for her family. Brandon Walker steps into a world of evil that still exists after 30 years.A good read from the annals of cold-cases.Writing as a Small BusinessQualifying Laps: A Brewster County NovelUnder the Liberty Oak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"Normally I like J.A. Jance, but this book was an incomprehensible hodgepod of characters and meandering plot line. The author introduced so many characters so fast who had no association with each other, and then didn't mention them again till so far later one couldn't even remember them. They range from an ex county sheriff to an Indian girl who suddenly realizes her mother had a lesbian affair with a former Benedictine nun. One can only thing that there was a deadline fast approaching and the book had to be written FAST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too dark and on the sick side for me","review":"Actually, I think there are writers who can get away with this type of a story, but J. A. Jance isn't one of them. It's too bad because I am sure she was trying to make a point, but this book is just too depressing when one is expecting a Summer read type of book from her. I do give the lady credit for attempting to capture the Native American spirit here, but as a William Kent Kruger fan, she just doesn't cut the mustard this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"day of the dead","review":"I love mysteries and read an excerpt from one of J. A. Jance's books 'Death of a Snowbird' in book that I had purchased. It sounded good and I couldn't find it so I purchased this one. I'm very disappointed in this book. Way too graphic...I felt like I was reading a nasty porno murder. I don't know what other's expected but I expected a really good mystery. This isn't what I experienced. A good mystery doesn't need to be this graphic. I stopped reading it at 117 pages and at this time realized that I could never recommend it to anyone I know. Sorry, but it doesn't live up to the truly great authors like Ellis Peters and Tonly Hillerman."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ugly Book","review":"I've been a fairly loyal reader of Jance's Brady and Beaumont books. I don't think I will be in the future. In buying this one I feel was trapped by my past loyality. I struggled with this to page 175 and then quit. Now I'll probably use it for fireplace kindling as I'll NOT give this book to anyone I know. The subject's Ugly, many of the people are Ugly and the writting is contrived and predictably Ugly.Why in the world would Ms Jance impose this uglyness on her readers.Nice cover though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loyal Jance fan but greatly disappointed in this book","review":"I want to start by saying that I am a diehard Jance fan. I love the JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady novels but I found this one so disturbing that I gave it up after 100 pages and just flipped to the end.Why? It was very gory, graphic and disturbing. I, personally, felt no reason to have included such graphic, detailed child rape and murder scenes. The bottle scene and others were just too much for me.When I read, I want to be entertained with a good story, perhaps some humor... and I don't want nightmares. This one definitely could give a sensitive soul nightmares for days.I'm not giving up on Jance but, I disagree with another review, I don't see this character being her most memorable. It's just not a comfortable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I discovered J. A. Jance 4 years ago and have read every book she's written. This one is definitely the worst. The first hundred pages are spent introducing a myriad of characters and their histories (from her previous books). Very confusing. Very fragmented. If I were a first time reader of Jance, I would have stopped reading this book - but I persevered and finished reading it. I would not recommend this book to anyone -but I would definitely recommend anything else that Jance has written. She fell on her face on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of the Joanna Brady and J. P. Beaumont series, so I was looking forward to curling up with this book. I never read the first two of the Walker series but I was sure I was going to like this one. My goodness! What a horror! The description of the torture perpetrated on the orphan was so disgusting that I had to leave the book alone. I never went back to it. I like to read for pleasure and this was no pleasure. I will only read the Brady and Beaumont series from now on unless they get very gory."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR","review":"I BELIEVE I HAVE READ ALL OF JANCE'S BOOKS BUT IF THERE ARE ANY MORE LIKE THIS ONE, SHE WILL LOSE ME.

And it would probably be a far more intelligent read.Why no zero star option - or negative number ratings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to Joanna Brady","review":"I have read all of Jance's Joanna Brady books and love them so I was admittedly a bit bummed to discover her new book was not of that series. However, I was still excited but this book just dragged on and on with way too much contrived sex crime stuff as well. What a downer compared to Jance's normal good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much gratuitous violence and sex","review":"Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problem putting this book down. It was so repulsive I took it out and threw it into the trash can after about 100 pages then came in the house and washed my hands. There was way too much gratuitous sexual violence explicitly laid out for the reader that I felt I was being nearly raped myself. Awful, just awful. Not typical Jance at all. And, having seen this side of her, I just don't know that I can go back to Joanna Brady and J.P. Beaumont after reading this. I'm too afraid I'll come across this pornography again.It was also very difficult keeping up with all the native words and phrases (and their meanings) that were used repeatedly throughout the book and too many story lines to keep track of.It's back to Miss Marple and Poirot for me this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dead day of the dead","review":"I have read all of her books and have loved each one.

This book is like a bad movie that uses violence and sex instead of acting to make a movie. This is not what I have come to expect from J. A. Jance.

Which leads me to wonder why Uncle Mike's does not have an application chart for specific guns. After all, how hard would that be to program in their website? My recommendation is to physically verify the fit to any gun before buying an Uncle Mike's holster or use a brand that assigns specific holsters to fit specific guns.\\"One size fits all\\" is a guarantee of a poor fit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"different item sent","review":"What was shipped is NOT what is pictured on the Amazon site.

This holster is just too tight to be practical for even a limited carry or storage, and it doesn't seem to be stretching after a month with the revolver holstered and snapped. It fits 4 inch K-frame Smiths, okay, but I think I'm going to have to spring for a custom leather holster for the 629. My fault for cheaping out. This might also work better for an automatic like a Glock or 1911, as it's the cylinder on the revolver that makes the holster too snug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good author","review":"Victoria Holt is one of my favorite authors.

Smith had ten tunes that made the top-100 pop charts during the late 60's and early 70's. While previously, there have appeared budget compilations of his recordings, it has taken this long for a truely comprehensive greatest hits collection to see the light of day and it has come by way of the independent Taragon Records label, known for their high-quality reissues.All ten of his pop-charting songs are here along with other bubbling-under and failed singles filling out the generous 23-count tracks. As has come to be expected from Taragon releases, the production is first-class with all tracks in crystalline stereo. Complementing the audio is an informative, albeit brief liner notes booklet.This underrecognized r'n'b, pop, country and jazz singer finally gets his due recognition with this excellently produced piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool New Artist","review":"I heard two of the tracks on this disc on a couple of stations on XM Radio and had to rush out and buy it even though I already bought K.T. Tunstall, Cat Power, and Robinella this week. It was worth it. The disc starts out very strong with \\"Missed the Sunset\\", \\"Don't Ya Know\\", and \\"Frank Sinatra\\". All very cool, funky tunes that sound like early Cherly Crow mixed with Sherri Jackson and Toby Lightman. O.K. it's cooler than that sounds. \\"Aesops fables and \\"Icicles\\" are also strong and the bluesy gospel of \\"The Party Life\\" near the end shows her more soulfull side.

There are only two \\"listenable\\" pieces of music on this CD, the others are so wound into the action of the show that they don't mean anything to the casual listener. Further, many don't have an enjoyable melody. They're not the kind of thing you walk around humming to yourself. Sarah Bightman has a thin voice, too much vabrato, and poor diction.

I'll sum it up as this. When it comes to The Magestic in music, The Standard is the ending of Beethoven's 9th. There is no definitive definition of what makes something magical -- no particular note, nor arrangement of notes, nor anything -- but it is simply the culmination of everything in the musical piece. It's when you shiver from the music.

Buy the double cd Original London Cast instead- I give that recording 5 stars. If you buy this recording you will miss out on A LOT of great music, and some thrilling moments that aren't on the highlights.Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh is not on the highlights and that's worth the price of the double cd alone. I love that song and it's where Carlotta gets it good..and Crawford is haunting as usual during this part.Highlights for any musical are a waste.

For those of you who do not wish to sit through the dialog of the show and want to get to the good songs of the show, this would be the CD for you.Michael Crawford makes singing sound easy. The melodic discipline of his voice is of no comparison to the forced and choppy vocals of Gerard Buttler.

Good Thing It's a Fast Read","review":"I had relatively high expectations; lots of 4 and 5 star reviews on line, the newspapers loved it, the consensus seemed to be \\"hilarious.\\" I found very little entertaining in this book. The characters alternated between flaky and cliche, and the story never once even caused me to crack a smile. I tried in vain to detect some sort of existential underpinning here -- Justin's oral obsession as a reaction to his reluctance to act, his choosing not to choose. This was never flushed out (and may not have been intended; alas, opportunity lost). The plot was horrendously thin, the characters flat, the story completely unengaging. The novel didn't raise any questions and didn't ask me to think about anything. Did the writer even have a message? I give 2 stars because (mercifully) I finished it in one night."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Worse Habits","review":"THUMBSUCKER started off great--I liked the narrator Justin from the first page. But then it sort of fizzled. I gave it two stars only because, like Saturday Night Live, it just didn't sustain the humor and energy that grabbed me in the beginning.The funniest passage is his description of a nocturnal trip in his grandparents' motorhome.There were a few other sections where I laughed out loud, but it always seemed that the reader was held at arm's length, so I couldn't feel Justin's adolesence anguish. I think this book would have been much better if it had been edited a little more tightly, or if the grandparents--and other peripheral characters--had more page-space.Read this if you're going on a long bus trip. It's not a great book, but it's not a bad book, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"To echo some of the earlier reviews, this is a disappointingly slight novel from the author who created the captivating world of \\"She Needed Me\\". Kirn writes well, but this novel is surpisingly devoid of meaning. Vignette after vignette depict a depressingly stale Midwestern adolescence, with a broadly drawn protagonist and his vaguely drawn family. Justin Cobb has any number of adventures - his mother works at a Hazelton-like rehab clinic,where she may or may not be having an affair with a tv star in-patient, his speech coach has casual gay sex (point please?), his seldom seen grandparents appear and briefly, if unintentionally, kidnap Justin, and Justin has his first sexual experiences with a fellow Mormon convert. Some of these tales are well told, and keep the pages turning. But what's the point?I had to laugh at earlier reviews listing the novel's strength as it being a quick read. You know you're in trouble when that saves you from a bad review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best modern day western","review":"This is an excellent film. An all time favorite and classic.

I was looking for a meaningful Indian movie like Powwow Highway or Thunderheart and was misled by reviews. This is nothing like Dances with Wolves, which was thoughtful. This movie is not thoughtful, and has a third-rate script.

While it was a fine film in its original release, the voice-over was at times annoying and self contradictory. (How did the narrator get the protagonist to tell this story, when he was so dedicated to keeping it secret?!) It is a much better film without the narrative.

The music was wonderful, the scenery spectacular, the acting passable by the white actors, and effectively understated by the native Americans. AND - the film was monitored by the American Humane Society, which is especially important to me - no animal should suffer at the hands of mankind for any reason, let alone to create a realistic effect which could be achieved equally well with special effects cameras.

After much work in an elimination diet to determine the reasons for severe constipation that I have developed over the past year, I still had to have surgery and still had bm issues. I finally accepted that I cannot just rely on a very high fiber diet. So, in working with a wonderful nutritionist, I found that my supplement has to be free of all the commercial, chemical garbage that they put in most supplements.This fiber supplement, Heather's Tummy Fiber, has been a godsend. I am finally off a daily, heavy-duty laxative. I still have to drink lots of water (which I had been doing) but the fiber supplement is working, is inexpensive, and does not trigger allergic reactions like the others. I highly recommend this product as a possible solution for those who have a very long list of food/chemical intolerances. Follow the directions and go slow. But it's working for me! Yay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This product is wonderful! I had symptoms of IBS and was having a terrible time. I looked this product up online to give it a try. BINGO! It works great! If you have either diareaha or constipation, it works for both. Start slow and work your way up to a dosage that works for you. I am taking about 1 to two tablespoons a day, depending on whether or not I need it...but I do take at least 1 tablespoon a day every day. You may not need that much. Read the instructions....I'm telling you, this product was an answer to prayer!

God loves you and his love isn't found in this book ."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"Hank obviously is unhappy with the emotionalism that comes with revival, healing, and signs and wonders. In reality many of the healing miracles done through the healing movement have scientific and medical proof.That doesnt mean that the healers are not sinners just like you and me. It does not mean that the revivalists are not normal people. It just means that God works through real people to make miracles happen. Which sounds alot like the book of Acts. Hank probably wouldnt have been too comfy if he had been at Pentecost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feelings or Faith","review":"This book is for those who are sincere in their quest for true Christian experience. This book was hard to absorbe as Mr. Hanagraf doesn't pull any punches, but truly laying it on the line, either you are going for the \\"feelings\\" or you will have faith,If you are un-teachable then this book will only make you mad an angry at the author, but Hank is truly trying to educate you, the sincere seeker of truth, so hear him out and then let the Holy Spirit reveal what is really behind the \\"Counterfeit Revival\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dogmatic, where is the faith?","review":"I read this book before and during the process of learning about the Holy Spirt. Though Dr. Hanegraaff is passionate about unmasking the deceptions that some ministers use concerning God, he does so and a negative and often harsh way. Many facts were used in his arguments however his faith never shined through. I often have a hard time siding with someone in the Christian faith who uses head knowledge without incorporating faith into the process. I urge readers to seek out Billy Graham's book Holy Spirit for a better personal insight and experience concerning God as the Holy Spirit.

His voice is one of authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book better not read by anyone who wants to know God","review":"Hank Hanegraaff is foremost known for his struggle against cults - and he has done a fair, and good job in his exposure. The problem is that he unfortunately doesn't seem to be able to divide between occult cults and Christian brethren. I have myself been into cults - been tried and tested, if I may say so. And I know the tricks of the trade as well as anybody else - in that game. Like Hanegraaff I would like denounce certain things within the charismatic movement - but denouncing all of the charismatic movement is like flushing down the baby with the bathwater. God didn't call us to be lawyers. He called us to be lovers. But when Christian Brothers aren't able to love one another - what happens to the testimony towards the world? I cannot recommend -this- book by Hanegraaff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Hank for exposing these heretics","review":"It is about time that the evangelical establishment criticizes the unbiblical antics and false doctrines of the Toronto Blessing crowd. After reading this book, your will gain greater sense of discernment between \\"wheat and chaff\\". You will gain knowledge about the hucksters in the charismatic movement who have been preying on and destroying souls since the 1960s. Learn about the documented heresies of William Branham and the alcoholism of A.A. Allen. Also learn about the use of mesmerism and psychosematic manipulation in Pentecostal and Charismatic so-called revival meetings. Learn about the decline in the moral climate despite these revival meetings. Most shockingly, learn about the rampant anti-intellectualism of most of the leaders of the Toronto Blessing movement.

He used snipits out of context to build up straw men, and then blow them down. Quite a feat for the narrow and ignorant who think they are intellectual. Each one of his points could be searched out more directly by those who wish to be more spiritually and intelectually honest to see their fallacy . If interested in having your eyes opened wider than Hanegraaff is allowing, see Christianity Today's review, and Dr. Michael Brown's review in Let No One Decieve You.

It is poorly researched and the author is a dishonest writer. The Bible tells us (Isaiah 55) that God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts, that His ways are higher than our ways. The entire Bible is filled with events that most people would consider BOGUS and stupid and silly, and that is because HIS ways are higher than ours. We have no right to judge HIS ways! Please see Naaman--2 Kings 5. Jesus DYING on the cross in order to obtain victory for mankind is on the face of it preposterous! No one dies to win, after all....I am quite sure that Hank would have been in the crowd around Jesus telling him, \\"IF you're so great, show us! Come down from that cross and really be a man like we expect you to be.\\" No, Hank is fearful of the mighty moves of God.

After finding out the COMPLETE story of how Vineyard split off from Hannegraff's own Calvary Chapel, which is never once mentioned in Hannegraff's book, I can no longer listen to him without wondering what kind of spin he's putting on his opinions.

The area around the church remains untouched by the hand of God while Christians line up right in their yards for nightly services.

Between Disc one (1) and (2), the outside labeling of Episodes is wrong, i.e. Episodes are missing. And since the episodes are NOT labelled on the discs (you cannot see on the TV which Episodes are playing, despite the facts you have to watch the credits again and again) this defect is harder to detect.

It was great to see the clips of seasons past: shoulder pads, catfights, and massive wealth. However, my nostalgia was taken over by MAD FRUSTRATION because I am STILL WAITING for the rest of the \\"Dynasty\\" seasons to hit DVD. What's taking so long? How much suffering do we have to endure? How much begging do we need to do to make this happen? This is TORTURE, and I'm having a breakdown over this. Sitcoms of much lesser quality are getting rush-released on DVD while a show of this magnitude only has Season One. Sorry, but that's shady. Get it together, people. Get the rest of seasons on DVD.

I understand the need to put a faux Joan Collins photo on the box for marketing purposes - although we really don't see her until she whips up her veil and removes her dark glasses in the courtroom scene at the start of the act in season 2. Pity though to neglect Pamela Sue Martin from the front cover. Next to Krystle's clumsy stumblings around the Carrington house - Steven's storyline and Fallon's scheming were crucial to the development of the show. Fallon's sharp barbs alone (delivered with precision and extra relish by the always wonderful Pamela Sue Martin) deserve DVD box credits: (To Krystle regarding prenup) \\"It's just like in the Bible - You brought nothing into this world and it is certain you shall take nothing out.\\" Now that's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a real \\"Guilty Pleasure\\" is!","review":"Dynasty is what a true \\"Guilty Pleasure\\" should be like.

It was great to see Krystle Carrington and Alexis Morell Carrington Colby Dexter Colby (played wonderfully by Linda Evans and Joan Collins) go at it tooth and nail, Literally! It gets really better (in my opinion) during the 9th and final season when Alexis' cousin Sable (The great Stephanie Beacham from the Dynasty spinoff The Colbys) joins the cast. She is Alexis' equal in bitchiness and gives as good as she gets. Sable is nothing like Krystle. She makes a promise to Krystle to keep Blake safe from Alexis and boy does she!

Introspective lyrics, haunting harmonies, and Jerry C. This album represents the end of an era for a generation that refused to go quietly, and in the process, left their mark on rock music. Cantrell does a nice job of mixing up the hard-edged cuts with a couple of mellower tracks. This is the last studio album you'll ever get to hear with the soaring, shining Layne & Jerry harmonies. For that reason alone, it's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"...

Ok I will admit that the frist time that I read the Vistor I really like it. I thought that it was a fun quick read. But I just reread it and I just wanted to throw the book across the room everytime Cassie went off on her looks or lack there of in her opinion. At 24 years of age as Cassie is in the book you should realize that there is more to life then looks. And I just can't see that any guy would put up with girl so insecure about her looks as Cassie is and to pull what Cassie does in the book. But I guess in the world of Lori Wick if you are red head with freckles you have to get a guy to fall in love with you before he sees you to have any chance at happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I am a big fan of stories from this era, and I really enjoyed all four books in this series. I live in reality... I don't need a story to further dwell on that. I enjoy that Lori's books are so ideal, so perfect. I don't mind that the characters aren't \\"believeable\\" as some have criticized. That's exactly why I read them! It's fun to escape. And yet in the story there are neat twists and turns. They aren't completey predictable. I recommend this book highly. And I enjoy that the characters you meet as the series goes along are main characters in later books. That is a very neat aspect. I do recommend reading the books in order. I skipped book 2 because I didn't own it and read it last. I wish I hadn't. It isn't necessary, but I think you miss out when those characters pop up in the later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I really enjoyed this book its a great story for anyone . It is also a beautiful love story how Cassandra falls in love with a man who is blind, and they give each other more faith hope and love.

Lori Wick always writes such great stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Keys Fitness","review":"I purchased this elliptical in April of 2008. Over the last couple of weeks it began to make a loud knocking sound every time I used it. I found a broken bolt from the pedal mechanism on the floor when I investigated the problem. I made several calls to Keys to get warranty support as I am within the warranty. They have a message on their voicemail stating they are moving offices and won't be taking calls until after 11/24 (It's 12/3 today and the message still hasn't changed). They haven't responded to any of my emails. None of the local repair companies will perform warranty work on the machine so I now have to pay out of pocket to have it fixed. It will probably end up costing me upwards of $200 for something that should be covered under warranty. Ridiculous. Stay away from this company and from their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distant Trumpet","review":"I first saw Troy and Susan in the Movie \\" Lovers Must Learn \\" better know as the Rome Adventure. This movie is so honest as the chemistry between the two is so real. Distant Trumpet does not have the personal experience of Rome Adventure but still a very good action movie. Difficult to see Troy dirty and dusty away from his normal on screen characterisation. The movie is enjoyable as an action movie but the romance between Troy and Susan is not as good as Rome Adventure. It is a different movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfaction","review":"I had been looking for this video for years and I finally found it.

The writing was horrible! My friend's eight year old could've written better. Talk about confusing???? This story bounced all over the place. There was no real connection. What in tarnation was she screaming about? I read on the back of the book that the author is an editor and attended writing classes. That remains to be seen. If I were her, I wouldn't tell anyone and would take that off the back of the book. I was so turned off by the writing and story itself (being so poorly written) that on several occasions I had to put the book down. I only picked it back up to give it a chance, but it was so hard and unfortunately, a first occurred for me: I could not finish this book. Don't mean to be cruel, but unlike most authors, this writer does not display any inkling of being \\"gifted\\" in any writing manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I tend to agree with the first reviewer. I was really disappointed with the book as a whole. Thought maybe the author was in a rush to publish, rather than take the time to really develop characters. I wondered through the whole book what was the \\"Scream Within\\". Felt this was a draft rather than a finished work. Feel with a good editor, this could have been a great book. I read reviews on authors website and wondered if we had read the same book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA Noir-ish","review":"This is the first of the Eve Diamond series, a noir-lite series set in LA with reporter Eve Diamond. I'll admit that I'm getting tired of Kinsey Millhone and this offers up some detective thrills in the same genre. I like how she uses LA as a main character and is wonderful at describing the neighborhoods. Sometimes conversations are stilted but this is worth the read for a 1st effort. I'm hooked on the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everyone else seems to think.","review":"I did not think that The Jasmine Trade was very good, especially when compared to other new thrillers, like The Stone Monkey, by Jeffery Deaver. I found the main character Eve Diamond's self-conscious narration tedious, and the confidence she inspired in those she interviewed hightly unlikely. If I were a \\"parachute kid\\" who she tried to interview, I would kick her out on her [rear]. Diamond was stupid, allowing herself to be conned, drugged, and robbed at various times in the book, and the story's twists were forseeable. The thing the book had going for it was, dispite its lack of style, it had two intriguingly realistic news expose' storylines going at once, about \\"parachute kids\\" and Asian brothels. Unfortunatly, the ending was exceedingly disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that much of a page turner-A Michael Connelly wanna be","review":"I found her writing to be very elementary - and uninteresting. The most interesting part of this book is that I learned about the children - and of course that in itself was sad. However, the story line did not engage me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fair Mystery","review":"Since this was Denise Hamilton's first novel I think she did pretty well. Her character Eve Diamond was likeable and interesting. She wasn't perfect and she did do plenty of dumb things like getting drugged, losing evidence and getting romantically involved with someone she went to interview. But come on, she was a reporter not a dectective. Having the main character less then perfect made for a more interesting book. I liked the story. There isn't a lot known about the \\"Parachute Kids\\" and I found it quite educational. The murder mystery itself was done well. At least, I didn't come close to guessing who done it and was even surprised at who did. That alone made it worth reading. All in all it was a good book and I hope the author continues with a few more Eve Diamond mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.....","review":"The writing is good, the background is interesting but the main character is an ass. She manages to get almost everyone (and a animal) she comes in contact with beat up, murdered or left as a prostitute, because she can't seem to keep her mouth shut. I hate that. Nothing is resolved and she goes on her merry way without a clue its all her fault. I'll take a pass on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful guide","review":"Holladay begins by presenting the 10 major problems that Christians have with the Old Testament, and then rather than pretend that they can be easily handled or dismissed, he simply acknolwedges them and moves on to his exposition. I found this to be very honest and frankly comforting. The author does offer some solid advice on ways to deal with difficult Old Testament passages, but he never says \\"grit your teeth and believe it\\".His approach reveals a scholarly background, but this book is accessible to the layman. If you are dedicated to the inerrancy and/or verbal inspiration of the Bible, be warned -- he isn't. But he does take the Bible seriously as the record of the history of God's dealings with people.My biggest complaint is that he constantly uses phrases like \\"Jesus is remembered as having said...\\" or \\"Jeremiah understood God to be telling him....\\" Whatever the academic merits of such phrases may be, they are stylistic death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pirate movie............period!!!!!!!!!","review":"Robert Newton is THE only Blackbeard The Pirate!Linda Darnell is simply Babe-a-licious.It was fun to see Granny(Irene Ryan) getting stewed,I was waiting for Uncle Jed to take the bottle of rum away from her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul weather off the port bow, Mateys!","review":"I have the latest \\"Desert Island Films\\" 2011 release of this movie.

Sometimes the image is sharp and clear, sometimes it looks out of focus. However, it is the only current DVD available. There are no chapters, no menu, you just put the DVD in and it plays. It even cuts off the closing scene prematurely.I was not favorably impressed by the script, acting, or direction of this film. Newton hams it up, but can't save this sinking ship.There are many fine sea yarns on film, but this is not one of them. Despite its detractors, I foundCutthroat Islandto be vastly superior to this bilge."},{"rating":"2","title":"For kiplomaniacs","review":"There aren't many public school novels being written and read these days.

But this was like one of the great Hollywood films in the way it captured the majesty and adventure of the West, with humor and satire sprinkled throughout. In 1849, Flashy participates in the Gold Rush; 27 years later, he returns in time to become the sole white survivor of Custer's Last Stand. The greatest chase of the entire Flashman series occurs about halfway through, with a murderous Apache war party pursuing Sir Harry across the New Mexican desert.

She can produce, write arrange and sing! She is the total package. Although I didn't really care for the dated sound of the fast songs as much, the slow songs more than made up for them. Classics like Angel and Hello are worth the price of the CD alone! I have all of her CDs. Her writing and music seemed to get better with each album. I wish she would produce some more music. Her voice is truly missed in what the music industry is passing off as R&B these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SHARP debut from Angela Winbush!","review":"Angela Winbush's solo debut SHARP, is indeed a sharp piece of work. One half of the Rene & Angela duo, Ms. Winbush is an accomplished writer, producer, arranger, and an excellent vocalist. Her writing is R&B at it's best. Her later work with The Isley Brothers will prove that. On this excellent debut, the stand outs are the masterful ballads. On first listen, you'll be transfixed with the gut-wrenching ballads on the \\"Quiet Storm Side.\\" You Had A Good Girl, No One Has Cared (Like You), Hello Beloved, and the hit, Angel, provide the steam needed for any romantic evening. Though the funky cuts on the \\"Slammin' Side\\" sound dated, Sensual Lover still holds up as a smooth R&B jewel. The other cuts were very good indeed for their time. This is a worthy debut from a lady as talented as they come. She's proven this on her two susequent releases as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No so impressed","review":"I'd seen some good reviews for this album so I bought it but I found it tedious, predictable and unoriginal.

It is filled with lively cheerful music and adorable characters that she even likes to pretend to be when not on the computer sometimes. She was about 2 1/2 when we got it and it was just about right. It is mainly filled with letter recognition games in the form of matching. It is not a great brain teaser but it does give them an objective to work their way through. They have to find out who left their juice in the caboose through process of elimination. They get a clipboard with a passenger list that they can even print out along with a magnifying glass and a thinking hat. The final reward is slow in coming and it can lose their interest along the way. But it saves the game for you and you can spend days acheiving it if you like. They also make a video tape that mimics the game and is a great motivator to complete the game and see the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning ABC's!","review":"My 3 1/2 year old loves this software.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good fantasy novel, and if you haven't read any of his other books in this series, I would recommend that you start with the first, Rules of Ascension.

This function allows you to set a schedule of time specific users can have access to the internet. The function works great.

Best I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contour on the pads makes it seamless!","review":"I first tried Lansinoh and then the Medela pads. My complaints on those are that they don't stick as well and the \\"forced\\" contouring makes it feel bumpy.

Great absorbency too."},{"rating":"2","title":"best i have tried","review":"I have tried many different types of pads (Advent, Simplisse, Lansonih to name a few) and these are by far the best. They do a great job of keeping you dry, while the others could not and leaks occurred. They are comfortable and not too large at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product when arrives intact...","review":"Love the product, but was quite unimpressed when it arrived in a shipping envelope all beat up with the pads full of packing lint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"These have been a lifesaver for my wife. She's been starting her journey as a nursing mom, and learning the ins an outs of breast feeding. Thankfully one of her friends recommended these, and they've been a real help as she deals with full breasts, sore nipples, and keeping her clothing dry. The nipple shape, while potentially embarrassing to the sensitive, is very purposeful--it protects sore nipples from chaffing caused by a normal cup shape. These are the only pads my wife can wear comfortably, and she's very grateful that they work as well as they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I am a first time Mom and had no clue what a sprinkler system I was going to end up with in my bra after having a baby. These nursing pads are wonderful! They come with just a little bit of adhesive on the back which keeps them in place and they keep your clothes completely dry. I never had any irritation from breast feeding and I think that part of that was due to the quality of these nursing pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"the BEST nursing pads!","review":"These are the only nursing pads I've tried that claim to be contoured and are *really* contoured--that is, they curve around the natural curve of your breast. They are thick and soft and extremely comfortable, and they look decent under clothing. In short, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these for day use","review":"I have tried several brands and these are my favorite during the day.

After only 6 weeks the adaptor started hissing while plugged in, stopped powering my notebook, got dangerously hot, and the blue LED starting blinking on and off.

I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this one","review":"The 22 Super Cities travel videos, of which this is one, all appear to follow the same general format-30 minutes of low-level aerial views alternating with ground-level shots of various sights and local people, all to convey a sense of the ambience of the city. That approach works well where, as with Vienna and St. Petersburg, the city offers a finite number of attractions, many of which are outdoors.It does not, however, work with London. There is simply so much to do and see there that it cannot be covered quickly. Experienced travelers know this, and will limit themselves to a few attractions on each visit.If possible, try to find a video or a book that focuses on the particular aspects of the city that interest you. For those interested in walking tours, \\"LononWalks\\" (out-of-print but available from used book dealers) is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming show","review":"Barbara Cook is WONDERFUL in this forgotten gem by Bock & Harnick which has only been rediscovered in the last several years thanks to a Broadway & London revival. Miss Cook considers this one of her favorites too, because she almost always performs songs from it in her cabaret and touring act. I was lucky enough to see the London revival in the gorgeous Savoy Theater. I have all 4 cast cds (orig. 1963 cast, London 1964 cast, 1990s B-way revival & 1990s London revival), but I have a soft spot for this particular recording, even tho Barbara Baxley as Illona CANNOT SING. This recording is the only one that has the sweet but sad song \\"Tango Tragique\\" complete with clever lyrics. Future productions cut the song but kept the music as background in the cafe scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST!","review":"This CD contains the score to (arguably) the best score of the 60s, and certainly the last/best score of the Golden Age of Musicals. It also contains the most incredible performance I have ever seen in a Broadway musical. One only has to hear Barbara Cook's coda to \\"Tango Tragique\\" or her plaintive \\"Will He Like Me\\" to know why she is a legend. This is also a perfect example of a score in which the lyrics reveal characterizations, advance plot and are sumptuously gorgeous. The singing-acting of Ms. Cook, Jack Cassidy and the others is far superior to all the other versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel","review":"My all-time favorite musical, with my all-time favorite musical theater performer, Barbara Cook, in the unforgettable role of Amalia Balash. Every song is a gem, though the musical should be seen on stage to fully appreciate that this is so. Though Barbara Baxley's singing takes a little getting used to, everything else about this CD is divine, and if you can listen to Cook singing \\"Dear Friend\\", \\"Will He Like Me\\" and \\"Ice Cream\\" without melting into a pile of goo, you have no heart. The numerous other songs (\\"She Loves Me\\", \\"Try Me\\", \\"Days Gone By\\", \\"A Trip to the Library\\", \\"Romantic Atmosphere\\", -- the whole score!) are also wonderful, not an even slightly mediocre song in the bunch. A must-have for any fan of musical theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Musical!","review":"SHE LOVES ME is a perfect little gem of a musical - Every song is delightful, and the cast couldn't be better. It is, of course, an original musical treatment of the old play which became the films THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and (more recently) the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan YOU'VE GOT MAIL. This is one I never tire of listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love \\"She Loves Me\\"!","review":"Having just seen a wonderful local production of this revival, we wanted to hear the score again. The Broadway cast is great, too. While it fits the play perfectly, the music grows as an independent joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Loves Me - GREAT","review":"I absolutely love this soundtrack. My husband and I went to a local presentation of this play. Super cute!!!! I didn't know anything about it and had never heard of it before....so I thought. This play is the basis for the movie \\"You've Got Mail\\". The songs are really funny and cute. My favorite one is \\"Perspective\\". Very lighthearted! Perfect for playing around Thanksgiving and Christmas because the setting begins in late summer and ends at New Year's."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"It's hard to believe that this musical belongs to the same creators of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. Whereas in FIDDLER there is not even one bad song, this one's got them all. The singing is very good but the songs are quite unappealing and almost impossible to follow since melody is scarce and hard to catch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nike Blade Watch - Not Designed to last","review":"I have owned this Nike Blade watch model WC0037 for 7 months. It is a very neat watch. Unfortunately it broke and I don't know how. One evening I remove it from my wrist and notice the black bubber wrist band had separated from the body at the rear battery cover. The entire rubber/plastic hinge had cracked. This wrist band is not replaceable. I wore this watch daily to my office job. A sports watch should be made rugged. This one is not. Lesson learned is to buy a watch which has a standard replacable wrist band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.","review":"This and the DVD had terrible quality and the performance itself was no good either. The only reason I bought this garbage was becasue the origional Sabbath had 2-3 songs present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy - Great Live Album","review":"This is a two disc live album from Ozzy and company recorded on the \\"No More Tears\\" tour in 1991 / 1992. His band at the time consisted of Zack Wilde, Randy Castillo, Michael Inez and Kevin Jones. Ozzy has done numerous live albums over the years, and I think this one ranks up there with his best ones. At the time this tour was billed as Ozzy's \\"farewell\\" gig. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but he is still out there on the road today. Overall this album is great. Pretty much every Ozzy classic you could want is here along with several Sabbath tunes. Ozzy is in fine voice throughout the whole thing, and Zak Wylde is a maniac on guitar. The energy is high and the band smoking through the whole set. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE LIVE DOUBLE ALBUM !","review":"\\"Live and loud\\" it's one of my favorites albums, because the album contains all the power of Ozzy's music. The drums are thunderous, Zack plays like Randy Rhoads, the bass sounds incredible and Ozzy's voice sound powerfull. \\"Mr. Crowley\\" sounds noizy, specially the keyboards, \\"Miracle man\\" it's loudest song in the album, and of course, all the classic tracks of Mr. Osbourne sounds great: \\"Crazy train\\", \\"I don't know\\",\\"Flying high again\\", \\"Bark at the moon\\", \\"Suicide solution\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Goodbye to romance\\" and \\"I don't want to change the wold\\". If you like the good heavy metal concerts, buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I felt the other reviewer was absolutely correct in his/her assessment of this book. I, too, noticed the inaccuracies (the author also has Prince Albert's mother divorcing his father--highly unlikely in the atmosphere of the time) and his use of the English language was faulty. It was difficult at times to figure out to whom he was referring in his use of pronouns, and some words he used in a way that was neither correct nor standard usage.The author had a disconcerting habit of making jumps in the timeline (he marries and buries Edward VII and then goes on to describe his life and eating habits.) Rather confusing!Two stars is actually being rather generous. There are better sources out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Egyptian Classic","review":"This classic movie has been wonderfully transferred to DVD. The quality of the picture and sound is superb, and the subs titles are noticeable but not terribly intrusive. I give this two thumbs up"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taste for Death","review":"P D James wrote an excellent detailed book. Her depth of characters and their use to develop related themes such a male mid life crisis and choice of career is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not James at her best by any means","review":"This marked a low point in James's mysteries: her obsession with Victorian architecture seems of much greater interest to her than the characters (Sir Paul not only lives in a Soane mansion but he is murdered in an architecturally significant church), and the suspects are all so universally loathsome you wind up not caring who did it in the end. James seems even to take special relish in Lady Ursula's hateful snobbishness and misanthropy. A bad place to start with the Adam Dagliesh novels, when there are so many finer earlier ones (DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS) and even later ones (A CERTAIN JUSTICE)."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO MANY WORDS","review":"P.D. James is clearly a very knowledgable writer, and thus had a very clear idea of the innerworkings of the British legal/criminal justice system. Her character, Adam Dalgliesh, was a major operative within the system. He was very delightful-almost like Lord Peter Wimsey from Dorothy L. Sayers' series featuring him. What impressed me about him is his willingness to accept a woman, Kate Miskin, on his investigative team. He was always very respectful of her, and commented on her intelligence. The only thing I did not enjoy about the book were its lengthy descriptions about everything. I know that description is important, but do we really need to know every gory detail about somebody's outfit or bedroom if it doesn't pertain to the mystery? Overall, though, I enjoyed this book very much. It allowed me to play along, which is something I enjoy doing when I read mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taste For Great Detail","review":"This is another in the Adam Dalgliesh series by Ms. James in the United Kingdom. An elderly woman & a young boy stumble across a double murder in a small Vestry of a church. One, an important person Dalgliesh knows; the other a tramp.Ms. James is an excellent author when sticking to details & descriptions. She develops characters well. She doesn't need to get into a lot of gore & violence in her descriptions. The reader can clearly see it through her writing.The book is very well done. I found the tramp's murder somewhat passe. I was a bit bothered and felt the book leaned toward social classes since almost nothing was mentioned of the tramp's untimely demise. If this was the premise, why include his character at all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grim mystery","review":"'A Taste for Death' is another fine effort from PD James. The story moves at a leisurely pace as James introduces many characters related to the mystery. The background and lives of victims, suspects, police, witnesses are all developed by James, and and pretty much everyone is miserable. It's a good book but it is almost relentlessly downbeat. In the end the mystery is solved but the reader doesn't feel that much better for it: the victims are still dead, and the living return to their drab and depressing lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love PD","review":"I never get tired of the live radio broadcasts. There is nothing like a good mystery, and the price was right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivery Slow!","review":"I placed my order on Jan. 9 and received the book Feb. 1. This is not a newly released book so I assumed that the delivery time frame was generous. I could have gone to my local book store and have had the book read twice! I have ordered many new books from Amazon with happy results. Buying this new yet older paperback edition was not a good experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I am enjoying the books by PD James enormously. She is a fantastic writer. Have not read any that I did not find fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I am a great fan of P.D.

Dick Morris, Clinton's political advisor during Berger's tenure in the White House, singles out Berger for particular scorn in a recent Wall Street Journal essay, claiming that Berger \\"seemed to work overtime at opposing tough measures against terror.\\"Put another way, asking Sandy Berger to explain how 9/11 happened is like asking Neville Chamberlain to explain the origins of Nazi aggression."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we may have thought we knew, we didn't.","review":"Many would and do say that it is easy to see how this could happen, meaning the attacks were in fact low down and low tech, hitting us at our vulnerable spot, our freedom. The book does in fact have evidense of being put together to quickly here and there, but for the most part there is new information and up to date background info on the terrorists I did not know. The book is not just how did this happen, there is considerable info here from various trusted sources that has been upgraded from their past writes. Another book similar not only mentions \\"how this\\" but predicted it would happen and goes into detail, even predicting precise accounts. I strongly recommend Karl Mark Maddox, a surprising paper back titled SB 1 or God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to classify","review":"I usually listen to classical music, so this CD was a big departure from my usual programming, but I like what this group does.Swing out Sister is almost like listening to a big band with a female singer- albeit a band of electronic instruments.I particularly enjoy Ms. Drewry's bell-like voice, and she seems to be the anchor around which the group pivots.Some drawbacks. Often the lyrics are tailored to rhyme, not to make sense, and Ms. Drewry doesn't have much range.The remixes on this CD are uneven. Some of them are fun and bright, and the others are not. When the group is having fun with a piece, you can tell it. When they are going through the motions it's obvious too.So what if it's not Wagner?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz pop wonder of late 80's VH1 culture","review":"I remember first hearing \\"Breakout\\" while watching VH1 in my parent's bedroom back in 1988. I was 14 at the time and a big fan of the Polish diva Basia. I was waiting to try to catch the \\"New Day For You\\" video when I saw this. Wow! It was so smooth and happy and upbeat. I was hooked.

However, after that you quickly find yourself becoming extremely nauseaous from just listening to these over-produced tunes. You will soon want to quickly exorcise this CD from your CD collection AND your collective memory! That said, I still highly recommend Kaleidoscope World where the songs (save only a few) represent superb pop-craft that hold up to repeated listenings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great R&B!","review":"Swing Out Sister are probably the only British R&B musicians in the world. They were influenced by the late Marvin Gaye and other artists who recorded for the Detroit-based Motown label. If you listen to SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD from 1997's SHAPES AND PATTERNS and AM I THE SAME GIRL? from 1992,you could hear the MG sound. The first hit from this album is BREAKOUT which has great saxophones. TWILIGHT WORLD,the only other hit(at least in the USA) is pretty cool. Many of these songs were written by SOS members Corinne Drewery and Andy Connell. Drewery is the lead vocalist and Connell is the keyboardist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the free SAP help instead","review":"This is basically a poor rewrite of the on-line SAP documentation.

I bought a couple of these books when they were new, I was new in SAP, and I did not know better. I believe the are a direct rewrite of the help files, with less value. Recommended under no circumstances ever.If you are looking for an overview, search around for SAP PDF files called \\"Functions in Detail\\". These were internally produced, about 100-150 pp, and had a really good conceptual top-down look at a particular functional area of SAP. Even though they are years out of date, the core information is just as valuable as it originally was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough description","review":"The book is not so informative who would like to understand the detailed functions of SAP PP module.

This large volume (864 pages) covers a broad range of topics that will help the seasoned manager refresh his or her memory and provide the beginner with a well-rounded set of skills. It is a well-written book which contains numerous color illustrations and graphics. It is, also an easy and enjoyable read and one of the best books that I have read on this subject.

Quite a challenge and not surprisingly this book does not succeed.The information given will be so obvious for most that reading this book is a waste of time. As a reference this book will not be of much use either, since no subject is covered in any depth.The tone and language leave much to be desired. True, the lack of jargon must be applauded, but this book has nothing of substance to replace it with. Some of the advice is simply laughable, such as: - \\"Don't keep sweets in the house\\" - \\"Do not be belligerent, it is counterproductive\\" - \\"Do not make major decisions too quickly\\".This book tries to achieve too much in too little space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read reference!","review":"Great easy to read reference for anyone trying to increase their knowledge on these essential topics!

And what he said about this CD in the book is true: It's a departure for him. He has an orchestra behind him - violins and the whole works - and there's a killer sax solo, too.

You get ONE, count IT, ONE popular aria on each disc, so that to get 4 or 5 recognizable songs to perform for friends, you have to spend between $100.00 to $150.00 ! This is OUTRAGEOUS gouging of the consumer. Tell you what; How about putting 1.Una furtiva lagrima-2. La donna e mobile-3. M'appari tutt' d'amor-4. Vesti la Giubba-5. Recondita armonia-6. Che gelida manina and 7. Nessun Dorma on one C.D. for $39.99 and let the die-hards who must have all pay for the more obscure tracks? Frankly, I am insulted in the marketers presumption, unless someone is interested in only one or two tracks, this set is DEFINITELY geared to GOUGE the consumer! SHUFFLE THE CARDS AND TRY AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS HAIRDRYER IS VERY DANGEROUS TO USE!!!!","review":"I bought this a little over 1 year ago. It started to back fire about two months ago. Brookstone refuses to exchange, repair or refund it. I recommend against purchasing this product. Also, Brookstone does not have very good customer service since I was initially told, when I called two months ago, that they would replace it and would send out a pre-paid shipping label. However, two months have passed and nothing happened. When I called again, they simply said that they cannot do anything for me and it is beyond their warranty period.

I wonder if I need to contact my bank, to dispute. It shouldn't take this long for a refund back to my card. What I am suppose to do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, well...it was fun for a time","review":"I checked this out of the library and was completely enjoying it. Never seen such a hysterical (funny) movie in my life...then I realized it was supposed to be non-fiction.Non-fiction? Well still hysterical just in the \\"crazy\\" connotation of the adjective.Where do people get the money to make such delusional claptrap--OH! The multinational corporations and their CEOs who are ACTUALLY bringing about the destruction of the country and want to deflect blame. Not that this could have cost much to make.Check it out of your library and play it as a drinking game--just don't make the rule \\"Drink when a conservative wing-nut speaks\\" or you'll be blotto fifteen minutes in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall of the Republic CD","review":"The premise is the existance of a shadow one-world government pulling the strings in Washington, making Republicans and Democrats irrelivant, both being controlled by their puppet masters. The premise is potentially valid in terms of \\"The New World Order\\" which has been touted since the G.H.W. Bush administration. Today we have an Administration focused on \\"Progressive\\" objectives that could well meld into part of a Global Power Structure based on the European Union model. Read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, and see how her experience with the Soviet Revolution of the early 20th Century could be the model for the \\"One World Government\\" postulated in Fall of the Republic in the 21st Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Freaked Out Conspiracy Theories","review":"Alex Jones is getting better at editing his films and cutting 30 second clips of people talking, but the film is a gross representation of the truth.

It has been the last thirty years of Reaganomics which gave corporations the real power to take over of America, destroying the middle class, the unions, and the American worker.

Alex Jones is a Moron!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable what some consider \\"the Trugth\\" UGH!","review":"Title says it all.

I am not sure, it is true or not. But I am sure it is difficult to believe. Criticizing over the past is acceptable, but criticizing over Obama is way too soon, right now. I agree with Alex when he said, turning the tv off two hour or so, getting to know the neighbor and spending quality time with family and your love one. If you are a fan of weird conspiracy theory, you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD","review":"I really enjoyed this CD. I'm not really big on county or bluegrass but this CD pulls it off in a really nice subtle way while retaining the feel of the traditional melodies. Also, Mare Winningham has a really beautiful voice- very melodic and calming. Her voice fits really well here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refuge Rock not worth the time","review":"I have recently listened to this CD without knowing it was all religious music in Hebrew. There are some songs in english but they are few & far between. Mare Winninghams voice is still great but this is another genre for her & I don't know that it suits her well. I'm not impressed w/this CD's content or orchestration (production)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rides of the borrowed","review":"2 1/2The once bludgeoning metal band continued opting down a well established path of pop-rock accessibility, offering a solid, if quite unnecessary EP which often borrows direct structural elements heard in Jupiter & Antenna, to less distinct success."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"This is an awesome DVD the only bad part is that the title song is not there they just right the names its like having friends but without the theme song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"I am a Party of Five fan and loved the first season so I naturally pre-ordered the DVD.Its great to see these episodes again and the special features are interesting to watch. The DVD quality is amazing.Not sure i'd buy season 3 to 6 if they came out - I didn't enjoy them much after season 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I am so glad they released this. I hear they are releasing season 2 in Novemeber 2004! I love it! I cant wait to see Jennifer love Hewitt in season two.Also..the theme song is on the dvd...it just dosent start until you watch disk 2 and on.

How can they release as much rubbish as they do on dvd these days without releasing ALL of the party of five series'. It must be to do with the fact the 1st series has not sold as well as expected, but I can't believe that.Who are these people that refuse their release, and where do they live?ITS JUST RUDE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I do?","review":"I have never taken the time to write a review for anything that I have purchased (on Amazon or anywhere else). It is only b/c PO5 means so much to me that I felt compelled. I cannot tell you how wonderful it was to find out that PO5 Season 1 was going to be available. I purchased it the day it was released and was anxious to buy all the rest of the seasons. Now I hear they aren't going to release any more (indefinitely postponed). What a let down!! I have read through most of the reviews and I have got to say, it is wonderful to know that I am not alone in my pursuit of, or my love for, the Salingers. My question is...does anyone know how to get Columbia Tristar to reconsider? Is there another website, message board, e-mail or address to which I could write, add my name to a petition, and/or voice my request?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theme song","review":"I just wanted to post to correct the person who wrote about the theme song.
