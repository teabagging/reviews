She lives in Manhattan and one day she finds that her next door neighbor has been hit on the head and is unconcious in her apartment. While her neighbor, Helen, is in a coma at the hospital, Mel takes up the responsibility for Helen's animals, which she clearly does NOT have to do. Then she contacts Helen's famous photographer nephew. Instead of the nephew, someone posing as the nephew shows up to take care of the animals.This whole book is written through emails, which gets EXTREMELY irritating to read.Who actually emails anyone this much? PUH-LEEZ. This book is dumb and just not written well.All of Cabot's other books are great. NOT this one.~Atalanta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, silly, a waste of time","review":"The Boy Next Door is just another chick-lit novel, a genre I am not a fan of, but I wanted to read something light and romantic for a change. The only thing that separates this book from many, many other similar novels is that it's written entirely as emails sent between the main characters. It is an annoying gimmick, but the author does a fair job of making it work, despite the fact that most people would (hopefully) never dish about their sex life using their company email address. This book is completely predictable and pretty much a complete waste of time. Cabot should stick to writing Young Adult novels. If you want a QUALITY romantic read, I recommend either Bridget Jones Diary or Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redheads Rise to Good-looking Rich Guys Standards","review":"This book is one of the best Meg Cabot books I have read in a while. Her main character, Mel Fuller, a redhead is a genuine girl who needs a boyfriend badly. Then one day, her luck changes, when her neighbor has to go to the hospital after getting attacked. And she has to take care of her pets until the neighbor's nephew comes. The neighbor's nephew comes but as a photographer Mel finds him a little odd. Soon though, they are spending a lot of time together, falling in love. Through the books e-mails you hear from a person named John Trent who's family and friends comment on the details of the novel. You also learn of the nephew, Max Friedlander's dirty little secret. Its a bit of romantic comedy mixed with mystery, that suits every teenage girl and any woman. Meg Cabot brings her winning Princess Diaries style to this wonderful beach book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Compulsive Read","review":"This book exceeds my expectations. It's hilarious and truly fast-paced, made even more so by its e-mail format. What I love most about the book, though, is how Meg Cabot succeeds in creating highly likeable characters, including the dumb supermodel Vivica and the formidable matriarch Mim, even the office bimbo Dolly Vargas. By the end of the book, you've fallen in love with every single one of them, including the array of quirky officemates, who giddily chip in every once in a while to gossip about the heroine. Thoroughly fun and more than enjoyable--read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great Story!","review":"I have never read a book like this.

I was not by any means disappointed. The boy next door is easily one of the cutest books you will read. To be honest without sounding like a geek, I thought that the concept of using emails throughout the entire book was such a creative and innovative idea. I never really realized how expressive people are in their emails until now. Each character that Cabot used was so distinct, and even quirky at times. I can honestly say that I was laughing out loud in some points of the book. The ending was....oh so perfect. You begin to feel as though the characters are your close personal friends. The (description of) love scenes are not obscene, they are just appropriate. The ending was perfect. It was like apple pie at the end of thanksgiving. Exactly what it needed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless no brainer--cute at first--then annoying","review":"I really enjoyed reading this when I first began because it was written in \\"email\\" format between all the main and supporting characters. It began as a fast, couldn't-put-it-down read and then it just got to the point where the supporting characters were just annoying, nosy and didn't give me a reason to care for the storyline. While it was unique to formulate the story in email form, the length and details of the email conversations (most of the time took place at the characters' place of employment) were at times ridiculously long and too detailed-no one usually has that much time to write emails like that unless they really want to jeopardize their job standing! The motives for the actions between the two main characters at times made no sense---it was very drawn out. But if you like no brianer, romance novels then try it out.

I am so tired of these gospel artists making music as a career and not for ministry.

It has already been de-installed and replaced with a Water Pic. Don't waste you money or time. With a little thought to the nozzle construction, this could have been a pretty shower head that gives a good shower.

Gender/Racial stereotypes are the driving force behind the humor and, as usual, these don't add a whole lot of value to the movie.

As many have mentioned, it would appear that there are videos to the hits on this DVD but instead you have a random clips sandwiched between the same dang black&white; cut scene throughout featuring about 3 seconds of Miss Independant.It's good to know that Kel hasn't let the glam of the spotlight swell her smalltown head but I get enough of this nerdy babble in my own burg.Then again, maybe the target audience consists of tweens and teens who can't wait to grow up and go camping and bowling without parental supervision.

Good book, must have for any comic fan.The only bad thing is I hate the way Wally is drawn, even if he has matured and what not he doesn't need to be like every other muscle bound hero, that and Wally doesn't crack one joke during the entire thing?

Guillaume never indicates his external quotations clearly, flanking them with parenthesis instead of setting them apart from the main body text, and preceeding them with a \\"T\\" which is vigorously employed but never explained. A lay muslim can fall in the trap and swallow truth with polytheistic fiction and unwittingly accept the tale as a definitive part of Ibn Ishaq's serious historical work.The sad part is that this book has been published continously in muslim countries since 1967"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Primary Resource","review":"This book is a translation Ibn Ishaq's SIRAT RASUL ALLAH, the original version of which has been lost to history. A. Guillaume translated an abridged edition by Ibn Hisham for his translation. THE LIFE OF MUHAMMAD is the result.The book is not in the form of an integrated narrative. Instead it's a series of stories, poems, accounts, recollections and other scraps of information collected by Ibn Ishaq bearing on the Prophet and his life and times.Don't plan on sitting down and reading this cover to cover. It's a scrapbook of information. To his credit, Ibn Ishaq attributes the bits and pieces of information he collects. In that sense, he's trying to do what professional historians still try to do, reconstruct the past and preserve it as best he can.And, he did a good job. There's a huge amount of information preserved in THE LIFE OF MUHAMMAD. If you're interested in learning more about Muhammad, you'll appreciate this book. I like it and gave it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of time","review":"The will to power; it is so inaccurate to reality it isn't even worth reading.Unfortunately, like \\"The will to power\\", Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah has taken on a cancerous life of its own with devotee's quoting it as the 'genuine biography' ignoring that the reliability of Ibn Ishaq so useless that it has absolutely no value what so ever.If you want a good biography - best to give something else a try. Hans Küng does a fair representation of Muhammad in his book, \\"Islam: Past, Present and Future\\" (Ignore the rabid anti-Islam Christian nuts who have made comments Amazon page)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classical work but not history","review":"This is a book mostly for the layman who is not fussed about getting the facts right but who just wants to enjoy a good story. The work is centuries old and so it is better to read a more critical work on Muhammad (if such a book exists at the moment) before reading this book. This is because it is written by a devout Muslim and it would be fair to presume that it is concerned mostly with religious issues then the historical truth (like trying to learn about the Historical Jesus from the Gospels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Unfortunate","review":"It seems i must agree a hundred percent , if not more, with our good friend mrashdan_mradzi who has written his long review on this book.

The text is flowery, repetitive, and much of the time so convoluted that after perusing a section one is left scratching one's head and asking, \\"What did he say?\\". So be prepared for a lot of very close reading and rereading.That said, I would think this book makes a very good companion to The Koran.One final caution: If you think Islam is the religion of peace, you may be disillusioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this before reading the Koran or Hadith","review":"This book does far more than provided a detailed biography of the Prophet Mohammad, it also provides the historical context by which you can read the Koran. I actually wished I read this book before I read the Koran. It would have made much more sense.When I first read the Koran, I literally got a headache. To me, it seemed to be a jumbled mess of unrelated chapters. I later found out that it actually was. For some odd reason, the Koran is not arranged chronologically, which makes it very difficult to read. This book actually linearized everything for me, so I indirectly got an idea of how the Koran should have been arranged.This, however, is not a book for the faint of heart; it is extremely vast. I actually wasn't able to finish it.

I recently bought the Kindle version though, and it is seriously almost painful to read. Whole words are missing, words and phrases are truncated, descriptive verbs are simply not there... you have to GUESS at what the author meant in that phrase in that particular position in the storyline.

It's an exercise in English syntax just to guess what the story should be at times.This is a terrific book, and a shameful example of an e-book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"While admitting its shortcomings, I was a fan of the Chtorr series. I decided to see what else Mr. Gerrold has to offer.The sci-fi elements of the book are excellent. The faster than light travel is explained in an especially imaginative way and the ships are described in detail.Unfortunately, I must agree with some of the other readers in that the characters are not multifaceted in any way. Some characters include the engineer (who really wants to be Scotty from Star Trek), Brik (Worf from ST:TNG), and \\"the Bad Guys\\" (any of the evil Klingons).While I really wanted to like this story, I found myself distracted by the cliches. Characters were introduced and killed (much like the random guy on the away teams) and the other characters would say \\"Oh, well\\" *shrug*.

Many, many, many sentences are incomplete or missing words.\\"I'm enjoying the story. But as the previous commenter noted.. many, MANY sentences are truncated, leaving the reader to infer what the author wrote. An example, \\"We did an exemplary job, we brought back intelligence that no one else has ever accomplished. It's wrong to punish You not only deny us, but you deny the fleet the benefit of a crew has proven itself under fire.\\"Some chapters are in pristine condition, but many of them are full of incomplete text.

We found it lacked strength in characterization, believability in character motivations, and especially did not suspend our disbelief with the plot line. The main villain is a superhuman cannibal (tired) named Cinnabun, or something, that melodramatically sneers every line. The plot just doesn't cut it with everyone unfairly blaming the crew of the last surviving starship in a space massacre for something ridiculous. The book is a fast read, thankfully, but unsatisfying.

A truely miracleous event that tugs at one's heart-strings, makes you mad, brings you to tears, and certainly won't leave you unaffected once you've read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage and determination held this family together.","review":"Mr. Wortman writes in a simply format to allow the reader an opportunity to fully grasped the danger of the situation without being distracted by flowery words. The courage this family protrayed and the lesson in determination for survival is the reason I have read and re-read this book over a dozen times. The majastic of the sea and of the coast of Alaska makes this a unforgetable backdrop to an adventure of a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Because I love the musical, I paid the higher price for this album to get more songs.

Real Zen.","review":"Very 'readable' book. Gentle autobiography from Phil Jackson, coach of the repeat three-peat Chicago Bulls, and now the championship LA Lakers. From Pentecostal parents to playing with Bill Bradley to coaching in San Juan to Michael Jordan and basketball history; Phil takes us on a journey of his life and mindful basketball. It's a thoughtful mix of Eastern and Native American philosophies, woven into what others make into the win-or-die world of pro sports. Some commentators laugh at the \`Zen Master' and say with Jordan any team can win games. But here you learn the depth of thought and real Zen behind the label, and reevaluate the \`big man' label. Worth reading twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing book","review":"It wasnt a surprise for me that this book will be an amazing one!!If you need leasson for the good lidership I recomended to you!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really corporate teamwork:","review":"I've used this multiple times as a foundation for building better corporate teams and getting talented people working together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book on Management in Any Arena","review":"I bought this book to help with management style, and even though I'm not a coach of any sport I found inspiration from Phil. It's easy to trust his word when he's won so many championships. There must be something to his thoughts, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre Book","review":"If I was looking for a book on Meditating, Zen, etc...I would have simply bought a book on those items. Being a North Dakota native I would much rather read a book on Roger Maris anyday.It wasn't a terrible book, but it wasnt great either. The only thing that kept me interested was how MJ and Scottie took to Phil's different philosophies. I haven' read any of his other books, but maybe they are a little better. I would highly recommend reading Rick Majerus' \\"Like on a Napkin\\" over this \\"overhyped\\" book. I guess if you are into \\"spiritual\\" type stuff you may enjoy the book. Phil has definetly been pretty darn succesful so I guess he's doing something right!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL LAUGH RIOT (Unintentionally)","review":"Sheer new age nonsense. Don't waste your time. I could pull quotes out of it all day long that would make you laugh out loud, and I'm talking about quotes where Jackson is dead serious. If he is what passes for an intellectual in the NBA, then the NBA is in trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!","review":"I always knew there was someone who had a truly selfless coaching philosophy and I am glad he wrote a book. There is hope for the corporate world.This book captures the essence of Phil Jackson.I think this book is a must read for anyone who manages people and thinks you must brow beat performance out of them. If you have a manager like that, send him/her a copy.I felt totally at peace while reading this book. This book is a very easy read and I enjoyed it throughly. I am certain you will enjoy it too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Sacred Hoops is a verry good book. It is not just for sportsfans, but for anyone who wants to read a good book. I thought it was a verry goog book, not just about the game of basketball, but about life. The book follows Phil Jackson in his march into the playoffs. One bad thing about this book was it had some big words in it. I think that anyone who enjoys sports or life in general should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being fully present","review":"Phil Jackson finds order in chaos. His concept of being \\"fully present\\" is a gem. This book is an easy read (I did it in one sitting) full of nuggets of wisdom. Phil is obviously well read and shares his insight in a thought provoking manner. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I loved this book by Phil Jackson. I picked it up for a reading project thinking I would not enjoy it, only read half of it, then do the project. But it was just the opposite, I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed learning how Phil got to be such a good coach. I loved the spirtual lessons that Phil teaches and how he incorporated Native American believes in his lessons to help his team work and play as a team. I recommend this book to players, coaches, and anyone that wants to enjoy a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole can be greater than the sum of the parts.","review":"In today's me world, an attitude by no means limited to atheletics (witness the runaway salaries of today's CEOs), examples of people who grasp that the most effective path to strength is the one that leads through community are precious and too rare. Mr. Jackson allows us to follow the evolution of the Bulls from a group of very talented individuals into a team in the best sense of the word. There are lessons galore of all shapes and sizes, but the one that I most appreciated is that the pursuit of excellence can be very successful without sacrificing honor, trust and commitment to something outside of ourselves. And make no mistake, Mr. Jackson is a winner of the first order. Sacred Hoops should be mandatory reading for every high school athelete in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeffrey Smart : Paintings of the '70s and '80s","review":"Jeffrey is a is genius.Let me know when you have it in stockcheersnick"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is so great about this book?","review":"I can't imagine what the other reviewers like so much about this book. I was so glad when I finally finished it. I had no idea what it would be about and didn't know anything about Jonathan Carroll. This book was a complete waste of time. It's silly, boring, and meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre doesn't even describe it","review":"One of the most strange books I have ever read. Carroll jumps from one page to the next just making it up as he goes along.Unecessary Foul Language is used throughout the book. Real people do Not speak this way.The one thing that kept me reading is, the author really has a way with words. Beautifully written, save the 100s of \\"F\\" words throughout.When I was finished, I threw it in the trash. Didn't even bother to sell it on eBay. Too bad, Jonathan Carroll seems to have promise, if he can clean up his potty mouthed characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary vulgarity","review":"I was intrigued by the online reviews about this much anticipated title and I was very excited to order this book for my husband. The book offers a thrilling plot if you like psychological thrillers. However, upon reading the first chapter I realized how much Carrol uses harsh obsenities that could be deleted altogether without jeapordizing the quality and likablity of the novel. I was very dissappointed about this unnecessary language and it goes against Christian integrity as well as any good moral standard. Carrol offers a very interesting and novel, however I feel that Carrol will lose many prospective customers because of this unnecessary language."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do You Row in a Wooden Sea?","review":"The question lies at the heart of Jonathan Carroll's latest flight of fancy, the aptly named Wooden Sea. Look,let's make this simple. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who know Carroll is one of the most elegant fantasists writing today, and those who haven't read him yet. His latest \\"brings back\\" Frannie McCabe, Chief of Police of Crane's View. I put \\"brings back\\" in quotes because those who have met him in previous Carroll works will find they never knew him at all. But then, the only thing consistent in a Carroll story is the complete confidence one can have in knowing one cannot have complete confidence in knowing anything. Read this book and laugh, read this book and cry, read this book and marvel. Or, to put it another way, Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth to JC! Please phone home.....","review":"I've been a fan of Carroll's for years; sometimes felt I was the only person in on the secret. He defies the normal genre categories: his novels--beautifully written, teasingly plotted, quite often quite terrifying--combine horror and fantasy, flirt with matters metaphysical, don't ever entirely depart from the conventions of \\"mainstream\\" literary fiction. So it was extremely upsetting for me to find I just couldn't finish this book....just too whimsical, too exasperatingly arbitrary in its narrative development, too self-consciously darkly cute (or cutely dark). I want the Carroll who reminds me of Robert Aickman, not the Carroll who reminds me of a schizophrenic Walt Disney..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Carroll's best","review":"I have high expectations for this book after reading Land of Laughs and Sleeping In Flames but I was rather disappointed.The story had Carroll's usual interesting characters and humourous dialogues but the story simply falls flat - loosely tied up, full of inconsequential subplots with absolutely no sensible or coherent connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"I was speechless when I found out that this novel, which starts out as an intriguing, surreal mystery, devolves steadily into an ending which is both idiotic (space aliens and God) and disgustingly sweet in its moral (appreciate life at every stage of your growth). Carroll is supposed to be this great fantasy writer who has a cult following. All I can say is, keep them away from me! Too bad a writer with Carroll's talent has written such a convoluted stinker. I plan to avoid all of his other work like the plague!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wooden mind reading more Carroll","review":"Thanks to Amazon's You may also like... I picked up this one, and now I think I have a new favorite author. This is a truly creative book with wonderful characters and a convoluted but engaging plot. Man takes in three legged dog. Dog dies but refuses to stay buried or dead. Man talks to aliens, time-travels, changes his life, and sees the Beatles. Tears, surprises, and just the right amout of hilarity thrown in. I'm glad Carroll has written so many, I won't have to wait to read his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More magic from a modern master...","review":"Enough folks have commented on the plot of this great book. Let me just say that reading a Jonathan Carroll novel, any of his novels for that matter, is like a wonderful meal, a riveting film or great piece of music - you want it to keep going and never end. There are many fine contemporary novelists who are a pleasure to read, but few inject real magic into their prose like Carroll does. In many ways the elitist in me wants his readership to be small, the select few, but that's not fair to Carroll or the millions of readers who would make him their favorite novelist if they only knew."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It","review":"this book was a chance purchase but I would buy it all over again...its strange and wonderful unique story"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever!","review":"I have been playing brass instruments from tuba to trumpet since 1973.

Also, I dropped it on plush carpet, PLUSH! and it cracked in half and all of the wires jerked out. Also,the controlls are terrible, delayed, and they glitch.

Unless you're a reall cheapskate, don't buy this, the Nintendo brand controller is only 3 or 4 dollars more, and though it is 20 years old, it'll probably run for another 20.

If you just look at the picture, you'll notice the cord comes out the left side of the controller. Yes. The left side. You know... where your hand is supposed to be...This, to me, was the only reason why it sucked. Go to any NES controller and look at your hands, if they go above the D-Pad, DON'T get this controller.

The covers are done uniquely and the originals are all great. It is unfortunate, no, tragic that there will be no more music from Mark as he passed away from a heart ailment Nov. 1st, 2004.

The author was just a small boy when his father, Nate Saint was among those martyred by the \\"Auca\\" Indians in Equador. Through a long series of events, Steve ended up living with these people, known more accurately as the Waodoni. The very same man who speared is father's friends became Steve's honorary father, through a great redeeming work by an awesome God. I very much enjoyed reading about such a different culture, as well as reading this testimony of faith in showing that God can take what was meant for evil and turn it into such great good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is an inspiring story...and it makes a great movie. It's forgiveness to the Nth degree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the Spear","review":"I'm planning a trip to Equador. Someone had suggested this book to read before I go. I've only read a few pages, but am finding it very interesting. Since it is a true story, I am really finding it a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What man meant for evil, God meant for good","review":"Basic story: Author, Steve Saint's father was speared along with four other missionaries as they were trying to bring the gospel to the Waodoni-one of the most fierce tribes in the world. But this book is not really about what happened to his father as much as the ripples it created in this tribe and in Saint's life. He takes you on a trip to the deepest part of the Amazon to experience how great our God truly is and how deeply His plan goes beyond what we can understand. I was encouraged by his love and forgiveness for a tribe that killed his father. The Waodoni tribe uses the phrase \\"I see it well\\" the way we would say \\"I agree or I accept this invitation.\\" A quote from the author sums it up best: \\"When I was a boy, I cried; but now I see it well.\\" May we all learn to accept the cards we are dealt and play them to the best of our ability and watch what God can do in the lives of those around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating","review":"In order to get the most out of this very well written and captivating book you need to read \\"Through Gates of Splendor\\" by Elisabeth Elliot first. It is the beginning of a very inspiring story about 5 missionaries in Ecuador who got killed by the Waodani (Aucas). In \\"The Savage, my Kinsman\\" also byElisabeth Elliot the story continues.It is the story of forgiveness and love. You get to know and love the Waodani people. And then you still want to know more. This is where this book comes in. Steve Saint is the son of one of the killed missionaries and with him the story continues. He does a great job describing his journey back to the jungle to live with the Waodani. We learn more about them and their way of life. We wish them all the best for their future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible true life story!","review":"If I could do anything in the world, I would spend a week sitting at the feet of Steve Saint just listening to his life stories. This book is the next best thing. The stories are captivating - once one begins reading, it is difficult to put the book down. Steve has an incredible, enviable walk with God, but it has come at a high price. The book depicts part of that walk. This book is a great gift and great reading for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Our Culture!","review":"Steve Saint's tale of his return to the Waodani culture is more than just an individual trying to rectify his past with the culture he has been asked to help. It is a story with many compelling lessons for our current society of growing welfare dependence, creime and violence. And its message applies not only to our domestic policy but to many of our international policies as well. But it does it in a way that is never preachy and is informative and entertaining. It's a quick read (the last two or three chapters are a little TOO quick; hence four stars instead of five), but it carries a message that can resonate with almost anyone in any culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"much more than the movie","review":"I recommend this book to anyone whether you know the story of the 5 or not. It includes new incite into the details of what happened on \\"palm beach\\", and the beautiful way God has worked afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the Spear","review":"Awesome, I saw the movie first but this book is more from the missionaries view. I read Through Gates of Splendor years ago and it's great to know the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fascinating back-story of the Waodani","review":"I picked up End of the Spear after having seen the movie of the same title. I needed more detail, particularly knowing the artistic license often required for film. The book did not disappoint. Many of my questions were answered, and the story of what has transpired almost to the present day as Steve Saint fights to protect the Waodani from the outside world while at the same time finding ways to give them the benefits that some of modern life can bring, as well as wean them from dependence on himself, are both fascinating and, at times, heartbreaking.The only reason for four stars is to acknowledge that the writing is at times uneven, Steve is not a writer, per se. But don't let that stop you! If you've any interest at all in the story, I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Fusion music","review":"This CD is great!

In his attacks on other scientists and philosophers of science he could be called the Richard Dawkins of physics. He has a noticeable and intense disdain for the likes of physicists Penrose (who speaks of the Platonic realm) and Davies (who dares speak of God, if even as a metaphor); such \\"mystics\\" seem to have no place in true science, since they speak of \\"purpose.\\" It would seem, according to Stenger, that such ill conceived notions stem from a misinterpreation of quantum facts, and that the existing laws of science are entirely sufficient in explaining the universe (those anomolies that science can't reckon with are either misunderstood or nonexistent).

The graphics are as good as it is going to get on this platform (PS2) and for that reason if you love graphics, this is a good game.2) Gameplay- the radar, as we once knew it, is gone in MGS3! Now there is a new system called CQC- or close quarters combat. Though some classic aspects of gameplay have changed in the series, it still is a complex and challenging game for all the right reasons.3) Excitement- A stealth game is still a medium of gaming that no one has shown to master as thoroughly as Kojima.4) Plot and cinematics- A good story, and a neat ending.

This game is an amazing cinematic experience. The camera angles, as always in Metal Gear games, are awful, but that alone cannot keep me from rating this game as high as possible.

I have always been a fan of the Metal Gear series and this, the final in the trilogy, is the best by far. The opening had a James Bond feel to it and the story is borderline realistic-minus the villians with supernatural powers. The game is like a history lesson, especially if your into communist era espionage. Set in the Cold War the game has an spy vs spy concept. The game has a new CQC (Close Quarter Combat) format where you use judo/martial arts to take out your enemies. Since the game is set in the 60's there is no radar so its sort of like playing the previous MG games on higher difficulties without any radar. Overall you will enjoy this game and the finale will have you thinking for weeks to come. Get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest games ever...","review":"In my opinion, this definitely is in my top five games ever.

The horrendous camera angle/system completely distorts the gameplay, making it next to impossible to engage in combat effectively. The overhead camera cannot be rotated, which means you cannot see more than 10 feet in front of you unless you go into 1st person perspective, but if you do so, you cannot move.I really hoped this game would be much better, but sadly it is extremely disappointing experience. Do yourself a favor and rent before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in your head","review":"I don't think that adult humor should be taken out of the game, nor do I think that age has much to do with said storyline. He's 12, has a conscience and (apperently) no testostorone. It also has something to do with the mental state of mind then the age of the person. I'm 15 love Sephen King and Tom Clancy, and I Loved this game. If you can understand and appreciate the concept, story, and ..perks.. of the the game, then by all means get and enjoy. But if not, don't get it, and don't complain about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the hype","review":"Thank god I rented this game first. I'd be committing suicide right now if I'd actually thrown away fifty-buck on this trash. This was suppose to be the game of the year but it's terrible. I've seen better game for playstation 1. The camera angles (what camera angle?) are offal. You can't even tell where the enemy is half the time. But that doesn't really matter you can run around for hours being shot up and not die, how realistic is that?The dialogue is so cheesy it makes you want to vomit. The conversations between snake and the other characters are redundant and go on forever. The graphics are okay; not great but good. I can't imagine why people compare this game to splinter cell. You might as well compare Mario brothers 1 to splinter cell while you're at it. They couldn't be more different. Don't buy this game, take your money and buy a real stealth game like 'Thief, deadly shadows' or 'Splinter cell, Pandora Tomorrow' instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Game Is the G-$hit","review":"If you have ever played any of the metal gears before this you could see that this game is going to be the best game so far.Anyways if anyone tells you different they are just stupid hosersehhh.

Naked Raiden wasn't that sexual either as he was naked for a reason. What was sexual was the comedic references towards naked raiden and the girly posters and the reactions towards them.

The story was straight out of a James Bond flick. The stealth was extremely well implemented and the characters were extremely well developed. I think my only gripe about this game would have to be the framerate. I played through them in storyline chronological order so this is the first one I played. However it seemed like it stayed with me longer then the other two did. The other two's story's made far less sense in comparison, this seemed like they had taken a bond flick script rewrote it for snake and then given it a little kojima flavor.

Not every story or time period detailed may be as intriguing, but my wife and I both found the documentary very interesting and VERY well put-together.

There story reads more like an accounting of events so as a reader, i never developed any sort of connection with the characters. The characters themselves just feel unrealistic. There isn't too much range of emotions that they display and when they do, you don't really understand where they're coming from because there is no character development.

I will just state that I agree with the others that this was a perplexing, poorly written book.Carlotta, in my opinion, is no heroine. You get right away that she is a schemer, a neglectful mother, and very much a \\"party\\" girl who has no prospects because of a scandal she brought on herself.She's a woman who has an affair, is even TOLD by her lover that he will never marry her-then lo and behold-she's shocked when Bath society turns on her when her affair becomes public news?!?Sorry-but a really bad book. Take my advice and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"I have to agree with a previous review that mentions that it made no sense for Carlotta Ennis to Marry James Moore, the Earl of Rutledge, an honorable man, and not sleep with him right away. She could have risked all by not having a legally, binding, marriage. She was more than a bit of a schemer for her to not realize that. During that time, a MOC was pretty standard and those wives consumated their vows. Marriage was more about security, standard of living than love.

I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.

Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!!

I've heard less swearing in a PG-13 and R rated movie. I don't mind some swearing, but this movie had way too much. Not for children.There were scenes that I loved, like when the Nancy Allen character got into the Beatles' hotel room, and her Paul obsessed friend who was trying to get a ticket to Ed Sullivan.There were other scenes I defintely didn't like, and sure weren't on the TV version, but I won't go into detail here...might get my review banned.Not at all what I remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film to capture the feelings of the mania!","review":"I adore this film!

It provides the clearest, most concise explanation I have seen to date of why Marxism and its ilk are wrong. His essay on de Maistre is longer than its subject deserves, but not uninteresting.All of Berlin's essays display his encyclopedic knowledge and shrewd judgment. It is said that he was one of the fastest talkers on record; he writes with equal volubility, packing into each sentence a book's worth of history and theory. These essays are not for the neophyte or the casual reader -- the forthcoming _Power of Ideas_ (March 2000) promises to be more accessible -- nevertheless, they are virtuoso examples of the much praised but little practiced art of sympathetic critical interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Hard Read","review":"I can read Kant (ok, not all) or Byzantine history with considerable relish, but this was a hard read.

I was skeptical, but at $13 there isn't much risk. I figured if it didn't work out, I'd use it on my legs instead of my face. When it arrived, I was amazed by how silky and light it was. I hate greasy lotions, never use any on my hands, but this was great. It's pretty thin, so it spreads really well, and makes my face feel so silky and luxurious. I can't stop touching my face when I wear it. It feels light, but is strong enough for a winter moisturizer. I have fairly sensitive skin and this works well, isn't too perfumed and is just shockingly good for the price. If it had wrinkle fighting or sunscreen, this product would be unbeatable.

The only trouble I have with these songs is that some of them, especially the first, \\"The Day Before You Came\\" (which lasts more than 5 minutes), keep ringing in my head hours after I've turned the machine off.

It's a series of 8 games that are very simplistic and BORING. Your typical flash game on the web is better. The graphics in-game are not that great. Even my 3 and 5 year old Incredibles Fans were bored after 5 minutes.\\"Daddy Turn it off this isn't fun!\\" was all I heard. Man, I wasn't expecting much but this is about 2 days of programming effort, Not even a day of 'design' and some cut scenes. Sorely disappointed in this one. If I could return it, I would. AVOID!What you get: 8 basic 'single task games' such as:-Help Mr. Incredible get in shape by pressing the spacebar at the right time (boring)-Help Dash get to the front of the class and put tacks on the teacher's chair. (for one.. do I want my kids doing that? There would have been better things to show)-Help \\"mom\\" catch dishes as they fall. (oooo How EXCITING)It's too painful to go on.

When I brought it home, I beat it in five minutes, both the medium and easy levels.

My son received the Game Cube version at the same time. I played mine once, he is still playing his a month later. The graphics are so-so. The games themselves are boring.

I found High School a bore, that those make me bad?) It's a pleasure to relive my teenage years and reveiw these films.

I had to crank up the air pressure to get it to set the staples well beyond the Bostich tool and still had problems with staples that did not fully seat. I have had to buy a nail set for staples to have if I am going to continue to use it.

The unit slides into place on the boards with ease and there is little pressure on the plunger to set the nails. I would recommend this unit to any of my friends.There is one suggestion I would like to recommend to make the unit a little more user friendlier. Remove the straight air connection and replace with a swivel connection. This keeps the hose from placing pressure forward on the nailer and also keeps the hose from sliding up your arm.Other than what is stated; I could not be more pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT nailer for the price","review":"Currently using this nailer to install 600 sq ft of 3/4\\" thick engineered oak flooring.

Had I bothered to read the manual, I would have seen the pretty picture showing me to hammer the nails into the tongue portion, not the groove, of each board. Once I made that change, *smooth sailing*! No jams, no misfires, no problem-o.

I though all nailers allowed both 16 and 18 gauge cleats. Users recommend 18 gauge for solid 5/8 inch bamboo (Trillium) but manufacturer states either can be used. I tried 16 gauge and worked the compressor right up to 125lbs and it still wouldn't drive the cleats all the way in. I then bought the Bostitch MIIIFN on the advise from a Home Depot rep who told me it takes either. After the reading manual, it only takes the one Bostitch size which is 16 gauge. I tried it with the 16 gauge cleats. Using the recommended 3/8\\" NPT, it drove the cleat way into the boards at 90lbs. I adjusted and settled at 50 Lbs to drive the cleats to the proper depth, at or a hair below flush. The Bostitch worked flawlessly and is really really built well.

After I was done the tool was put away for 2 years until 2011 when I installed red oak flooring into my kitchen. Once again the nailer was consistent in sinking cleats properly, did not misfire, jam, or malfuntion even once.After putting thousands of cleats through this product without any malfunction I can say I would easily reccomend this to anyone.

The illustrated version of this book provides the pictures, drawings, and diagrams that were sorely needed in the original book by Dava Sobel.

You're left with incomplete pictures of any particular method or subject. Many times I just wanted to throw this book in the garbage out frustration.

But there is more to the story of longitude than mathematics and engineering. The human story of longitude is brought to life in Sobel's Longitude.Sobel does a very good job of explaining the intracies of the longitude problem, and relates the personal trials and frustrations of Harrison with a penchant for his personal fortitude and courage in the face of frustration and humiliation. I found her writing of the story to be truly inspiring.The book without a doubt is a \\"personal interest\\" story, with only a minimum of explaination of how the timepieces actually functioned and the challenges their developement involved. To others, this evidentially detracted from the book - I disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle version is not illustrated","review":"An amazing story, well told. As I owned the original hard cover, which I enjoyed so much, I decided to purchase this version as my first eBook.However, I had hoped that the Kindle version would include at least one picture (as in the \\"Illustrated Longitude\\") book. Sadly not a single image. Even the cover page is bare. The Illustrated version of the book is so much more enjoyable when you can actually see the amazing clocks and detail that Harrison designed and built.

His approach was condemned largely for its simplicity by scientists who favored an astronomical approach that required precise measurements of heavenly bodies, on a rolling ship, and complex calculations. While this sounds dry, the book is filled with amusing anecdotes of the quack methods proposed for finding longitude, and the descriptions of Harrison's struggles and dedication to his invention are inspiring. You'll learn a good deal about clocks, excuse me, chronometers, and their history from Galileo and Christian Huygens to John Harrison's marine timekeeper, designed to withstand the temperature changes and humidity levels of a rolling, ocean-going ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent review of navigational history","review":"An excellent reivew of navigational history and complex problem requiring a few centuries to achieve solution.

The author never even explained how longitude is calculated using the chronometer. Do you need a sextant? What happens if you don't see the sun for a week? I am not satisfied with mere facts. I'd like to know how and why it is so. The book offers none.I really enjoyed Atul Gawande's books on medicine. He's a surgeon and epidemiologist who also writes very well. Simon Singh is another scientist (PhD in physics) and a great writer. He can make a lay reader feel they understand difficult mathematical problems such as the Fermat's last theorem. They write great books on science because they understand the scientific issues at hand.The other way round, a writer, who has no training in science or engineering, hardly understands the science, much less being able to offer explanation. Such is the case of this book, a book of anecdotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, disappointing book","review":"There is no arguing that there is a fascinating story here -- I just hope someone will eventually write it. The writing in this book is clunky, and the book reads like an extended piece for a newsmagazine (which it may have been).

There is not even a single diagram in the entire text.Plenty of exagerated stories of the evil board of longitude, but no technology in a book about technology. Where an attempt is made the author gets it wrong, eg. confusing angles with distances, and stating that the temparature grid of brass and iron worked because the metals were of different lengths (and of course no diagram).It is like being given a fine looking cake with fabulous icing, but when the knife goes in the cake is hollow.

There is lots of florid prose about how evil and conniving some folks were, but we never really get a feel for them. I suspect that the author either 1) could have used a good editor or 2) got edited to death in order to fit some sort of page limit.

It's also got a lot to say about 18th and 19th century class issues (a common sailor hanged for daring to attempt to calculate longitude, and then having the temerity to tell officers their calculations were off; after they hanged the sailor they crashed their ships and lost 2,000 more men); astronomers' status relative to \\"mechanics,\\" and international relations in the age of sailing ships.Four stars instead of five because it isn't illustrated. I sent the illustrated version to my brother for his birthday, though, and expect I'll eventually be able to borrow it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it's about time!","review":"Someone has finally written the story of Harrison and his chronometer into a nice, readable story. Longitude is a good little book outlining the problem sailors faced in determining their longitude and the mechanical genius behind its resolution. Sobel's telling takes the reader through the nature of the problem, which is probably unfamiliar to most today, and illuminates the innovations achieved by John Harrison, a relatively unschooled but brilliant man gifted in mechanics and engineering. The problems he faced from his competitors and from the Longitude Board, essentially judges for the awarding of the prize to whoever found a workable solution, are very interesting. The tale is full of conflict-of-interest problems, engineering hurdles, and egos. I was fascinated with the longitude problem before reading this book and am now more fascinated in its history.

As it is, the book can be sensibly used to test people. It would take much leniency from one of even very limited technical/scientific culture not to react vehemently against it.

Ideas are presented without a context - the powder of sympathy appears to be an isolated idea. Numbers and facts are treated like adjectives; for instance, don't try to calculate how many people died in the Centurion (chapter 2) and compare to the number of survivors.The book looks a lot like a museum visit, where each piece is explained, but no clear link is visible between the pieces. And then, the explanations are quite superficial, with little technical detail.Not that the longitude problem requires a technical text.

I loved learning about the solution to the ages-old problem of figuring longitude while at sea. The technical detail of the problem was written in an easy-to-understand way, and the people in the history are so well-developed that I became emotionally involved with them--empathetic towards 1, frustrated by another, disliked yet another.

I understood all of the technical explanations, but I should admit to a practical knowledge of navigation (I know the difference between WGS72 & ED50).It explained one thing I had wanted to know for YEARS. In Joshua Slocum's \\"sailing alone around the world\\" (which is essential reading for anyone that liked longitude) Slocum says \\"I had no need of a chronometer because I find my longitude by the lunar method\\".After reading longitude I know what the lunar method is.The proof of the pudding is in the eating. After reading this book I HAD to go and see the clocks in person, and so I did (you can see the Cutty Sark there as well).I loved the story of Harrison doggedly doing what he knew was right in the face of so many enemies who were so unscrupulous.Buy it.Steve"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book for anyone who likes time, etc.","review":"I enjoyed this book. It has a nice story to follow, but at the same time it has a sufficient amount of technical description to satisfy even an engineer (me).

After reading this book, you will definitely have a finer appreciation of the modern technology that allows us to locate ourselves anywhere in the world in a matter of seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...","review":"A readable but ultimately unsatisfying look at clockmaking and navigation. While the author explains the context well, it is unfortunately badly edited (describing one meeting twice in contradictory terms) and rather too basic (with charcters described in rather more detail than science). As an very basic introduction it is a good book - unfortunately it leaves many more questions unanswered than it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"I purchased this text as a companion to my growing collection of Patrick O'Brian books. I thought it would be nice to read up on the scientific advances that made sailing (a little) less random for the British Navy. I imagined an absorbing read with depth and clarity, like \\"Fermat's Enigma.\\" Based on the reviews and O'Brian's statement (above) I think I wasn't setting my expectations too high.Instead, I found a book that was filled with flat characters, unsupportable sweeping statements, endless cliches, and generally a style so vapid that I couldn't even finish the book. I hope that someone revisits this subject sometime and writes a proper popular history that gives it the attention and treatment it deserves. I don't understand why O'Brian liked it as much as he did, and plan to forget his kind words about this book just as soon as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth borrowing","review":"This prettily produced book is short and easy to read, not least because of the almost complete absence of that awkwardly indigestible subject of technology (which happens to be a requirement for designing watches). The \\"human interest\\" story is appalling and worth retelling, and Sobel retells it readably--I am not qualified to judge her accuracy. Borrow this from a friend, read it--it will probably take only three hours or so--and return it. Then, when in Greenwich, take a long look at the chronometers themselves, and buy one or two of the relevant offprints from scholarly/horological journals. These, available at the National Maritime Museum shop, tell you a lot about Harrison and very, very much more than this book does about his watches. And even though their covers aren't so pretty, they're well illustrated with photographs and lovingly rendered diagrams . . . and cost less."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest revolution ever.","review":"This book is great. Sobel uses just the right amount of detail to explain a complex set of ideas and how one man dared to challenge some of the greatest minds in man's short history. John Harrison a man with no formal schooling solved a problem that plagued sailors for centuries and he did it despite the corrupt people competing against him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history of science","review":"This book, in my mind, is one of the best examples of truly superb history of science for laymen. It describes the problem clearly, it covers a problem that we can all understand, and one that had fundamental repurcussions for our world, and then it goes on to discuss its solution with wonderfully readable detail.I thought this book was great on a number of levels- social history (insight into the relevant British cultural context), technological history, and the coverage of a great invention.I mourn the passing of the golden age of design and engineering- everything is now electronic, with very few intuitive mechanical things left, and this book is a wonderful celebration of of an age when brilliance meant the creation of wonderful physical objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longitude was abig problem","review":"I recomend to read this book because it is talking about some famuse people who solved the big problem with sea, and descripe how they developed from telescope when Galeleo built it to compss and the watch descovered how Harrison made the firest whtch then how the watch solve the Longitude problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Relax.Drift away.dream...ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!THIS CD sucks!

James Bond doesn't even fire his gun the entire book. I don't expect Bond to shoot someone every page, but he doesn't even engage in combat. There is very little hand-to-hand combat, a couple car chases, and no gunfire. If there is only a little action, I expect deep and thoughtful espionage to substitute, but the book doesn't give you that either. There are some interesting chapters here-and-there, I like the card playing scenes, and the story Drax tells bond at the end, but the book is kind of non-eventful as a whole.

Shonen Knife mixes it up with a few slower numbers, but there's often an amusing feel to the songs, as with \\"Under My Pillow\\" - Naoko's tale of sleep paralysis. I could do without the male backup vocals in a few sections, but the whole CD is so heartfeltt and brimming with fun that for the most part, it's hard to suppress a smile.May Shonen Knife continue to rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear Title","review":"My college Spanish professor asked us to buy a Vox Spanish Dictionary (not a Spanish/English dictionary).

It's as though he's run out of story vignettes. The irritatingly banal Summer Jumped All Over Me is a case in point, lacking Bill's usual finesse and wordplay. Make no mistake, Bill Morrissey is a true gem. I hold his albums in very high regard. Few can hold a candle to his ability to make lyrics sit seamlessly with melody. Just listen to Birches on the album Night Train or These Cold Fingers from Standing Eight. This album, however, is padded out with pedestrian blues. It's worth a listen, and essential buying if you're a fan, but try his earlier albums (not the previous Something I Saw or Thought I Saw, where he is starting to run out of ideas) to hear Bill at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable device","review":"After much work using every routing device in the house, DCHP server and simple router. I was finally reduced to using a sniffer to at least discover that the system uses the default IP address of 192.168.1.250. Thinking the worst part was behind me and actually doing a little dance, I then spent about 3 hours trying to set up the wireless network and correct IP addresses. The system simply would not respond forcing me to perform a hard reset countless times. After a firmware upgrade and another round of fruitless web setup. I finally gave up. I never got the software from the CD to even identify the device. All in all the worst experience I have ever had with a piece of computer hardware. And for someone who actually does this for a living that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite ready yet","review":"The documentation,setup and networking was simple and \\"straight forward\\" and worked ok incuding the WEP configuration but the firmware had to be upgraded to 1.35 in order for the device to recognize the USB laser printer attached(samsung ml-1702). The Device reboots slowly and none at all when the printers are attached. I find that if I make any changes to the device before rebooting it, I need to remove all printers then reboot and after it comes back on attach them. for this reason i give it a low rating as in the case of a power cut you would have to reset it this way, which would remove it from working seamlessly in an environment, unless it was attached to a UPS. If this is corrected then it maybe worth the high cost. Good attempt but at a high cost to consumers. Not for the inexperienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product!

According to the sampling theorem, this would enable frequencies upto 48KHz to be recorded. A person with perfect hearing could hear upto 18KHz. So why record inaudible frequencies? The idea is that this helps to reproduce transients faithfully. The musicianship on the DVD is good but bland. The sound, at first hearing, is like that on a well recorded CD. The percussion does sound more open and natural. On the whole, I feel this type of music does not glaringly show off the capabilities of the medium. Thus the four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive.","review":"This is a very readable, very complete introduction/history to the thinking, questions and issues underlying cognitive science from its philosophical origins.

I am familiar with quality concepts, but I was expecting from the title to find better application of these concepts to a project. Dr. Ireland seems to drift between referring to the project and referring to the product. That, coupled with some unnecessarily complex language, makes this book difficult to understand. It is phrased as though it is a general discussion of projects of all types, but I found that many areas did not apply to the types of projects that I work on - development of a product for subsequent mass production. I suspect that Dr. Ireland leans towards \\"build-to-order\\" projects, such as construction or custom IT projects.

Seth is an understandably troubled hero and Pippa has some very real demons. I enjoyed the growing romantic chemistry between them.The side plots are where this book stumbles. The story about his son works quite well and keeps this from being just another cookie-cutter book about a trouble boss saved by a charming assistant. What I found to be utterly gratuitous was the whole evil threats/bombing aspects. This seems to be a real trend in 1990's romances. It seems to be something of a cop-out when the really tough thing to write about is the growth of the relationship.Bottom-line: A pleasant read but not a book I'll be keeping or lending to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific romance","review":"I've read many Patricia Rice romances, and based on her first contemporaries, she's even better at contemporary than historical.

This CD has the right balance of comedy and song, featuring tracks by SNL alums such as Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal and beautiful tracks by Celine Dion and Elton John, to name a few. The most touching track of all has to be \\"Ohio\\" sung by Gilda's husband Gene Wilder. The profits of this CD benefit Gilda's Club, which is a beautiful organization. Gilda Radner will live on forever not just through her brilliant comedy, but through this inspiring organization that has helped so many. The world lost an amazing person way too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's always something!","review":"This is a really fun CD to add to your collection. The song \\"Chopping Broccoli\\" has never been recorded before and for those Saturday Night Live fans its a real treat. The song that Gene Wilder performs (Ohio) is also very touching. My favorite is Gilda Radner doing Lisa Lupner's piano recital. You will laugh and enjoy the eclectic collection. The new song, \\"A Friend in You\\" performed by cancer survivor, Eileen Johnson is a beautiful song and one that should be a hit! (It's better than American Idol!!)

I was alarmed to see a few loose flecks of the gold grip spray stuff Purolator uses inside of the rubber gasket seal. The flecks were about the size of a grain of sand, and my concern is they'll end up taking a few trips around my motor and transmission. I'm not sure how much grip texture trash is inside the filter or if it is on the outlet side of the filter.I personally have never had a problem removing non-textured filters from my other vehicles, so I see this grip texture as more trouble than it is worth. The texture feels softer than the texture Fram uses, so maybe that is why a few bits of grip were able to come off. I think it is unacceptable for a new filter to have loose trash flying around. I'll contact Amazon to see what the return process is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid looking filter","review":"I recently installed my first Purolator PureOne on a 2011 Honda Ridgeline; it appears to be working as expected.

It was easy enough to remove, but Purolator should make QC adjustments to avoid potential filter contamination. I went with the PureOne based on recommendations from a vehicle owner's forum. Time will tell if the extra cost provides superior protection.P.S. The Amazon \\"will this fit your vehicle\\" feature (now) incorrectly indicates the PL14610 does not fit my vehicle. A quick check at the Purolator website reflects the correct applicability.

The quality of the filter medium appears to be better, with a tighter, more even distribution of the pleats.Construction of the filter, particularly the safety relief valve also seems to be improved.In the future, I know the decision will be an easy one.

A very small amount of oil would ooze out of the side of the filter even when properly tightened. I've since replaced it with a third filter and so far there are no problems after 500 miles.

It was interesting to hear her side of view.I did not know that Bob Marley sired so many children from other woman and his excuse to his wife was, \\"I know that I can not run your body down with having a baby every year.\\" That was his excuse for having children with other women. I have to pat Rita on the back by helping Bob take care of these children, because many women including me would have not done that whether the man had money or not. I must really say she has a good heart and because of that and so many other things she continues to be blessed.I found myself sad to read that Bob's life could have been saved if he had of amputated his toe, years before the cancer claimed his body, but he was hard-headed and him and his family had to pay the price.I feel that Bob Marley is a musical genius that still does not receive all of his props and I commend Rita and his family for continuing his legacy.Later...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"With finances tight, I make sure to read reviews before purchasing.

I do not. For me it was both enlightening and invigorating. At least from the examples here given, he worked out of a healthy mainstream to create his own variation on many themes. The dancers seem to do very well what they were supposed to do and were very likely to be able to perform in other styles as needed. I should think the Charlie Parker piece will resonate most with the casual viewer although it would seem to me that identifying characters in the dance with specific real life models will detract from one's pleasure. It is the dancer as symbol of emotional states that creates the impact not the reality of any particular person.Overall, then, a very good way for those unfamiliar with Ailey's contributions to begin to appreciate them. I should think others, as with some of the reviewers, will enjoy seeing again the unrepeatable performances of these particular artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO SUPRISE","review":"It's no surprise that this DVD is good, because Ailey is always good.

You take a little something to surpress the appetite, and you can count on cutting your fast food and tortilla chip intake by half. Wow, what a promise.This is not a book for people who wish to enjoy food, but in healthier portions. It's certainly not for those who see the connection between what we eat and how we feel.

The whole \\"diet\\" consists of taking 1-4 tablespoons of extra light olive oil every day with an hour on either side during which one doesn't ingest any flavors.

Also, as it is something one is meant to do for the rest of one's life, I found myself a little averse to the idea. I tried it for four weeks anyway, and did nothing but gain weight despite the fact that I was indeed eating less \\"real\\" food - I suppose the gain was due to all that extra fat I was ingesting. I won't claim that the diet is a hoax, but it absolutely did not work for me, and I can't risk trying it any longer if I'm to lose this last 20 (well, now more like 30) pounds.

I am also able to lose weight fairly easily when I decide to watch a little more closely to my food choices at any given time. So with this bit of history into my background, I am very dissapointed in its results or lack of. I gained 3 pounds by the end of almost 2 weeks and never felt the feelings of a suppressed appetite or the desire to eat healthier foods.I went back to my normal eating habits afterwards and within an additional 2 weeks I lost the 3 pounds that I had gained.

I highly recommend having updated drivers before you begin the router installation.I'm still using wireless-g adapters and am able to get 36Mbps throughput in my garage, which is downstairs and has concrete walls. Very happy with this product overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well if you don't mind rebooting daily!","review":"Pretty slick and easy to configure, a worthy heir to the WRT54G. Yet, like most of the N routers, it drops randomly the internet connection once a day. Network is still on, but nothing on the internet (DNS?) side until you power cycle the router. I tried 2 different new units, same issue. Even Apple is experiencing the issue with its Apple Airport Extreme. It sounds like a chipset issue with me, which screams that the N draft technology is not ready to ship, as its name indicates!! I went back to my faithful WRT54G, no need to reboot with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Router","review":"this is one of my other best buys.

This router gave me so much trouble that it ended up being used just as a 4 port switch ; the customer service knew absolutely nothing, and just infuriated me with trivial step by step procedures that ultimately wasted my time. More annoyingly, because I had faith in linksys products, I stuck with it - just to be disappointed in linksys and myself. The router has significant software/hardware flaws, and I would only recommend it to people who want stupid antennas while they're attached by a wire to a \\"wireless\\" router! linksys sure isn't what it used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Macs","review":"As one other review pointed out, this router is problematic with macs.

The WRT150N installed easily including securing the network. The install software is so intuitive, networking knowledge is optional. The software does it all. After allowing access to my laptop I tried it out. Old router provided limited signal strength in my bedroom and outside deck. The new router provides EXCELLENT signal strength throughout my entire property. Hope you don't need Linksys Tech support because it is very poor. They wanted to charge me $32 to reset password on old router. After I argued, they finally directed me to www.linksys.com/kb which allowed me to reset password myself after a 15 minute discussion with the tech. I highly reccommend the WRT150N.

I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.They used to have free support until just very recently. My beef is with the cost of support. 3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!! I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events. You will need tech support now and again when you change ISPs, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"erratic responsiveness, difficult set-up, eventual death","review":"This router has caused me much trouble and, as of tomorrow, it goes into the trash. I also wish to thank linksys personally for their poor technical support and for the audacity that they have in asking for money so that they could give me technical support on the product that did not work well from the outset. The cost of the tech support would be $39.99 and I can go out and purchase a new router for just a little more.I got a different encryption key after I had to reset the model, and after this happened the router did not work with any of my other devices.

I ran the step and it didnt work, so he transferred me to someone else.

I have version 1.1 and with the latest firmware 1.0.1.9 from Linksys, this thing drops internet connection on both wired and wireless connections. I decided to investigate to see if it's a hardware or software issue. It turns out to be software as I am using DD-WRT v24 RC-6 (01/02/08) mini - build 8743 and all my connections issues are gone. My router is now stable and I can say that this is a nice device. If you are having issues, give DD-WRT a shot, you'll thank me later.I will send information on this to Linksys so hopefully they can get decent firmware out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small and powerful wireless","review":"I have had several wireless routers over the past years and linksys has improved consistently. Linksys has reduced the physical size of the unit and its power is improved. I still use the older g type of speed because I havn't seen the need to upgrade my adapters, and this unit allows even those \\"older\\" units increased connectivity and speed. The setup was fast and predictible. I just needed to add wireless capability in my home and didn't want to eliminate the high end router that I already had. The price of wireless access points are, in my opinion, stupid. So, I took this router, attached it to my expensive 'wired' netgrear router, plugged it into the wan port, enabled dhcp, and I now have a second layer of firewall protection plus wireless capability. It works for me. The price of this router is cheaper than any wireless access point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys N Router","review":"Good router...could be a little more user friendly in setup.

It drops or freezes up randomly. It draws system memory (my memory was always on 50% usage but now drops to 30% after switching to D-Link). Its evil twins, the Linksys N wireless card interrupts the sound card (the volume keeps going up and down and slows down sometimes as if you are playing LP using the wrong rpm). The signal strength is worst than my years old g router. We paid full price to get this router and was reluctant to buy a new one within a year. But the performance was so horrible that we would rather dragging 100ft long cables go around the house instead of 'trying our luck' to get connected wirelessly.

Then, just short of a year, the router stopped working. Although I had the product less than a year, Linksys refused to honor the warranty, claiming that some date other than my acquisition of the product triggered the warranty. The technician told me \\"the luck is not with you,\\" and informed me that Linksys may be able to fix the router, but I would have to pay $30 to find out. Quite simply, Linksys doesn't stand behind their products, and their customer service representatives are smug, condescending and unhelpful.Instead of paying $30 to see if they would be able to fix my router, I purchased a router from Netgear, and I've been quite pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped connections on wireless","review":"We've had this unit for several months.

After following the directions on the easy setup disc (which didn't work, time after time, I had to restart after every step to get it to recognize the router), the internet drops every 1/2 hour, and having two computers online at the same time is a joke. I'm pretty tech savvy, not some nube who plugs the thing and expects it to work perfectly without effort, but this router is horrible.

Overall a good solid router, once the firmware is fixed. Had a major issue as soon as I tried to connect to WoW. It seems that the previous reviews were correct. Any internet intense workload kills the router outright. The fix explained in previous reviews was spot on.

So far after about a year's use, I haven't had any problems with either PCs or Macs on my home network. The complaints about \\"not working with Macs\\" are probably due to the user's lack of knowledge, not a problem with the router.I will say the setup is going to be a challenge for someone who knows nothing about networks or WEP security. Setup is done from a browser and there are several screens where information has to be entered to secure the wifi network. If you aren't sure about these, find a knowledgeable friend who can help set it up.

I expected longer range and higher throughput. I cannot confirm improvement either in range or with throughput. But I would probably live with that - at least it's not worse. However the real problem is with intermittent disconnections from the Internet under the load. And that's not about wireless connection it's just a basic wired connection. It changes IP every hour or so and that's really annoying. The connection is DSL and that was never that bad with D-Link. I upgraded its firmware, changed computer (WinXP, Core2Duo), changed DSL provider and a modem (of course these changes were planned and made regardless of the router) - nothing helps. I'm really disappointed.

I updated the firmwear and reset my Toshiba laptop for type N, updated the laptop adapter to latest drivers. The reliability in the house was excellent; in the clubhouse, the range was no better than the G router, one to two bars and frequent dropout. I worked with it for several weeks, updated my adapter, varied settings. Speed showed as 130 Mhz and connection type showed as type N on my laptop. I discovered that the built-in N adapter in my laptop (Intel 4965agn) lists several routers that are recommended but none from lynksys.

This book lists individual signs, many of which are SEE signs or outdated. Like many beginners, this was my first book...a lot of bookstores sell it at the top of their lists--I'm not sure why. If you are interested in signing a song to a hearing audience (these signs strung together wouldn't make any sense in American Sign Language) this book may be for you. But if you are looking at interpreting or real communication with a Deaf person, look elsewhere!

However, Joy of Signing does not present ASL (American Sign Lanuage) as much as signed Enlish. This may not mean a lot to many people - signing is signing, right?No. ASL is a real language with its own grammar, syntax and vocabulary. Signed English is not. Signed English is a pidgin language which borrows much from ASL but attempts to communicate in English.Many deaf people will be able to communicate with you, using signed English, but many others will not. Mostly, communicating in signed English has the potential to be akward for all involved, as nobody in the conversation will be communicating in their native language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners","review":"I think this is a great book for anyone who wants to learn the meaning of different signs.

It's easy and I loved it. However, when I got into more advanced, for-credit classes, I realized that much of what I had learned was obsolete or just plain unusual. I had to stop using it as a refrence because I was doing poorly on tests and my new teacher (who was deaf) had trouble understanding me. Even the number signs in this book are not the common ones used. I was frustrated that I had spent so much time memorizing these signs, and now had to not only learn new ones, but unlearn the old ones.

They are OUT-DATE signs!When learning sign, buy DawnSign Press, Vista, Signing Naturally (both video and workbook). These are the best and extremely accurate (a few signs are California dialect).

The guide is full of lots of screenshots but they don't really depict anything, just what's going on in the story. The walkthrough doesn't help much. It's more of walkthrough designed for the one who wants to go through the game quickly without getting the secrets and such (which the guide doesn't exactly touch base with either). The walkthrough isn't too confusing but the information provided is just for those who only care about completeing the game. If you're one who actually needs help with the game then the guide can be a life-saver.

After penning German Boy, a book relating his own experiences as a German youth fighting for survival at the end of WWII, Samuel examines the post-World War II Cold War through the eyes of American air force flyers. As a reader, I found it refreshing that throughout the book Samuel allowed military aviators to tell their own stories. But more importantly, he puts the events and activities into historical context so that readers who are not steeped in the history of the time understand the critical importance of the Cold War air effort documented by him. Early on, we hear American flyers saying \\"I Always Wanted to Fly\\" but I found the stories to be about commitment, motivation, dedication and the determined fight for the very freedoms we enjoy everyday. This book is a must read for history buffs and an adventurous, exciting and engaging work for any reader interested in the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent first-person history of the cold war","review":"Retired aviator Wolfgang Samuel has produced another enjoyable,readable collection of stories by cold war era combat pilots.

Where do they come up with these sissified colors and ideas?It's not that this is a bad batmobile; it's more that there's two others in this same make.

The relationships between these six women are complex and unpredictable and I liked that. They are all very different as individuals and different in terms of what they're doing with their lives. This is no \\"Desperate Housewives\\" - it's better (and I like Desperate Housewives for the most part).Being a fan of Michael Lee West (Crazy Ladies) and Rebecca West (Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood) I can't say that Cassandra King is quite there yet, but nearly so.

They relied a lot on their good friends inferring what they were thinking or what they needed. Maybe my problem is that I was born north of the Mason-Dixon Line.

It is a quick read and offers the truth about the range of emotions before,during, and after adoption. It gives a voice to all those unspoken things adoptive and even nonadoptive parents feel and think but could never publicly say. I really appreciated the authors honesty and her sense of humor which you really need to be part of the nontraditional life and extended family we create when we adopt.

I highly recommend this book -- I've already passed it on to a friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Buy a Baby, and Can I Send It Back?","review":"In her book, Jana Wolff objectifies the child and dismisses the child's mother as so much garbage. In truth, birth mothers enter into relinquishment sorrowfully and loving their children, and in doing so, they embark on a lifelong journey of pain: missing the child and loving the child and knowing they made a wrong decision in their youth. Jana Wolff's treatment of birth mothers is as they are simply a means of deliverance only (that is her word, deliverance). Wolff also devours and spits up the traditional adoptive family mythology, to be sure, openly discussing that cost indicates buying a baby, and wondering if she can send it back after purchase.Other adoptive parents have lauded this book. I say, if Wolff's representation of how adoptive parents think is reality, a hard look at adoption, motives of adoptive parents, and the welfare of the child vis-a-vis adoption is sorely needed.Thumbs-down on the thinking that is presented throughout this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad","review":"As a mother of 2 bio children and in the process of adopting another child, I thought this book would be a good resource to read. Instead this book angered me. The book though interesting showed that some people come to adoption as a last resort because all other attempts at having biological children has failed. Adoption should be thought of as giving a child a home that would otherwise be aborted or in foster care. This mother is angry at the world for her inability to have biological children and it wouldn't have mattered if the birthmother was white and the father was white she still would have been angry and bitter because he didn't come from her womb. She should have been thankful that she was able to be a mother to a child not matter how he came into this world. I feel for her son when he is old enough to read the book his mother wrote and to see how she felt about him and his birthmother. How sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly honest!","review":"Yeah for Jana! She is plowing new ground for adoptive parents by bringing secret thoughts to light. Instead of feeling defeated and ashamed when problems come, which they do for all parents, negative parental emotions will be neutralized. They will see once and for all that they are normal and not alone. Thank you, Jana, for having the guts to write this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I tore through her book and read many passages out loud to my husband who seemed to also appreciate her perspective. I took it for that - her perspective. An open and shockingly honest portrayal of her emotions and thoughts throughout her adoption experience. I've already loaned it to a friend. What I was most thankful for was that someone had the courage to say what many of us think at different times during the adoption process. Sure, not everything applied to my experience, but I didn't expect it to. Read this book if you need reassurance that those \\"secret\\" thoughts you are having are normal and okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad...","review":"As a mother of three children who were adopted (cross culturally), I found this book to be nothing more than a sad commentary on this woman's life. I doubt she would feel entirely positive about any biological children she might have had. I am glad she feels comfortable writing about her negative feelings, but am surprised it was published. The only useful purpose this book serves is to illustrate the sad fact that, unfortunately, not all people adopt for the right reasons, or make informed choices about the type of adoption/s they chose to have. For the sake of all involved, it is healthier to recognize that there are unique sets of issues that will be a part of any type of adoption, explore how one will deal with these issues, and resolve the many unresolved issues there often are for childless or infertile couples, BEFORE actually becoming a family through adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stuff does work!","review":"Pure Citrimax works for me for the following reasons:1. It is not mixed with massive ammounts of stimulants like caffeine, guarana or ephedrine. That means speciffically that it won't affect my moods or my sleep. Also, does not contain chromium, which can interfere with insulin. No side effects, period!2. It does help maintain healthy weight. This is not a rapid weight lossproduct, but I would say you can loose about seven pounds per month. Rapid weight loss is not healthy!3. It is also a mild appetite suppressant so it helps me eat more sensibly.Just keep in mind that using any diet product should not be used as an excuse or reason to not exercise or eat a balanced diet!!!C.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"take 2","review":"The company was quite satisfactory..on time and no extra chargesto me for the international shipment.I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because one cap. 3 times a daydid not work for me but as soon as I increased to 2 caps. 3 times a day,I see decrease in my appetite as well as increase in my energy level.Thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ireland: A Photographic Tour","review":"A must have for anyone wishing to see Ireland.

My only complaint is you don't get an even amount of each piece so you're very limited on what you can build. I ended up getting him the transparent 100 piece kit for Christmas to go with this set and it's much better.If I was to do it over again I'd buy the 100 piece set to begin with.

I will agree with a previous review that the metal finish is shinier than in the picture, which appears to be more matte. Even so, it is really classy, blingy, and sophisticated. Also, the links come in and out fairly easily for sizing. I took it by the jewelers and had two links removed for a better fit, and it took about 5 minutes. Easy!

This game is 100% dependent on luck. It is as dependent on a dice roll as Snakes and Ladders is and much more complex to set up and play. So you are better off with snakes and ladders. On the positive side, the game is very well built with beautiful pieces and board. My 5-year old daughter got bored with it right away as did I but at least she uses the pieces to play her own games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for kids","review":"This is a great game for kids.

With phrases like, \\"A sacred text is one which is capable of evolving into higher forms within the mind\\", \\"...the meaning [of scripture]...is symbolic and multiple - there is wide latitude and freedom in understanding them\\", and \\"powerful Spirit of Wisdom...as female\\", it should be apparent where the author is deriving his inspiration. St. Irenaeus, way back in the beginning, warned of the Gnostic's ability to reinterpret everything in terms of itself. This is just another one, although some of the musical bits are worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this book!","review":"This book is fantastic! The Playbook showed me, in a humorous way, what it takes to succeed in the world of dating for young professionals. It is tough finding quality women, approaching them, asking them out, and dating them after you get your diploma. It feels like the dating pool has dried up and become this big desert. Where did all the hot babes go? The Playbook showed me how to play this new game smart, and save me time that I would have otherwise wasted making rookie mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste of West Texas","review":"My book club chose the subject of \\"Texas writers writing about Texas\\". Passing up McMurtry and Graves, et al, I chose this book. The essays and short stories really are about living in West Texas - not just novels set in Texas. Reading about the authors, I was impressed with their credentials. Some of the pieces are so West Texas you can feel the everlasting wind and taste the dust and know that they love where they live. Of course, not all the pieces are of equal value, but I recommend the book to anyone interested in women writers - and West Texas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coach Wooden's Pyramid for Kids","review":"Inch and Miles is good for read-aloud and discussion with youngsters.

Every student in the school keeps an on-going journal of writing related to each trait, and students perform special skits, songs, poems, etc related to the traits in the book at our weekly assemblies.

As one reviewer has stated, he couldn't remember how long it had been since he'd so much enjoyed hearing \\"Voi che sapete.\\" Kozena's magic in familiar music comes from her skills in ornamenting the nobly simple melodic lines. The listener is continually surprised by her rich but tasteful additions to the written score. She never overdoes them, so Mozart, I suspect, would not have responded to her singing in the way Rossini is reported to have done to a singer of his time who ornamented \\"Una Voce Poco Fa\\" to excess. He told her the aria she'd just sung for him was very beautiful, and then slyly inquired who'd written it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much Banjo on the CDs","review":"I was very disappointed to see page after page say \\"Banjo not on CD.\\" True, the CDs alone are good, and help to lessen the blow of spending thirty bucks on a \\"banjo\\" book that doesn't actually have that much banjo in it. But if I wanted to buy Bluegrass CDs, I can find them elsewhere. I thought I was getting 50 BANJO songs. Instead, I have to search through the songs to find the few that actually have the banjo in it.The other songs are good and all, and may be helpful to somebody who is already really good at the banjo and can improvise, but I need to hear the tune I'm playing in order to learn it.The bottom line is that I was led to believe that I would be getting 3 CDs worth of songs with Banjo in them, and the tablature to play along... and I didn't get that."},{"rating":"2","title":"as always i love it","review":"love the vampire diaries every season draws me in looking forward to every new episode worth every cent thanks amazon:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"So far season four has been good.

And the secret sharing between Stefan and Klaus promises to be very bad news/interesting.Elena is starting to annoy me, and I'm in favor of bringing back Katherine - who, having been keeping a close eye on Stefan over the years, surely knows that Elena is now a vampire and will be back to stake her claim and stir up trouble?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Three-some","review":"Now that Elena is a vamp the story-line is getting interesting.

It's pretty much about a woman named Janice, and her husband, Munroe, that find a baby and keep it as thier own and hope that no one finds out about it.They live on a ship that they also make thier living off of fishing and selling the fish they catch. This book is very fictional, since there is no way you could find a living baby on the shore, and expect to keep it. And there is no way to make a good living selling fish. This book was not one of my favorites. Taking into consideration I don't have any favorites, and I don't care for a subject about people living on a ship and keeping a baby.

But when a mysterious stranger returns years later asking for the return of his child, the desperate woman tries to hide the child - and brings upon her village the anger of the sea and the seal people.

Am I going to return the copy I purchased through Amazon? No - it's no fault of the vendor's that the video is of low quality. They delivered the goods as advertised.

I am returning these boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy, too short, and with a chemical stench that sinks into your skin","review":"This is the first time I wish I could give negative stars to a product bought through Amazon.The worst part isn't that these gloves are ridiculously fragile; nor that they're so short they don't come close to covering my wrists. It's the smell I can't get over.The smell doesn't hit all at once, but after a few minutes it's nauseating. That's bad enough, but then a chemical stench lingers despite thorough, repeated scrubbings with hot soapy water. It isn't the smell of an OR or a hospital, if anybody's wondering. Think factory run-off.It actually makes me wonder if there's a health hazard involved here (and I don't scare easily about that kind of thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"these work great for my needs","review":"these gloves work great and fit well.

How can I complain about what it doesn't do or have when I wasn't willing to put out another $6 for the retractable cord, diffuser, gel handle, and stronger fan. This little hair dryer is pretty incredible actually and once I stopped being a brat I realized just how well it worked. Did it dry my hair quickly?......... YUP! Was my arm dead tired and soar afterward?...........NOPE! Did the noise wake the neighbors?...........NOPE! Was I able to save a few bucks?.....YUP! And there ya have it.

I just know it works, it's hot enough for me. There are three settings for the heat: low, medium, and high. I also like the flat head it comes with.I hope it could have come with a fold-able option 'cause this blow dryer does take up some space. It's a pretty awkward shape to be stored in my cabinet. The cord also isn't retractable, like my old one, which lasted for over ten years. The cord is short, but if you're just using it inside the restroom and not walking around the house with it, it should be fine.I don't understand what's the function of that extra button with the snow design on it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work smooth","review":"Bad dryer, Doesn't work as expected.

Also the attachment seems useless. A comb would have been far more appropriate. With that said, it works like a charm! The temperature switch could have been better placed as well, It wobbles for some odd reason and the cooling button is directly were you would place you hand. Just seems weird. But the heat is great!

It worked well every day between when I receieved it a few days later until yesterday, October 9th. However, on October 10, it simply stopped working. At all.It did not overheat and stop working, it just won't turn on. There are actually a series of instructions on the dryer itself about what to do if it stops working. First, clean out the lint. I did that, but there was barely any lint anyway because, as I mentioned, I've been using this dryer for under 4 months. That didn't work. I also tried resetting it with the buttons. Nope. It just simply doesn't work.Maybe I just have bad luck, that seems entirely possible. It seems like things only break for me when I'm too broke to replace them. I certainly don't want to have to run to Target tonight and buy another hair dryer when I JUST bought one less than four months ago! Things also only ever break when I don't have a lot of time.I'm sad. Money down the proverbial drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"efficient, powerful","review":"I didn't pay much for this hair dryer, but I sure do like it.

Luckily it's a fast read so not much of my time was wasted.For me, a book's worthiness is what I remember about it months later after reading about it, and I can tell you what I remember about this book is that it was a disappointment.If you are looking for an dressage- and adult-themed, entertaining book about a horse, try The Chronicles of the $700 Pony, which made me laugh out loud constantly. I read that book perhaps two years ago, and it remains one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horse humor at it's best...","review":"I thought my boyfriend wore the crown of being the funniest person to crack a joke about us equestrian enthusiasts until I read this book. The author reminds us fellow life long novices the art of staying patient to one of the most self degrading activities a woman can embark on. Along the way between laughs, she sneaks in little bits of information that shed light on my own person confusion. Thank you, Ms Odgers for clarifying that I was working with a classical instructor versus a competitive one. 2/3s of my dressage life has been demystified thanks to you. However, if you are new to riding or the snobbery surrounding the art of dressage; my advice to thoroughly enjoy this book, make sure you learn some dressage jargon first. For the rest of us dressage queens, get ready to laugh your butts off, or should I say seats?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have made a nice movie","review":"Or they could have done an entire season on this book. The characters are well done and their easy denial or miss-interpretation of the facts around them carries the spirit of the show well. The author has a good time with the secondary characters even if the character of Abigail could have been a bit more solid. Maybe it was because she wasn't in the show but I didn't find her character to be that well fleshed out and she seemed to accept the Addams too easily.Still a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"not you typical May-December romance","review":"I wasn't sure I even liked these two characters- a spoiled Elizabeth, stillbeing supported by her parents at her age (late 20's), and Chase, almost rude, hermit-like and 17 years older, but I must have, I was rooting fot them both the whole way as they struggled with their confusing feelings and with outside pressures and interference.It was as if they had to find each other to find the rest of their personalities-andwhen they did- I really started to enjoy them and the story. Definitely worth the read. Not the typical romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price!!","review":"This DVD of Clay Aiken in a PBS special concert is well worth the price. If you love the sounds of classic songs sung by a magnificent voice, this DVD is for you. Clay Aiken adds little nuances to each song to make it his own.

This is a don't miss!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome and truly entertaining","review":"This is a wonderful DVD with great song choices. I saw this on PBS and had to get this but was disappointed only because it did not include the song \\"In My Life\\" as shown on the program which is one of the reasons I wanted this. Other than that disappointment, this is a excellent DVD that I can watch over and over. Clay Aiken is one performer that you just have to include in your music collection.

If you like 50's and 60's favorites sung extremely well...you have to have this one.My favorites...Misty...the duet with Linda Eder of Crying...the best version of It's Impossible I've ever heard...You Don't Have to Say you Love Me.

Bayou Moon has all the best ingredients -touches of voodoo; seances; Southern customs, crimes and culture; dirty politicians; colorful characters and a heroine and protagonist who sizzle. Solving Migon Thibeaux's mystery of what happened to her mother and her mother's lover produces a wonderfully twisted plot. I enjoyed trying to discover \\"who done it\\" and was continually surprised to find who the bad guys and the good guys really were! This is a good read! I look forward to Bevill's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Solid Attempt at a Decent Mystery","review":"I have to give credit where it's due- I actually completed this book, so it couldn't have been that bad. However, I completed it with no real interest or passion for the main characters. If the heroine had died, if the love interest hadn't worked out, I would have left the book with the same sense of dissatisfaction which I now have. Mignon, the heroine, might just be a little too beautiful, rich and successful to pay attention to. The story a little too contrived to really get wrapped up in. A lightweight read to carry with you for coffee breaks at work, but not the sort of book to encourage snuggling under the covers with for a long, intense evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Location of the bodies revealed within 40 pages????","review":"Not only does this author not know a thing about Louisiana from a personal point of view, she revealed the location of the bodies by spending way too much time talking about the cistern within 40 pages of beginning the book.

Good for anyone over about 10 years old.","review":"Hey, please don't expect anything of this movie and you'll probably enjoy it. I'm a fan of 50s sci fi films, and I made my kids watch it with me last night. They were dreading it, but by the end we were all in hysterics (except for my 8-year old, who was too young to understand much of the deadpan humor.)Part of what makes this so entertaining is the way it seemingly takes itself so seriously. The extras, including interviews with the stars, are hysterical as well.To give you an idea, the hero spaceman's name is \\"Urp.\\" If that doesn't strike you as funny, then you probably won't enjoy the movie ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesey Whiz","review":"Some might think this boring, low budget, supposedly stereotypical of the 1950's, alien-crashes-on-earth film has merit as a spoof, but it isn't sufficiently funny.

When they made this movie, they followed the old school movie formula perfectly, but updated it with modern technology. It was a joy to watch this movie and remember the time I watched this type of movie when I was a kid (in black and white of course). It is entertaining, the music was perfect for the time period (loads of violin music was supposed to be eerie) and the acting was just like the old days...bad. BUT, that is how the acting is supposed to be! It was probably difficult for the stars to forget their training and try to be retro. For old style entertainment and nostalgia, this is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it!","review":"Please don't take this movie too seriously. It was meant to be a comedy, a 50's style alien sci-fi movie filmed with modern cameras and equipment. If you want some light entertainment you will enjoy this movie. I loved the added touch of a true 50's classic movie playing at the town theater. :)I wish I had that old Chevy truck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loving Homage, most enjoyable","review":"I am among the biggest fans of bad sci-fi films, and I was pleased to see this film taking itself so (semi-)seriously, a real tribute to the neglected genre. Period detail is perfect, and everyone involved seems to really buy in to the narrative. I won't blab away plot, but I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves the 50's schlock. This really is not a parody, rather a tribute, and is meticulous in its profound love of the genre. DVD extras are quite plentiful, with faux-interviews that are hysterical, and an insightful interview with director, R.W. Goodwin (X-Files). There's over-the-top performances from Eric McCormick and Robert Patrick, and I'd really like to see more of Jenni Baird. She gave a very centered performance, as if nothing could be more serious (and fun). Kick back and enjoy. I liked it a lot.

Almost as good would be someone creating something so close to the style of that music that it could almost pass for an original. Well to the lover of \`50s SciFi thrillers that is just what has been created in Alien Trespass. All the expected thrills are there, the crashed alien ship, the one-eyed monster, the small town sheriff, even the teenagers that no one believes. Done in a style that is pure \`50s.Great cinema this is not - but nor is it supposed to be. What it is is great fun.

Do yourself a favor, get coppies of \\"Forbidden Planet\\", and the original \\"Thing\\" a nice big bowl of popcorn and ENJOY. \\"Alien Trespass\\" serves well as a pay day for has been actors Dan Lauria(Wonder Years) and Robert Patrick(Terminator 2).

Popcorn, drink, a real balcony and a 50's style sci-fi movie, what could be better. And for the actors, real \\"B\\" quality. For the most part, a real homage to sci-fi. Blob and It Came from Outer Space comes to mine. Unfortunately, Eric McCormack in trying to act like a 50's B actor, over acted his part. He seems to be posing. Look I'm Richard Carlson, no I'm Hugh Marlowe, no I'm Grant Williams, etc. Lot of fun at the theater. You can go back. Not sure if the prerelease price is worth it ($19.49).Oh.

The actors were stiff and unconvincing for the most part with their characters. The sheriff had no sympathy from me and the least convincing of his role. The girls were pretty, but someone forgot to give them brains as with most of the characters. The special effects put the point across, but considering that it's a modern take on 1950 or 1960 scifi movie, these needed more of the technology of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Information about each subject.","review":"I felt this book did not give enough information about the subjects they were to have special sections for.

It's now just a story about a gang of boys....oh, and Circus became a girl. I guess they thought it'd sell to girls too if they added a chic. Very confusing to my boys who have heard the story and know that Circus is a BOY. Very disappointing that God can't even be in a story whose original purpose was to share God.

I guess with a front line of Randy Sandke (tp) Harry Allen (ts) and Howard Alden (g), one would expect as much. More than half of the tunes are taken at a very brisk tempo, the best being LADY BE GOOD (great Allen-Alden unison chorus near the end), THE CLAW (terrific Flip Phillips tune that features Allen and Alden), JUBILEE, and TICKLE TOE (excellent Sandke and Allen). Terrie Richards sings on four tracks in a beguiling, smoky voice; two of her vocals (THEM THERE EYES and WHAT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT CAN DO) reminded me very much of Carmen McRae's versions on her SINGS BILLIE HOLIDAY album. Everyone certainly came to play the evening this was recorded live at the Amerika Haus in Hamburg, Germany.

Timely, insightful, powerful, it cries for a translation into English. A collection of short stories of different calibre and scope, strongly rooted in the modern existence, that touch the essence of the human spirit. His short story \\"Blanco Es\\", for example, is a parable that applies directly to the illusion of wealth brought about by the drug-boom of the 80's. It makes one of the most insightful portrayals I have seen of the then in the rise drug-lord Pablo Escobar. But more than that it shows the roller-coaster of emotions and the changes drugs and money bring about to an unsuspecting fishing village in the Caribbean. The way Espinel structures and tells this one story justifies this whole book.

It's like reading about the events surrounding The Dalek's plan to use the Time Destructor to conquer the galaxy as reported by the New York Times. Dry and lifeless. So much more could have been done. See the novels The Power of the Daleks or The Mythmakers as examples. Still, it is the only way to experience the story and the Doctor Who fan(and that is the only one who would ever read it) can bring his or her imagination and knowledge of the show along to spice things up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana for anally-retentive neophytes.","review":"After purchasing 4 other iMac books, I took someone's recommendation to try Williams' approach. It did the trick: it presented computer/iMac literacy in accessible step-by-step tutorials and clearly told me what to do and what not to do. Previously, the combination of my ignorance and impatience resulted in nothing but crashes, hung programs, and Luddite sentiments. This book forces you to slow down and learn. The author's sequence of lessons is logically conceived, and the style is neither forced nor patronizing. For the next stage, I may go back to the Pogue books (Dummies series), as the author covers more ground and in a zestier style. But I wish I had saved myself some time and money and started with Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"For computer beginners only","review":"This book is WAY too basic for most computer users. I would even think it is too basic for computer beginners; eventually, you're no longer a beginner, and this book will have NOTHING for you.But, if you know someone who's been living in a hole for the last twenty years and has never worked with ANY computer, it is a well-organized introduction to the iMac. And, it's not as gratingly nerdy as the \\"Dummies\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book isn't worth its price.","review":"This compact volume is cute and does explain some things. But there isn't a clue as to how to execute an elementary maneuver such as changing your internet browser or your preferences. Furthermore, the book seems to be a hasty patch-up job using material from earlier MAC books by the same author. I would urge readers to look elsewhere for printed help with the iMAC computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but needs two spaces after the period. Really.","review":"William's \\"Little iMac Book\\" is friendly, informative, and well organized. I've been a Mac user since the \\"Fat Mac.\\" My brother lives across the country and works as a musician: rather inept at anything slightly technical. He badly needed to get on the 'Net, so I gave him an iMac for Christmas. Expecting to hear gales of joy, I was disheartened when he got the thing and couldn't make it go. (No written documentation!) This book is written for him.

This is not the best book for beginners, since it jumps from moving the mouse to icons. Although it is very informative, I found that there is a lot more to the iMac then what she wrote. The computer has so many possibilities and the book is so small, page-wise. Also, the pictures and text are small and hard to read. Get this if you want, but the better, more fun and informative book is definitely The iMac for Dummies by David Pogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"Fortunately there are now more iMac books to choose from, and not just this one, which is not worth the money. It doesn't tell you anything about the FAX, nor does it tell you how to customize desktop, nor how to drag & drop other data from the Zip drive. It appears to be written for grade schoolers who never used a Mac before. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for all levels of Yoga","review":"I truly enjoyed this book.

No need to sweat or join a health club, no expensive shoes to buy!

It's got a terrible emphasis on slimming and trimming, as opposed to opening and stretching. It's heavy on the kind of spot exercises you could find in Cosmopolitan magazine. It's aimed only at women (housewives, specifically), and it has very little in common with any other yoga books, tv shows, websites, classes or resources out there. There's not even a basic sun salutation in the book!

I got some hose clamps and stopped the leaks. Then, today...I turned on the mister, which was just fine yesterday...and the Auto Drain valve failed and shot water across the yard. I don't feel the need for a drain, so I cut it off and plugged the tube with another hose clamp. To be fair, they DID offer me a refund, but I'm so used to things Not Working the first time, I decided to cut my losses and just be done with it. I do NOT recommend this system.

On the other hand, it has given me an idea of a money saving tip for the mystery meatballs which can help readers of this book save lots of $: garden snails (escargots) are a free, easy-to-find replacement for the ground beef or turkey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful, achievable","review":"I read through this book in 2 days! I was so motivated to start my OAMC, even my husband is in on it. I love how she outlined step by step how to prepare, how to get started, and all the little tips in between. This is genius. I too homeschool and have 5 children (under 6) at home and I'm a working mom (full time night shift) so this is probably the best thing me and my family can do to free up time and money! This is a must, I don't know how anyone could give this book a bad rating. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More good than bad","review":"It's true that some of the recipes taste terrible and many of them are repeated. It's also true that I have been unable to save AS MUCH time and money as the author claims. However, I'm giving it four stars anyway because it really does have a lot of good ideas in it, and it has made it possible for me to save enough time and money to be worth the price of the book. I like the Mexican bean noodle dish, and my husband likes the turkey manicotti. My daughter won't eat any of it, which probably only goes to show that she has better tastes than ours. Still, the book is worth buying and I plan to use some of the ideas with more edible recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frozen Assets Not an Asset on the Bookshelf","review":"I got interested in freezer cooking and purchased the book \\"Frozen Assets\\" after finding lots of tasty recipes on the internet. I should have stopped before I bought the book, because not only does the author repeat recipes constantly throughout the book, at the time most of the recipes were available on the author's web site (although they are not at this time). There's not a lot of variety in her suggestions, either. I'm sorry, but if my family had to eat cheese enchiladas seven times in one month alone, they would mutiny on me!I think the cooking ahead idea is wonderful, and for someone with little imagination and no internet access, the book is a boon. But for the rest of us, we can just scour the net for recipes and get the rest of the information on how to get started from websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, lousy results","review":"I am single and busy and I need quick and easy meals. After vowing to quit buying expensive deli food, I found this book and gave it a try. Pros: I've spent much less on food, my freezer is still about a third stocked after about five weeks of eating the meals I prepared. The food is easily portioned into plastic bags to throw into a cooler for lunch and dinner at work. Cons: The food is awful. The only thing I look forward to is a chicken soup recipe. The rest of the tomato-sauce-based meals are bland. I would be embarrased to serve them to a guest, especially the lasagna and broccoli quiche. I keep adding ingredients as I reheat the meals to jazz them up. Overall, I've saved cash on deli food, and it's nice to have a hot meal twice a day. But I won't be using the book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gourmands beware!","review":"If you are an accomplished (home) cook or a chef than this book will be a disappointment. The recipes are not adapted for freezer shelf life.

Actually I was not quite this bad. The recipes for 30 days contain 14 pounds of fat dense meat, 2 chickens and 4 pounds of cheddar cheese. The spices are not those that will educate the palate of children - the most adventurous is packaged taco seasoning. If you are looking for a book with recipes of the sort found in the school lunch program in the past, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me time and money.","review":"More of a time and money management book than a cookbook.

There were really some that i wouldnt even consider eating BUT that is true of all cook books frankly... this book gives many options for freezing food (all at once..doubling recipes... etc) It gives insights when you have very little freezer room too (like the top of fridge freezer) i found this book the MOST helpful on the subject ...i would have given it a 5 if i liked more of the recipes...or maybe if the recipes were written with more subsitution possibilites"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this book","review":"I am brand new to freezer cooking.(Cooking at all, in fact) I bought two books at the same time. \\"Frozen Assets\\" and \\"30-Day Gourmet\\".\\"Frozen Assets\\" tells you what to eat for 30 days and gives you the recipes. Another chapter tells you what to eat for 10 days and gives you the recipes, Unfortunately it repeats the same meals from the other chapter. If I was going to try to freeze for only ten days I could have chosen my own ten. But the same recipe can be repeated 3-4 times in the book. I looked at the recipes and only found 1-2 that looked appealing to me. I was really disappointed. I wish I hadn't bought it.I love \\"30 day gourmet\\". It taught me how to adjust my recipes and had 100's of others to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't impressed.","review":"I was really looking forward to getting a copy of this book because most of the reviews were so positive, but I was really disappointed, mostly because of the recipes. First of all, there really isn't that many. Also, I don't understand making \\"home-made spaghetti sauce\\" and using store-bought spaghetti sauce in it! I thought there needed to be more chicken recipes, and why are some of the recipes repeated 2 or 3 times? I felt like I was ripped off, the recipes are low-quality and low-quantity. However, the freezer instructions are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a realisitic cook book","review":"This book gives outlines and and specific menu plans. The recipes are diverse, and adaptable, you can make substitutions where needed or wanted. The recipes are also almost all family pleasers. I would highly recommend it to anyone starting out with bulk cooking. A real gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook for a day, oh yea!","review":"I am a person that hates spending so much time in the kitchen everyday. When I bought this book and tried it I was so pleased at the results that I can just pull a meal from the freezer to serve and I am not spending an extra hour in the kitchen instead I can spend more family time and the kids love that because they have my full attention. Buy this book now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"What gets me the most about this book is using the old urban legend Neiman Marcus' recipe that has been out for decades is claimed in this book as her own: [...]a cookie I have been making for years and years! : Debra Taylor-Hough toots her own horn at how her neighbor's spouse said she could get rich making these cookies! Yeah it is a good good cookie recipe but not the original recipe Ms. Taylor-Hough, and I wonder how many other recipes were not given the proper credit, a big no-no for authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't feed this trash to your family","review":"The concept of bulk cooking is something I've been doing for years. And you can do it too, without \\"studying\\" the concept. Simply make it a rule to never cook one meal and you'll soon work out the details in a way that fits your lifestyle.But for goodness sake, don't feed yourself or your family the junk suggested in this book.I felt this author did a disservice, because so many people are desperate to save time. It isn't a savings if the time you save is spent at the doctors office, or so fatigued from a bad diet that you can't do anything but sit glassy-eyed in front of a television. This kind of diet doesn't grow healthy kids, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Bad Execution.","review":"Although I like the idea behind this book, I would say that it falls short on many levels. First of all, it is a book that is designed to save you time and money yet recipes are repeated for goodness sake-That is a WASTE of my time as well as a waste of my money as the book could have been half the size! I'm offended that the author would even think that repeating recipes would be acceptable in a cookbook. In addition, these recipes are very unhealthy and loaded with fat. On the plus side, I can probably use the helpful ideas in regard to meal planning and freezing to create healthy meals for my family. I would suggest you get this out of the library before you spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, Redundant, Recycled","review":"The same handful of recipes, over and over and over and over...no advice or guidelines as to how to freeze dishes or what changes to expect beyond \\"try it and see what happens\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great planning, poor recipes","review":"I agree that this book helps the novice once a month cook to plan, buy and cook the meals. However, the recipes for many of the dishes are not what was expected. For example, in the section for the once a month cooking, it says to have 3 meals of one of the dishes, but the actual recipe calls for you to divide it into 4 parts. And I am very disappointed in how many times some of the recipes are in the book. As someone else stated, taste is a very personal thing, and I knew going into this that we may or may not like everything. But that is part of the learning process of this, as with anything else that is done in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best team-up ever.","review":"If anything it was worth it just to see Mark Bagley draw Batman and see Spider-man fight the Joker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what everyone has been complaining about","review":"We have had this Kegerator for over 5 years.. it has sat in our garage, here in the Dallas area year round...The garage goes from 30 degrees or less in the winter, up to 140 degrees in the summer, and the Danby keeps the beer a constant 34-37 degrees... it has never failed us.... this has been one of the best purchases we have made...I am very glad we did not listen to many of the reviews on this unit or we would have missed out.It's amazing, with the negative marks on this unit on Amazon, over 5 years later, the company is still selling the same unit... must mean they are doing something right or they would have discontinued it years ago....I highly recommend this unit... it will save a ton of money down the road!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Discontinued","review":"This product has a major flaw with the temperature control panel on the top front.

After a few more days the unit failed to cool at all. That's where the fun began, serval calls later we finally had a service tech out who took it back to the shop... and that was 1 month ago - calls to Danby and the Service tech get answers of \\"we are waiting on a circuit board from China - should be arriving in a few weeks\\".

Doesn't maintain a temperature and some kegs don't fit, either they are to tall for the unit and you need to purchase a different tap or an shallow unit elbow piece, or the door doesn't close all the way. The compressor unit just fried itself leaving me with a house that smelled of burnt plastic and an expensive bill from the electrician who came to make sure I didn't fry any wires within my house.

I ordered in lilac (received the crystal blue- no big deal, but still!). I read many of the reviews and wasn't too terribly concerned about the wrinkling issues since my concern is softness - period. However, wrinkle factor with these sheets is so extreme as to be almost funny; shrinkage is massive (after two washings, bottom sheet barely fits at all and i'll be tossing them out after 5 washings, would imagine).

If you can pick this up for $4 or $5, then go for it, but don't expect more than a hint of what the films were really like. And definitely do NOT use these transfers as a model for what silent film is like--it would kill the love before it got started. The maddening calliope music for 3 of the 4 films is wretched: it is much better to turn off the sound and play different background music.

My sorority doesn't fit the supposed trend at all, as we are as diverse as the campus and do not haze in any way, shape or form.

The broad generalities were ridiculous. Not all sorority girls get drunk have sex and are anorexic. In fact over 20 of my 50 members do not drink and we're not even allowed to have scavenger hunts because it is nationally considered \\"hazing\\".More offensive than the picture she paints of sorority girls was the fact that she shared so many secrets about ceremonies.A great deal of the information she acquired are things that we in our sorority have NEVER written down but has been passed down for over a 10o years through traditions and secret ceremonies. I was upset to see some of these things written down in a book that bashed the greek system.I'm not saying all greeks are perfect but to conclude that most are like the ones in this book is just upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun book, but not worth the hype","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be reasonably accurate. However, as others have stated, there's nothing really new here. So, \\"general\\" (i.e. white) sororities are shallow and not every member is happy or friends with every other member in her chapter. Sororities are more about partying than they are about service. We all knew this going in.The bigger problem I had with the book was the author. Robbins' style and tone were not even remotely \\"unbiased\\" or objective. She seriously had it in for these sororities and greek life in general. Yet she also had a vague sense of idolizing them and wanting to fit in with the sisters (check out the part where she describes herself as passing for a college student friend of the girls.) It just seemed like she had some issues of her own to work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias hidden behind a veil of neutrality","review":"Throughout the book, Alexandra Robbins tries to stress that she is attempting to provide readers with an unbiased perspective of sorority (and greek) life on college campuses. However, it is clear that Robbins has deep-seated feelings of negativity towards sororities and this book has been created more to air those than provide a reader with a fair view of organizations she covers. I would argue the only thing she presents with a neutral perspective is the positive aspects of sorority life whereas any shred of negativity is emphasized and explored. Most sections in the book also end on a negative note. Also, the fact that Robbins has absolutely no in-depth understanding of how a greek organization works is painfully obvious to those of us who do.This book is same biased garbage that everyone else is peddling about the greek system. If you actually want to learn more about being greek or how to affect real change in the system, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring","review":"I've read a lot of books about fraternities, so I thought I would give this one a shot. After reading the whole thing, I read the book description again and laughed. Here is what it says:The sordid behavior of sorority girls exceeded her worst expectations -- drugs, psychological abuse, extreme promiscuity, racism, violence, and rampant eating disorders are just a few of the problems. But even more surprising was the fact that these abuses were inflicted and endured by intelligent, successful, and attractive women.Let me warn you that Robbins doesn't come close to even scratching the surface of what it really happening on campus. The wild stories I could tell you would make Pledged seem like a children's story. Robbins just doesn't succeed in exposing the wild and crazy behaviors of college students. Maybe this is because her main characters are all females or maybe the college campus where this story takes place is much tamer than my school."},{"rating":"2","title":"If nothing else...it's entertaining","review":"This book has received some serious backlash and I find most of the criticism to be \\"over-the-top\\" and unnecessary. If nothing else, this book is a quick read and very entertaining. However, I wonder how the author was able to obtain the girls' stories. She mentions that she was an undercover student at State U. She clearly did not become a pledge or sister, so did the girls report to her on a daily basis with the details of what was going on in their lives? The vague explanation the author gave regarding how she obtained the stories makes me question the veracity of the stories and wonder whether they are fictional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never was Greek but....","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, through reading it I kept in mind that some of these events probably only happen in a few chapters throughout the US. However, it does happen. I never belonged to a sorority, but I had two friends belong to them, they loved their sisters and said the good things that happened in the sorority far outweighed the bad. And that's how I felt when i read the book, there were some bad things writen, but all the good things, parties, fundraising, the closeness the girls shard...far outweighed the bad things. I mean seriously, put just 20 girls in a house and don't see if you have these kinds of issues Greek or not. It's part of life, and it doesn't mean that you have to get defensive about it.I highly recommend this book.

I have had a great time in my sorority, but now that I'm about to graduate (I am on the 5 year plan) and have gained a bit more maturity, I can see some of the things we do are ridiculous. Most are great, but some...well...I'm surprised nobody got seriously hurt. This is a good book, a great \\"fly on the wall\\" or voyer book.

I don't think anyone is going to deny that some -- perhaps even most -- sororities have their problems but the world that Robbins sketches for the reader is so distorted that you have to wonder what animus she has for them.I was also particularly appalled that she would reveal the secret handshakes, rituals and slogans of several sororities. That's just disrespectful to the people who hold these harmless things dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I feel as though someone invaded my home and wrote about it. Actually that was my home during my college years and no matter how well some critics think it was written, it was an invasion of privacy of life that should not have been done.

Plain and simple, either you are Greek or you're not - and the author is not (THANK GOD!!!) This book was boring, and it focused on the things and ways to put down Greeks.

It was just not an accurate portrayal of Greek life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, boring, uninformative read","review":"When I first heard of this book, I thought it sounded interesting. I wasn't Greek at my university, and I was interested in getting more of an \\"insider's\\" perspective. However, this book did not meet my expectations.This book does not reveal anything that a person who went to college, Greek or not, wouldn't already know. College students, again, Greek or not, drink a lot? Sometimes they have sex? Sororities cost a lot of money? No way!Frankly, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. The stories seemed trite; the use of the girls' away messages to introduce the new topics got old FAST. I didn't find myself caring about any of the characters [and I do mean characters; this book definitely veers towards the \\"fiction\\" end of the scale], and this further took away from my enjoyment of the book. I am just so glad I found this book at the library.This book is presented as an exposé. It is anything but."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written glimpse into sorority life","review":"You'll notice most of the reviewers below complain about this book not because of the way it was written, but because of what it says. Robbins does exactly what she says she is going to do--present the lives of a few sorority girls as they happened. No more, no less. This book may or may not be a good indicator of what life is like for countless other sorority girls in the countrty, but that is not the purpose here. If you have personal experiences with a sorority that you found to be different from those told in this book, that's probably a good thing. Count yourself lucky. This author does a pretty good job of presenting these women exactly as they are. It is up to the reader to judge who or what made them that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to sleep","review":"This book lacked any real insight into what is going on in sororities. The author continually mentions how she was trying to be fair in how she depicted the girls. It seemed to me she left a lot out, just to be friends with these people once the book was written. I could only get through a few pages at a time before getting bored. If you want an insight into sorority life and how the girls really are, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars if I could-- hugely disappointing","review":"What a disappointment! I'm really shocked by how negative, one-sided and poorly presented this book is.I picked up Pledged thinking it might be an interesting, if somewhat critical look at sorority life. However, it turned out to be just an outright indictment of the Greek system, without any reasonable discussion of its benefits. There was no balance to it whatsoever, as if the author had decided what she wanted to write before embarking on any research and then only looked for antecdotes that would back up her pre-existing idea that sororities are bad for women. That's just really amateurish writing. And it created a book that has little to offer the reader other than horror stories.I'm really disappointed in Pledged, because I was very curious to read about this subject. Unfortunately, the book is not terribly informative and somewhat hysterical in tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"Ms. Robbins does nothing more than re-state tired stereotypes without a sufficient amount of supporting data. It is certainly no expose of the Greek system.From university to university, student organizations vary. Behavior of college students is relatively consistent regardless of membership in sororities or fraternities. There is nothing mystical about it.Unfortunately, this book does nothing more than make it OK (in the eyes of some) to ostracize a particular group of people.

In the end, I had to laugh, because the sex, drugs, and rock n roll she describes in the sororities is nothing new. Heck, every DORM at the Pacific Northwest school I attended was full of sex, booze, drugs, and partying too--you didn't need to join the Greek system to pass out drunk every weekend! The point is, is it any shock that college-age girls are drinking and having sex while in the Greek system? Of course not. Therefore, the whole book is anti-climatic. This stuff is happening in high school. College? Big deal. Partying is half the reason why you go to college for! There's a famous saying: \\"Want an education? Go to a library. Want to party? Go to college.\\" 350+ pages on something we all know is going on. Pfft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fraternity brother reviews","review":"I read this because I was curious.

It has something for everyone. Positive aspects of sororities, negative things like hazing and sex parties, and an in-depth responsible treatment of the issues surrounding sorority life. Women will like the relationships and interpersonal interaction. Men will like the female-to-female physical interaction. Parents will be equal parts proud, intriguied, and horrified at what goes on in a sorority.I loved it. And I'm buying the book for everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"An interesting book, however, the experiences of the main characters did not tally with my own at all. I don't know if a)the author was biased, or b)she was accurately portraying the sororities she visited and they just happened to be drastically different from mine and the other houses at my school. Either way, the sororities she wrote about were shown rather negatively. The book would have been much better had the author bothered to look at the sororities in the northeast US and canada, instead of focusing tightly on the south and the west coast. Then she really would have gotten a look at the diversity within the system.I dislike a lot of the implications that historically white sororities emphasize nothing but getting a man- i joined my sorority because it was full of strong, independent women. maybe this is true elsewhere (?) but the fact that the author did not even include a mention of groups like mine makes me think this work is rather biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betsey Rae","review":"Betsey Rae shouldn't believe everything she reads!

As a member of an NPC Sorority never in my LIFE have I heard or seen anything described in the few blurbs I've read of the book. Robbins obviously does not know how to research correctly because her use of words like \\"pledges\\" is out dated and no longer allowed to be used. There many greeks in many high positions; almost all of our Presidents have been greek, congressmen and women and many many other high profiled individuals. None of us appreciate being slandered and stereotyped in such ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Author is a Psychopathic Narcissist","review":"Voyeurism her main motive in every one of her \\"literary\\" works, Miss Robbins knows what grabs, what sells.

We appreciate and realize being in a sorority is a privledge and not all people can handle the pressure of sorority and school at the same time.I find it disrespectful that anyone would expose some of these sororities secrets.These secrets she exposed about ritual and other sacred stuff is crossing the line.This woman deserves to be sued.She violated the rights of these women."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an accurate representation of Sorotities across the U.S.","review":"I am a member of sorority and I can tell you that this book does not accurately portray our organizations. It plays into stereotypes and is very one-sided. I was extremely offended by the Publisher's Weekly review that claimed, \\"Historically black sororities... do have a reputation for promoting community service and sisterhood; \\"historically white\\" sororities.. are really just social groups for making friends and meeting guys, despite their claims to academic and service values.\\" I found this claim to be very racist and stereotypical, my sorority participates in plenty of service oppurtunities and we have high academic expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and choppy","review":"Nothing interesting happens in this book. NOTHING! I was hoping for some jaw dropping insight. Instead, the stories are mundane and trite. For example, in one sorority, the girls pressure another girl into breaking up with her boyfriend... that way they can all hang out more and she'll want to go out with them and flirt with boys. Oh that's crazy!!!11"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even well written","review":"I read this as a greek woman who does not consider herself \\"the typical greek\\". Which means that if you asked every person in my life if they thought I would \\"go greek\\", every person would say with 100% certainty that I would remain indepedent. With all that being said, I picked up this book for a good light read about a world that I myself sometimes do not feel completely comfortable in. The book was terrible, I had to push myself to finish it because all of the characters were so flat and unlikeable and the writing was so green. Most people will read this book because of the back cover summary and the close up of the pledge's chests in their P.U.'s (personal undergarments) on the front. If you have to read it, borrow a friends copy or from the library - please don't reward this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias and poorly written","review":"I was very excited to read this book, thinking it would be well-researched and give an accurate picture of Sorority life. Sadly, it doesn't. All the bad things that happen in this book do not happen because the girls joined a sorority, it happened because they were in college. Every college, regardless of having a Greek system experiences drug abuse, eating disorders, date rape, etc. Statistically, in a group of 100 young women these things are going to exist, not simply because they belong to a certain organization. I hope readers realize that this book is more about college life than sorority life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellow journalism at its worst","review":"I would forewarn any worried parents of college-bound girls that this book is far more sensationalist than the critics urging you to read it would let on. The paperback version begins with a convenient dismissal of any would-be critics, claiming the book to be an objective, outsiders' account of what occurs when the typical girl joins a sorority. And it may be a true description of Alexandra Robbins' narrow field study, but it is nothing more than that - a glimpse of two specific sororities on one anonymized campus. There are many Greek systems across the country who do not approach the lewd behavior described on these pages. It is apparent that Ms. Robbins' motives for penning this diatribe are less than pure; I would have been severely penalized by my journalism professors for writing a piece of any length with such skew. Just take it with a grain of salt - and be advised that it's not especially well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I approached this book with the idea that Robbins was going undercover to give a firsthand account of sorority life. I was disappointed to find that she was simply following several sorority sisters, observing and interviewing. The book suffers as a result.Also, it is not organized well. Robbins moves back and forth from the stories (which are surprisingly boring) of the sisters to her research about themes that arise from the sisters' tales.Her conclusion was didactic and did not fit with the tone of the rest of the book.I have no idea why Greeks are so upset by this book (except, as Robbins points out, that they probably have not read it). It is hardly an expose. I was bored and felt that I wasted my time reading it. Current, former, and future Greeks seem a better audience for this uneven, flat book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is too good to write a bad review.","review":"A sister of mine I hadn't spoken with in a while asked me to write a negative review for this book. So I read the book figuring, from all my sister's fussing, that it would be easy to pan. But there was a problem. The very sister who is angry about this book did many of the same things listed in the book -- hazing, drinking, partying a little too closely with a specific group of \\"hot\\" fraternity boys. I know, because I did it too. Look, not everything in this book jives with my college experience, but enough does. It's actually not a bad book, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, trash, lies","review":"This was one of the most inaccurate portrayals of Greek Life I've ever read. Had it been satirical, then that would be one thing; however, the author was clearly trying to stereotype all sorority girls with this one book. A total waste of money. If you hate sororities or are jealous of sorority girls, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Realistic","review":"This book, while it claims to seek out the non-stereotypical girls, was the most stereotyped book I've ever read. It was almost painful to read, much like reading a textbook. I realize that it was \\"researched\\", but there are different ways to write it so it doesn't sound so dull. Never, in all my experience as a Greek woman, have I seen, heard of, or been privy to anything like what was described. I went to a large southern school, and hazing and drugs ARE NOT allowed. Period. The end. Real girls are not allowed to behave in this way, and if they do, they are put on probation.I feel like the outsider looking in approach was not the way to go here. Because you don't see the retreats, the chapter meetings, or any of the sisterhood ties that are there. You only see the surface, and what's on the surface can be twisted and misconstrued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"An interesting expose of Greek Life in American colleges. Robbins was very fair in her report, revealing both the good and the bad of sororities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great!","review":"I would suggest this book to any member of a fraternity/sorority. It's a bit confusing and wordy at times but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Life of Scroll and Key","review":"Apalling. As I read this I am amazed to see how the author gladly gives away secrets of what is supposed to be a secret organization. She claims not to be anti-sorority, yet she looks at everything, from sorority tshirts to key chains, with utter disgust and snobbery.What some people may not realize is that the author herself was a member of a secret society at Yale. You would think she would understand the value of secrecy. Someone should write an expose on Alexandra Robbins and the Scroll and Key society at Yale. I'm sure that someone with her scrupulous unethical behavior would have a few shockers of her own.For a much more accurate account, pick up \\"Be my sorority sister.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Do People Write and Read This Stuff?","review":"I've been involved with my college sorority for over 20 years.

If it is not for you -- stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shock-Lit.","review":"This book shone some light on the horrors of Greek life in college. However, as someone who is *in* a sorority, I think it's more than a bit biased. One sorority doesn't tell the story of all of them and the \\"dangerous behaviors\\" this book focuses on (conforming, eating disorders, drinking, drugs, ect) aren't part of just Greek life... that's what it's like to be in college now. College-students are faced with those sorts of issues every day, regardless of whether or not they are in a sorority/fraternity. She fails to mention the real connections that are made, the academic excellence required by many sororities, and the philanthropic aspects of the sisterhoods. Robbins should put her energy into investigating something that's really a problem, like the over-whelming acceptance of rape and sexism in our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"pledged...","review":"As a member of a sorority in the NPC, I was appalled that this woman was allowed to release private information about these orgainzations. I couldn't even bring myself to read the entire book because I was so disappointed that she misrepresented the greek system as a whole. I cannot believe that one person could attack something that has existed for over 100 years, and has thrived as part of college life. I hope that she is proud of herself for releasing secrets into the public, and making sororities look like nothing more than a bunch of girls with eating disorders, and sex, drug and alcohol problems"},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman is jumping to conclusions...BIG TIME!","review":"You can't judge every sorority by the actions of a few girls! Every greek letter organization is different, I can't speak for anyone else, but I am an active member of a well known sorority and I have NEVER seen one of the problems that the author refers to in her book! Going Greek has been the most positive experience of my life and I think it is horrible that this woman is putting such a negative spin on something she truly knows NOTHING about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed a bit fabricated","review":"The book is captivating, but I couldn't finish it because it jumped all over the place. I pledged a well-known, national sorority in Texas and girls were catty, but not as bad as the book makes them sound. If anyone acted out of line, they were dealt with by a Standards committee. I pledged 14 years ago, so if this is how sorority girls are behaving now, I am horrified!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The not so secret life","review":"I was foolishly disappointed with this book, even though I knew when I picked it up that it wouldn't be a \\"serious\\" read. It is not a brilliant exposé fit for the New York Times - it is more like the book version of an E! Entertainment documentary. Robbins writes about four sorority girls and uses a very fictionalized style to tell their stories (as opposed to a documentary/interview style), which I didn't care for. Frankly, if one wants to read college fiction, there are far better books out there. I would have appreciated more of a journalist's detachment and objective eye.And as for the whole undercover angle - it's not done too well. Nothing remarkably secret is revealed, no new truths uncovered - the observations in the book could be made by any college student. Also, the sorority behaviour is in no way exclusive to sororities. Many high school and college youths behave like the ones in the book, Greek life or no."},{"rating":"1","title":"not accurate","review":"While an interesting read, I did not feel that this book was an accurate portrayal of sorority life. Yes, I am sure that there are some sororities like those in the book (obviously, or it would not have been written) but there are many more with so much to offer. I am a member of a sorority at a public university, and I have never experienced any sort of hazing. (After rush the executive board actually told us that an active member was not even allowed to ask us to pick up a dropped pencil!) I am also a Christian, and not once have I been pressured to go against my beliefs (getting drunk, dressing provocativly, etc).Please do not base your opinion of sororities on this book!! Do some research and most importantly, find sorority members at the school you are interested in and ask them questions! Do not base your opinion of a sorority as a whole on one person and remember that we are human just like everyone else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm..","review":"Entertaining read...but absolutely not an accurate portrayal of true sorority life.

As a recent college grad and fraternity man who worked closely with NPC groups on my campus, it all seems too far fetched. I never saw any of the things Ms Robbins noted. (of course I wasnt privy to the most secret aspects of house and sorority life.) Even if some of those things were true, hows it different from your avg 25-30 year old woman who's all about making connections and spending $ on herself. If Ms. Robbins really wanted to write an expose from the inside, she shoulda just joined as an undergrad. Then she really would have had the proper perspective (not some 30+ something trying to fit in and write about a bunch of 18-22 year olds.) Maybe she just should have written about the exciting scandals of a Journalsm Department at her alma mater. Oh wait, becasue it would be boring and wouldnt sell. Remember, its all about selling books, truth be darned. I read that the movie rights just got optioned on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda becomes clear by the end of the book","review":"I just finished this book and for the first half of it I enjoyed it. Towards the second half it became clear that the author went into the book intending to slam the Greek system. I was in a fraternity in college, and knew many girls similar to the girls depicted in the book. I enjoyed their stories, but when it came to Robbins' criticisms of the rush and pledging systems she did a poor job of remaining unbiased. I found her suggestions laughable. I liked her descriptions of other collegiate social groups that provided better environments than sororities that had less than ten members. That's not an organization, that's a lunch table. I also had a huge problem with the chapter towards the end of the book that served no other purpose than to unveil sorority secrets. That was just wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"not always the case","review":"i have read this and to tell you the truth not all sororities are like that and i would know I am a current sorority member and have been a me,ber of this sorority on 2 seperate campuses in two different areas of the country , one in Kentucky and currently i am at Iowa State. I have NEVER expirienced any form of hazing or have been pushed into dieting drinking excetera. i think that it is sad that sororities are given such a bad rap because from all the girls i know and the colleges i have been to it is so much a wonderful expirience of service and sisterhood. So dont take this book as the complete truth because there are us good sororities out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism","review":"Sororities are a microcosm of the entire student population. Yes, there are members who do things that are deemed inappropriate. However, these incidents are no more prevalent inside a sorority than outside to a non-Greek affiliated college student. Sororities put a name on a small group of people. A target, if you will. This, coupled with the age old tendency of people to hate what they don't understand, lends a negative tone to this book. Although the author states that her experience does not necessarily represent all sororities, it is human nature to try and extrapolate unrelated data, and almost everyone who reads this book will see it as a definitive reference to all sorority life. If you hate sororities, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"She shadowed four women for a year, and this gave her enough information to speak about the nature of every sorority chapter across America? No. She had the research to talk about these four women alone.These problems she is talking about are not exclusive to sororities. Of course, sororities have some problems - as does just about any other organization that exists - but she is blaming sororities for these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"upset","review":"Well, I personally found this book to be horribly untrue. I am not a Greek, but I have many friends who are and just seeing something demeaning to these girls has made me very upset. It just ingrains another bad image of sorority-life into the public's mind. Besides the fact that I do not know any sorority girl who does any of the \\"astonishing\\" things written in the book, the bok also uncovers ritual, which although may seem \\"dumb\\" to some people, it is very important to these people as a family tradition is to some of us. Also, sororities are not all about the social life; sorority girls and fraternity men account as the largest volunteer organization in this country. Personally, this book apalled me and I did not even have to be in a sorority to feel this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly researched and written","review":"I was so disappointed with this book, which I found to be out of date. It listed the incorrect information for several rituals, which made me think the author went by rumor instead of personal experience. You can't base a book on rumor and call yourself simply a reporter. If you were wondering if you should purchase the book, just look at the bibliography of sources. If they are over 20 years old or web chat rooms, it is clear this author is just trying to make a quick buck off anyone who will buy it. Completely disappointing and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities","review":"Thie book claimed to be an unbiased look into sorority life.

The experiences that she wrote about represent \\"college life\\" as a whole. Besides the ritual, there was nothing that was exclusive to greeks. Drinking, Drugs, Sex...you don't need to be greek to do that in college. The \\"characters\\" in the book, in my opinion, were boring and had far greater issues than being in a sorority. These women would have acted the same if they were non-greeks. If there are girls out there that would give in to hazing just to belong to a group, I feel sorry for them. I was not hazed once. In fact, our new members were treated very well and never had to complete silly tasks.

Not just upon Robbins' clearly bias reports from disgruntled greek women, but of her intentions in writing the book.It is entirely unethical for Robbins to publish private sorority secrets; that is a mark against feminism itself. The secrets represent the foundations of centuries of female bonding and empowerment.I applaud Robbins for opening a nationwide discussion on such unsightly topics as rape and drug use within the greek community, but it is not a balanced one. There is an upside for every downside, and usually a bright one. I have spoken with dozens of greek women who credit their house as the reason they stayed in college rather than fall into a lazy dorm routine and drop out.I recommend that women considering rushing greek life speak with women who have been in the system RATHER than read this book as their source of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written to exploit Greeks and sell books.","review":"This book was a quick and easy read, with its tantalizing stories about Greek life: boozing, hooking up, and cutting each other down. Stereotypes exist for a reason, and it appears that Ms. Robbins went in search of proving some of these. I knew many Greeks and non-Greeks, and the problems prevalent in the book were experienced by all of my friends, regardless of any affiliation they had with a social club or fraternity. Its sad and unfortunate that the Greek system was exploited in this manner so someone could sell a few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"really boring book","review":"I couldn't finish this book.

But the bad aspects that Ms. Robbin's writes about are a little far fetched. I do believe that some sororities out there (maybe in Texas) are psychologically and emotionally harmful as she states in her book, but not all. And I think that the information she released in her book about rituals was a little upsetting. My advice to anyone thinking about purchasing this book: Please don't assume all sororities are like this. Because they aren't! Especially the ones on my campus. Books like these sort of add to the already rumored \\"sorority life\\" that is 95% untrue! So when reading this book just keep an open mind and don't assume all sororities are the same!

She stultifies the Greek system by seeking merely to perpetuate a stereotype of licentious behavior. In a nationwide Greek system, one can undoubtedly find any sought after \\"truth.\\" The fallacy in Robbins' conclusion is that she applies such \\"truths\\" to the entire system.

I didn't get pressured into drinking or being thin. I didn't get forced to party with the \\"hottest\\" guys. My chapter had a strict alcohol and hazing code, we jsut didn't do it. Alcohol was not allowed in our house and boys were not allowed on the top floor (the floor that had all of the bedrooms) and after midnight not allowed in at all. No I wasn't in a academic chapter but we had to have at least a 2.5 gpa but many had much higher. This book is extremely shallow and doesn't accurately depicts the Greek life experience.

Pretty much felt like I was reading about my own college experience. I read the book in about 48 hours. It was great. I've also read through some of the reviews on here. How absurd can people get??? Angry that african american sororities aren't mentioned? Ms. Robbins mentions them and holds them up as an ideal for others to follow. Angry that asian sororities aren't mentioned? Write your own book. Angry that Ms. Robbins learned more about greek groups in one year than most of us see in two or three? Well, good for her! Stop complaining about journalistic integrity.

Of course there was lots of drinking, days when we didn't go to class in favor of doing something else, make-out sessions with boys and \\"cliques\\" but that's college whether you're in a sorority or not.I also saw first-hand that girls of all types got bids from houses of all types. I ended up depledging because the experience just wasn't for me (I probably would have stuck with it if I had pledged as a freshman), but I hardly think that sororities are all bad.

Robbins wasn't privy to any of the sorority experience first-hand. Her attempt at Hunter S. Thompson journalism fell short of her goal. Most of her \\"tales\\" could have happened to any girl at any college in the U.S. The true depth of the sorority experience can only be related by those who have gone through the process.

While a good bit of the \\"revelations\\" in this book aren't that revealing to anyone who's been in a University in the past 10 years, I'm glad that the book is out there.

So I've long been curious what my friends-become-sisters were all about. This book, however, disappointments. I so would have appreciated an overview of the sorority system, history, tenants, principles, et al. before being dropped in on Alexandra Robbins' narrative. And she never hooked me. I was constantly trying to figure out who was who, where they were in relation to each other and what they were actually doing. Plus the more I read about these girls the less I wanted to know about any of them. I blame that on mushy writing and poor editing; the subject still interests.

Escape your Shape was not working for me, I was not losing like this book said I would.

If you want typical grammar books, don't buy one that sounds so obviously different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Analysis of English","review":"The premise of this book sounded interesting enough, but sadly, it's just one man's angry ranting over the evolution of a language about which he seems to know precious little. Few if any of his criticisms have any foundation in grammar, linguistics, or logic. Some choice examples: he takes issue with use of the terms 'covert action' and 'pacification,' which he claims are mere euphemisms for 'terrorism' and 'annihilation or slaughter,' respectively. What?! Smith doesn't quite seem to understand that certain apparently identical synonyms actually provide useful nuances in a language, and instead seems to believe that the English language would be better served if it 1) never changed and 2) were pared down to a few hundred words.

The subject, on which I have had interest for a long time, certainly lends itself to a detailed discussion and is worthy of careful analysis, all absent here. I had the opportunity to listen to Ken Smith, the author, on NPR a while ago, and was not surprised to discover that he is not very articulate in person.I would love to see this very same topic analyzed by experts in psychology and semiotics, to profundize on the relationship that exists between language and thought processes. As it is right now, this book is an amusing read, but lacks the necessary depth to be trully insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of bull!","review":"This whining tedious screed is predicated upon the thesis that language shouldn't change. I guess Ken Smith thinks that we should all be talking like Beowolfe.I had to stop reading when he said Quality Assurance was incorrect. Wrong!

It is not a narrative, as the four canonized Biblical gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but contains only the words which, according to \\"theTwin\\" who wrote it, are the direct teachings of Jesus, the Rabbi, to his Disciples. This is the Wisdom He imparted only to his close inner circle. Similar to a koan, these cryptic teachings require great thought and are somewhat paradoxical and perplexing. Dr. Bauman, whose academic credentials are numerous, has translated directly from the original Coptic Greek of the manuscripts which were only discovered in recent years.

If you have read other books in this series, I can only guess (based on the other reviews) that you will enjoy this book. If this is your first stab at the series (like me) save your time. Most of the book is spent going to dinners, parties and meetings with characters from past books. If you've read them, I'm sure this will be a treat. If you haven't, you might prefer sticking long splinters under your fingernails. When finally something interesting happens, everyone has to return to the house, meet an old friend from some previous adventure, and spend the next twenty pages discussing it.

After seeing the glowing reviews, and considering the richness of the locale, I was so looking forward to being immersed in this story. What a disappointment! The characters are irritating beyond belief--there is nothing beyond a one-dimensional view of any of them, and I couldn't care less what happens to them; and the story is so tedious that it's been painful just forcing myself to finish this book. I can't wait to pick up a real mystery & cleanse the mediocrity of this tale from my memory.

All the Edwardian posturing and pseudo-language, way too much dialogue (much of which is racist), and the total absence of believable character development, have left me skimming over page after page to get to the end of this waste of money. Rather than ever show an emotion or break that phony stiff upper lip attitude, they resort to various rooms and locations to banter about ridiculous Edwardian behavior and drink tea or variously, whiskey and soda. This waste of paper is about social class and conversation. No one was ever in danger, the villains are not dangerous and the glories of Egypt are barely a backdrop for a car load of arrogant Brits sailing up and down the Nile. My first and only Peabody novel. Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I really liked the Amelia Peabody installments up to the time when Ramses and Nefret became more active. I think Elizabeth Peters is stretching herself too thin, and should stop with this series.

Don't buy this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I be the only one who hated this book?","review":"Maybe I just don't have a taste for English mysteries. Maybe this book loses a lot when you listen to it on tape, as I did. Whatever happened, this book was a real trial. The characters were more irritating than charming, the plot was a clumsy mixture of any generic Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes story, and the dialogue was contrived. On top of all that, the Egyptian characters were almost insultingly shallow, suitable only for doing the hard work (if they were the good guys) or being messily killed, if they were on the other side. Maybe this was Peters' way of showing British colonial attitudes, but I found it grating. Finally, the heroine's continual ejactulations of her signature \\"Good Gad!\\" drove me downright mad. One more little annoyance in a book full of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like spending time with an old friend","review":"There are no significant new characters developed in this, the tenth of the Amelia Peabody series, nor any significant changes in the behavior of established characters. But fans of Amelia and the Emerson households will enjoy spending time with their old friends as they work their way through another Egypt-based mystery. And there are enough plot twists and unexpected scenes to add interest. Readers unfamiliar with Amelia will still enjoy the story, which can stand on it's own, but would better enjoy it after reading the series in publication order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelia is wonderful","review":"I really love Amelia Peabody Emerson.

So many love stories are full of unrealistic characters and situations. In all Medoff's characters, I can see myself or people I know. I have read this book five or six times, and each time Medoff's humor is fresh and his emotion rings true. \\"Dear God That I'm Pretty Sure Doesn't Exist,\\" the main character prays, \\"please help me to forget the only person in my life I ever wanted to remember even after I'm dead.\\" Medoff talks about love in a way that is familiar to me and at the same time more noble than any feeling I have ever felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very long letdown","review":"After reading and reading and reading, this book just kind of left off without any real conclusion.

The story starts with Lady Godiva's famous ride, and follows how it set off a chain of events, big and small, culminating in the Norman invasion of England in 1066.Godiva and the Golden Dragon brings to life several characters: some real, such as Harold of Wessex, his brother Tostig, and of course the Lady Godiva; others fictional but quite believable. The author weaves their intermingled tales in an exciting saga that puts new twists on the story of the end of the Anglo-Saxon reign in England. The recreation of 11th Century politics is compelling as we witness attempts by various factions to fill the throne after the death of King Edward.This novel could make a wonderful movie as well. Reading this book is a must if you've ever been interested in medieval England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version of the Godiva story","review":"I really enjoyed this retelling of the infamous Lady Godiva tale.

Mine looks the same but much larger. This one is just big enough to fit on smaller saute pans, but it still works great. Make sure you check the measurements of this splatter guard and check against any pans you want to use it on to make sure that it will fit before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyday cook","review":"I had purchased the larger one a couple of years ago and I just love them.

It is that, but when I checked my sausages, I noticed they were unevenly cooked! Parts overdone, parts still pale in color. Turning them, to cook more on other sides didn't help them brown more evenly. They were a mess! Dried and shriveled on the ends, underdone in center places. It must be that the silicone deflects the heat back to the pan in an uneven way. Sure, it reduced the splatters to none, but with it on, the meat did not cook well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a blacklight; just blue LEDs!","review":"I ordered this product to be able to spot \\"accidents\\" by our elderly cat, but this isn't a real blacklight.

It works fine for spotting urine stains, but doesn't seem to work so well on glass. Maybe it was just the way I was using it, but it seems to only highlight specific spots on the glass rather than give it a nice, even, all-over glow that you need for photographing. I think the style of UV lights with the long tube would work better for that purpose than the flashlight style.Still, it does do a great job of lighting up urine stains, so if that's what you're looking for then this would be a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"piece of junk buyer beware! would not buy another, does not work well with UV inks , perhaps stains ewww.. but not inks.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This flashlight was completely non-functioning when received.

The title of the collection alone- \\"The Light Changes in September\\"- seemed to promise lyrical, intelligent, introspective prose, such as I had relished in The Beauty of Men and Ground Zero, and some stories from Men on Men. Very disappointed with the reality! Most of the stories were trivial, dull, and homocentric. Several of the stories deal with isolation and obsession with anonymous sex. A sad comment on the nature of homosexual expression at the end of a century of awareness and growth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe somebody liked this book!!!!!","review":"Frankly, I was disappointed. In one word, this book sucked (no wait, that's three words). Still no real knightly stuff, too much boring nautical junk and a lot of boring parts. I can't believe that I was stupid enough to buy it. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the ending was good compared to the rest of the book. If you're a die hard DL fan, buy it but don't read it.

Bernard brings Talleyrand to life - through the use of the erstwhile bishop's own memoirs & those of his friends - and even his enemies. What came through most was the fabled Talleyrand charm. A modern reader can clearly see why he was as influential as he is reputed to be.

And for anyone interested in sampling this composers vast output of solo sonatas, this is a near-ideal release; the works are all rather early Hindemith, but also Hindemith at his warmest and most immediately appealing. Stylistically, the works are surprisingly varied (at least for belonging to the same opus number), from the spicily dissonant, neo-classical cello sonata to the generally sunny, untroubled viola sonata containing genuinely memorable, almost romantic, melodies.It is possible, I guess, to find competitive, maybe even superior, alternative performances, but no one will be disappointed with these accounts - indeed, the performances are all on a very high level, and the recording is excellent. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly prejudiced towards Mary Beth Whitehead!","review":"Ms. Chesler did not write a factual book.

It is a long video in its entirety, but you can choose to do whatever sections you have time for since Osha does a short centering segment at the beginning of floor and standing sections.

Main reason was that all the reviews were excellent. But Chinmoy's book is superior in every aspect. This book is more a dictionary or overview on meditation and technique than useful practitioners manual.

The book takes up where The Man Who Loved Clowns left off. Although both books are fictional, some of the characters are based on real people. It is so wonderfully written, I cried when I read it.

We (the daughters)give this book four-and-a-half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place","review":"I'm not sure there was much to like about this book. The writing was dreadfully dull and overly descriptive, not at all realistic to what a 12-year-old narrator would sound like. There was nothing captivating about the plot, and most of the characters, with the possible exception of Jake, were horribly two dimensional. It's bad enough that the story was boring and unappealing, but the fact that it moved slowly with no subplots made it even worse. The characters seem cute and quirky, but turn out to be ridiculously simplistic, reminding me of Juno. It seems overall like the kind of book written to be read and analyzed endlessly and pointlessly in classrooms. I did enjoy the fact that there was a wrap-up at the end, allowing for some quick closure and letting the story come full circle, but it's a little disappointing when the only thing you like is the very end of a book.Rating: 1.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Konigsberg At Her Best","review":"Margaret Rose Kane has been saved.

Margaret's quirky Uncles Alex and Morris have been living at 19 Schuyler Place for 40 years and during this time they have built three magnificent towers. As Margaret recovers from a Camp Director who attempted to strangle Margaret's spirit, she soon discovers that perhaps her Uncles are just as much in need of saving.Written as a companion to Silent to the Bone this book will remind fans far more of A View from Saturday. Embodied with a delightfully offbeat sense of humor and wonderful artistic and literary references, readers will find much to like in this satisfying tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par Konigsburg","review":"A great children's author, but not a great book, despite a powerful message.First problem: The characters are aggressively unlikeable for the first third, as if daring the reader to endure them. Even if her camp is overly rigid and populated by loathesome girls, Margaret Rose comes across as an obnoxious, arrogant brat. The \\"colorful\\" squabbling of the uncles also grated on me.Things improve in the middle-sections but the ending--in which previously hateful people suddenly (and inexplicably) become motivated do-gooders--is just bad, expedient fiction.I'd recommend you stick to Konigsburg's many superb books, among which my favorites include Father's Arcane Daughter and Silent to the Bone. And From the Mixed-Up Files, of course, unquestionably a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite and Adorable!","review":"This book sings!

Rather than the laid back hippie he shows himself to be a gun toting confrontational hedonist in search of emotional and spiritual healing. Because of this soujourn, the book often carefully describes the facts of his personal history and existence as he sees them. Also surprising is Fonda's behavior in accepting sub par acting roles and making commercial endorsements in order to support his (and his family's) extravangant lifestyle. Hippie not, capatalist, yes, is how I would describe him. I did find the book to be a good read and found Fonda's writing style to be both personal and conversational.

Let me tell you, it's god awful. There are no maps of any kind, and all the information can easily be found in the official guide. In fact, unlike many unofficial guides, which will occasionally have that extra secret that the real writers left out, this guide actually has less! Although it does have information about the final boss, its not enough to make this guide worthwhile.

I guess it is important to know though that the book is based on a lot of their personal experiences and that writing it was a marvelous bonding experience for them.Having established their loophole and \\"sensitivity credentials\\" the authors proceed to parrot the feminist agenda. It soon occurs to the reader that, from the authors' perspective, the Charlton Heston's and John Wayne's of the world are inherently depressed beyond belief while the Woody Allen's are almost manic.My bottom line: if you're a man this book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This saw is pretty good","review":"This saw is pretty awesome. Plenty of power, was pretty much spot on right out of the box, and I got it at a great price.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the dust management.

Quality components. Dust collection needs improving. No option given for dust bag. Cast miter scale gets covered w/ sawdust as does magnified pointer (Keep an air nozzle handy!) I ended up using a \\"Sharpie\\" to make some of the angles more visible. Dust gets into bevel lock down causing saw head to slide down to 45' bevel, even during a cut. Customizable miter stop feature allows for one stop only...not very helpful when doing crown, base or other cuts where you need a corresponding angle. Fence extensions do not slide far enough out of the way and must be disassembled to reach certain compound angles. Miter lock handle quickly became loose and fell off. Trigger safety button would be nice. Quality laser would be nice. I've owned this saw for about a year and still can't get used to it. I find myself going back to my nine-year-old Makita LS 1211. I would not buy this saw again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"On the plus side:The saw runs smoothly and makes accurate cuts.It also has great cross cut capacity.Good quality for this price range.Drawbacks:It is heavy.Has plastic set screws for the clamp.Feels a bit under powered for framing applications.If you do not make a living with your tools, then this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"IBEROSTAR'S THEME SONG","review":"WHENEVER I LISTEN TO THIS SONG IT BRINGS BACK GREAT MEMORIES OF OUR STAY AT IBEROSTAR IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEXICAN SUN COAST LAST APRIL' OO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not GREAT, Not BAD, just borderline in the MIDDLE","review":"I was never a fan of Dragon Ball because when the show aired on TV it was at 5:30am in the morning. I couldnt watch it on the Cartoon Network because they were way to deep in the story for me to catch up. All i knew about DB is that the artwork and character design is addictive. God Bless Funimation for releasing the new remastered widescreen box sets because i finally see the show that everyone loves so much. I decided to rent the GT series from Netflix to see what it was all about when the Z series ended. I started with the 16 lost episodes when Goku becomes a kid again by accident, anyways it barely kept my attention. But i decided to hang in there. You can see from the very 1st episode that the magic is gone. But overall its still a decent anime. There are far more aime titles out there that are just a mess.

The best scenes are mostly at the end of the series, like when they turns SSJ 4 Gogeta and fight Omega Shenron (By the way,I think the Super 17 saga was way worst than the Garlic JR. saga)But if you still want to watch it and you're a big fan like me, start from the Second Season because the first is really Lame.

Things in it go against the original manga, the artwork is different, and throughout the whole thing you will find yourself going huh? and why?! Not only that but it decimates the original ending with a very dumb one that doesn't even make sense (as much as dragonball might be kinda \\"out there\\" it has always at least had some explanation for things that makes sense). Toriyama did not even write this story, they got greedy for money and wanted to cash in on dragonball. They basically came to him once a week and he would say \\"ya whatever, go away\\".

I bought DragonBall GT with the assumption more is better, but after watching quite a few of these episodes, i can't recommend it. I don't think the plot is good.

How do you think they keep putting out Tupac and BIggie songs? They use past lyrics that the artist does not own. Therefore this CD is a piece of junk, but by no fault of G-Unit.

The reason why I will not even listen to it is because it is just a gimmick for a cheap record company to make money. Think about it. This cd dropped the same day as Get Rich or Die Tryin' Soundtrack. It was put on shelves for people to see it and think that Buck came out with a new cd. It is just old tracks from Buck. They did the same thing with Game and those JT the bigga figga cd's once Game signed to G-Unit. Also, as well as Chamillionaire and Controversy Sells with Paul Wall.

If not for Crabb I likely would not have made it as a Christian.

For instance, Crabb was accused of using psychological tactics like sharing from his own personal experiences to trick people into buying his teachings. What if Crabb was being honest, which I have every reason to believe from the way his thoughts have changed my life????? I would stake my faith on the fact that Crabb's words are closer to God's heart than Bobgans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak guide","review":"Very little useful information in this guide.

The performers are obviously struggling with this music; they are often wildly out of tune, and their ensemble rhythms are very sloppy. The producers and editors have not done a great job, either: somehow they completely missed the fact that the first two beats of Quartet no. 6 have been cut off! The music, however, is very strong (especially Quartet no. 7), and does manage to deliver its message despite the drawbacks. If you're really interested in these works, this is the only way to hear them. If you're merely curious, choose something else - this set would be a very bad introduction to a very fine composer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype...","review":"I was very disappointed with these binoculars from the moment I took them out of the box.

The strap and case I found to be cheaply made, as well. I also found that the only rubber protection is the green colored casing. The black is hard plastic which I feel will be vulnerable to damage when used. I have since found a much better pair of compact binoculars, the Pentax UCF-R, which I enjoy much better and I feel are much better made.

I now have an idea of where to set up crate and play pen, and just important facts to know before buying a pup.I also recommend reading \\"The Power of Positive Dog Training\\" by Pat Miller, which is more of a psychology book about dogs. It teachs dog behavior and how that differs from human behavior. It is a great guide for positive, clicker training.

While almost all the commands you'd want to know are here, too many of the dogs have already learned the commands or seem too preoccupied or bored to be learning what's being offered.

Quite the primer for free-thinking and broad-scoped youths!!!

Christopher not only tells a gripping tale, but explains a philosophy in a way that a third-grader can understand. In my opinion, most books for children write as if the children were stupid and uncomprehending, or only devolop stock moral lessons, but Christopher writes in a way that respects the reader's intelligence and allows the reader to ponder morality for himself. Not only do I recommend the Tripods books for inquisitive souls, but also The Lotus Caves and The Guardians by Mr. Christopher. Both are exceptional books of at least the caliber of the Tripods. If for nothing else, get Christopher's books for the great entertainment value they'll provide the children in your life.

However, the whole book is no more than a written version of a cheap crime chapter from a TV show from the 1970s (like Kojak, Baretta, or Miami Vice). Silly dialogues and the usual stereotypes abound (e.g., the tough-talking, swearing police detective). The twists in the story are no more than people doing or being at the end what they were not supposed to be doing or being.The other reviews here in Amazon (all of them positive) are impossible to believe, and can only be assumed to be written by either the author himself or the publisher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first try -- good choice","review":"This is the first Jonathan Kellerman book that I have read. It was very hard to put down. I'm always excited to find a good author--- I will definitely try more of his books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good story,","review":"but not nearly as good as several other Jonathan Kellerman books I have read. This one is interesting as it really gets into some pyschology.Dr. Alex Delaware breaks away from his usual work and takes on a private patient... a young woman, Lucy. She had been on jury duty full of horrible and frightening details and she is now suffering from a very troublesome dream.As Alex works with her he begins to wonder if her dream stems from a childhood memory and he starts to dig deeper. He finds out that Lucy has had a very difficult and sad life.This mystery novel takes us into con-men's games, pay-offs and multi-murders. Plenty of people have things to hide and Alex and Milo uncover them. At one point Alex's life is on the line!Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly more exciting than hypnosis!!","review":"I found this book to be very boring. Not much happens for the first 300 pages or so. If you can wade through that to get to the story, you might be ok. The descriptions are just so overdone about everything. Didn't like it and would not recommend.Some of his other works are ok but this one is dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Delaware is a great character!","review":"This is the first Alex Delaware novel and it was a very fast and enjoyable read!

Im extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmares Turn Out to Be Real","review":"This is another good page-turner in the Alex Delaware series.The plot is intricate and there is a good blend of psychological intrigue andwho-done-it. Dr. Alex Delaware, psychologist and sleuth, is helping hispoliceman friend, Milo Sturgis, to calm a troubled juror. The juror is havingfrightening nightmares that are scaring him. It appears that these night-mares have credibility. They are an awakening of childhood memories thatothers might want to prevent from surfacing.The cast of characters includes badmouthed writers, very dysfunctionalfamilies, druggies, etc. Dr. Delaware has some fussy professional boun-dares but he's quite likable.This is a good book for the beach, vacation or airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Kellerman.","review":"Self-Defense by Jonathan Kellerman is yet another solid mystery tale, loaded with psychological profiles. Alex the psychologist is asked by friend Milo, the gay detective, to help a woman he has befriended. This part of the story is particularly well done, showing Milo as the protective male. Lucy, the patient has lots of problems, but what makes her a unique character is that she bought none of the problems on her self. Her father and those he's associated with are aging men who illustrate the dark side of the hippie movement. They each used the sentiment of the times to exploit those around them and what Alex learns from Lucy's therapy sessions lead him to believe they are involved in a twenty year old murder. Finding out who died, and how, leads Alex and Milo on a trail peppered with unusual characters as they uncover long buried truths. Definately a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book filled with rants about Penna.

Not very personal or well rounded, just an impersonal diatribe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prison: The Reality","review":"Having worked in a high-security prison for six years as a clinical psychologist, I can attest to the picture of life that Mumia portrayed. In fact, his account felt so genuine to what I saw and experienced first hand. My 82-year-old mother read this book. She was so shocked of the treatment that the inmates received, that she had a difficult time reading parts of the book. She could not believe that in this country inmates are treated, in her words, \\"like animals\\"! Few people are allowed to go behind the walls to see the truth of the goings on inside a prison. This book gives an accurate account to those people who would like to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CALL FOR OPEN EYES, HEARTS, HANDS, AND MINDS!","review":"Mumia's book is not a selfish effort to save himself from execution. Rather, he is the voice of the voiceless who speaks on countless issues, from police brutality to the environment, the prison system to the criminalization of youth. To dismiss this book as solely for leftist \\"idealists\\" is absurd. What does left and right mean when it comes to someone who is given nowhere to go but down? Please open your mind, look at the facts, and be your own judge. So many people are doing that, and support for Mumia is growing as he nears execution. This book will surely be one of our childrens' history texts one day, as those spat upon today are the heroes of tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book from an amazing author","review":"Mumia is brilliant, articulate and insightful.

Not anymore. Reading this book made step back and look at my position of this issue. Here is a man who may or may not be guily of his crime, and if he is indeed not guily, then he will die for something he didn't do. His essays from death row are a vivid, though provoking testament to how our prisons are. We can feel the beatings he describes and the anger and hatred from the guards who abuse him. I am looking forward to reading Death Blossoms, which will no doubt be just as excellent as this first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Out!","review":"The book title and design looks deceiving from the outside.

The only major complaint that I have is not in regard to the performance, but rather with the design. The drive is big, most of which is plastic. There is a considerable amount of space wasted to make the drive look nice. The two plugs for the Firewire cable are located in the back of the drive and are very flimsy. This drive is used for more than one computer and so I must exchange the Firewire cables. I broke off one of the plugs within the first week, simply by pulling the Firewire cable out of the drive. The second plug is loose as well and I fear that even with the utmost care, I will eventually pull it out as well, simply by using the drive.

The only drawback is the volume of the recorder, it's not loud at all. You can max the volume and the speaker still seems lower than other less expensive recorders. Even with the supplied headphones (which is of good quality), not very loud. That's the only thing, it's beautiful in every other aspect.

Instead of getting them all, I got three, I guess it is a good deal. I got the seaworld adventure, volcano mystery, and hotel who-done-it. My guess is that they randomly chose three videos and rap them up together, or just give the three I mentioned.

It deals with almost all of the AFVs in service today, and although it does give some rather superflous details and leave out some others (for example, rate-of-fire for the main armament), it is just about the best low-cost option for anyone wanting a book on modern AFVs. For those who can afford to buy Jane's Armour and Artillery this may seem a little short on content, but for most of us (myself included) who can't afford it, this guide is plenty good enough.

I later showed my husband (this is Mark's wife), and he was sickened by the pitifulness as well; it appears to be a pretty nasty scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for both kids and adults","review":"I read this book today to a 4th grade class and was thoroughly entertained, as were the children who \\"got\\" the tongue in cheek humor more than some adults who also rated this story. If I'm going to read children's books, I want laugh out loud humor. This book did not disappoint. Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated, the book's lesson is that manners and communication will solve problems. The underdog wins, but is still humble in his triumph. Entertaining morality-it's an unbeatable combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...and wouldn't recommend","review":"My daughters, who are now 7 and 10, have loved Frank Asch's books in the past, so we thought we would enjoy this. The illustrations by his son are wonderful, but we did not enjoy the story. It seems to be a subtle, or not so subtle, commercial for a vegetarian lifestyle. The words used to describe the cat make anyone who would dare to eat meat out to be the villain. It's not enough that the poor \\"naked\\" mouse is served live on a platter to the cat at a restaurant, the mouse is left to somewhat bargain for his life.I'm sorry if I missed the higher nuance of this story, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the meat","review":"This is a hilarious take on the predator-prey relationship.

The more mature vocabulary and workplace description is refreshing in a children's book. Mr. Maxwell's celebration of his promotion by eating a live mouse is entertaining. I can't help but feel bad for the cat. It's suited for children who are older and able to tolerate a little bit of gore. It may sway kids to become vegetarians..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY","review":"I was bored of this game just one week after I got it. You have to read the instructions of the game each time you play, there is no way to skip them. I thought I would have lots and lots of different games to play, but on the contrary you only have about 10 games. Each game lasts no more than 30 or 60 seconds, and you only get to play them once each day if you want to save your score (you can keep playing but it won't save your score). Now I get the slogan: MORE TRAINING, IN MINUTES A DAY (literally, you won't get more than 10 minutes of gaming per day)Also, I bought the Brain Age 2 because I am a sudoku fan. Huge Mistake. It has three levels of difficulty, all are pretty easy, also each level has no more than 20 different sudokus to play, so you will finish all sudokus in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up","review":"I played brain age 1 constantly (I still can't say BLUE good enough though). Brain age 2 is a really good sequel. Just as much fun as the 1st one, and you never have to say the word BLUE."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the good stuff","review":"Those who have played Brain Age before, Brain Age 2 offers even more fun trainings that aren't just repetition of the previous version in disguise. Brain Age 2 has a better stylus and voice recognition system which is a welcoming improvement (no more screaming at the DS shouting *blue*). There are plenty of variety in minigames this time to keep you entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game every kid should have...","review":"This is not a super fun game. But it's one your kids should have. Looking at what is available in the market filled with war and combat games with creepy personages and killing weapons, Brain Age is a breath of fresh air. This product aims to exercise your brain and sharpen your abilities in mathematics, music perception and words. It will help your kids with their learning skills at school and with their everyday activities...it will help them keep their brains in shape! (and yours too!).I would recommend this product to kids 8 and older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting Game!","review":"I only purchased my nintendo DS just so I could play this game. Its a lot of fun and I have introduced it to many family and friends who also have gotten addicted to it! Everyday you train you acquire a new training challenge. My only very small issue with this game is that your \\"brain age\\" is not determined by your training, you have to do a brain age check, the check seems to have the same games over and over again. I feel like I am getting a better brain age just because I have played the same games so many times. My brain age is 27, and I am actually 27! The training has an abundance of games to play you just have to keep up with it. Its really fun, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not an ounce of bad.","review":"i likes it. if i can get it back from mom. very addicting. get one for your mom and pops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Game","review":"This game is very tedious. You have to go through the explaination each time you enter a game. My biggest complaint is the Quick Soduku option which only has ONE game. They are the exact same numbers each time you play. This is not true for the main gameplay, but it is a serious flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected.","review":"Before buying Brain Age 2, I read about it and saw commercials for it, so I was pretty excited when I recieved it as a gift. However, the novelty wore off for me after about a month. It soon got to be too boring and tedious. I would definitely recommend renting before buying. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"This game was extremely boring. You do the same 3 things over and over until you master them.

I play it almost every day for approx 15 minutes per day. I'm able to take my brain age test and train in that time. After you complete your brain age test and brain training you receive a stamp for that day on your calendar. My brain age was very low at first until I got the hang of it.The brain training games include numbers and words training. It scores you by your speed and number of items correct. This game is fun right now, I can see it growing tiresome after a few months. I'm sure they will come out with a brain age 4, 5, etc to keep things fresh. I recommend this game, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating","review":"Really gets you thinking. Gets more challenging as you go. I like it, very happy with my purchase.

Grabs your attention and desire to solve everything that appears!! Definetely reccomend for adults and kids!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"When I first got my DS this game was part of the present. I was really excited because I wanted a DS more for NYT crosswords and the like so I thought this would be perfect. Ugh! Not so. This game is pretty boring. There aren't that many \\"tests\\" and you can only record your scores once a day! You CAN play the tests over again to \\"train\\" but puzzles like word jumble (that's not the exact name of the test) stay the same until the next day so there is no real challenge.There is a sudoku game in addition to all of the fake brain tests but that can only hold me for so long. I'm the kind of person that likes addictive games. The kind of games that when you close your eyes to go to sleep you are still playing it in your head. Brain Age 2 can only really be played 15 mins tops a day.Since I bought other games Brain Age has been sitting in the corner collecting dust. Good thing I didn't pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCISSORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAARGH!!!!!","review":"Ok, both Brain Age games are great. I received them as gifts recently and I am enjoying them a lot. The sudoku is great and it has actually sparked my interest in those puzzles. I recommend this title, but my only beef with it is that the voice recognition leaves a little to be desired. There is a rock paper scissors game that requires you to speak into the microphone on the DS, and for some reason, it has extreme difficulty recognizing the word \\"scissors\\" Everytime I have this daily training exercise it causes my brain age to decrease dramatically, not because I have trouble with the exercise, but because it ends up taking the game 10 minutes to understand that I am saying \\"SCISSORS\\". Because of this, it has determined that my brain is 80-90 years old.Fun overall, but ...SCISSORS! SCISSORS!!! SCISSORRRRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game for us old folks","review":"This is a good ds game for us old folks.

My son in 8 and he is able to navigate most of the tasks \\"assigned\\" by the Max Headroom-like teacher and developer of the game. We've actually turned it into a family activity, and my wife and I also do our \\"daily training\\" along with our son. It's not as easy as it looks, and it's challenging to us, too.It really does offer something of substance to a medium that is mostly brain candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brain tune up","review":"This is a good way to keep your brain cognitive functions tuned up. Does however get frustrating at times with entry times being too short if a sign for instance in math is read wrong. That would be my only change, give more time to assess if sign was read by computer incorrectly to enable the ability to change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first DS game","review":"My sister gave this game to me along with a DS platform for Christmas and I have been hooked ever since. The daily training if super fun and I like the whole stamp reward system, where with increasing amount of stamps collected, more training modes are unlocked. The only complaint I have about this is that there are too few training modes! Also, I agree with a previous reviewer that there can be a little too much of Dr. K giving repetitive advice and tips, which can become inane after a while.Otherwise, this game is super enjoyable and keeps my brain alert, even if only for 5 minutes a day. And, since I'm also a Sudoku addict, this is perfect for me. Again, the only complaint about this aspect is that I'm coming close to solving all the Sudoku puzzles; so I'm quickly running out of Sudoku to play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!","review":"I love this game. I didn't think Brain Age could get better but it did! I like this one better than the first one. I hope there is a Brain Age 3!! Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say of a sequel?","review":"I have owned the first in this series since it came out. I was looking forward to the release of this sequel.It has more of the same brain trainings but with a change in some of the methods (games) that complements the original.For a second purchase, you will find yourself switching back and forth for variety. For an initial purchase, you cannot go wrong with getting Brain Age or Brain Age(2).Regardless, there are suduko puzzles on each.Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and educational.","review":"I purchased this together with the Nintendo DS system for my daughter.

It is a good change of mind and rush of senses to answer all the puzzeles. But somehow I find Brain age express- math and brainage express arts and letters more interesting. I don't know if all those contents are in this game cartridge, have to find out after playing for many days and see what all new activities will be enabled. But for a non-VIDEO gaming gamer, this is a good thing to spend time with when -- wife is busy selecting clothes in the mall, and you need to accompany- in commutes taking more than half hour- in airport and doctor office waiting- mid-afternoon break at work- while enjoying an hour of sunshine on lakeshore in the parkIt is addictive for 20 - 30 mins, then starts become a drag, but if you leave it then, you feel refreshed and alert. I love DS and these games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear daughter loves it!","review":"I purchased this game originally for myself. Dear daughter however uses it much more often than I do and loves it. Chastises me for not using the game more often. We will definately be looking for the newer version of this game. Any game that exercises a 10 year old brain and makes them want to use it more and more, is wonderful in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard But Fun","review":"This was requested by my wife. She is having a great time with the challenge. Her only complaint was that the time required to figure out exactly how she was supposed to write down her answers counted in her first score. But, since that first effort, she's been having a blast, so she still wanted to give 5 Stars. Anyone can \\"wipe the slate clean\\" and \\"start over,\\" but in the long run \\"who cares,\\" since it is \\"all about the challenges.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be.","review":"This is what it says I guess. You play for a few minutes each day....however after a few minutes of playing you are done. I thought there would be more to it than there was. Dissappointed but my 10 year daughter loves it. I would not recommend to friends my age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you can stick with it","review":"Just as advertised it is a nice collection of tasks which force you to concentrate, remember, and think.It does seem a bit slanted against you if you're like me and don't spell well. That said there are certainly several math based tasks which will probably frustrate those poor at mental math.Several tasks are just incredibly difficult. Some tasks are easy to score the max possible value on while others are very difficult to do at all. I find this discourages me from doing those tasks which are harder which is probably exactly the opposite of what I should do.The brain age test chooses several random tasks which can dramatically alter the outcome from day to day.All said it is well worth the cost and gets the mental gears turning in ways they might not during your day to day grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 15 minutes a day","review":"I think this is a great game and keeps your memory and thinking going.The program has some trouble recognizing the + sign I use for the quick math and often turns it into another symbol. Since I can read music and play the piano somewhat already, the music portion is super easy. I also love the daily sudoku. Overall a very fine game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Age II","review":"FUN! FUN! FUN!

I was happy to finally figure out who did \\"Be My Yoko Ono,\\" which I had heard before. The album really stuck with me, being as off-beat as They Might Be Giants, witty as Ogden Nash, and resonating with me and my experiences, particularly Grade 9. I picked it up soon after, and it was one of those albums I listened to over and over. It goes from being whimsical to moody to satirical, but is almost always up-beat. All the tracks on this are strong, with particular favorites being Grade 9, with its Rush tributes, and If I Had $1,000,000. Also look for an unexpected insertion of Styx's Mr. Roboto, and a slam dunk against New Kids On The Block.

I guess I'll just have to listen to \\"Maybe You Should Drive\\", \\"Born on a Pirate Ship\\", \\"Stunt\\" or \\"The Brothers Creegan\\" for a while until I can find time to buy another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic BNL cd to own","review":"This is the CD that hooked me on BNL. My college roommate owned Gordon. One day I popped it in while I was studying. By the time it was over I was hooked. I've been a devoted BNL fan ever since. The lyrics of this CD contain humor, sadness and tremendous variety.Brian Wilson is the popular favorite. But I was particularly awed by the rich lyrics and raw emotion in the slow songs. #6 \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\" and #12 \\"Blame It on Me\\" are tender classics. #13 \\"The Flag\\" is the bittersweet tale of a couple's fateful argument and the \\"rules\\" of their relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Band - The 'Ladies","review":"I am an American, and I am a fan of the Barenaked Ladies. Most Americans have put a bad impression on this great Canadian Band, by listening to \\"One Week\\" a few times and getting sick of it. Or they buy Stunt and they don't like the other music that is on it. I think all of those people should know that \\"One Week\\" is an average Barenaked Ladies song. If you want to say that the Barenaked Ladies are a bad band, listen to all of their music first before judging them. I believe that their hits are not their best songs (with the exception of \\"Pinch Me\\"). Steven Page, Ed Robertson and the rest of the Ladies are awesome people. You would have to listen to their music and see them in concert to really know what I am talking about. Anyway, the Best BNL album, in my opinion, is Gordon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The barenaked best of BNL","review":"I liked the BNL on Stunt but I loved them on Gordon. This album is pure BNL at their best: fabulously smart songwriting and catchy lyrics paired with talented musicianship and harmonizing vocals. They're sort of like a cross between Elvis Costello and the Beach Boys -- they come at pop from such a quirky, intelligent angle that every song makes pitch-perfect sense. My faves: \\"Hello City,\\" \\"Grade 9,\\" \\"The King of Bedside Manor,\\" and \\"Box Set\\" -- but then, every song on Gordon is a classic. Gordon is the Barenaked Ladies distilled to the barenaked truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music and Comical Innovation","review":"This album shows what BNL has always been about. The basic humor of the lyrics on this album sell the music all by itself. However, when you listen to the ability of each player (especially the bass stylings of Jim Creeggan) you have to say to yourself \\"these guys know what they are doing.\\" This is an album to buy if you like to listen to humorous music, and to have a good time.Personally, \\"Hello City\\" and \\"The Flag\\" leave a lasting and deep impression on me, and have really made the album worth listening to many times over. I would recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a must own CD","review":"The first time I heard this album, I thought it was a greatest hits album because I'd never heard of BNL. I was hooked immediately and I've heard them live and they are just as great live as in the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll regret it!","review":"This is one of those purchases that really makes me wince. What was I thinking? One song (Yoko Ono) survives repeated listening. The others all sound pretty much the same, and it gets annoying. The music is very cutesy, with trying-too-hard-to-be-hip lyrics and trying-too-hard-to-be-retro hooks. Would probably appeal to Hanson/Joey Lawrence fans, but it just annoys the heck out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I am just an oddball - I hated this.","review":"I bought Maroon because I loved \\"Pinch Me\\", and I think Maroon is a very solid album. Then I went out and bought Gordon and Stunt and I disliked both of them so much that I sold them to a used-cd store almost immediately! I really like the Brian Wilson song, but couldn't stand anything else on Gordon. Most of the lyrics cross the line from being quirky/clever/funny to being goofy/dumb/ sophomoric. Stunt was more solid and mature overall, but there was no real standout song as far as I was concerned. I look forward to BNL's Greatest Hits disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare to their new stuff.","review":"If you want to see how BNL developed into the great band they are today, go ahead. But I was very disappointed with this album. I hate to say anything bad about them because I love their music so much, but I really hate this album. I own it, but in all honesty I never listen to it. That's why the rating is a little harsh. It's not that I haven't tried. Even the other day I gave it another listen, but I simply don't like it and don't see why everyone else does. The new stuff is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD of all time.","review":"By far BNL's best work. Every track on this disc is fabulous. I like it much better than \\"Maybe you should drive\\". I just wish they would play more tunes from this disc at their concerts. The new stuff is great, but this disc is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good start!","review":"Of course, this is their first alblum, so you can't expect it to be perfect. My favorite song is \\"The Flag\\", about a girl and her abusive boyfriend. It's a serious matter and the guys really did it up. Good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and first Barenaked Ladies album to debut!","review":"The very first album CD debut from canada's own comedy, talented rock'n roll musicans the BARENAKED LADIES have accomplished with lots of highlighted performances. There songs they sing are \\"Grade Nine\\", \\"Brian Wilson\\" and \\"If I Had A Million Dollars\\" are my favorites on here to listen and get down while you be-boop dancing to these guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best!!!","review":"Even after 5 albums, almost 10 years, and a lot of GOOD albums, Gordon still rules as the best BNL album! Here their message and their pure enjoyment of their music is captured at its best, along with a lot of fun. This album was recorded for a bunch of guys that like to have fun, not go for profit. And the product is the finest musical CD to date. Though their later music is more refined, it doesn't have the soul of the original--Gordon. This album is simply fantastic!!! Too good to top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh! My! God! Buy this CD now!!!","review":"This CD is the best CD ever. I listen to it every morning because it makes me feel so good. I love each and everyone of their albums (I own them all); however, I feel that this album is particularly brilliant. These guys were 21 years old when they recorded this album. My personal favorite song is Brian Wilson, it's mind boggling. You think you have figured out the meaning of the song, but it changes everytime you listen to it. Not only is it just with this song, but with everysong this group has recorded. They are geniuses. Go and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gordon shows this bands diverse style","review":"As a fan of all types of music I found Gordon to be one of my most listened to cds. From Hello City's cool harmonies to Grade 9's ska sound and the semi-country style of If I Had A $1,000,000 and Crazy to the blues of I Love You, This band has a style all their on. whatever my mood I can always listen to Gordon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gordon continues to be BNL's very best","review":"The artistic variability and lyrical brilliance of this disc has really not been surpassed by BNL, or pretty much any other band. This remains one of my very favorite collections of music. From mocking boy bands to Tom Jones, to painful walks through one's own pain and guilt...these lyrics are amazing. I also find the multiple musical jenres used throughout both fun and impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Very good debut. It's not every city which gets to be immortalized in a BNL song... but if that song's \\"Hello City\\", then that isn't a good thing. Halifax rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another fantastic Canadian band!","review":"I took a chance and bought this CD blind. It is fantastic! The incorporation of different elements - jazz, rock, even a little big band really works. Even the lyrics are funny as h*ll.

I just couldn't leave this album behind. I notice that everyone else gives this album 5 stars and raves too, so I won't belabor the point; BUT I have to say - ADD THIS ALBUM TO YOUR COLLECTION! It has broad appeal for a lot of folks, but if you are a GenXer, it is particularly delightful, because you can fully relate to Duran Duran and the leather tie in Grade9, and the caustic tribute to the NKOTB. I love it. The album makes me smile, sing along, harmonize, and cry. Great job guys! (love your newer stuff too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"highly enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

We received this as a gift for our 2 yr old, and she liked it, but we discarded it after a couple of days due to the strong chemical smell, in order to avoid further exposing our daughter or ourselves. The problem is compounded by the ridiculous name of this product -- Smart Snacks. Are you kidding me? How is this a smart snack? How is it a snack at all?

I chose this one because of the bright colors, capital and lower case letters, and the fact that it stored nicely in it's own jar. I was very disappointed when we opened the package. The plastic coated ends of the laces are too wide to fit through the holes on the beads so the lacing purpose of this set is useless. Also, the end of the scoop is narrower than the beads, so my son has to pick up the bead, put it in the scoop and then turn the scoop over to dump it out. Basically, it doesn't really \\"scoop\\" the beads. I ended up going out and buying a couple of narrow shoe strings to make this toy work. My son can now lace the beads and still likes to dump out the beads on the floor and use the scoop to put them back in the jar, one at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sweet as I thought","review":"My two and a half year old daughter got these lacing sweets as a Christmas present, and was very excited to open the box and play with the pretend candies.

I finally pushed the lace through one of them, but my daughter was more than frustrated when she could not do it herself. Also, the laces are very, very short. I expected more for the money.

This is an facinating account of his travel around England. At first he gives lots of detail of where he is, description of the town etc, but as you progress through, he seems to skim over his northern travel. Unfortunatly, Scotland was not given as much detail as the South. He labours the point of Ugly architecture to the point of,\\"is this all?\\", Bill, I love your books but , get a grip. My recomendation, Read THIS book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but contrived humor","review":"While a good mini travelogue of Britain, and well-written, the humor seems contrived and thus artificial. While there are some genuine naturally occuring funny moments, Bryson spends a good deal of time trying to be funny and it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I listed to an un-abridged audio version read by Bill Bryson and I loved the book. Bill Bryson is hilarious, honest and a just plain excellent writer. His historic notes are useful and his descriptions paint a vivid picture. He's dry and sarcastic but very, very real and very very funny. By the time you're done with this book you will have an honest to God, realistic and in-depth narrative of a country that, like anything familiar and dear, can be beautful,imperfect,nerve-wracking and glorious but always well-loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to read this book. I hadn't read 20 pages before I realized I wasn't going to like it. I think the only reason I even finished it was I was stuck on an airplane with nothing else to read. I think my primary problem with the book was that Bryson just sort of wanders from one destination to another, telling us the travails he experienced getting from Point A to Point B. I didn't get any real insight into the British people. And there were several instances in the book where I was sure he was making things up for alledged comic effect. Several people have made comparisons between this book and Paul Theroux's \\"Kingdom By The Sea.\\" I will admit that Paul can be kind of mean-spirited and doesn't seem to have a good time when he travels. But he is such a far superior writer that I felt I had a real sense of what Great Britain was about after reading his book.

I laugfed so hard it hurt and I got truly useful information besides. That wonderful book on Australia is a sharp contrast to this one.Read this if you need to have a cure for insomnia. This book reads like it was written by someone without an editor and is more frustration than education. It commits the sin of being boring. You may wonder if a book can be completely boring from cover to cover? I would say yes, although it ranges between deadly boring to only marginally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Interesting","review":"This book has been placed in many different categories, such as travel and non-fiction. But in my opinion, it seems as if it is just the story of a bitter old man being miserable on his trip around England.There were excerpts of this book that were, in fact, pretty amusing. But overall it was relatively boring and hard to get through. If you're looking for an informative, fun travel book about England, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sense of humour in this book","review":"I only read a little of this book because it was a gift for my friend. What I did read the author seemed to have the English customs and sense of humour down pat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul","review":"Dont bother. I didn't make it half way through.Bryson comes across very shovanistic and codascending. He spends pages describing how much he dislikes the street names in London or the Chinese restaurants in Kent.

I am of English descent and have been to England twice - so it was extremely interesting to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Bryson","review":"A charming, loving tribute to an adopted home from one of America's preeminent travel writers. Minus one star for a sameness to the approach (visit town with an obscure history, long trudge to get there, last-minute search for food that invariably winds up in a second-rate curry or Chinese restaurant).For comparison's sake, readers should check out the anti-tribute, AA Gill's The Angry Island: Hunting the English."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's written better.","review":"Now don't get me wrong - I love Bill Bryson's writing. But this one seems to be from his \\"early work\\", where he mostly travels around and expresses his discontent with a city's architecture and planning. There's not a lot else to flesh-out the story. After a while it gets a little old. For something more varied and less critical, try \\"A Walk in the Woods\\". That is a great read. As is \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" (go for the illustrated version). Those are both books that I eagerly read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"If you enjoy descriptions of frumpy resorts, slightly seedy restaurants and near-abandoned villages, this is for you. It pains me to give Bryson only two stars, it really does-but not as much as it pained me to slog through this offering to the bitter end. There are pages and pages of Bryson sitting alone in restaurants and waiting rooms, wandering through rundown tourism areas, and so on. The entire book feels like the journal of a man trying to kill five hours in a boring city between travel connections. Exactly the sort of situation where one longs for escape into a good book. This book isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knackered?","review":"Being part English and having studied and lived in the US, I feel I have some common background with Bryson. I think he could have done more with this one. At times, he doesn't seem to enjoy himself in his trekking, and his sprinkling his stories with typically English terminology at times seems contrived. This was my first Bryson, I'll try more to try to figure out what the hullabaloo is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming and detailed walking tour by witty Anglophile.","review":"Bill Bryson captures something essential about England and the English in this loving account of his last trip through the island he called home for 20 years. Bryson, electing to use public transport and foot, encounters many amusing and frustrating obstacles as he navigates his \\"green and pleasant land,\\" and as his journey slows, so can the book. But his keen eye for detail and his self-deprecating humor make this a must for any American travelling to the Mother Country, and a delight for those of us already in love with her quirky people."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, hate is a strong word but...","review":"i LOVE bill bryson. but his voice ruined one of the funniest books i've ever read. hoping to return it. i've since discovered the seller will not accept its return because it's been opened. why would you return something you hadn't opened? how would you know there was something wrong with it? i listened to about 10 minutes of it and it's a good thing i did. as a gift, i couldn't send it to my friend. as a book to listen to while driving it would put you to sleep!!! so i'm stuck with this rather expensive disc i will never listen to. i don't think this is good business. i suppose it's a catch 22 situation. the seller thinks you'll just copy it and send it back. on the other hand, it's very easy if you have the apparatus to repackage something to look brand new so i don't know if the seller did this prior to selling it to me. this would be my first unhappy experience with amazon. i guess it has to happen sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Walk in the Woods","review":"I loved his Walk in the Woods and so I had to try this one. I did not even finish the second disc (audio version). I think that someone that spent time in Great Britain would likely enjoy this, but if not it just may not be your cup of tea. It wasn't mine or at least 1.8 discs of audio weren't. Could be it starts slow and gets better and I just didn't give it a chance, but for me it was nothing like his Appalachian trail hike and I ended up zoning and loosing interest.

I am sooo glad I did not spend money for it, and I surely don't mind spending money for good books. Early in the book, Bryson refers to the RO-RO (roll on-roll off) ferry from Calais to Dover, as the roll on-roll over ferry, due to the numerous ferry accidents in recent years. That was the last piece of humor I found, and I expect it was not original.Mr. Bryson's endless hyperbole grew tiresome very quickly. Many of his attempts at humor are of the bathroom variety, and are not of much interest to one much beyond puberty. His four-letter word vocabularity reminded me of a teen- aged boy just out of earshot of any adults.It is amazing that people earn large sums for such drivel. Don't buy this book. Don't read this book. Don't listen to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unabridged it is not.","review":"Don't be fooled by the confusing title of this book \\"Notes from a Small Island [Abridged] [Audiobook] [Unabridged]\\" It is the abridged version which should be made much clearer on the Amazon site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stories, good humor, bad narration voice","review":"The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).If you want this book, get the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are in Britain, perhaps","review":"Pretty funny at times, starts very well and the starting humor has a pretty universal appeal. After a while though Bill Bryson brings us through numerous boring places in England and the book just fizzles.Obviously, if you are British this book may be interesting to you but even then, most of the places he describes sound just about as interesting as would US travel chronicles through New Jersey, Newark, Flint, Buffalo or Detroit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing enough in a superficial way.","review":"Bill Bryson is very popular with the British because he panders to their own self-image as lovable eccentrics. This book is a perfectly agreeable holiday read but utterly superficial. Also dated (written in the mid-90s, it refers in several places to the Conservative government). There's no reference to the problems that plague British society, such as alcohol and drug abuse, rampant consumerist materialism, over-indebtedness, issues with uncontrolled immigration and race relations, hyperinflation, cultural elitism, etc etc. OK, so it doesn't aim to be an in-depth social portrait of the UK, it aims to be a light and amusing read, and in this it succeeds very well. But I found the superficiality a bit cloying after a few chapters. A very light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it on the shelf where it belongs","review":"This book has been in the best seller lists for a number of years and has had rave reviews. I was extremely disappointed in the book. I found very little humour and got irritated by Bryson complaining about architecture, transport, etc. This isn't a travelogue, just a sequence of towns visited with incidents on the way. As a Brit I didn't feel that it painted an accurate picture of the people or the place. I feel sure that there are better books that address the issues - leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid","review":"Maybe its me, but I just don't get Mr Bryson's books so it seems.Having been to Australia I picked up his version of his travels there and found it at best mildly amusing, and at worst inaccurate and banal, but as I'm open to the idea that maybe I started on the wrong book, I picked up this one as a secondary attempt to see why people like him so much.Now I know that negative reviews on here seem to be frowned upon, and hardly ever classed as helpful, but I'm struggling to find a positive. Yes, I know its not supposed to be a reference book, and is an individuals projection of the aspects of his adventure around the Uk which he found amusing / noteworthy and indeed, with a few pints in the pub and a few mates, the stories told may raise a chuckle or three, but in a book? Perhaps im just lacking an affinity with the author, but then... isn't that what the books he writes are designed to create? In which case, for me at least, it just isn't happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun to read while visiting in England","review":"My British hosts gave me a copy of Bill Bryson's Notes from a Small Island to read and enjoy during my visit in July and August. I had researched the traditional British travel books thoroughly so I knew the \\"facts\\" but I had great pleasure and fun reading his \\"personal views\\" while I was traveling to many of the places he mentioned. I needed the road atlas to keep track of his wanderings to places unfamiliar to me. I wish he wouldn't have ignored major parts of the country (like the Midlands) but it was his trip and not a comprehensive travel guide. It is his ideas and views only and his wit was refeshing. As I read the customer's comments (after I returned home) I was surprised at the enthusiastic response from the British readers themselves...their comments alone would draw me towards his writing. I have become a Bill Bryson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book, but not all at once!","review":"The first part of this book was amazing, it really made me laugh. Unfortunatly, the book does not continue to the same high standard throughout. There are a few funny parts later on in the book, I see that there are a lot of people who found the 'Vodaphone Man' amusing, but sometimes the jokes may offend people.As I am British myself, I sometimes found myself being irritated by Bryson's comments about this country, but I think the overall picture is flattering.In spite of its shortcomings (it is sometimes repetitive) I liked this book so much I recommended it to an American friend who wanted to know more about Britain. I hope he finds it as entertaining as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Perfect!","review":"The thing that I liked best about \\"Notes From a Small Island\\" is the fact that by the time you have finished reading it Bill Bryson feels like an old friend. He is completely open with the reader and is not afraid to laugh at himself. Most of the humour comes from the fact that everything he says about the British is so true! I know that I often fall into the \\"mustn't grumble\\" category!I have decided against giving this book 5 stars, however, because Bill does tend to whine on rather about his obsession with cities and how modern architecture is ruining them. This book had me falling about in fits of laughter, especially the scene with the waterproofs, but it would have been ten times better if Bill had just cut out some of the rubbish.In conclusion, however, this book is a brilliant and enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and funniest account on travelling in the UK","review":"I have read 2 contemporary accounts on travel in the UK, that by Paul Theroux and Bill Bryson. Paul's fashionable left wing haughtiness and his propensity for meeting people he hates make you wonder why he bothers to travel at all except to write a book or meet famous people. Bill, on the other hand is always sympathetic to the locals, enjoys their company hugely and imparts his enthusiasm to his readers. He laughs at their foibles but never in a condensending way. And in spite of Paul's reputation as a serious novelist, Bill uses language much more effectively. And infinitely, more funny. Two Americans who have lived in the UK and travelled the world extensively ....Bill obviously enjoys living in this world much more. I wish he would make a trip to the East and write about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those With A Sense of Humor","review":"Please, babies, if you are a humorless malcontent do not under any circumstances read this book! It is not for you! In fact, do not read any of Bill's books as they are all written for people who like to laugh and have fun in life.Have a wonderful day, all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPERBLY FUNNY ROMP","review":"The book originally started as a diversion but then I discovered the beauty of Bill Bryson's humour and his descriptions of places involuntarily painting pictures in my head, I knew I had to continue. I was rewarded with a stupendously entertaining, light book. It makes a great holiday read. At times, you simply have to burst out laughing. People who read the book in public should stick a large sign on their heads reading, 'I AM NOT DEMENTED, I'M JUST READING A F***ING FUNNY BOOK'. I'm not being rude, but to those who are offended easily, the F word is used many times in the book.Read the book, you'll love it. And Brits, you'll love it even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"If books were food, this would be a big ol' submarine sandwich, and an absolutely delicious one. Similar to Paul Theroux' \\"Kingdom By the Sea\\", it's the story of a man's travels around England, mostly by foot. Some of the descriptions of the places send a shiver through my Anglophile soul - what I wouldn't give to hike through Windsor Park, or seek out Arthur's Cave. Even the descriptions of the crummy hotels and bad weather are delightful. Oh, to have the energy and freedom to go exploring England! Bill Bryson is a lucky man. I think anyone who wants to follow in his footsteps should hurry up and do it before they tear down more of their ancient buildings and hedgerows and replace them with more concrete atrocities. I know what he's talking about. I can't wait to read Bryson's other books, but this one is just so wonderful I'm reading it very, very slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walking tour through England","review":"This is a true story of the author's's walking tour of England. Mr. Bryson is essentially a walking travelogue (except when he gets tired and decides to hop a bus or train....). You will feel as though you are with him every grueling, wonderful, step of the way. If you never thought about England as being \\"different\\", then this is the book that will make you want to travel to this wonderful island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Dull","review":"This was my first Bill Bryson book. I bought it because the last time my mom stayed over, she was up all night snorting with laughter at A Walk in The Woods. I'm more of an Anglophile, so decided to try this one instead.Gack. This books reads as though the author's brain was in neutral. It is obvious that he is talented, and equally obvious that he is coasting. I got really tired of sifting through endless dreariness and grouchiness; the brilliant quotes and historical anecdotes were great, but not worth the effort required to find them.I ended up leaving this book on an airplane in a fit of pique. Apologies to the poor innocent who found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a travelogue that makes you want to stay home","review":"Bryson reaches for at least one homourous quip per paragraph, and usually doesn't even raise a dry smile. As a travelogue it is totally unmemorable and uninspiring. It inspires me to stay home, to travel nowhere. The fact that this book is so popular in Britain just shows what a nation of narcissistic, air-headed twits they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, jokey, trivial","review":"Can only suppose that the success of this book is because it flatters the british ego. He says nice things about us in an amusing way. But as a thoughtful analysis of life in the UK it has little to recommend it. I couldnt be bothered to read more than a quarter of it. George"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love drizzle & brick","review":"I lived in London for 12 months. Bryson calls London the most perfect city in the world. I say it's a huge overpriced crumbling Dickensian slum. If you love brick and drizzle and hate carparks, playgrounds and shopping centres then you'll love this strongy opinionated guide to Britain. Otherwise, forget it, you'll just end up feeing angry.But don't let it put you off Bryson's \\"History of almost everything\\", which is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I couldn't even get through the first half of the book on cassette of Notes From a Small Island. Most of the humour is mean spirited. It appears that he gets great pleasure of sitting next to an overweight family just because he can watch them and find a reason to make fun of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell to Notes from a Small Island","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it a great concept to travel around England by public transit or foot and comment on what he saw after living in the country for 20 years. So he walks into Oxford with a passing comment on the beautiful buildings and then spent paragraphs denouncing the shopping center. It seemed to me he wanted to be a stand up comic, but he failed, fell on his face or his posterior most of the time. He also commented in vulgarisms, too many times. The only thing I will give him credit for is being an ambitious walker, even in the rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The book initially attracted me as the first couple of chapters were humourous and well-written. But after that, the book got progressively boring, repetitive in style, predictable, lacking in life, soul, and colour. It is difficult to imagine what the author is trying to describe if you've never been to England, so what is the point in reading the book? Compared to other travel writers, I found Bryson boring, boring, boring. I would not pick up another one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this one....","review":"I've read five of Bryson's books so far, but this one has put the nail in the coffin for me-there will be no more Bryson books for a while. I'm about half way through it but am finding it increasingly difficult to tolerate Bryson's mean-spirited remarks about people he's never met. Bryson's comment that an overweight teenager was a, \\"greedy, fat, pig\\" wasn't funny at all. It was just mean, plain and simple...and this coming from an author who needs to take a look at himself in the mirror. In the last Bryson book I read, his wife comments that all he does is, \\"b**ch, b**ch, b**ch. I agree with her. I find this book to be repeatedly filled with whining, and mean-spirited comments about people Bryson has never met and places he doesn't spend enough time in to know anything about. If you want to read good Bryson books try, \\"A Walk in The Woods\\" or \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\". This one will will be going out, half-finished, with our summer tag sale items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I was misled by the glowing reviews on this review page. I expected to read a very funny travelogue, but instead ended up plowing half-way through this book before I quit. Where exactly is the humor? It all seemed contrived. There are even a couple of times where the author is amazingly mean-spirited (if I recall correctly, there is part where he talks about a strike at the newspaper where he worked, and how one night when he was trying to leave a guy got out of his car blocking traffic. Bryson says that even after all these years he would still gladly drag this guy on rough ground behind a car. How amusing.). I would have rated this book even lower, except for one thing. My expectations were so high for a really good book and the disappointment so great, that maybe I'm not judging it for what it really is. I suppose anyone interested in Britain might find this book informative, if they don't mind the annoying forced humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious - I couldn't wait to finish it.","review":"I found this book so annoying. It was my first 'Bill Bryson experience' and I was expecting to be entertained rather than irritated page after page.Maybe it's because I am English that I did not find him funny, just patronising and schoolboyish.When I had finished reading it I had to get this book out of my house. I am going to read The Lost Continent to find out whether it is actually Mr Bryson that offends or just his condescending manner towards 'my home'."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Excellent Short Story...","review":"...but, sadly, not a novel. Bryson has moments of brillance. His observations are witty, and he is able to decribe the British culture like no other. But he needed a strong editor to make the tough decisions about what to leave out. Bryson made all of his points (and his most cogent observations) half way through the book. He did not need to continue to make the same observations over and over the rest of the way. Overall, I was disappointed. The book started with such promise in an English port city. His description of the B&B landlady was tearfully funny. Unfortunately, the book never got any better. Sometimes, Bill, less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The warning was correct","review":"In the edition of the book I read there was a warning not to read on the bus, on in public. You will begin snorting and chuckling. It's a funny, sweet book that make the 'small island' travels of Paul Theroux and Jonathan Rabin seem not as much fun. I pick Bill Bryson as my travelling companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Eloquently written, full of comedy, and insightful. However, it does sound like he has a lot of resentment for the English landscape, and goes a little far critisizing the culture at times. I've lived in england for three monthes however, I find a lot of humor based on the knowledge that I acquired there about the culture. Especially the bit about him talking about the war england waged with iceland over cod. :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Bryson goodness.","review":"I recommend this book for Bill Bryson fans, but not perhaps for those just starting out with his books. I really enjoy his audiobooks read by the author, but this one is read by the capable but somehow inappropriate David Case. While his British-accented voice is clear and he tells the story well, I can never quite escape the impression that he's reading with a slight sneer, as if putting a sarcastic feel into this tale about his country by an American. I like the story overall and it helps complete the biography of this worthwhile storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"As an American living in the UK, I found that this book gave a good insight into the small differences that make the US and the UK so similar but so different. I would especailly recommend it for someone who is planning a trip to the UK because it mentions lots of pretty obscure places that you might not have heard of otherwise (e.g. Lickey End near Bromsgrove) and is a lot funnier to read than your basic guidebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a comical and Clever book!","review":"I thought that Bill Brson would be a reasonable writer, but seeing as I lived in England, the book wouldn't appeal to me. I loved it however and each piece appealed to me the same way that any funny book does. Thankyou Bill for this Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb overview of English life and eccentricities.","review":"In this book, detailing his one last trip around mainland Britain, Bryson again surpasses himself by creating an intoxicating mixture of facts and humour that will, most literally, have anyone who has ever lived in Britain laughing loud enough to be heard from the other end of the road. It has to be read. That's all from me, but it is HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best, But Still Worth Reading","review":"Although Bryson has got to be the wittiest travel writer around, I wasn't as enchanted with this book as I was with his shorter--and nastier--Neither Here Nor There. In this travelogue, he decided to take a sort of celebratory tour of Britain just prior to moving back to America after 18 years. His goal--largely successful--is to accomplish this all via public transport or foot. Bryson does lots of riffing on various aspects of English culture, often to humorous effect, and never fails to highlight his own mistakes and shortcomings along the way. It's a largely successful book in that he manages to recommend certain destinations and express disappointment at others in a fairly judicious and witty manner. He's also good at highlighting the differences in scale between the U.S. and the UK, not to mention the differing sense of history each culture has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep calm and carry on laughing","review":"During a stint working away on an Australian mine I decided to reread this book and was glad of the decision. Not may books make me laugh out loud, but Bill seems to have found the way to tickle my funny bone.I still think the funniest part was the beginning and it does fade in places, but overall, a jolly yarn about an amazing country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody hell! Are we really like this","review":"The best (and the worst) thing about this book is the realization that yes, in large part, we are just as Bill describes us. The book turns on a sixpence from being killingly hilarious as you wonder what planet this weird American is actually from as he commits some outrageous faux pas to the sudden realization that he has us bang to rights on some point or another.For example, as a people we really do like a nice cup of tea, and the best route from A to B really is a valid topic of conversation down the pub..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bryson's best travelogue","review":"I've enjoyed \\"In a Sunburnt Country\\" as well as \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" In both books, there were plenty of exploring, interesting history, and witty dialogues. In this book, he explored Great Britain on his own so not a lot of dialogue. Some of the history was interesting but most was flat-out boring, as I found in my history courses in school whenever we had to touch upon British history. And exploring he does, but it got pretty repetitive. I am sure Great Britain is wonderful and I do hope to get there one day, but Bryson really made this place seem boring. Sure he had a few humorous remarks here and there that kept me reading, but I struggled to finish. Usually Bryson has me planning a trip, but with this book, he had me planning a snooze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean spirited","review":"After loving A Walk in the Woods and In Sunburned Country, I bought Notes from a Small Island. It was disappointing. It seemed mean sprited to me in that he took shots at people without letting the reader know why they deserved it. At first I thought okay, maybe it's just me. I put the book down and went back to it weeks later on several different occasions and just couldn't get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointedly overrated, opposite of \\"Mother Tongue\\"","review":"Having read Bryson's \\"The Mother Tongue and How it Got that Way\\"(a terrific book), I thought he found so much fault in all around him that I just couldn't finish this diatribe. I was astounded at the depth of his angry ranting against the people he met, the architecture and their society. I was so surprised, having read a number of positive reviews to find this book without much to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bless Bill Bryson","review":"If there is anyone out there who has never read Bill Bryson I urge you to start. His books will warm your heart and make you laugh out loud....you can't stay blue or depressed when you're engrossed in one of his works. In spite of his penchant for being an Anglophile (no doubt because he's married to an Englishwoman), you realize, after reading between the lines, he's an all-American kid.What's so delightful about him is that he not only entertains but educates as well.Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! Bill. There is no one like you. I have one complaint and that is there aren't any new 'travelogues' on the horizon. Come on, Bill. You're not that old!."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest, hilarious and rather true diary!","review":"I saved reading this book for my lastest trip to England, and finished it on the plane home. Bryson gives a fantastic, tongue-in-cheek description of small town, and well, large town britain. It was just as I experienced it as well!! I noted some \\"Bryson-isms\\" as I travelled and visited some of the places mentioned in the book. I can't say I'd reccommend it for a first time visitor to England, but if you have been there, it can take you back in a second, reminding you of the great and not-so-great-but-still-hilarious things if you look at it through the authors eyes. Very enjoyable, will definitely read it again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a break from factual tour guides and laugh...","review":"Take a break from factual tour guides and put a bit of cheer in your reading with Bill Bryson's witty cultural commentary on British life and custom.Bryson, an American who lived in England for 20 years working as a writer for the London Times, set off for one last look at a country that has intrigued him, bewitched him and charmed him. Notes from a Small Island is tales of his wandering, written with amusing and insightful humor.P.S. Best read during you visit to England or afterwards. Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little... dull?","review":"Was this book a product of cobbling together a series of travelogues written independent of each other? While Bryson's prose is... interesting, if a bit vulgar in his attempt to be \\"outre,\\" this book wearied me. Perhaps it was the redundancy. Or maybe the repetititiveness. Or maybe... ah, you get the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bryson disappointment","review":"After reading Sunburned Country, Stranger Here and Walk in the Woods, this book was an astounding disappointment. I expected the same sarcastic wit Bryson is famous for, but instead I found myself reading a depressing list of gloomy towns in the UK with unending descriptions of rain and fog and how the names of British towns and streets are more entertaining than those in the US. After reading this book, I could tell why this was not one of his more famous ones. If this had been the first book I read by Bryson, I may have enjoyed it, but from reading his other books, I came to expect from him more than the average author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty but too sweet","review":"The coconut dark chocolate bars taste pretty good.

They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting.

Also, an annoying number of grammatical and spelling errors distract from the stories (spelling Dr. J. Allen Hynek's name as \\"Hyneck\\" and listing CSICOP as \\"CSCIOP\\" are examples.)

Otherwise no name could be less appropriate for this old man who is described as \\"spectacularly clean\\" and whose kaleidoscopic life story, in England and the Far East, this is. It would be a spoiler if I described it or the gaps in the story which the author leaves to our imagination to fill in.The book and the characters in it are quirky, funny, sad, and touching; the touches of period flavour (ca. 1923 to 2002 - though there seems to be an error on the very last page) are spot-on; and Jane Gardam' style is idiosyncratic, often staccato, but a pleasure to read. Her similes or descriptions are never hackneyed, never forced, but always fresh and arresting. I found the novel a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed, very disappointed","review":"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with all the positive reviews.

Yet, within himself Edward Feathers was always the extension of the child that had to find life without the comfort and love of parents, like the boarding school children who can never go home even on the holidays because there is no one to go home to.Passing through a series of caretaking aunts, cousins and school masters he developed a \\"stiff upper lip\\" attitude about his life and a strong sense of duty about everything he attempted, and mastered in life.Jane Gardam's story of Old Filth is intriguing and I felt a part of him all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both my dogs love 'em!","review":"My golden retreiver and my carolina dog love these chews.

It seems to condense all the pertinent information from the different Anglican/ Episcopal Church prayer/practice books and organizes it into a handbook. The preface is a great introduction into the purpose and focus of the liturgical practices. God is in the middle of the the liturgy! To ignore God is to waste your time practicing. This could be very handy for people in the different emerging Anglican braches that are beginning to form and have formed in the United States. I myself am looking to ordination in the AMiA Church. Again, fantastic companion with explanations and guides. Some of the descriptions of physical instruction seem a little unclear, but can be figured out easily anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource for Neglected Subject","review":"Many of us in ministry have never had so much as a single seminary lecture devoted to proper liturgical practice. If you have ever questioned the proper way to administer communion to the the sick or homebound, if you have ever questioned the appropriate way to impose ashes on Ash Wednesday or do a Palm Sunday processional, you need this book. Although it is deliberately Anglican, and thus gives guidance for the liturgies particular to that tradition (Cf. References to BCP 1979 throughout), it is grounded in the Scriptures and informed by ancient and broadly catholic practice.You can easily dispense with items that are incompatible with your own tradition and keep what remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reverend Father","review":"An excellent source of information for the seminarian or newly ordained.

Her early 60s pop recordings are a textbook of melody, arrangement, and most of all, incredible delivery.This 16-track disc is a great introduction to her work on Vogue Records, with entries ranging from 1962 through 1968. For those who find this to be too small a taste, the 4-disc \\"Complete Vogue Recording\\" is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, but incomplete compilation","review":"This compilation covers Franoise Hardy hits from the beginning of her career to 1968. The repertoire, presented in chronological order, shows the evolution from her teenager songs as \\"Tous les garons et les filles\\" and \\"Oh oh chéri\\" to more serious ones as \\"Il est des choses\\" or \\"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\\". Personally, I clearly preferred the second half of this recording and I missed the inclusion of some of her seventies stuff. Also, there's a couple of essential hits from the period covered in this compilation which are missing: \\"L'amitié\\" and \\"Mon amie la rose\\", and this is a shame since these are some of her loveliest songs. Anyway, this is a good example of the early career of this delicious singer who is able to convey in her interpretations a tenderness rarely found in today's musical scene. But if you want to have a comprehensive idea of Hardy's career there are more complete compilations available in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra for the price!","review":"I bought this bra here on Amazon and have been very pleased with it.

Any little girl would be very happy with it. The only problem is a very minor one. The assembly instructions appear to be written as a \\"one size fits all\\" instruction for all Huffy bikes rather than specific instructions for this one, so some degree of interpretation is necessary. Anyone who has assembled children's toys or bikes in the past won't have a problem. Also, at one point, the instructions seem to imply the need for a torque wrench, which most people wouldn't have. Nonetheless, assembly is pretty easy, and the lack of a torque wrench shouldn't be a problem if judgment is used in place of an actual measurement of torque."},{"rating":"2","title":"toddlers bike","review":"Perfect size for 21/2 yr. old girl.

How disappointing. I had trouble warming up to the heroine,Francesca. Ms.Joyce was trying to make Francesca into a enlightened young upper class woman of the turn of the last century-secretly attending college,befriending lower class people,ect. I think another reviewer hit upon the main problem with this story-it couldn't decicide if it was a mystery or a romance. Francesca was supposed to be a bright and articulate person,but when she meets the new police commissioner she becomes just another simpering ninny. I also found her interest in the abduction of the neighboring child to be more of voyuerism than that of true concern. Rick,the new police commissioner was correct in being annoyed with her interst in the case. A most disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll pass, thank you","review":"Half way through this book, I asked myself, who cares? I simply lost interest in the story line.

A very disappointing read especially when I look forward to any Brenda Joyce novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"I was horribly disappointed by this book. When I bought it I though it would be a romance mystery. Unfortunately,its not a romance. The most romance in this book is a kiss between two main characters who can never get togeather, in this book or any other in the seiries. unexpressable unrequited love that is not overcome is not my idea of a romance. In addition to this, the myster part of the story is a major let down, boring and predictable from a mile away. If you want a romance or a mystery get a different book about the only thing this book is a waste of time.

I love the strong female character, the time setting and her family. It made for a very interesting story. But then it all fell apart.

While the author sets the stage for more books, I don't think I will buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a MYSTERY","review":"When will publishers learn to market books honestly? This is NOT a romance novel; it is an atmospheric character study with a mystery thrown in for good measure.The descriptions are well done and accurate. The cast of characters is quite interesting - conflict building for future books, I hope.Re the main characters, Francesca is too much the feminist for my personal taste - a budding Hillary comes to mind. We are told early and often that she's quite liberal and out to change social ills.Rick, on the other hand, is totally opposite of the sappy males written by many female writers. He is masculine, intelligent, tender when necessary, and does the heavy lifting the Francesca's often avoid.In short, I hardly ever read Brenda Joyce's romance novels - too light and sappy - but decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condensed version, too much left out.","review":"The original book I read years ago was exceptional, this version is condensed and contains many pages of cartoon-like \\"shortcuts\\".

Alan Moore's stories for DC are always good, and this book just compiles them leaving you to feel like a kid in a candy store.Get your fix of \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" and the greatest Green Lantern comic ever \\"Mogo Doesn't Socialize\\". The compilation now includes the controversial graphic novel \\"The Killing Joke\\" and so much more.As mentioned previously, who knows if he will ever write for DC ever again? So if you consider yourself a fan of Alan Moore's work, you owe it to yourself to buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's got to be more than this.","review":"I'll start out stating that the only reason I bought this was to own the Killing Joke. Well, that is pretty much the only reason to own this since you can't find that one-shot for individual sale anymore. If you are a fan of Alan Moore's work, then this should get your fix. Agreeing with a lot of other comic readers, this is not his best stuff though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressive.","review":"I was let down by this collection of stories from one of comics' most celebrated writers. While \\"The Killing Joke\\" was okay and important in the legend of the Batman, most of the other other stories just seem lackluster and dated. The art is typical of the times the stories were written, not flashy or stylistic, but adequate to tell the story if sometimes a little unclear. This may be of interest to those with fond memories of these stories or those with interest in writing that was ground-breaking for the time, but there's no need to read this if you're looking for modern innovative work."},{"rating":"2","title":"AP Chemistry Text Book","review":"This text book was the most through chemistry book I have ever used.

(We also saw A Cinderella Story, Cheaper by the Dozen, etc etc etc.) This is not like anything else Hilary has done. The supporting cast is superb (except for Rebecca Demornay, who for some reason really grated my nerves in this movie...maybe because they went a little overboard trying to make her look like an older version of Hilary). I was slightly crying 10 minutes into the movie, and did a few more times throughout. I didn't expect a Duff movie to deal with anything so heavy. I got a little tired of the whole \\"Fame\\" feel of the movie, maybe because I'm not that way inclined. But this movie isn't about that. It's about a family, as dysfunctional as it may be, trying to get past a devestating tragedy and a mother trying to give her daughter wings. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it at Wal-Mart","review":"I was watching this movie on tv, and had to leave before it was over, but it was one of those must buy movies just to see the end. So as soon as I got home, I went online and bought the movie, thinking it would at least be in in a week. Unfortunately this was not the case. It has been almost a week and a half, and way past the delivery estimate, and I have still not gotten that movie. So as far as the movie goes, it was great. Totally cute, it will make you cry, smile, laugh, and of course Oliver James is very cute. I love to hear him talk. I would like to say that it ends well, but I have not gotten the movie to see it. So I definitely recommend that you buy the movie, but not from Amazon. Just go to Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I used to love hilary duff when i was younger. thankfully, i soon realized that there is nothing special about her. her movies are all the same. she can't sing at all.

And usually I watch them for the pure fun of mocking the cheesy cliched plot and bad acting. Hilary, as usual delivered a spectacular performance...as herself. The plot...what was it again? She stopped singing due to a death in the family? Learns to raise her voice...and move on...that that person will always be in her heart?Also kiddies, we learned to lie to people for our own benefit...maybe if Terri had her heart to heart earlier all the sneaking etc. would not have had to happen...just a thought. But no...they have to add conflict. Not that it made the movie better...just more pathetic.If you want to watch a predictable movie, with Hollywood morals and mediocre acting this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"just....great!!!","review":"I bought this movie and I wacht it already 6 times in 4 days, I LOVE IT!!!I'm a great fan of Hilary Duff...Is about this girl who is an awsome singer and she wants to go to this summer program in L.A.The problem is that her dad doesn't let her go. Her mother, aunt and also herself invent an excuse, finally Terri (Duff) gets into it. The movie shows the problems that she founds in the summer program and she lives happily ever after!! LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I found this movie to be well done. It takes you through the range of emotions, and you feel them. Hilary Duff plays a promising young songwriter who over protective father becomes even more so when she loses her brother. And some of the reviews think that the movie forgets about the boys' death and moves on. I think the opposite.This movie shows that regardless of your age, tragedy can come into your life. And even if you are young, you cannot give up. You have to continue on with your life and follow your dreams. This does not mean you have forgotten about your loss. We watch Hilary's character deal with this loss in her life and grow up in spite of it. It also shows parents that it is important to let go a little and let their children follow their dreams.On the lighter side, the acting is fine as is the casting. And the film has a fantastic soundtrack I think teens will love. Yes this is a chick flick, but it has a good plot and message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raise Your Voice","review":"Great movie, somewhat a chick flick but guys who like to play in school band would enjoy too. The movie is one of Hilary Duff's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raise Your voice shines","review":"Okay so here's the deal, I never cry during movies, I just don't get too emotional about that kind of thing, but when I was watching \\"Raise Your Voice\\", I tried with all my power not to cry, but still couldn't retain myself. It was awesome, a wonderful roller coaster making me feel happy, sad, special, and just highly joyous. Hilary shined in it. The acting was wonderful, Rita Wilson made my mom cry more then once. It was such a leap from Hilary's usual ditzy blonde comedy characters, But Hilary pulled it off with Grace. I personally think Drama suits Hilary quite well. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly suggest you do so. It's not all sad-sad-cry-cry. There we're some great moments in there, some nice comedy as well. If your a girl, it's a great movie to see with your mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!WOW!!!","review":"this is the best movie i have ever seen i don't really like hillary duff that much but this movie is the best movie she ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Really A Review More Asking For Help!!","review":"Im getting a bit desparate, does anyone know what the songs are called that densise plays or where i can hear/get the music for them??thanx in advance...ash"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr8. awesome","review":"the best film of Hilary Duff she's gorgeous and in this film she demonstrates that is the bestest singer and also a great actrees, dont doubt buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked sooo hard!!!","review":"I watched this one at a sleepover and I hated it!! I've never been a Hilary fan, but his was by far the worst movie yet!! Hilary duff is fake and she knows the cameras are on her, so she way over-acts!! Hilary is a fake, botox-infused poser that is not worth your time or money. In this movie she plays Terri and musical girl whos brother dies and then she doesn;t want to go to Music acadmy of whatever!! all the plots to her movies are the same: she falls in love with a hott guy, he does something wrong and then she feels betrayed and has a pity party and then he apologizes and they fall back in love. this is not worth your time or money and even little girls won't enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it ..... not really!!!","review":"Hilary Duff is the best new actress that wants more money. All of her starring roles have wrought havoc on this generation's minds. The pretweens are being sucked and brainwashed by her bubblegum image. Most of her movies have flopped because they are all the same, just with different boyfriends. But anyway, the movie would have been better if it had someone else with talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Hilary Duff proves her incapabilities as both a singer and actress in this truly horrible family drama. Duff plays a high school student with musical aspirations. Her brother dies early on with a strange desire to send his sister to a performing arts camp in Los Angeles. So the predicatble happens and Duff goes off to the camp, connects with a boy, realizes her strengths, and overcomes her fears. Pretty melodramatic and trite.Duff has a charm about her but can't handle the demand of this role. Her character is given depth but her limitations as an actress keep the girl one dimensional. Keith David gives a Razzie worthy performance as the predictable strict father forbidding Duff to go the camp.The story is alright and James Avery (Uncle Phill from Fresh Prince) even pops up for an appearance, so that saves the film for a couple minutes. But ultimately the story falls flat through no realistic dramatic situations, lack of comedy, and lack of realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I heard about 40 people say that this movie almost made them cry, but I watched this movie two times and can honestly say its probably the worst directed movie I've ever seen.First off, Hillary Duff's brother in the movie is such a suckfaced loser that we are glad that he gets killed in the car-wreck. Honestly, he got grounded for spraying lighter fluid in the bbq. Not to mention that you are waiting for the moment that him and Hillary Duff just start making out. NORMAL AREN'T LIKE THIS!!!They should've made the brother storm out and get killed in a drunk driving accident or something. Also, why is Hillary Duff relatively untouched in the accident? If a MAC truck hit me I would sure want some worthy battle scars to show. The low-rent Australian lover-boy that Hillary Duff is hooking up with looks like a Metrosexual A.C. Slater.Yeah, this movie should've had some re-write done to it to make it more realstic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me but are all these movies the same!!!","review":"Hillary Duff is a cute girl in this movie. Is it just me but is the plot always the same in these movies. A girl's mother dies and she wants to live her dream to honor her mother by going to a school for performing arts. She gets teased by her roommate and by pretty much everyone else. She finds a cute boy and they fall in love. The day of the huge residle, Concert, ECT comes and Her father is stuck in a meeting. And she is very sad. (THAT'S VERY SAD, I MEAN REALLY SAD) No it's just pathetic. Hillary, listen if you don't get into some serious rolls your always gonna be typecast as Lizzie Mcguire.

It's not worth it to spend $50 dollars to watch a lousy movie like most movies are these days. However, this movie looks good and most of the movies Hilary Duff stars in are pretty good. It sounds inspiring and interesting. Hilary Duff is one of my role models. I recommend this movie to a Hilary Duff fan or anyone wanting to see a good movie...this movie looks really good!

It breaks everything down into manageable steps. Each chapter is a main step which is further broken down into smaller steps. I found it easy to refer back to. Quick read. Practical. Useful. If I had one book on publishing to recommend, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding guidance through the proposal-writing process","review":"Of the many guides I've read, Susan Page'sbook is the most helpful.

I'd definitely recommend it very highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a place to start","review":"As a struggling writer with no knowledge of the publishing industry or all of the facets that accompany the actual writing of the book, I found Susan Page's book to be exactly what I needed to truly wade through the complicated world of moving from a \\"writer\\" to a \\"published author\\".Her advice is timeless and valuable. I don't think I'd have made it past my manuscript, my various poems, and collections of journaling, and actually be on my way to publishing a book of my own without reading The Shortest Distance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward, Practical, Excellent Advice","review":"This book oriented me to the inner workings of the publishing world, helped me clarify what I wanted to do with my book idea, and provided a straightforward, practical set of steps to accomplish the goals I set for myself. My book proposal was accepted by an agent with high compliments on its quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good basic information and encouraging","review":"Pretty good basic information and encouraging. Though the author has gained her expertise from a very narrow set of experiences writing about her special topics, the info is still very good and there is surely learning there for everyone. Also gives you an idea of how much money one can get from writing and gives you several ideas and things to think about. If you are considering writing a book, this book is a good first step, before you expand too much effort. There are a few things you may do differently as a result. And the book is not only a fun light read, but also very detailed sort of like a handbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"non-fiction focus","review":"This is a great, easy to read book with good suggestions. It is worth the money for the section on how to find an agent alone. You should note that the book is definitely focused on non-fiction books. Page sort of adds comments about fiction work as an afterthought. Still a good buy though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing a book, or Marketing 101?","review":"There's no doubt that there's some good information here, but I was a little overtaken by the 'businesslike' manner she portrays. It works for self-help relationship books like her's. But it seems somehow sacreligious for any kind of literary writing. If I were looking to write for the money it brought in (as compared to writing for the discovery, joy, uncontrollable need) this would probably be a great book. For me, it's somewhat interesting and mildly depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok i guess","review":"This book was Ok, but as far as it being a step-by-step approach it wasnt so great. I didnt see many unique ideas and the step by step approach was ambiguous. Just about all of the information I got out of this book I recieved through a simple internet search. If you are looking for a hold your hand approach to publishing, I would look elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"new\\" series to be hooked on!!","review":"I'd never read any of this series before, but it's laugh outloud funny, and I'm hooked! For example, \\"If liars' pants really did catch on fire, I'd be buying new drawers five times a week.\\" (p. 164, hardback) They're clean, if that matters to you, and I'm getting settled in to order more. Extremely recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and memorable","review":"An exciting book with stories that I can't get out of my mind, months after reading it.This book is more than vignettes of life in Costa Rica, this is first rate anthropology in fictional and memoir form. You will never forget the people in these stories. They will make you laugh, cry and fear. Great stories about fascinating real people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted after my trip","review":"I don't know about the reviewers who said that you will never forget the people in this book. Still, this book was just what I wanted after my 2-week trip - interesting vignettes from someone who truly experienced Costa Rica.You should know that most of the stories occured at least a decade or more ago, in case that matters to you. Also, there wasn't much about Costa Rican wildlife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much value added in this book","review":"I'm not an academic, but I thought the Psalms of the Bible were already poetry. I didn't read one psalm that sounded better than the original, in this book.

This scale would never read the same twice. It was overly sensitive to the point of not reading a steady weight unless you were absolutely still while it took a reading. I apparently could not stand still long enough for it to \\"lock in\\". My wife had the same difficultly. I would avoid this scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon?","review":"I purchased this scale in November and have had to replace the batteries twice already.

I was so confused after reading one review that said the game was \\"awesome\\" but the reviewer only gave it two stars. Then the same reviewer said over and over to keep all adults away from the game, but added that parents can help kids through the hard levels. Huh?? I decided to give it a shot and I like it. It provided hours of fun for me and I recommend it for any Spongebob fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 year old loves it","review":"Some of the levels are too difficult for him but he loves doing the parts he can (again and again and again) and I offered a little help for the more difficult sections. The humor and animation are pretty good. Although I found some of the challenges tough, I'm also an adult and he loves the challenges even if he can't complete them.Buy it for your youngn's. They'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, But Not Very Appropriate For It's Age Group","review":"A great game, but a bit hard for the age group it's targeted towards.

I think this game is not to hard or not to easy. The gameplay is great and you are always doing different things. I defintaly don't think this game is for real gamers who like the advanced big name games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun","review":"I am a 10 year old writting from Guatemala. I bought this game after playing it with a neighbor. I think this game is very fun. It is not so hard as I already got to the end. I highly recommend this game for middle stage players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - This is a different (and inferior) game.","review":"I enjoyed the PC version of the game. So, I bought this game so I could play on my PS2.Same title, same box art = same game , right? Wrong! This is a totally different and inferior game. They just use the the title and box art from the PC version to cheat you out of your money.Beware, THQ and Spongebob use deceptive advertising.Be sure to borrow or rent a copy to see if you like it, first."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awesome Game For Kids!!","review":"This game is great...If your 13 or younger. I despies older people watching and enjoying spongebob as if he were some God. Wearing shirts and boxers of him gloating about how they watched the show the day before. It is a time to put an end to this misery over this terrible creature. Nevertheless the game is great!!. Graphics gameplay....Hell a kid won't know the difference but its good for them. Unfortunally the humor in the game is just as warped and subliminal as in the show and the movie though for kids it is alright. The overall apperance of the game is great and is certainly easy to play except for a few tough levels in which you can easily help your child through. If you catch any adult near this game officialy declare them an outcast and stay away from them at all costs. This game is awesome only if your 13 or younger!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Game","review":"This game is good my kids like it, they just can't get past a certain level, my wife and I both try to beat the level for them and can't LOL But over all it's a good game. My wife and I just aren't game players, my kids will figure it out sooner or later."},{"rating":"1","title":"For absolute beginner dummies only","review":"I'm a bit disappointed with this book. It seems to be aimed at people who wouldn't recognize an exercise bike if they bumped into it. After 40, most people train for health rather than aesthetic amusement. So I was surprised to see some potentially injurious exercises demonstrated. (Maybe that's why the author has had seven knee surgeries.) Although she never claims to know what she is talking about. Perhaps she should have written a book on tennis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaks to all levels.","review":"I am a former athlete that my 20s and 30s that got the best of me. Now 50 pounds heavier, with high blood pressure and lower engery levels I want to make a change. What I liked best was how this book was an easy read the first night read over 50 pages. The key fundemental that was repeated was get up and do something constintantly even if its taking a walk for 15 minutes for 3 times a week and then increase steadily. This book also gives people a little embrassed about getting back to the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky cute with a touch of drama","review":"I got the table lamp first and loved it, so thought I would try this. Was afraid it might be \\"too much\\", but it is not. I obsessed about how to arrange the lights for at least a week, but now I am satisfied. The only thing I wish is that it had a dimmer included on the switch like my last floor lamp did. It gives off a lot more light than I thought it would with those dinky little 25 watt light bulbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for 90s technology","review":"I bought this card for an old Dell mini-desktop that I turned into a cheap digital VCR. The card installed with no problems, the software is easy to use, and it actually syncs audio and video better than a newer AIW AGP card that I was using in a different machine. It works good with Windows XP, and if I wanted to search for the old Windows 98 drivers for the rest of the hardware on this machine, it could probably run even better. I'm really impressed, considering I never expected to downgrade to PCI video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"There is nothing practical about this book. It is a looooong, purely theoretical torture with only a few examples that don't work too well in the real world. I had to buy it for one of my graduate classes and here I am three months later even more clueless than I was when I started. This book is very boring, painful to read. It doesn't help that the author is clearly biased in favor of traditional HRM and refuses to give much room to more modern thinking. The exercise book is a nightmare. The exercises are either impossibly difficult and time-consuming because the textbook does not offer valuable guidance for any practical problems, or they are an absolute waste of time - students basically have to copy a chapter. I could go on like this forever. In a nutshell: buy this book if you have to, but sell it as soon as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unknown International Version","review":"The book came quickly, and is new. However it is the international version which was not included in the original description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, from a student perspective.","review":"I thought this class would be one of my favorites, but the textbook saw to it that it would not live up to this expectation. The book is technical and boring. There isn't any anecdotal information (which I find very helpful for moving a student through the chapters). I don't know if there is a better choice out there, but if there is, teachers should make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Outdated","review":"This book was assigned for an undergraduate degree in HRM. This author clearly has not worked in the real world as every point of view is from an archaic way of doing things. He still uses the term \\"personnel department\\"!! What year are we in?? Aside from his ancient rhetoric, it is also one of the most boring books I have ever read and I love compensation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful service","review":"I ordered a textbook for class and have never received it. I reached out to the seller on numerous occasions and never received a response. I had to ask Amazon to get involved and then received a prompt refund.

I even love Donna Summer's \\"On the Radio.\\" It's great when Emmylou Harris cuts loose. Enough of this gentility! She needs to record another \\"Baby, Better Start Turnin' 'Em Down.\\" This was the first collection where her voice started to fray, possibly from the gusto she put into this remarkable, unbridled record.

I definitly recomend to rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demo pretty weak","review":"Played the first one and thought it was okay. I recently played the demo that was packed in with OPM magazine. It was pretty dismal. The game play is slow, the camera is nausiating and overall the game is just slow and no fun. I think I liked the first one better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"We have been playing Tak 2 and have been very disappointed in the product.

You might want to rent before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you","review":"Not very good, not very fun, very slow. Much better products out there. My biggest complaint is the game has gotten any better since the first one. I rented it and am glad that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair not great","review":"Our family owns the first Tak and while I don't think this game is bad, it just seems a bit too similar to the first game and still has many of the same problems. The collect-fest of the game is still as annoying as it was in the first game also the camera works very poorly. The characters and graphics look better, the worlds are larger and there are some decent puzzle aspects - but it just still feels a bit slow and monotnous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating game","review":"Well we thought this would be a nice game for our kids, not gory violence, lots of fun, etc. My kids played it a few times than asked me to play because they were stuck. I got a little further, but then got to a place that is just too agravating. I would agree that the clips are funny, to a point, and I would completely agree that the controls are far too difficult and it is too easy to get stuck without any help to get out. Stay away from this game. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever, Tak is great!","review":"The review below is very weird. I have this game and have been playing it for a few weeks now. This game is tops for me because my mom will only let me have E games and this is by far the best E game out there. The puzzles in the game are cool and hard. You don't finish this game in one day which is like other games. Maybe the guy got a bad copy orsomething. The angles in the game are fuzzy at times but all the games cameras have problems. The game is really funny and levels are well done. This game looks a lot better than most kid games do. The dream worlds are great. I like this game and give it a 10.

Thanks to the romance of a Paris setting and a buttery Cole Porter score, détente between stars Astaire and Charisse develops quickly, followed by marvelous dancing routines. At age 57, Astaire is still a dazzling, graceful performer, while Charisse ably fills Garbo's shoes. Peter Lorre, in a rare comic turn, even vamps his way through the rollicking \\"Siberia.\\" Irresistible entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silk Stockings","review":"Fred and Cyd were never singers or actors; they should have stuck to what they knew best....dancing!

Digital enhancement would appear to be needed in this particular case."},{"rating":"2","title":"musical Ninotchka","review":"As much as I love Fred Astair and Cyd Charisse, it must be said that the original Ninotchka has qualities that this version lacks. But then you don't get Peter Lorre singing and dancing in the original Garbo picture. For a musical lover, or a Fred Astaire fan it is an absolute must. Note that you will see much more of Charisse than Astaire, but we'll take what we can get, right? The quality of the print is very high- overall a great addition to your classic film collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astaire","review":"Classic Astaire & Charisse. Together they're magic! Unexpectedly, Peter Lorre shows a touch of comedy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Oldie","review":"Excellent movie that hasn't been shown much in recent decades. Especially good for those who remember the Cold War, although younger generations could enjoy the music and dance as well. Some of the dance numbers are fabulous, and Cyd Charisse is at the top of her form. Last musical in which Fred Astaire did his top-hat and tails routine.

Definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys musicals, and musical comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Classic!","review":"Good acting, but what's great about the movie is the dancing.

The \\"family man\\" who spends his work day conjuring-up new andinovative means in the pursuit of the mass-murder of over a million humansouls. The \\"good soldier\\" who will blindly follow the fascist doctrine ofhis Hitlerian superiors and take pride in his ability to impress them with the butcher's bill of his murder machine. Truly, his story is a good insight into a worse case scenario of \\"the nobody\\" who ascends to a position of power within the parameters of a police State that will allow any excess and rationalize any atrocity in its never-ending pursuit of self justification. It could happen here, it could happen anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banality of evil","review":"'The banality of evil 'is what comes to mind. This concept was developed by Anna Harendt at trial of criminal Nazi Eichmann in Israel in 1961 - 1962. Thus she felt that Eichmann, far from being the bloodthirsty monster we have described, is a man sadly banal, a small ambitious and zealous officer, entirely subject to the authority, unable to distinguish right from wrong. Eichmann believes perform a duty, he followed the guidelines and stopped thinking.This is what we feel about Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of the extermination camp Auschwitz. The remorse realizes sometimes, very timidly, towards the end, to be evacuated as radically it showed. The écoeurement dispute is the revolt by reading this auto-biography. A necessary reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPORTANT MEMOIR FOR NEUTRALIZING HOLOCAUST DENIAL","review":"In his autobiography, Rudolf Hoess openly writes that he was personally responsible for the gassing murder of 2-1/2 million Jews at Auschwitz-Birkenau. He wrote the memoir just before his execution for crimes against humanity to save his family from consequences of his actions. Hoess took full responsibility for his crimes. It was a mea culpa -- complete with elaborate tables with a breakdown of which country various populations of his victims had come from.Hoess concludes his memoir explaining that he wrote it so the world could see that he wasn't a monster -- rather, just a misled bureaucrat who hopes his family will not be made to suffer for his crimes. The book is well worth reading -- especially by those who either out of ignorance or wickedness take the position that the Holocaust never happened.See: \\"Pope, Expressing Solidarity With Jews, Reacts to Uproar Over a Holocaust Denier\\" -- New York Times[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comandant of Auschwitz","review":"I first read this book in the 7th grade, many years ago. It started for me a lifetime interest in history, autobiographies and WW2. This autobiography is frightening in its normalcy...in the matter-of-fact manner in which he describes the construction and operation of the gas chambers, his family relationships, and his mindless acceptance of even the most barbaric orders all in the same paragraphs. Hoess wrote this book between his arrest and his hanging, and under those circumstances you would expect some element of contrition. Instead, the reader is given Hoess's classic cry of innocense...\\"I was just taking orders\\". Nevertheless, the book does offer a peek behind the characters of Nazi history, with hints at some of their motivations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Little Problems make for one big flaw","review":"Like other reviewers I have found many problems that indicate lack of a quality technical editor. There are several typos per chapter most heavily concentrated in the math sections (missing parenthesis, squares, improper powers, units and just bad math).

Reading about the holocaust many survivors talk about the Chimney's and the Crematoriums from a distance since most of them weren't in a sonderkommando unit. This book allowed me to put my imagination and vision of inner Auschwitz to a reality. To actually be a eyewitness to the gas chambers is beyond belief.

The first one was to assist him and the second one was to go to the gas chamber and up the smoke stack. He made a wise decision. What bewilders me how he could keep doing the disections. Mostly on twin childern. Dr. N must have been good as he did an atopsay on a murdered SS man. Why would the nazis let a \\"OTHER THAN\\" do that work on a SS man? Dr. N must have been an excellant doctor. The ending also is very interesting. Like a good movie the book has a very interesting ending. A must read for all...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting viewpoint","review":"This book is written from the viewpoint of the pathologist who had to satisfy Mengele's sadistic cravings. While Dr. N did what he had to do to preserve his life, did he facilitate and spur Mengele's urges? This book raises the question of whether it was better to be shot immediately for disobedience to the SS, go immediately into the gas chambers/ovens, or should one do whatever it takes to preserve one's life to the last possible moment, no matter what the suffering. I was particular interested in the young Jews who manned the ovens. Each knew that their life expectancy was only 4 months, yet they still undertook gruesome tasks, not to preserve their life for a chance of escape or to help others, but just to live a few months! What difficult choices these poor men had to make! This book spurred me to read other accounts. I have just started \\"Children of the Flames\\". It too is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"If you have a weak stomach, stay clear of this book, it is not for the faint at heart.

As one reads the book, it's difficult to understand that such a thing really happened.It's a fairly short book, but it tells enough to get its point across. It's not a history of Auschwitz. It is simply one man's experiences while trying to survive. I certainly don't blame him for his part in the cruelties. He did what he had to do to live, day by day.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the cruelties inflicted upon the \\"undesirables\\" of Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, engaging","review":"Really enjoyed this inside story from a prisoner with an uncensored view of the dementia of the Reich.

I finished this book in a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read and Understand","review":"I bought the book on a saturday evening, by Sunday afternoon I was done. I have been reading a lot of Holocaust books and this has to be one of the best. So sad and yet so true... If you truly want to learn about the horrors of the holocaust start with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good account of Auschwitz","review":"Extremely moving book. Why it stands out distinctly from the other accounts of the Holocaust is because of the technical details and description (kind of dispassionate in the style) than some of the other dramatized versions of the movies and books on the same topic.Specifically, the forward by Bruno Bettelheim has brought out some important observations w.r.t. \\"inertia\\" of the crowd to make a change or revolt against an adverse change brought by someone else. The term that he uses frequently - \\"business as usual\\" - has thrown a new light on the \\"passive\\" mentality of the crowd, and has given examples of how the \\"active\\" minds actually escaped this atrocity that time by acting in time.Second book to give me a shiver while reading after \\"Into thin air\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone-chilling account of Aushwitz-Birkenau","review":"A very vivid and frightening first-hand account of the horrendous atrocities committed at Auschwitz through the eyes of Dr. Mengele's assitant (Dr. Miklos Nyiszli). At times details were nauseating; not for the faint of heart or children! But this book is a must read. Everyone should be educated on the terrible crimes against humanity committed by the SS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auschwitz","review":"Once I began reading and got into the story, I felt compelled to finish even if it was too sad to read at times. We must know what happened and we must not forget.

I particularly enjoyer resding the forword by Bruno Bettelheim who raises a very profound question. Excellent read for people with solid stomachs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious hard-to-read book","review":"This book basically shows what would happen if the inmates ran the asylum. It reads like fiction, but it is a real trip to hell. The doctor is a fine writer and captures every sordid detail. It is a hard book to read, but I am sure it was harder to write. A must read for all Holocaust deniers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the more IMPORTANT and EXPLAINING book about nazis'cruelty","review":"I am an italian - JEW - doctor M.D.,I am born in 1932, Iescaped from nazis' persecution first hidden, after escaped inSwitzerland: I had a grandmother and two uncles died in Auschwitz and Mauthausen. I THINK as M.D. (and also psychanalist) systematically studying Nazism with a great interest - professional and personal and historical - THAT THIS NYISZLI'S BOOK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND EXPLAINING ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE PARTICULARITY OF NAZIS' QUALITY OF CRUELTY: NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH WHICHEVER OTHER SLAUGHTERS OF THE WHOLE HUMAN HISTORY. I was bewildered on reading another reviewer writing: \\"interesting but nothing new\\". I apologize but I don't agree at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling but an intriguing book","review":"I try to read as much about history as possible. People who are fighting or have fought in wars are our loved ones and ancestors. This book is not pretty - but it is not meant to be. It is a book based on one man's journey in life and Auschwitz. I would recommend it to anyone. We need to know the history of our land and people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"As with most stories about the holocaust, it explains the struggles and strength of those that had to endure such horrific circumstances. This book goes into details of what the author went through. A very good read that allows you into this tragic time of our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Forget","review":"A chilling reminder of the horrors and inhumanity of the Holocaust. There were times when I didn't like Dr. Nyiszli very much. It was had to rectify his willingness to participate in Mengle's activities. But I think that's a true testament to the frank honesty of his account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Narrative","review":"Prisoner/Doctor recalls his eight months in WW2 concentration camps. He was fortunate to survive as thousands around him fell victim to Nazi atrocities. Detail is remarkable as he recounts the terror and horror. However, little detail of Dr. Mengele's experiments is related to us in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"I'm not a non-fiction reader usually, but this book held my interest and gave a different perspective on the horrible experience of being at aushwitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best First Hand Accounts of the Holocaust","review":"This work is a memoir written by the chief coroner at Auschwitz, and documents in detail the bizarre autopsies he was forced to carry out, the limited life-span of the Soberkommando, how he survived, and how he managed to preserve his own humanity and sanity in an environment lacking both. The writing style is clear, simple and always compelling. In its own way, it is as an important work as Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" for those attempting to grasp the savagery of the Holocaust. I most highly recommend this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and to the point","review":"Disturbing, but that's exactly what it should be. It amazes me that there are still people who deny it happened. I don't know how to respond to the 2 guys who gave 1 star with identical reviews. I'd like to see your research on the doctor. To the other person who gave 1 star-what did you think you would be reading about when you chose a book about Auschwitz?? Sunshine and roses? Yes life goes on, and it has, and the survivors got past the horrors somehow.I found this to be a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distrubing but Brilliant","review":"Auschwitz certainly won't make you smile or give you any warm fuzzy feelings but is more likely to leave feeling depressed and probably grateful that you didn't have to live through such an experience.An open window into Auschwitz and the mind of one of its prison doctors. If I were a high school teacher this would be compulsory reading for my class. You cannot read it without being horrified and moved to the core of soul. I was left thinking about \\"Auschwitz\\" for weeks afterwards.A must read but prepare yourself for truths you may not want to be confronted with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A historical read.","review":"Having just finished this book, I will say that it is a must read. This is a very disturbing look into Auschwitz and the attrocities that took place, under the direction of Mengele. This account, from a Dr. details that number of people massacred and how they were relieved of their lives. This man, for one reason or another, managed to stay alive and recount the life in Auschwitz as no other could. He is detailed in his memories of the place and gives a clear image for the reader to understand. It is one of those books that you don't often find, in which once you start, you simply cannot put it down. Truly one of the best accounts to date, as it has held up under the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Quick and Informative","review":"I read this book recently and found it thought provoking and certainly informative. This isn't a classic or great piece of literature. It's a essentially a pretty frank account of the Nazi atrocities as seen through the eyes of a medical professional who worked alongside Dr Mengele in Auschwitz and fought to stay alive. The material is different than the typical camp survivor because the author lived a much different life than the majority of those crammed into barracks.I found the book worthwhile and I'd read it again. This isn't an all encompassing piece of work about the holocaust, rather a view through the eyes of a survivor who had to watch those around him suffer and perish. I'd recommend it to anyone who already has read a fair bit on the holocaust and wants to see it through a different set of eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!!!!!","review":"This book was wonderful and a defiante one to read again. It is told from a Doctor who worked as a Pathologist for the Nazi's. He was a prisoner of the Nazi's. This book was very good and I really suggest anyone who is interested in history of the Aushwithz Consentration Camp to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was amazing in what the story has to tell to the entire world. I had an idea of much of what had happened in the Holocaust as I am currently researching the topic, but nevertheless when I picked up this book it had me riveted. This is such a heart-wrenching novel about a topic that can be considered horrific in the very least.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Holocaust, or even to those who feel that they have done plenty of study already."},{"rating":"2","title":"chronicle of courage!","review":"Rare and precious account of man kinds darkest hour, told through first hand experience of a man who survived insurmountable odds in order to fulfill his destiny: to give us his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auschwitz","review":"The book was well written by Dr.Miklos Nyiszli who experienced more horror than anyone should ever encounter. It's a miracle that he and his wife lived through this terror. An amazing courage of the survival instinct of self preservation against all odds. I learned a lot more from this doctor's account than I ever read about the holocaust before. It is shocking, but a fast read without dwelling too long on each nightmarish incident. I felt that I was there in this insane manaical subculture where The evil Dr. Mengele was the devil himself from hell. I shed tears for Dr. Miklos at the end of the war when the Americans finally arrived and set him free of body, but the reader knows that his mind is far from free of all that he saw and the fact that he was the sadistic Dr. Mengele's assistant in order to live longer than the allotted 4 months.I came away feeling a renewed sense of gratitude for life and freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auschwitz","review":"Once I started reading this I could not put it down until the end!, having been to see a camp in Germany I could relate to the book.

In return for his participation he was rewarded with a RELATIVELY easy lifestyle when compared with existence of the prisoners who did not have his education and experience. This is where the conflict comes into play. This is what made the book a fascinating read for me.I found myself asking the question \\"What would i do?\\" while reading this book. Here is a guy who is directly benefitting from the deaths of his fellow prisoners. Is he an evil coward? A traitor? Or should he have just hopped in to the oven, along with the other poor souls, based on some moral or ethical ideal? It's easy for me to ask this question since i was not there and have never experienced anything close to the suffering of the author and the victims of Auschwitz.This is an excellent book and i would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auschwitz","review":"Excellent book for those who loves history. the book takes you back to how it must have been surviving the camps.

Dr. Nyiszli lived the horrors, and describes in his book far more injustice done to millions of innocent people than was commonly talked about. Maybe it isn't pleasant subject matter, but it needs to be told.

A bit of a rip off really because you expect a plot to have a beginning (Janie realizes she's kidnapped) middle (discovery of her other family, conflict, adjustment, etc.) and end (resolution.) Instead, you get to the end of the book and realize you have only read the first few chapters of the beginning of the actual story. In order to read the rest of it, you have to buy additional books. The plot has potential to be a really good book. Breaking it up so strangely really makes it seem like a ploy to get you to buy all the books once you are hooked on the story.

It seemed that the author took an unusual (for ya literature, perhaps not TV movies) subject and plugged in very typical, not particularly likable characters. The relationship between Janie and Reeve seemed thrown in purely to have a romantic/sexy aspect, and didn't seem natural or necessary to the plot.

Within 5 min. of reading this book, I just could not put it down. The reason why I say this is a good book, and not a very good book is because, yes I did very well like the book but it had some parts where I felt as if Janie was asking a lot of questions and in my opinion she was sort of freaking out to much.

First off, this book has a very interesting plot because it is develop with suspense, unsuspected twists and surprises, and it concludes with an exciting ending. In addition to the great plot, this book also has a great meaning to today's world. Though the story in The Face on the Milk Carton seems exaggerated and not believable, it is more realistic then people thing. More and more children are kidnapped in situations somewhat similar to this one everyday, and this book helps to show that reality to all readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youll love this book.","review":"In the book The Face on the Milk Carton, the author Caroline B.

Later on in the book,\\u0003 Janie takes an adventure to New Jersey to seek out what might be her adopted family.

I think it would be best if only ages 12 and up read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Girl","review":"Description is one thing this book doesn't lack! I enjoyed this book for thousands of reasons but to spare time I'll just name a few. First of all i liked how the author brought u into the book right away. It doesn't take the 190 pages for Janie to discover her face on a milk carton. Another reason I liked this book is because of the mystery involved. You can't help but keep thinking about how or why her face was on a milk carton indicating she had been kidnapped. I also enjoyed this book a lot because it leaves you hanging... You just can't possibly think anything else could happen but then it does. This book was one of the best books I have ever read and not just because of the story line, but because of the way the author places it neatly all together so it falls perfectly into place. I can't really say there are any reasons that could have made me not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book! A must read!","review":"The Face on The Milk Carton starts with normal Janie, a middle school student who one day drinks a carton af milk(even though she's allergic) and is shocked when she looks at the picture of the young girl and realizes it's her.The book, takes us threw her story about her looking threw the attick, in old newspapers, questioning her parents and driving to the house she believes is where her real family lives. Is it? Is she the young girl on the milk carton? Is she Jennie Spring and not Janie Johsnton??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Milk?","review":"This book was about a girl named Janie. One day at school while she was eating lunch she saw a picture of a little girl on the back of a milk carton that had been missing. She had a strange feeling that the girl was her when she was young. She had no idea how it could be her, but she decided to do some research on it anyway. She got shocking results. Was the little girl actually her? I liked this book because you never knew what was going to happen next, and the characters seemed so real I felt like I knew them. This would be a good book for teens, but other ages too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A book with an interesting twist!\\"","review":"This book is about a girl who sees her picture on a milk carton and is wanted because she has been missing. Now Janie is desprete to know what happened to her and goes to the limit to find out.This is a good book to read because is has a lot of suspence and you never know what is going to happen next. Also the book has a lot of the main people thinking about what they should do next. Which is a unique point of view from the book.This is a great book to read if you like to read books with lots of suspence, drama, and lots of important decision making.This is a great book for any teenager to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended for Younger Readers","review":"Many people beleive The Face on the Milk Carton to be a wonderful book and a good one to have children read. I must disagree very strongly with this. There is mature content all throughout the book, and I find that about 40% of the story is about the main character's mystery and 60% is about her and her boyfriend and how it endourages their behavior. Definitely don't recommend this book for children in elementary school. Middle school girls would really enjoy the book, (I would know, I'm surrounded by them) but parents be warned at some of the content. It's a good idea for a mystery, but in my opinion the story was ruined by other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okay Book, It Could've Been Better","review":"The Face on the Milk Carton is an okay book, the author (Caroline B. Cooney) does a generally good job on this book. The author uses dialogue very well in order to display emotions, drama, and moving the story on. The story moves on smoothly and the characters each contribute a piece to the plot line.Personally, I am not a fan of fantasy or non-fiction books. This book, the end and surprise climax was extremely unlikely, it was very farfetched and the logic didn't really click with me. It was also a little annoying to me that the author didn't really give the reader a chance to guess why she was stolen. There were useless clues and they didn't specifically contribute to the climax. But, I do have to give it to the author that it was very surprising.If you like emotional books, with drama, family, and a pinch of fantasy, this book is for you, especially if you're in elementary school."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will really grab you!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. She really gets the to the emotional turmoil of Janie when she discovers that she was kidnapped and her parents aren't really her parents. She also shows the impact of this dilema on her parents. The only thing that I didn't like was the wooden and stereotyped treatment of Hannah, as a disturbed member of the Hare Krishna \\"cult\\". This plot element was too contrived and unrealistic. I wonder if Caroline Cooney has any real experience with Hare Kirshnas or if she got all her information from sensational news articles or professional deprogrammers. (They are the real destroyers of families from MY personal experience!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS !~!~!~!~!","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it was easy to understand. I liked that part when Janie found out that she was on the milk carton. After she finds out, she sets off to find her real parents. If you like to read, this is the book you should choose. A person the age of 10 or older should read this book because it is enjoyable. The author of this book is Caroline B. Cooney. She lives is Westbrook, Connecticut. Other books she has written that you should check out are: Family Reunion, Camp Girl-meets-boy, Romance, and Dont Blame The Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you hanging on...","review":"If you don't like series, I would not suggust buying or reading this book. The story line is very interesting, and well written, but the end of the book does not bring the end of the story.

Janie Johnson, a normal teenage girl, sits down in her school cafeteria and recognizes the kidnapped little girl on a milk carton to be herself. This and more leads to her search to find out who she really is. This is a book you can't put down. I think it's good because of the detail the author puts in and her style of writing. I also think she did a good job in the way she leads you through Janie's search so that the ending to the book is as surprising to you as it is to Janie. Once you finish it, you'll want to read the other books in the series: \\"Whatever Happened to Janie\\", \\"The Voice on the Radio\\", and \\"What Janie Found\\".

Jannie (the main character in the book), is having the worst year of her life. It all began in the lunch room when she decided that she wanted to drink one of the cartons of milk that her friend didn't want; when she was done with the milk she was throwing it away and as she was putting it in the trash can she noticed that there was a picture on the back. The picture was of a girl wearing a polka-dot black dress that she had seen about four nights ago when she was up in the attic. She got a suspicion about it; so about for three weeks she was researching on the face on the milk carton. If you read more of the book you will get into it more and more every chapter. This is the best book I have ever read, why? The book always went into detail and you would never get tired of reading it.

Janie Johnson or Jennie Spring? Janie has to decide whether or not to tell her \\"parents\\" what she saw on the milk carton, and if she should believe what she saw. Is it a trick, or is it serious?

I would recommend it to A 6 greader or A 7 greader.I would not recommend it to a adult because the adult would read for a about a day and stop. If I could I would read thiss book two to three more times. I hope that all seventh grade teachers are reading the book the Face on the Milk Carton with their kids. I think that all schools should read the Face on the Milk Carton with their kids that they teach! The Face on the Milk Carton is about a little girl that is kidnapped from a mall in NEW JERSEY, when she was 3. When Janie is 15 when she finds out that she is kidnapped.

When I opened the book I read the first page and the next thing I know, I am several pages into the book. I would have to say that this book was probably the best mystery that I have ever read.

As such, many pages on older issues are stained a bit, or wrinkled, or chipped, but this does not affect color and readability. It's very amusing to read the ads from the early 1960s issues: muscle-building courses, transistor radios, hypno-coins!!The Fantastic Four was conceived, written and drawn by the magnificent team of Stan Lee/Jack Kirby. (That's why I bought this disk.) Simultaneously, they also wrote/drew/edited the Avengers, Spiderman, Hulk. I don't know how they did it, they were true geniuses.

The book (written only in 2000) completely contradicts what other publications and cadets themselves (particularly Plebes) told me regarding Beast, academics, military training, etc., and some of the admission data was inaccurate. Aside from this, the writing is horrible and the author often drones on at times. You get the feeling that you are reading the script from a 1950s newsreel at times. On a positive note, when interviewing members of the math and chemistry department, one can see what they should brush up on before the go to the Academy.

So, there isn't one main conflict running through it. Yes, the characters were realistic, but that isn't what I look for while reading books. What I do look for is a good plot and a conflict that is solved with a reasonable conclusion. Some strengths in Oddballs were that it is, for the most part, well written. William Sleator does a good job letting us get to know the characters in each chapter, especially Bill, Vicky, Tycho, and Danny. And he makes the situations in the book sound funny when maybe they weren't as funny when it really happened. So, if you like books that are quick-reads and slightly funny, you would enjoy this book.

I plan on keeping them after I finish the class in order to use them when I become an English teacher. The author introductions are helpful and insightful, providing sufficient background on the writer so that the reader may better understand each story by having a basic knowledge of what the author was experiencing in his or her life.

Between those writers there are great American works by Samule Clemens and Henry David Thoreau. A collection of writings like this is perfect for any home.

From Christopher Columbus' letters to Tennessee Williams' famous \\"Stella!\\" in A Streetcar named Desire, this anthology covers everything. The introductions to the pieces of literature not only tell about the author but the history behind the works. There is something for everyone and though it is huge (2879 pages to be exact)it takes up less room than would owning all of the classics in this anthology. I gave this anthology four stars only due to the akward size and the thin pages that cause you to look through to the other side of the page, blurring the already small type.

This is definitely an action/mystery novel and it is a fairly short book by the Koontz standards.Graham's palpable fear is key to the novel's rewarding ending.In accurately describing not only Graham's fear but the madness of the killer's deep desire, we are forced to arrive at a variety of feelings which will strike readers with differing opinions.The relationship between Graham and his girlfriend was also superb. Despite not being a well known novel, this is one worth picking up and reading a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense, Scary if you're a woman!","review":"I personally thought this was a scary book, that I would not have read if I knew about it more. It scared me because the main character, \\"The Butcher,\\" was a rapist who killed many woman. It was scary and kind of disgusting to hear about these women being raped, and it felt as if you were there, watching it in person. It makes you want to cry, it's so intense. - But you do hear about a couple, Graham and Connie, who barely survived, because of the Butcher and his evil gun. The only part I enjoyed was when you hear about Ira Preduski, the detective, who seemed to be so nice and caring towards these people. He was kind and warm hearted. He made the day. - So, if you are looking for a more scary, thriller book, check into this one. If you are like me, then STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great buildup and then it falls flat","review":"I enjoyed the book until the ending. That was the one of the most disappointing endings to a book I have ever read. However, I guess every book of his isn't going to be fantastic. I thought the main theme of this book was very interesting, and the standard man and woman who fight the villain together and also become romantically involved (or at least attracted) is not a problem for me. Even though it's in every one of his books, it's also in most action movies and TV series (for example \\"The Outer Limits\\"). It's something that writers seem to think is necessary to appeal to the widest audience, to have a male and female protagonist. This book isn't one of his best--try \\"Servants of the Twilight\\", \\"Midnight\\", or \\"Mr. Murder\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early Koontz","review":"This is a great story, even decades after being written. Graham, an ex-mountain climber, fear-filled after a serious accident, has developed psychic powers. Show-casing his talent on tv by identifying a demonic serial killer, he becomes the targeted next victim. More suspense than horror, our hero has to battle this sicko with his wits and overcome his fear as he and his girlfriend are stalked in deserted office building. No power, no phone, only his mountaineering skills and luck and one really mean crazy with a gun determined not to give up. I just had to stay up late and find out what happens. Interesting description of climbing technique and a strong sense of place, New York city in a snow storm. Some of the characterizations were weak, but a bit of a twist at the end adds some spice.

They are all too similar and their titles border on thoughtlessness. I enjoyed Koontz before i started reading people who spent a bit more time with their novels and payed a greater attention to details. It is my feeling that Koontz writes like the rest of us use the toilet. He just sits down once a day and squeezes one out. Where do all of these books come from and how do they keep getting elected best sellers? They arent bad or uninteresting, but they are more like an outline for what could be a very interesting world than an actual novel. If you want something you can read in a day and not have to think much about then go for it. His novels are entertaining. If you are interested by complex characters and twisting storylines then look elsewhere. Leave Dean on his porcelain throne..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz actually wrote this?","review":"I tell ya, after reading Twilight Eyes and Seize the Night, I was in love with Koontz. I read this book next, and I honestly do not believe Koontz wrote this. It seems as if this book was written for a much younger audience than his other books, and the plot is basically pieced together from other far superior books. About 1/4 of the way through this book, i really was thinking about just quitting, but i kept reading, hoping for that major plot twist or ubelievable ending. Sadly, the last half of the book is just as boring as the first. I was hugely disappointed in this book. You want a good Koontz book, read Twilight Eyes.

Yes, the women may prevail by the end of the book (I'm guessing, I didn't get past page 5) but as a woman, I was terribly offended by the first few pages.I have read other Koontz books. The Face was marvelous, clever, smart. This seemed almost to be written by a different man. Maybe he's gotten better as his skills improved, but I couldn't read this book and quite frankly, am ok with that. Just warning the other women in the audience thinking of reading this for the thriller aspect that may waste their money. If you are ok reading these details, then go right ahead. As for me, I will move on to another book. It hasn't turned me off of Koontz, I think he is good sometimes, but this was difficult to get past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Versatile Microphone","review":"I've been using this microphone for years. I have two of them, actually. I didn't buy them as a matched pair, so one is a bit brighter sounding than the other. That can be an advantage, as I use the darker mic for overly bright sound sources, and vice-versa. I've used these mics with good results in my project studio, on vocals, guitars, and hand percussion, and actually earned a major film festival award for music I created in that studio. I think the mics sound particularly good on female voices (as a number of reviewers have noted). The figure-of-eight pattern offers the flattest response curve, and I almost always use that for vocals. (The cardioid and omni pattern give more treble/upper mids boost--useful for some applications, but a little harsh on my voice.)Bottom line: This is a well-made, versatile microphone that will do pretty much anything you ask of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on 97 Honda Accord SE","review":"Fixed the oil leak in the spark plug tube, a common issues on Accord, easy do it yourself, double check the torque specs on the valve cover, I was told 17lbs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexable","review":"This item arrived in a flat package which held it in shape and the product was very pliable, flexable and non-dry. It was extremely easy to install and I have not lost a single drop of oil since installation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time I buy from the dealer","review":"Purchased this valve cover set for my 1995 Honda Accord with 2.2 engine. All parts in the set fine except the most important one, the valve cover gasket. Gasket is slightly off spec, with biggest problem being that it does not fit very snugly into the groove in the valve cover. (Yes, I know how to put the gasket on without stretching it, I've done this lots of times in the past with no problem). As a result, the gasket does not stay in the groove when you turn the valve cover over to place it back on the engine; and because you can't easily see the gasket once the valve cover is in place, you can't tell if you've gotten a proper seal or will leak oil. Next time will spend a bit more and buy the gasket set from the dealer, as not worth the hassle for the few dollars saved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extrange looking but does the job","review":"Came in the original sealed package very quick. the valve cover gasket is grey in a extrange material, the other seals are regular, never had problems with them.

Had to reboot in safe mode several times and edit the win.ini file before I found a compatible setting). Since the installation manual isn't too helpful, this card is best suited to people who have some experience installing computer hardware.Once installed, it has worked flawlessly. Some of the features are really cool: digital VCR (works much like a Tivo), ability to run a monitor and TV at the same time, stills gallery.Serious gamers will note this card doesn't have the cutting edge polygon rendering that the top Nvida cards have. But most people will find this card fast enough for most games."},{"rating":"2","title":"When friendship hurts","review":"A pretty good book on the ins and outs of friendship though it doesn't delve much into what does make a good friendship or how to improve friendship skills. However for those problematic friendships, it does a great job and I guess that is what it promises. Goes through the common problems in quite a detailed way which is really helpful.

A good solid book on friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial shallow and dismissive - there are better books on this topic","review":"This book has tm (trademark) next to the terms the author has \\"coined.\\" A little too processed and gimmicky for me, and too superficial to label the friendships that didn't work out as being toxic.Better books on the same theme are The Friend Who Got Away and Secrets and Confidences -- both of these delve deeply and questioningly into the very complicated nature of female relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic","review":"I didn't care for this book, much, as I found the examples and explanations overly simplified. While the book is based on research (interviews), I found that the examples given were often somewhat extreme examples and didn't readily apply to my, apparently more benign, situations. This book lacked a depth of explanation and came across, at times, as clinical. For a topic that is so frought with emotion, the book failed to capture the true essence of betrayal, hurt, conflict, etc. in friendships. I did find a few research based facts enlightening. And reading the book did, at least, provide motivation to look at some of my friendships and former friendships. However, I didn't feel the book provided me with much new insight, factual information, or coping strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book for everybody","review":"This book is great.Everybody can find something there.It helped me to understand a lot.We all desire true friendships and it's possible.Sometimes we just need to reflect how we are doing as a friend.If you really want to make a healthy friendship - read it.You will be amazed how clearly it explains different relationships between friends and their ups and downs.My two thumbs up to J.Yager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Insights","review":"With a Ph.D., the author is well-qualified to talk about the subject of friendship, and offers many helpful insights. It's a comprehensive reference book on friendship that can also be used as a book club study; there are twelve discussion questions at the end of the book. Jan Yager talks about all different kinds of friendships, including friendships between siblings and how those relationships in the family affect your friendships throughout life. She also mentions children and teen friendships and bullying, and offers helpful resources for parents.The reason I didn't give this book five stars is because of the tiny print and technical-style writing with long sentences and large blocks of text. But the information it offers is very valuable as a textbook to keep in your family library. The author makes no mention of God, which disappointed me as well. All in all, though, I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get over it!!","review":"I picked this book to address issues with one \\"friend\\".

With this guide I only find something like 5 of 10 films. Mick Martin & Marsha Porter 9 of 10. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by them, because I see by the other reviews here that this guide was informative to some. Maybe its the only one they've read.

I was really excited to get it in the mail. But after trying it out on 2 separate computers, including one that was brand new with all new drivers and a fresh load of XP the bottom line is that this ATI TV Wonder VE is a piece of junk.The main problem involves frequent lock-ups while in capture mode. This happened on both machines. It doesn't recognize that DirectX 9 is installed, it doesn't recognize it's own capture drivers from the ATI site (yes I checked to make sure I was loading the right drivers that go with this card.)Normally I'm a fan of ATI's stuff - and some of their display adapters have been great.

Oh yeah a top of the line ATI graphics card too...I don't know what the problem is, but the program freezes every time I start it up. It asks me to re-install the software each time I reboot the computer. Oh the CD it came with didn't even work either, it had junk stuck all over it and it wouldn't read. I downloaded the drivers and software but that didn't work either. It just keeps freezing.On top of this, the one time I actually got it to work (for 30 seconds or so), the picture was grainy and horrible, and there were popping noises coming from the speakers.From the gunk stuck on the CD I think they might have sold me a refurb or something...I'm about to call tech support and go nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Product (unless you need a doorstop)","review":"Once again ATI has preserved its impeccable reputation for producing unstable products that work only intermittently, if at all.

However, once in a while the audio \\"pops\\" and the video \\"skips\\". Moreover, when I'm watching \\"TV\\", the audio frequently goes out of sync with the audio. I did a google search and found many other people had the same problem. I updated all of the drivers and changed the sound card and nothing worked.

I ended up returning the product, and looking for another TV Tuner card.I'm sure that if I didn't have those resource conflicts, it would have been a great product...documentation was sufficient, the other programs seemed to function great, but because of the serious errors I had, I'm giving this 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you run Windows XP - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"If you run Windows XP DO NOT BUY this product.

This equipment doesn't even deserve the 1 star I gave it! It is suppose to work with XP - after you download all kinds of patches and drivers that should have been on the installation CD. The system check is, in a word, bogus. ATI support told me to ignore it because its often wrong. I had no sound, the picture was grainy and black and white. ATI wont take it back even though it will not work!

I am only replacing it now because it over heats because of the lint that gets trapped in the back. There isn't really an easy way to clean it out so it just ends up overheating every time I use it. Its not a big deal its just annoying. I don't find that this is a very loud dryer like other reviews have mentioned.

Having the option to select ionic or not seemed to be a good choice. The hairdyrer itself was fairly lightweight and balanced. I did like the ionic drying - it seemed to make my hair much softer. I did not like the on/off and heat selector buttons...they seemed to get in the way and be much harder to use than the sliding tabs some other dryers have. I would have gotten used to them though, if the dryer had not overheated and quit on my 3rd use. Nothing I did would get it to work again; every time I turned it on it overheated within 5 seconds and quit.

Despite the long duration of the Mahatma's struggle, the author keeps the book interesting pretty much throughout. Fischer's two first hand accounts of his meetings with Gandhi serve as a plesent break in the course of the book, giving it greater life, as well as providing a more personal insight into Gandhi. Thankfully the author remains well clear of blind adoration for the man, highlighting both his flaws and weaknesses. The only short coming is that the book was written before the rise of M.L.

The result is a work that could have added greatly to the debate on the future of the region, but is instead largely a lament with few positve things to add to the topic. That said, the book is worth reading, but only with the knowledge that it is a very narrow view of a very complicated topic.

The Princess Diaries initially drew me in because I could believe Mia as a real 14-year-old, but as the series is progressing, Mia seems to be regressing. In Princess in Pink, Mia's search for self-actualization (which at this point has slowed to a snail's pace) seems to entail acting like a sheltered sixth grader and involves a tiresome amount of CAPITAL LETTERS and exclamation points (...).

Cabot takes a B plot, like wanting to go to the prom when your boyfriend doesn't, into a 256 page book. Also the whining that she did...lets just say that there was more then one time that I wanted to slap her. She also said \\"Why me\\" more then once. Are you kidding me? You get to be a heathly teen with good friends, a boyfriend and even a princess. On yeah...you really have a terrible life! Her selfishness also comes through on this book. It wasn't even HER prom, yet she thought it was a good idea to make her boyfriend go by tricking him. I can only hope that the books get better then this. To me it just seemed like Meg wanted 10 books in the series...and had to make something out of nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"Being one of the only books I've ever actually laughed out loud during, The Princess Diaries Volume 5 is hilarious, enjoyable, and well written. I am genuinly impressed by Meg Cabot's ability to portray a teenager, judging by the fact that I am one myself. I never read teen series books, but this truly is different. The Princess Diaries is truly entertaining, and I haven't regretted reading it. Although the horrible covers may be deceiving, these books are definitely fun and flow very well. I now own every book in the series, and I read them over again and again. The Princess Diaries are definitely the kind of book that you can read again and still enjoy.

They don't even mention anything about genetics or the fact that physical shapeshifting is anatomically impossible, but focus on \\"magic\\" shifting instead.I'm only giving it one star for the neat cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Neglected Band","review":"Best understood as the British answer to Alice Cooper. SAHB shares a lot in common with those guys from Detroit -- showmanship, a flamboyant lead singer, Tin Pan Alley influences, and, best of all, a nice, uncomplicated reliance on heavy riffs to power the sound. This and Live (taken from a 1975 show) has good versions of all their best songs -- \\"Faith Healer\\", \\"Framed\\", \\"Vambo\\", \\"Tomahawk Kid\\", \\"Temptation of St. Antony\\"-- and taken together is all you really need."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"i didn't even get my product yet and its been more then a week, i feel like you guys just robbed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Ball Z: Season Seven (Great Saiyaman & World Tournament Sagas)","review":"Perfect for a fan because you don't have to worry about it being censored and you have every episode at you fingertips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Video Review","review":"Watch this youtube review video, which goes into detail about what to expect from this season and what you should get when you order this product!!

And the world tournament saga sets up the story for the grand finale. essential in all collections.Piccolo definately deserves this cover. He is one of the most dynamic characters in the epic. Only second to Vegeta. He killed Goku in the first saga and then trained Gohan to save the world. Then he died for Gohan. Then on Namek, he stepped in when the Gohan and the others were beat.

I was hugely disappointed in this book. I admit that my disappointment is because I require that people investigating a murder actually take some sensible precautions. After all, sooner or later you're likely to run into the murderer, so it's best to be prepared. The main character, Jane da Silva, doesn't think along these lines at all. She arranges to meet with someone who may know something, and I could see there was going to be trouble, but Jane doesn't suspect a thing. Once at his place she gets knocked unconscious, and upon awakening she does some more stupid things: she doesn't want to go to the hospital or tell the police what it was all about.That was enough for me. I stopped reading.

Having some computer work background, it was obvious Mr. Oren was spewing out catch phrases he had heard somewhere, but had no idea whatsoever of what he was saying.

On problem was that everytime I pluged it into my laptop, I had to reboot the comptuer, which it should not have had to do. However, the reason I sent it back was that the sound would go out after a few minuets, and I would have to change channels to get the sound back. The picture quality is also much worse than a tv tuner that goes into a PCI slot, which is expect because USB cables cannot transfer as much data as PCI cards.If you have a desktop, I would recomend a PCI tv tuner or one that directly connects to the monitor and does not need a computer to work.It is possible that the sound and USB problems were because of XP compatablity issues. However, I gave this two stars because ATI does advertise it as XP compatable, and the poor picture quality was because of the tuner, not the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"Jade Carrington was not left with much choice when one of the King's men attacked her.

This particular episode is intriguing, eventful, quite an adventure! The only thing I don't like is the language is too modern at times, you wonder if people then would have talked in the same syntax as us considering how different their society was.

I purchased the book to use the data tables as a means of comparing different units in the game. When I started reading the book I noticed that none of the Soft and Hard Attack values matched the game values for ANY of the units in the book. These factors are the most important numbers to look at when comparing unit info. Why buy a guide book that supplements the rule book if the information is incorrect...not just some or a few of the values but all of them.I also looked at the walkthroughs of the various campaigns and senarios and these seem to be lacking some depth. If you are looking for anything earth shattering in this guide book in the walkthroughs don't bother. If your looking for unit stats to be accurate and informative you had better just look at the data the game gives you.My overall ratting is a 1 and would not recommend this book to anyone who loves this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game - pity about the book!","review":"Let me start by saying that I bought this book mostly for the equipment tables. Well, they are all wrong. Even the headings do not compare to those used in the game itself. There has also been equipment omitted from the tables. Also, the number of turns given for most of the scenarios in the campaigns are wrong. The strategies are mostly OK but if, like me, you are buying this book for the equipment tables - don't!

I haven't noticed any benefit from the ion control, mine and my wife's hair get's easily frizzled with this dryer, plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed. The switch is definitely very difficult to use, there's no way a person can use it with one hand. If you tried, you'd end up dropping the thing. The fact that the off position is between the two speed settings isn't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position.

I love the style and the ion feature. My hair feels so soft when I use it on the lowest setting. The dryer is not only compact but also quiet. I use mine everyday and just love it! My hair has never been so soft! A few weeks ago I went to Germany and was staying at a hotel that had a hair dryer already. Knowing this was dual voltage I brought it along.

I shut it off and unplugged it immediately, returning it to the store that day. Maybe I just got the bad apple, but if one of my kids had been using it they might not have turned it off in time and I hate to think of what might have happened.

It was dark, depressing, and the ending was absolutely the worst. Don't look for happily ever after here, folks.For Kindle readers, there were many typos which made reading it that much more difficult.

This is Dabo's dilemna. Sure the CD starts rough enough with an ill futuristic gangster movie type of theme, ends with the same beat track but little jewels are in this package. Most tracks sound similar; the vocals as well as the beats. Not without any flavor this cd comes off sounding like a Japanese Guru from Gangstarr produced by the Neptunes type of thing. If you really wanna feel Dabo pick up his first cd, when he was hungrier and showed more variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book...","review":"This is a really good book because it tells you how and where to catch all 250 Pokemon! It also says all the attacks each Pokemon acn learn! I liked it because it has pictures for all the Pokemon and it was really fun going through and looking at them.

Ho hum, this is science fiction? But there are slow real teaser ideas here that really began to grab me. What was the entity responsible for the original event? What happened to the aliens that destroyed their own habitats? What's the story with the Kinnt? What was the sleeping god found in space by the other sapient race?

All without forgetting he has to first entertain and engage his reader. Don't look for deep meaning or some \\"read between the lines\\" insight - this is a fun romp through the galaxy. Much like Dune, a new world is created complete with technology, aliens, cultures and language. Unlike Dune, you don't need an appendix to keep up with the action. Don't get the first book(s) (Reality Dysfunction 1 & 2) without buying The Neutronium Alchemist 1 & 2. You won't forgive yourself. Can't wait for the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, I'm hooked","review":"When I read the first book of the series, I thought that the characters were weak, the plot was to thin and drawn out and morality had nothing to do with anything in it (may be just me, but I think morality is important). The only reason I even read the second was that someone loaned me his copy. Now, I can't wait for the continuation of the series. The characters have gained depth, the story has me riveted, all the actions of the past come back to haunt the cast. The whole \\"bad is bad\\" thing is dying too. It seems quite a few of the dead are only there from a need, not a desire to be evil. Overall, if you can make it through the first book, this is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy (its both) books you'll ever read"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could!","review":"I've been reading science fiction for over 35 years. During that time, few authors have succeeded in grabbing my attention through multiple books the way this series has. Larry Niven Known Space, Gordon Dickenson's Dorsai, Issac Asimov's Robots, and now Hamilton's \\"Adam and Eden\\" stories. Peter Hamilton has the ability to \\"flesh out\\" a large number of major characters, and weave divergent storylines in such a way that you can really empathize with the characters(even the bad guys), and never loose interest.

I've read the british editions, where The Reality Dysfunction and the Neutronium Alchemist are both one novel (1000 pages hard cover or 1200+ pages paperback each!!).The characters are well developed and not just hate em/love em stereotypes as are common these days in adventure/action SF (most commonly seen in filmed SF).The story moves at a breakneck pace and keeps you guessing every step of the way. The ideas and technology introduced in each book are incredible.Mr Hamilton is well on his way to becoming one of the premier writers of SF of our decade.I can't wait for the next installment called \\"A second chance at Eden\\".The british hardcover edition is scheduled to be published in October 1998. The paperback is scheduled for May 1999. (this according to a british internet bookstore).I almost can't wait till October"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading - Currently Reading - The Naked God","review":"Not only have the previous two novels been outstanding in terms of character depth and believable sci-fi themes and events, but Peter F. Hamilton has managed to go two steps further with his third and final chapter in this trilogy. If you thought there were some strange and new concepts in his previous two novels, you will certainly be amazed at what is at offer in his final book. The Naked God has certainly left me with the impression that another sci-fi book even half as interesting as this trilogy will be hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! story..","review":"Like anything else; Reality Disfunction / Neutronium Alchemist isn't for everyone..

We see openly his disappointment and fears after Johnny's birth. The child will never play football and may be looked down upon his entire life.Stallings strives for coaching fame all the while advocating for the best for his son.

We chuckled our way through it, and my son now scoots his way around our kitchen while quoting \\"scooty, scoot, scoot.\\"My son had some questions about the characters' motivations; for example, why does the pigeon get so upset about the duckling asking question?

This book is a great book to get children who aren't interested in reading (my youngest son) into the fun and endless possibilities books offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one joke joke book","review":"My daughter got this book in kindergarten through a Scholastic book order. She liked it herself, but I couldn't stand it. I get that it's supposed to mirror some classic comedy sketch, but the characters are obnoxious, it demonstrates negative behavior, it's less of a story than a brief joke, and it's just plain not funny.

I paid $164 for it. I've spent more on repairs than I paid for it. I only have two small bedrooms to vacuum and two 5x7 area rugs. The switch has gone out four times and the belts have had to be replaced four times. This last time the repairman told me that the switch was redesigned in Jan. 2010 and that he would rewire my vacuum cleaner and put in a new switch and that should solve the problem. I think the belts are going out because I am vacuuming on the low setting. It's my feelinig that you must set it to the middle setting or the belts will continue to break. My old Hoover lasted for over 20 years and I only replaced the belts a few times over the 20 years.

Tutu asks us to extend love,regardless of belief, while standing up for the greater good. Thisis not moral relativism. It is humor and understanding andcompassion and a belief in a source that connects us all.I am absolutely pleased to be the first to review and recommendthis book.

I ordered two and am glad I did. Not only does it hold your workpiece at the correct height, it allows setting two joints at the same time.The clamps are strong enough to hold heavy oak, but when done, the light weight aluminum makes them easy to store.

You could get around this \\"luxury\\" clamp by using some simplier items, but this is sure quick, convenient, and less cumbersome than using 2+ clamps and blocks/brackets. One of my favorite uses is to use one end to clamp onto a fixture or table, and use the other clamp for workholding . . . viola! instant movable vertical vise! Money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The extra set of hands you need.","review":"These clamps are great. I just finished a set of built-in bookcases, and these clamps came in very handy. I built them by myself, with some help from my wife, and I would have had a much more difficult time without them.They were superb in that I could dry fit the case to mark where the biscuits needed to go without any help.When it came time for glue-up, the same applies. They kept the cabinets at right angles until I could get proper clamps and screws done. They don't get in the way, yet are very strong. The all metal construction makes them very sturdy - better than plastic ones. You can also mount them to a work surface at the appropriate dimensions and really churn through the operation. I didn't use it, but they are engineered to let you work a miter while the pieces are clamped up.I won't build another set of cabinets without them. Well, because I own them, but if I didn't have them, I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sears copy","review":"I wanted to add a second corner clamp of this type to speed up my picture framing.

Sadly AFTER buying them, I found an almost EXACT copy of them at Harbor Freight for about HALF the price.

One side of one clamp won't tighten, the quick release mechanism keeps ratcheting to the next notch. Currently in the process of returning the defective clamp and obtaining a replacement. The other clamp works fine, but 1 defective clamp out of a sample size of 2 doesn't look good for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for square corners","review":"I love it. Used it (like other reviewers) for picture frame making. It works great, makes perfect square angles, and the quick release is a great feature. Not a bad price at all for what it does. I was surprised that the threaded screw clamps are plastic, not metal, but I haven't had any durability problems with it at all yet. Holds tight, sturdy, secure and fast.

This makes it so easy to use. It is strong and durable and does its job well. Only thing and it was my own fault, is that I tried to loosen it by unscrewing one of the clamps and went to far. This caused the clamp to come undone from the bar that tightens and loosens it. It still works just now the bar can become unsecure.

Although I have read many books about the Tarot (ranging from the history of Tarot to its use and interpretation), Toni Gilbert's Messages From the Archtypes is the first book to give me clear insight into how the archetypal imagery impacts my own psycological, emotional, and spiritual growth. Now I understand why the Tarot, its images and symbolism first intigued me and I am consciously using this new found awareness to deepen my own readings into lasting healing experiences. I recomend this book to anyone who has a connection with the Tarot and wishes to deepen their relationship with this form of divination. In fact, I have already given the book to several friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just really enjoyed it","review":"So this book is not a plain \\"how to\\" book. That's fine. If you have just enough skill, you'll find that this is not only great story telling about how he put all these deals together that made him millions upon millions, but also how he did it. He throws bits of his psychology around through out the book, those are easy to catch, and if you look just a little deeper you'll see all the other points that helped make him so rich, things like: persuasion, hard work, calculated risk, being involved in your business, don't leave things to chance, work with the best, don't be afraid of something you don't know, find ways to make things work for you, etc. I could go on and on.Don't expect this to be your \\"how to make deals manual\\" but if you are the right person, you just might get more pointers than you expect.

Written back in 1989, at the height of his previous career, this book simply tells you that Donald Trump is the modern-day J.C. Some of the accounts of his personal life are nauseating.

When everything is connected, your lap is filled with wires and the PTH plastic enclosure.- The PTH sound is tinny and the button to activate it is poor- The packaging is exceptionally wasteful. It's a series of cardboard boxes and foam inside a useless steel box that has sharp edges inside a plastic box inside shrink wrap.- The zippered pouch is nice except for the fact that it's to small to easily fit the PTH enclosure and the ear buds.I'd be inclined to replace these with the non-PTH version but the wasteful packaging is a deal breaker to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"High price + low comfort = unimpressed","review":"I had heard so many good things about these headphones that I just HAD to have them. Like so many other things in life, though, if it's not convenient and easy to use, it's often not worth it---that was the case with these headphones. They are not easy to insert in the ear and once in, are not particularly comfortable. That said, I realize that everyone is different---some folks are bound to enjoy shoving chunks of plastic in their ears; for those so inclined, this might be an interesting choice, except for the price and sound quality. My B&O headset is vastly more comfortable, easier to put on and take off, and has roughly equivalent sound quality for approximately one third the price.

The included short and long extensions both end in modified jacks which seat exactly in the iPhone's recessed jack. I assume this is a relatively recent change since my pre-purchase research failed to uncover it.The volume and PTH modules end in normal jacks, but with the inclusion of the very short extension this isn't a problem at all.Note that if you want to use the phone features without unplugging your headphones, you'll need Shure's adapter (sold seperately, currently out of stock everywhere).

Realy scary at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"possessed???","review":"Begin reading this novel; it starts off okay, but too much narration, is involved in the story itself, which takes away the feae & realistic (thoughts/feelings) that should be present in a supernatural-horror-story; thus far, this novel is nothing compared to the exorcist...even the book is/can be a little scary, fear-intimidating. if you are telling a true story based on records, do not overshadow the storey with interruptions of reasons/why/how things went on so long. if given the chance, i would not waste money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential inaccuracies","review":"Perhaps the most important thing to know about this account of the \\"true\\" story that inspired The Exorcist is that the real boy in question did not live in Mt. Ranier. So all the facts presented here about that house, about those neighbors, or relating to that location - it's at best derived from erroneous sources, such as the early 1980's reports that first mentioned the abandoned Mt. Ranier lot, and at worst it's all fabricated. The real story can be easily found via Google searches. Knowing this, the rest of this account then falls into serious question, rendering the book virtually meaningless to anyone seeking the truth behind the Exorcist inspiration. It may make a good read, but it doesn't do much to present the true story. Try Google, and happy searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking for my Grey","review":"This book is invaluable when it comes to the do's and don'ts for my Grey. It is very comprehensive and covers nearly the total spectrum of parrot must have and NOT to have. The portion devoted to foods not suitable for a Grey, is however, not marked clearly enough. This is a most important issue, and should receive more attention and a much more prominent place in the book. The various mineral elements, vitamins, etc. is covered extensively, and the scientific knowledge of the author is great, but this could be dealt with in less pages. The recipes are a great help and goes a long way to ensure a healthy, happy and good-looking Grey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picky Parrot?","review":"Do you own a parrot or known someone who does?This book is for you.If you recently bought a \\"Used\\" parrot rather than a just hatched parrot,they might be used to the wrong type of eating and food.this book gives ideas and recipes on what kinda of HEALTHY goodies to give to your parrot.NO AVACADO PLEASE.DO NOT GIVE PARROTS AVACADO OR GAUCAMOLE.CAN KILL.Great book overall.ideal for a petshop owner with birds who cnat get some parrots to eat.Great if your weaning also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"This item is a great buy!!

It is told though the youngest of the Smolinsky daughters, Sara. The father is a preaching tyrant. He cannot make a living, but sits and prays all day, saying the woman is the curse, and blames his daughters for his mistakes. Sara runs away and tries to survive in the world by getting a college education. This story paints life for immagrants in New York during the early 1900's. Sara tells about how she feels about life.

It would be impossible to completely wipe out one's past. Different backgrounds are what make the United States such a unique country. Immigrants coming to the United States should not be forced to forget or abolish their own heritage, but they should adjust to the new life that they have gained, just as Sara Smolinsky did willingly, and her father, Reb Smolinsky, was forced to do in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this required reading?","review":"This is a turn of the century, Ghetto New York story but it's universal to all the world and all time.

First Offence blends pop with a rock edge. Highlights are Peruvian Lady,Lamp at midnite,Shes got the radio and the hit single Sunglasses At Night which is an extended version.This album is very enjoyable bubblegum pop but not his best work.That came later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 songs don't make an album.","review":"21 year old Canadian pop singer Corey Hart released \\"First Offense\\" #31, in 1983. It produced 2 hits, the classic rock staple \\"Sunglasses At Night\\", #7 and It Ain't Enough\\" at #17.

But that is not the worst part of the game, the way you have to save is. When you go to save it gives you an eight digit code to \\"Remember.\\" As if that is not bad enough, the code is not even alpha numeric, it includes pictures as some of the digits. How is a kid supposed to remember this code or even write it down to use it later? This is the worst game I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!","review":"I bought this game for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas. I was sure she would love it and almost had to walk through fire to find it. She won't even play it anymore because it's too complicated for her. I played it and could not win the game for anything. I was super frustrated and I'm an adult. You have to go through several \\"mini games\\" to find things to help you grow fruit in your \\"garden\\". After you win the items needed it is impossible to actually grow anything in your garden. You can only use these tools once (to grow one berry) and then you have to do it all over again. It is absolutely rediculous-If an adult can't pass it, how do they expect a child to? I would recommend Barbie the Princess and the Pauper game. My daughter loves it and I've already won it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game boy advance strawberry shortcake","review":"We bought this game and quickly resold it.

This game was far from fun. Fustrating is more like it. Both myself and my husband tried desperately to grow fruit, and it is impossible.

I own Wario Ware Inc. for my game boy advance and those games are great, but this travesty of a game defiles those good times.

I'll just reiterate that this is an excellent collection of Byrne originals and fascinating covers. In my view his most mature and natural work he's ever done without ever getting away from the excitement and innovations he been known for. An artist in a satisfied point in his/her life is always a joy to behold; Grown Backwards are joyous noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"First class pop music","review":"I bought this album 2 days ago and find I can't tear myself away from it! It is full of diverse sounds and influences, fascinating lyrics, and great grooves. My tastes tend toward classical music and jazz generally, but this album is so well-crafted that I can't seem to turn it off. While Byrne's rendition of Bizet's famous duet from the Pearl Fishers (Au Fond du Temple Saint) is not the best I've ever heard, it is charming. Haven't we all sung along with a beautiful piece of music and been less than virtuostic about it, but been moved by the experience nonetheless? If you are a Byrne fan or a music fan at all, I'm sure you'll love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than lately...but far below his peak","review":"I don't know how he lost his way....those Heads albums and even his early solo work were soooo great! But at least this one show's a bit of a turn in the road and perhaps, if he stays on track, David will once again produce a great album! Until then we can only be marginally satisfied with his output....and look forward to his better Luaka Bop releases...by other musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I only downloaded Au fond du temple Saint, and I'm glad. Both vocalists \\"slid\\" to most of the notes, and it just got really old. Intonation was pretty poor, both tended to go flat. The musical expression was extremely bland, and I didn't like the tone of either vocalist: one seemed like he was bored to death and the other was having a hernia, I swear he was.Sorry guys, it's a beautiful song, and you just ruined it for me.

I apologise for my initial harsh non insightful review. I'm the reason Ricky Nelson wrote \\"Garden Party\\".Clinton Born II"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arias","review":"David Byrne started his career reciting lyrics in a new wave declamatory style; over the years, he's learned to sing, and proves it in this CD of emotionally intense arias. Some of the arias are even written by Bizet and Verdi. It's worth the price of the CD just to hear him and Rufus Wainwright sing the duet from \\"The Pearl Fishers\\", but this CD is a lot more than that; it's the most unified work Byrne has ever done; each song takes something from all the others, and each is perfectly placed on the CD. It lacks a bit in variety what it gains in unity, and you may get annoyed at Byrne's more fatuous lyrics (\\"glad\\"), but he's still one of the best lyric-writers out there, and he's as good as he ever was, good as he ever was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful songs ever!!!!","review":"If you like David Byrne's music, then buy it now because it is so much better than the other albums. Obviously Mr. Byrne have thought this album with a lot of time and effort to bring us this jewel!The album includes great \\"original\\" songs such as \\"Civilization\\",\\"The Man Who Loved Beer\\" and \\"Glass, Concrete & Stone\\". Besides, there are the songs and opera selections (he performs bits of Bizet and Verdi)!! Simply amazing.I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes good music! I can't stop listening to it!You'll be mad not to buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Guess I Just Did Not Want To Go In This Direction With David","review":"I have often been attacked for saying that David's early solo albums were as strong and consistent as his incredible Talking Heads albums, but I believe that. However, David has just been going off recently into areas I would prefer he not go. This last album was just not the David Byrne I have grown to love over the years. The songs are wishy washy and way too artsy. I am not desiring any Opera records at this point. David is a genius and has the right to go in any direction he wishes, but I regret following him on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"MCSE Test Yourself Review","review":"I purchased this book as part of a Windows 2000 Accelerated box set. After looking through it, I wish I hadn't. This book is poor, and cannot be trusted to reliably help you with your exam preparation, because not all of the answers are reliable. As an example, chapter 3, first question asks a scenario based question, with a required result and proposed solution. The actual answer it gives is that you should install AD client on NT 4.0 Workstations to connect to a Win 2000 server, and this can be obtained from NT 4 Service Pack 7. I don't need to study anything to know that client software ISN'T needed on NT4 Workstations for 2000 connectivity, and even if it were, there isn't an NT4 Service Pack 7 around to get it from!

I especially appreciated the \\"foundational elements\\" the author laid out which greatly aided in my ability to understand and differentiate the many subsections of the Hearsay Rule. If you're a law student like me, or even a recent graduate, this book will provide you with the quick reference materials you'll need in the future when dealing with this complicated topic. Moreover, the illustrations and \\"Top Ten Approaches to Hearsay\\" made learning this much easier (e.g. The Formula, The Manufactured-Evidence Approach, and The Real-Witness Approach). Overall, I highly recommend this book and encourage you to purchase it. I have no doubt that it will help you more easily understand hearsay which will likely result in high grades and better interaction in the courtroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"I found Fenner's book to be extremely helpful in understanding the hearsay rule and its exceptions/exclusions. It also explains the rules in a manner that makes them easy to understand. It breaks down the elements of each rule in a way that you will remember on the exam. In addition it provides ways to get around the hearsay rule that are very useful on the exam. Highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and Informative","review":"Professor Fenner's book is a must-have for anyone learning about the hearsay rule and its many exceptions (and exclusions).

This book is easy to read and understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is as bad as the Dean Milk/McCullough decisions","review":"This book is garbage. The problems with this book are these.

By telling his personal story, he may profoundly influence a growing number of Jewish and Chrisitan partners dealing with the perplexing issues that neccesarily accompany such a union.

There were some unfortunate typos and the occasional bit of grammatical license that left my head spinning, but otherwise the book is competently written. The two main characters are somewhat stereotypical, but their personalities may take on more original aspects as the series continues. I like mysteries that may be classified as American cozies, and this is another fine addition to the genre.

Results vary, of course, but there's some great advice in here (mixed with not so great advice - but this happens any time you get a big group of people). I definitely thought that this has a place on most writer's bookshelves (or at least is worth borrowing if you can't find it reasonably inexpensively).More than most books on writing, I liked that this had 1) a fairly large group of novelists who were queried (so the advice was varied) and 2) assigned them all topics so that articles didn't cluster around one facet of writing (i.e. the plot, character building, whatever). In general, a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH CHATTER","review":"There are many flattering reviews of CREATING FICTION on Amazon, but I find the book to be filled with friendly chatter that doesnt contain much instruction or helpful information.

The essays are written in a sort of univerally vanilla style, which is maybe indicitive of how writing classes are taught, but which hardly gets the reader exciting about the writing process. The exercises are hokey, and may be of interest to people just getting started on the work of writing, but will most likely be useless to anyone who has completed a few stories. \\"The Eleventh Draft\\" and \\"Why I Write\\" are much more interesting, inciteful, and inspiring books about creating fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"See movies more sharply","review":"This book was just what I needed. I love to watch movies, and I know what I like, but I never really knew why I liked them. It is the perfect book for someone like me who has never studied film but would like to know more.It covers how movies are made, the roles of all the folks involved, and what separates good writing, directing, or acting from the bad.Also his \\"all time best\\" lists, agree or disagree, are fun to discuss.Finally, it is written in a fun, fast-paced style.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All in the Style","review":"Mr. Glatzer has a wonderful readable style which reminds me of his popular NPR movie reviews.

Fingers crossed that she devotes equal time to Hedda Hopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOLLY, Hollywoods First Protector","review":"I have waited over twenty years for an indepth book of Louella Parsons, and while there were alot of \\"the usual supects\\" including the deaths of Thomas Ince and Paul Bern- Ms. Barbas did a great deal of homework and the beginings of Louella's life has stuff I never heard before. While she generously throws in all the contrary things said about Louella's career, she also gives this journalist her due,and does not act like someone pulled her teeth to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz","review":"This book embarassed me. How could I be interested in so unflattering a woman as Louella Parsons. And, actually, I found her life boring boring boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful set of 6 touching songs","review":"This is a rather short \\"album,\\" but it packs several of my favorite Caedmon's Call songs into its short playlist. In my humble opinion, \\"Forget What You Know\\" is worth the price of the whole CD. The order of the songs, alternating between lovely selections such as \\"Close of Autumn\\" and \\"April Showers,\\" and the thought-provoking but rather bitter \\"Not the Land\\" sometimes makes me skip a track, but I do like them all. These are among the band's older songs and are not as happy as some of their more recent work, but as a set of 6 songs, they're as moving as anything I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to human endurance and a very worthwhile read.","review":"If you need to be reminded that war is hell, here's a book that will do it. Interesting as history and as a tribute to human endurance and the strength most of us don't know we have. The names of the places and some of the history are familiar, but the perspective from one in middle of the \\"action\\" is fresh. The characters are people we can relate to, and feel for. This is a good reminder of the sacrifices that were made by so many, who even if they survived left a part of themselves in those faraway lands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good puzzle","review":"Great puzzle educational And cute. Sturdy and made well like most Melissa n Doug brand. I recommend this for all toddlers"},{"rating":"1","title":"big shoes to fill","review":"Though this movie is still worth a look, by being an unofficial companion to \\"paris is burning,\\" there is a lot to live up to. That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the ball room scene look really bad. Not a sequel to Paris is Burning. No plot, no message. no artistry in filming.","review":"That transexual Ocatavia was completely inarticulate. I have never heard such a poor use of language from all those inteviewed. Not worth the 2 dollars I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"King me!","review":"This is one of those games that is deceptively simple. The game board is basically a ladder. There are 13 characters that players take turns moving up the ladder. When one reaches the top, you vote by secret ballot on whether that character should be king. If there is even one \\"no,\\" it is removed from the board. When a king is crowned, players add up their points. Each player is holding a list of six character names and you get points based on where they are on the ladder. Bonus points if you have the king, zero if your character is off the board.The game is fun and can be played with three to six players though it gets a little more difficult with more. I like it overall, but I subtracted a star for design. The characters are flat pieces on little stands and it is difficult to angle them so all players can see which is which."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see the light....for only the 1st week","review":"Great out-put of light...but only lasted for a week.

And as with the previous releases, the performances here are uniformly excellent and the recordings splendid.That said, these are perhaps not the best of Hindemith's sonatas. True, they are full of immediately attractive melodies, but they are also rather workmanlike (pun, if there is one, intended), in particular the works for obo and English horn. But in performances like these, ideally accompanied by Randalu, this release is still strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT The 1985 album","review":"Do not order this disc if you are looking for Corey Hart's 1985 album.

Without a picture of the album cover and with \\"NO TRACK LISTING\\", there was almost no way to know that this was not his 1985 album. (Except for the small product description that I overlooked. It stated \\"Songs: Sunglass at Night, Boy in the box, In your soul, Never surrender, etc.\\" Since, the 1985 album included the title track \\"Boy in the Box\\" and \\"Never Surrender\\", it alone wouldn't have raised that much of a red flag. This is a poor grade compilation disc with a few hits from several of his albums. All of the songs were included in the other \\"authorized\\" Hits packages. This looked like someone burned this CD from their home and made up the cover art. It is totally deceptive to title this disc \\"Boy In The Box\\". Since, I only spent about $8.00 to get this disc, I probably won't go thru all the trouble it would take to get my money back, but at least I can warn any other potential customers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever Corey Hart Album","review":"Boy In The Box is one of the most fantastic and enjoyable popalbums ever made.It is a perfect blend of guitar meeting synthesiserswith fantastic results. The title track is a fantastic pop song about screen legend James Dean that has a dark and powerful edge to it. After this first slice of pop bliss comes another in a similar vein.Corey screams out the orders to \\"shoot KOMRADE KIEV\\" on this track about the stupidity of the cold war. The synths,drums and guitar go wild on this track that should have been a single.Other tracks are skillfully written with brilliant lyrics and a musical mind trip that takes you on a journey. This album is a must for any pop music loving 80s fan or for someone new to Coreys music!

I had was not into Sigur Ros yet, and I had not heard anything like it. Fast forward 3 years, I was well into Sigur Ros by almost 3 years and I saw them in '04 with The Cure. I was hooked! Bought this album the next day and have been hooked ever since. Got to love the bow on the guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric","review":"I imagined that music from a band with the name \\"Mogwai\\" would be inventive, playful and strange. After listening to \\"Happy Songs for Happy People\\", I found that, while right about the \\"inventive\\" and \\"strange\\", I was wrong about the \\"playful\\" part. The songs on \\"Happy\\" are very pensive, melancholy, atmospheric and subdued. Downbeat, but not depressing, expansive but not pretentious. I dug it. I think I'll check out \\"Come on Die Young\\" next."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This album sounds like _______\\"","review":"One of Mogwai's more interesting and subtle albums, I appreciate the fact that they're continuing to grow and experiment, despite the constant comparisons, not only to other bands, but even within their own catalog of work.No this is not \\"Come On Die Young\\" or \\"Young Team\\" (and its CERTAINLY not \\"the Radiohead album they almost made\\" or \\"the next Sigur Ros\\" - come on, really, folks) - and why would anyone want it to be? Those albums have already been made, and they were very good. But so is this one, so lets let it stand on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music","review":"This album is one of those rare pieces of music that is good the first time you listen to it, and the 1000th time. If you're a fan of radiohead that particulary liked \\"How to dissappear completely\\" and \\"Climbing up the walls\\", you will be blown away by this record. It will relax you into a trance and before you realize what's happening it will escalate brilliantly. The mood this album creates is by far the best thing about it, although the interaction between the guitars and violins/cellos is amazing as well. If you are into any softer music or want to explore it, buy this record. This is truly beautiful music"},{"rating":"2","title":"music for the night.","review":"i like to listen to this album at night when i am alone. it is a great album to just sit back and get lost in the moods of the music.... i often find my mind drifting between focusing on the music and my own thoughts. it isn't exactly \\"happy music for happy people\\" but it's not painfully depressing either.... it is music that might bring you down if you're happy, or bring you up if you're depressed.one great thing about mogwai is that when you are alone it really enhances the enviroment you are in. i guess you have to listen to experience it, but there is nothing like a long walk at night listening to an album like this.this isn't the kind of album i listen to everyday, but it is an album i will keep in my catalog for years to come.out of 10, i'd give this album about an 8.5, therefore i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mogwai shoots and scores","review":"This album almost perfectly blends a number of instruments and ambient noises together to create an emotional mood that cannot be expressed in words. Even if you don't like the genre, I think it would be hard to say that the music doesn't touch you in some way or another. Mogwai's ability to blend some kind of an electronic, errie ghost-like voice with a guitar, drums and bass make you feel like you're in a musical trance. The flow of the music is beyond comprehension, it almost fits perfectly like a puzzle. These guys are amazing, and I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is familiar with the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Know We're Monotonous, But What Are You?","review":"I'm not familiar with Mogwai's other albums, but when I stumbled upon the gorgeous -I Know You Are-, I was intrigued and wanted to know if the rest of the album was just as good. -Hunted By A Freak- was strangely pleasing and -Golden Porsche- was depressingly beautiful as well. The rest was so incredibly monotonous (-Boring Machines- being the worst) that they all feel like filler! -Stop Coming To My House- and -Ratts- start without any memorable melody, again, and both end in a cacaphony that has no resemblance to music whatsoever. Mogwai has to get way more creative on the next album to win me over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I not get it?","review":"This Mogwai -- all of whose albums I somehow ended up with -- are pretty boring. A weaker Sigur Ros, and nowhere near as strong as GYBE!. Maybe it's the constant guitar wash many people worship. The strings are welcome here for variety. You get the idea that any melody is from luck, otherwise it's just noodling. And emotion? Yeah, maybe the same one, really more a celebration of a muddy state of mind. If their thing is to build, then build! The thing I find most enjoyable about this band are the song names. However, they did make one work that does build well, and shines above the rest (besides a track or two here & there): the EP \\"My Father My King.\\" That one's a keeper.NEW (May 2006): I do get it a bit more nowadays. A good listen overall.UPDATE (much needed): I get it, I get it now...! I play this a lot. Along with ROCK ACTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite what I expected","review":"I'm a mogwai fan and was waiting for this album to really floor me... this album only put me to sleep. Their style has gotten a bit schizophrenic recently, the problem is that they jump from one style and one mood to the other too quickly and in an un-natural way. The second track also mimics Labradford too much. A lot of these songs aren't that memorable either, most of the melodies just aren't that strong, un-comparable to some of their older gems (Summer, 2 Rights, Helicon 1 etc). The songs just drag without ever really grabbing the listener. I'd take the recent albums by Labradford, Sigur Ros and gybe! over this any day of the week..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consult the Style Manual Instead","review":"The book is okay and gives you some tips for composing a term paper; however, if you already have the proper style guide, there is no reason to buy this book.Now if it's available on reserve in your school library, it is not a waste of time to read.

No such luck in that department. We did laugh a lot, though. We actually made a joke of reccommending this DVD to our friends just so we wouldn't be the only one's who wasted our money. The plotlines were mostly terrible. The story about the boy who cuts off his finger is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. That one wasn't even funny.

Although not all are stellar, I was surprised at the overall quality. Some of the films could even be described as elegant. The images in \\"Shadows of the Dead\\" and \\"Disturbances\\" will linger with you long after you have shut off the DVD player. \\"Mr. Eryams\\" and \\"Inside\\" have well developed story lines and great twists, especially for shorts.

They obviously got their names to hype it into what its not. If you like b, better yet z-horror home videos, maybe this is for you, the first sequences is ok, the rest....well you'll see.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that both the playing and the sounds of this long work are just fantastic. One can almost imagine Widor sitting at his organ, composing and playing alternatively, trying out various melodies, harmonies and techniques. This recording rivals any of my other organ CDs. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of this world!","review":"What a magnificent composition! Sadly the 8th symphony is one of the more obscure Widor symphonies, as indicated in the CD notes, this is probably due to the length and technical difficulty of the piece.

Music like this boosts life to a higher level..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone interested in politics.","review":"While Tarloff's book might seem to be a timely missive on sex and scandal in Washington, what lies beneath the surface is a commentary on how all of us--both men and women--are seduced by power in one form or another. As the husband of Clinton's former Economic Advisor, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Tarloff's insights have been honed by both an insider's, and in some ways outsider's, view of Washington. Tarloff's book is a study in human nature which combines sex, politics, ego, ambition, power and lust. It is a must read for anyone interested in the political realm and an insider's view of what really drives Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent read!","review":"I have just revisited this book in its e-book format. A well written political satire which was originally published when it ironically proved to be reality. Buy it, read it today. Good reading demonstrating a truly excellent vocabulary by author, Erik Tarloff. More books needed by this writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A study of love and power","review":"Moving and compelling story of young love and ambition in Washington. Written with an insider's insights into life at the highest altitudes of political power. Once begun, it is a hard book to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"hmmm....\\"Face Time\\" follows the story of presidential speechwriter Ben Krause as his career ascends, unfortunately with help from his girlfriend--she has an affair with the president. In light of the Lewinsky scandal, I can see how a satire may be appropriate, but this was somewhat \\"light\\". The characters were quite implausible for the circumstances, especially Ben and Gretchen(the girlfriend/mistress). It seemed that Tarloff was struggling to reveal the plot, and what he did state was especially brief. This book came off as a \\"summer reading\\" type, though I found it difficult to sit on the beach with a dictionary in my shorts. The narrator's vocabulary was pathetically and unconvincingly immense...not to mention placed in long, unnecessary sentences. Of course this is my opinion, and if anyone wants to support some new, pretentious author go right ahead...but I want no more face time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither black nor white nor much fun","review":"This sure sounded good. Joe Klein made an excellent novel out of similar material. Tarloff begins with an interesting premise and keeps his characters in the intriguing gray area of believable human behavior, their hats neither clearly white nor black.So why is the novel not much fun, and eventually interminable, despite its brief length? Perhaps because it doesn't read like a novel, but rather like a prose outline for one: we are told everything, shown little. In theory, the story presented is interesting, but theory is all we get, and eventually it all gets kind of whiny and annoying. And although the book remains well-balanced, it almost never, ever funny.Without humor, or anything resembling a satiric edge, we're left with an earnest sexual/political soap opera in which not much happens. This book feels as if it contains a good story struggling to break free, but it never quite manages to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes talent to make a reader hate a book this much.","review":"I loved Tarloff's other book so much I ran out and got this one as soon as I finished \\"the man who wrote the book.\\" It's hard to believe how much I wanted to tear the pages out of this one and throw it in the garbage... it takes talent to draw emotions out of a reader like that! However, who wants to feel that way for an entire novel? Not me, surely. I did stick with it and finished it just for the obvious ending - why? I dunno. It was like using your tongue to play with a painful cavity page after page after page.It is a valid question in another review I saw here: is it tarloff's story? Why else would someone draw out such horrible pain with so little comic relief except as some form of payback?It just made me sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Dreadful and depressing. I laughed out loud at some places where this foolish author tried to pretend he understood how men think and act. Worst line (in a fit of anger at his girlfriend): \\"Don't think that just because I'm a liberal Democrat I'm not capable of domestic violence.\\" If that's your idea of good dialogue, you'll like this turkey; otherwise, give it a pass. (There's an obvious alternate title for this book. It is two words long and the first word is \\"Sloppy\\"). \\"Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"Some other reviewers here seem to have found this book riotously funny and blazingly insightful, but I'm really at a loss as to exactly where in this story the laughs are, and equally unable to believe real people with any intellect, sense of self-worth, or moral values would act or react the way these characters do. More than any book I've purchased in years, this one left me resenting the fact I'd judged the book by its cover blurbs and regretting the time and money spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rational adults in an irrational time.","review":"I liked this book for the simple reason that it assumed both main characters were intelligent. Sure it is difficult to understand infidelity: but the premise that it is infidelity with the President put a whole new spin on it.I loved how you saw what both characters were going through, and the \\"adult\\" conclusion. I could see the viewpoint of both people, and understood how difficult it would be to say no to the president, and how the boyfriend could agree with that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Energy!","review":"I acquired this CD only because it happened to be available to me at an insanely cheap price but I would gladly have paid every cent or more of its usual cost after the hours of playing time it has gotten on my stereo. The more I listen to it, the greater complexity seems to be unearthed from this high energy, dynamic EP. This is the CD that gave me an appreciation for the Goa variety of Trance music. I find every remix of Stargazer and the additional tracks to be a must for the EP. It does not at all get repetitious as I had first thought it would. If your looking for an insanely non-stop, danceable, tranceable bunch of tracks get Deepsky, Stargazer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!","review":"I got an upfront look at Deepsky on Cyberfest2000 this year in Melbourne, Florida,after that I was compeled to purchase this CD and is great!!!!!

This is a must have cd for anyone that likes dance music in general. This alblum is so good because its techno/trance but it doesn't get to caught up in the super trippy trance sound...Its hard hitting techno (and break beats) with that hint of a light, trance-like efect that comes together to make some of the the best dance music I've ever heard....You just have to listen to it, you'll be amazed.

I was attracted to it only as a novelty because I was an extreme fan of the cartoon series as a child; I didn't have high standards/expectations for it, but the game was just not fun at all. I was playing multiplayer with my boyfriend and we just couldn't stand it. We beat the first boss and then were too bored to go any further. It is too slow. Perhaps someone younger would enjoy it; I don't know if it's so slow because it was geared towards children or not, but I definitely would not recommend it to teenagers, adults or anyone serious about gaming.I put 5 stars for how durable the toy is because it was required to answer, but I wouldn't know because I only rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more turtle games please.","review":"I have to say that the graphics were better than the first Battle Nexus and the four player co-op was a good idea,but the controls are terrible and camera angles could've been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for the Jag library","review":"While no single book has all there is to know about the E-Type.

It shows it as an 'Unknown File' and there's nothing you can do except delete it.I sent it in for repair and when I got it back, it still did the same thing.

There is still some folk based tunes here, but the band really cooks here. With tunes such as, \\"Ballad Of The Beacon\\", \\"Sorrel\\", \\"Rock \\"n' Roll Widow\\", \\"So Many Things To Say\\", \\"Doctor\\" and the progressive melodic number \\"Everybody Needs A Friend\\". Last album with Ted Turner. Their highest charting album in their career (#44). Next up 1974's \\"There's The Rub\\". The only problem with this album, it needs remastered bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four","review":"Argus was a hard record to follow.. My favorites on this one are Ballad of the beacon, and Sorrel. and a couple of others.. Being a fan I hate to knock them but only a few good ones here, so pick them up on the \\"Time Was\\" CD...I did also find the sound quality kind of tinny (live sounding)on a few cuts, but not as out right bad as one previous review found it.. No doubt not a outstanding album/CD... Chris"},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"This is an OK 70s album but it followed the magnificent Argus so it had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the Ash didn't even try following it up. I like Sorrel, it has an Argus vibe about it, Beacon is nice and sounds good live, but the rest is just OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like many people, I was introduced to WA by the incredible \\"Argus\\" album, so I was eager to see how they would follow it up. Unfortunately, \\"Wishbone 4\\" only disappoints in comparison. In addition to the band's incredible musicianship, the strongest point of \\"Argus\\" was the songwriting; unfortunately, the material here just isn't up to par, in fact, most of the album is pretty pedestrian generic 70's guitar boogie. While \\"Ballad of the Beacon\\" and \\"Everybody Needs a Friend\\" are first-rate, most of the songs here are throw-aways: \\"Doctor\\" and \\"No Easy Road\\" sound like Humble Pie rejects, \\"Sorrel\\" tries to evoke an \\"Argus\\"-style vibe in its imagery but fails due to an uninspired melody and indifferent performance, and \\"So Many Things to Say\\" (the worst offender) sounds like it was recorded on a cheap cassette deck in someone's garage. If you really love \\"Argus\\", this might still be worth a purchase for \\"Ballad...\\" and \\"Everybody...\\", but otherwise it's pretty slim pickings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wishbone ash classic","review":"I cant understand the reason for the negative reviews this album is getting.I own this album and can confidently rate this as one of their very best after ARGUS and their brilliant debut album.this album contains such fine tracks as SO MANY THINGS TO SAY,BALLAD OF THE BEACON,SORREL and the amazing EVERYBODY NEEDS A FRIEND.Every classic rock fan should own all these three albums.Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ash fan hates this CD...","review":"Gawd! This is a miserable CD. My album sounds so much better than this muted, muffled piece of junk. The songs are mediocre except for Sorrel, which is worth the price of the album.I saw them in concert when this album was released and they were incredible.

The twist in the plot comes early but the book maintains a wonderful sense of wonder and adventure right through to the end. I'd read several reviews that suggested Larry Niven's Ringworld was a better book but I found it quite the opposite.After first reading this, I searched for and read as many of Shaw's books as I could find. It is fantastic to see such a great number of his novels, so long out of print, being made available for Kindle. This is exactly what should be happening. Unfortunately, at $8.32 each, grabbing the entire collection would be a prohibitively expensive exercise. Perhaps the publisher should consider offering them as a bundle, like a DVD Box Set.

RLJ is clearly out of her element here. 'Show Biz Kids' is a tasty track and 'High Heeled Boys' is certainly listenable although clearly there was no need to re-record these as the originals are superior but the remaining selections are just out and out mistakes. 'Smile', as performed here is so trite and devoid of any feeling that you wonder why she even bothered to record this song: no pathos, no interesting arrangement. The remaining selections fare no better, they all have the feeling of cast offs from a private taping session. Indeed the entire album seems like a vanity pressing, and while it's always fascinating to hear an artist record cover versions, RLJ did this on 'Pop Pop', and to much better effect. It's always a treat to hear RLJ but I can only hope for a better album next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"on snotty reviews of RLJ's work","review":"if you read any really poor reviews of this record, i suggest you go read about the reviewers.

RLJ was voted best jazz singer by the grammies (jazz duet) as well as best jazz nomination(autumn leaves) as well as best jazz singer in many polls, including playboy way back when, and plenty of meaningless trophies for her mantlepiece. to suggest that she is not one of the greatest interpreters of songs of her generation - and ours- no not the joni mitchell 55 year old generation - is to be undereducated. She did it first - before Linda, Carly, Joni, or any of them, and she did it truer, and better. she does not belly up to the bar with publicists and the like, and is the itenerate outsider.

However the only truly essential Elvis album you NEED, other then the Sun recordings and early Elvis, is this Blue Hawaii soundtrack. Elvis is accompanied by Hawaiian steel guitars, ukuleles, and it is as hep as can be. This cd is perfect not only for great Luau Parties, but it's great background music for any respectible lounge album collector. This cd swings too like on \\"Rocka Hula\\" \\"Beach Boy Blues\\"(a real blues) and \\"Almost Always True\\", man this is as close as Elvis ever got to swingin' like Bobby Darin. Exellent cd all the way through, even \\"Itp Eats\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This is an excellent soundtrack that is classic 60's beach music.There are a few of Elvis' best songs on this album, but it isn't so great all the way through.

It's tolerable even with Angela Lansbury, only a few years older than Elvis, playing his mother. But the general theme was repeated for years to come in his other movies and not so effectively or even as believably (ahem) as here, with Elvis rarely given the chance to show his acting chops. So it comes down to the music. \\"Blue Hawaii\\", \\"Can't Help Fallin in Love\\" and \\"Moonlight Swim\\" stand out. After this movie, I would have been happy to have the so-so soundtracks and foregone having to see most of the movies. The up and coming young fans (and many musicians) scoffed at Elvis as the King, unaware so soon of his bringing rhythmn and blues out of the shadows and making all that followed possible. Again, it's the music here. You can make your own CD and skip the crap, but this item should be in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha!","review":"Very humorous.

However, if you have landed here because you love the sound of Enya, be forewarned: this particular Clannad collection does not compare very well in sound and style to say, Shepherd Moons. It's more contemporary, more beat driven, slightly 70's-ish sounding at times, without much in the way of those haunting melodies and vocals that Enya (or Loreena McKinnet) are known for (the exception being \\"Harry's Game\\"). But all in all, this is a great collection that any lover of Irish music should have. 3 or 4 of the songs are worth the entire CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, diverse mix of their early works","review":"I'm a huge fan of SOME of Clannad's work, mostly the traditional, celtic-inspired numbers, not the Irish-pop as much. This collection is a good sampling of their first wave of releases.

The opening track, \\"Jupiters Moon\\", sets the tone for another journey into musical bliss and grooves. \\"I Want To Live\\", the first single, has too infectious of a hook to ignore- one of those songs you find playing in your head at work all day long. \\"Earthquake\\" is an all-out, in-your-face headbanger- one of the standouts on the CD. The band even does an arrangement of the \\"2001 Space Odyssey\\" with their own flair, making it their own. The rest of the CD is Spacehog doing what they do best- combining thought-provoking lyrics with outstanding musicianship all around. This is a bandwagon you don't want to miss, or should I say rocketship?"},{"rating":"1","title":"They went down in flames after Resident Alien","review":"SpaceHog are inventive,yes,but just plain boring.The arrangements are somewhat creative and the guitars and drums featured on this cd are sometimes ear-popping.It's just that the songs are often a bit over-the-top or unnecessary.A few catchy songs though should make this cd have one,possibly two mtv/radio tunes.Somewhat a disappointment since I loved Resident Alien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spacehog Doesn't Have their Old Charm","review":"I fell in love with Spacehog's Resident Alien.

I'm glad I recieved it as a gift and didn't spend my own money. Not that it... majorly...I mean I'd rather listen to this than oh say, Kid Rock or Backstreet Boys. But it just doesn't have the same quality as Resident Alien. I wouldn't really recommend this album if your looking for something like Resident Alien.

After a first album that belongs on \\"All time great albums\\" lists, and a folow-up that showed that they weren't a fluke, this things outright \\"is bad.\\" Maybe worth more than one star from a mediocre band, but Spacehog is not mediocre. They should give fans better than this. Maybe stardom and Liv Tyler has clouded main songwriter Royston Langdon's creativity (and who can blame him) but if so they should've just taken a break.

During a time when many managers and business owners may be focused solely on survival, Roger and his co-authors, Tom Olivo and Joyce Gioia, show the importance of focusing on current business and management practices that can enhance employee engagement, communication, and recognition and thus improve employee relationships, tenure and recruiting as it becomes an even more significant competitive advantage in years to come. Clearly and persuasively written, I also like that this book includes useful action steps for improving any company's circumstances on its way to becoming an \\"employer of choice.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really a wake up call for all companies","review":"Finally, what I have been telling many of my clients, has been written about in a very readible form.

This book is not just for HR executives...it is really for CEO's CFO's and General Managers who want to be ahead of the curve when the labor shortage hits.I have given this book to several of my clients who need an objective, realistic view of the upcoming labor market and what to do to keep people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impending Crisis is for real","review":"Never before have Director Boards and Executives been so focused on the \\"Near-at-Hand\\" as they are today.

Impending Crises puts the focus where it needs to be-----and forcefully. Human Resource Vice Presidents (who truly are strategic business partners) and Human Resource consultants are thrilled to finally have a meaningful resource to be able to refer to in trying to get the message across to the corporate world that this shortage of future talent is for real and needs some SERIOUS attention. This is a very meaningful guide to be shared by all executives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, Dirty, And Good.........","review":"This is my favorite up to date ZZ Top album their dirty guitar picking, distorted sound, and their loud amps makes this ZZ Top album much better than XXX.

I also love the blues songs included on this one Vincent Prince Blues is a great jam. Hummbucking, Part 2 has a really cool grove. The whole band including Dusty Hall, Frank Beard, and Billy F.

I was amazed at the no-frills production/high integrity/grease level of the material on this album.

Guitarist Billy Gibbons cuts loose with raw abandon, laying on gritty, bluesy solos over rhythms drawn from an entire history of roots music dating back to old 1920s era blues albums like the ones I catalogued at a part-time job in 2008. The rhythms of a few songs are straight out of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, and the feel of the CD is much like that of TRES HOMBRES and TEJAS. This CD is a must for any ZZ Top fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck In A Bass Tone","review":"This recording seems to be stuck in a eerie tone with an over use of bass notes. Some of the tracks most especially What's Up With That and Pretty head work very well. This is mostly do to the special emphasis Billy Gibbons contributes on vocal and guitar on these tracks in particular. Vincent Price Blues has some interesting moments as well. Most of the other stuff is just stuck in neutral. There are some good riffs but the soloing is kind of muted. Also, what is really needed is a high energy Dusty Hill vocal. A track like Tush and Francine would really liven up this batch. As it is, this collection is sort of middle of the road fare at 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD","review":"UNDER BRIGTH STARS THEY THUMPED THE WORKMANSHIP OUT OF CLASSY INSTRUMENTS BUT AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME FANS WENT YAY AND YAY AND YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mean Rythm Indeed.","review":"This is a classic example of what the good reverend B.

They were really just getting started on this album. They hadn't developed into a \\"space rock\\" band yet, they were just a mediocre psychedelic-rock band. \\"Hurry On Sundown\\" is a catchy folk-rock tune, but it doesn't really sound like Hawkwind. Bottom line: I bought this album because I wanted to have every Hawkwind album, but I NEVER listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet story that surprises you with its emotional depth.","review":"With a panache for the spoken word, Bayard takes us on a journey well worth the trip. A twenty-five word description of the \\"plot\\" of this gem would reek of cliche. Yet, it is the fact that this \\"Fool\\" is able to take a universal story--who hasn't spotted someone in the briefest of moments whose image won't seem to go away--and make us care enough to not want to put it down that makes it so remarkable. The plain truth is that you like the often exasperating characters that people this novel, and that is no small feat in the cynical world of contemporary fiction, particularly contemporary gay fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know him by heart....","review":"recently finished this delightful novel, and reminds me of romantic comedies such as sleepless in seattle or when harry met sally. i like the empipthany of the protagonist, the \\"lesson\\" which makes him realize happiness is always within the reach of his fingertips, only if he really lives his life and opens his eyes for once. it also reinforces the beauty of preserving idealism within the parameter of reality. Highly recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet story","review":"What an enjoyable read! I found myself instantly taken by the original way in which the author couches his \\"message.\\" Very identifiable characters.Two minor complaints: the style in which the dialog is written gets to be a little old. Many characters start sentences then stop abruptly, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks. Bayard sort of overuses this device, making for a rather choppy \\"flow\\" in places.Second, towards the end of the book one character is telling another about seeing someone walk down the street. Then, on the next page he says the person was in a cab. Very odd. Not a pivotal plot point, but a glaring error nonetheless.Those two things aside, this is a quick, ultimately satisfying read with a highly endearing, exceptionally upbeat and very sweet ending. Well worth the time and money. BEGS FOR A SEQUEL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and wonderful book!","review":"For some reason I purchased this book some time ago, put it aside, and just found it again last week. I thought it was a wonderful book. I started to laugh when Patrick and Alex split up at the beginning of the book. They do not seem to have much of a relationship; nor are they very upset. Alex is a neat-freak; he wants to know if he can clean Patrick's mini-blinds before he leaves because it will make him feel better. I laughed all the way through it, and read it in about two days. The characters are all crazy, the dialogue is fast and funny, and eventually, the author draws a real lesson that we can all take to heart. While it is funny, there is a real lesson to this book. Run to your nearest bookstore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reading.","review":"A nice story. Being a resident of California, I had the opportunity to travel to Washington DC on company business once in a while. I feel like going around DC again with Bayard's settings- those familiar streets, the Circles, Georgetown, the bars, which were all real. It is also good to read a book on this genre without the usual graphic sex scenes. I became obssessed also in finding who Scottie was. All the while I did not think of him as the criminal but maybe a boyfriend of one of Patrick's girlfriends. I was pleasantly disappointed to find out that Scottie was a straight but glad he was Doug. Gave me a good laugh with the ending. Highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"Worst book I've read this year. Boring, boring, boring. I can't imagine how anyone could enjoy such a dull book. It's filled with detail after detail of the most uninteresting information. The ending is probably the worst part of the book, completely anti-climactic. After stringing the reader along for almost 500 pages Bayard allows the story to completely fizzle. What a disappointment. The only positive thing I can say is that Bayard's writing is so simple it's easy to fly through the book in just a few hours. But it's still a huge waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't bother!","review":"Don't bother with this one! it isn't worth the time. In fact, I couldn't finish it and I lost interest in it after the first quarter. Bayard tries his hand at a Noel Cowardesque type of comedy of manners but unfortunately it comes off as a little \\"half baked\\" and ultimately contrived. There is a severe lack of dramatic tension and dreadfully droll and half hearted attempts at comedy. What exactly does Bayard want to do with this? So Patrick falls asleep and sees a man of his dreams - who cares! There is nothing about this story that is original or dynamic, rather, you are just faced with pages of inane, inept dialogue with little or no impact. There is an attempt at some nice, easy and relaxed conversational style but the negatives of Bayard's writing by far outweigh the positive. Forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The story has potential but becomes totally stupid. The main charcter, Patrick, made me angry because of his endless stupidity. Gay people are not this totally brain dead. I read the review by Publishers Weekly and was amazed that they compare Bayard to Armistedad Maupin's writing! NO WAY. Maupin is a master story teller and his writing is on no level of this book! I read three fourths of the book and finally gave up on the ridiculous search for \\"SCOTTIE\\". Save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a freshman effort that cries for narrative technique","review":"The other reviews must have been written by the author's friends. While I liked the idea of the book and what he was trying to achieve, I finally gave up mid way through. This book seems to be a real freshman effort. It's ferociously extended with dialogue and virtually no narrative. Most of the dialogue is pedestrian. It should have been a gem and brought in under 200 pgs. I don't know what purpose the father and Marianne serve. I don't think they edit books at Alyson. It was a delight to read about characters searching for love with all their quirks, but learn some technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Tremendous! Don't Miss It!","review":"If I sound excited, it's because I am. I read \\"Fool's Errand\\" a few months ago and it is easily one of my all-time favorite books. How refreshing to read a gay novel in which I could actually relate to the characters. They're regular people who happen to be gay... Mr Bayard has made a literary miracle and crafted a believable, clever, and inspiring story that cannot be put down. Stop whatever you're doing, quit reading whatever you're reading and read Fool's Errand. You'll be so glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Review","review":"I have never written a review before, but I loved this book so much that I had to comment. If you are looking for erotica, keep on moving. While this book is certainly gay-themed, it is mostly 'human'-themed. It starts out oddly, and for a while, you don't know quite where the story is going to end up. At the very least, it didn't end in the way I expected. which was a pleasant surprise. I feel that the author did a great job with those in my age bracket who have no set place in 'The Scene', and I couldn't help smiling for hours after I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"As if it spoke to me","review":"My father died three years ago when I was thirteen.

The authors love to use bullet points. But often they use them to mention one word that really should come with some explanation.

The advice is uncomplicated, the observations are sharp and the recommendations are worthwhile.If you are looking for a book that provides a broader perspective on the traditions or history of Spring Training, then perhaps you should look elsewhere. Alan Byrd does not really attempt to cover this here but should not necessarily be faulted for this.From personal experience of visiting five different venues during Spring Training 2005, this book was a tremendous help and eliminated a lot of mistakes that would otherwise have been made when visiting ballparks for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide for Spring Training in FL!","review":"We've been going to Florida for spring training for most of the past 25 years.

The story weaves itself in and around previous episodes of \\"Highlander\\" and leaves the reader feeling like he has watched a continuing episode in the series. \\"Highlander\\" needs writers such as Neason to keep the series alive now that the final episode has been taped.

However, it does not cover a few topics in detail which are a part of the exam.

For in depth references I think the Oracle press books are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passed the test, thanks to the book.","review":"The book is VERY comprehensive, and allowed me to breeze through the 2 hour exam in less than 45 minutes. The questions in the exam are very similar to the test prep samples provided in the CD-ROM. I definitely recommend this book for people who already have a working knowledge of SQL/ PLSQL. One problem I did have was the way in which the Sybex test questions are formatted: The little windows with the scrollbars make hugh chunks of code really hard to read. My suggestion is to use this as a study guide, but take the test at a Prometric center, as they have a easier to use interface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even a dummy can pass this test","review":"This book is great because I passed the exam with it. It's clear and concise so it won't put you to sleep. (Or, not as soon as the other books will) However, it contained the amount of detail that you'll need on the test. There was one term that appeared on the test that I didn't recognize--a pair-wise comparison. I don't think it was in the book, but it was on one question of the test. Also, the queries on the test are more complicated than the ones featured in the book. So study hard!! I'm using the Sybex book written by Chip Dawes for the next test. Wish me luck, and good luck to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This book is waste of money as far as preparation for certification is concerned. Oracle Press book is the best. I just wasted $ 39 on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I bought this book because I'm venturing more deeply into interior photography after many years of portraiture and architectural/travel work. This \\"updated and expaned\\" edition has simply tacked on a couple of cursory chapters on digital photography to a tired and outdated manuscript that needs reworking from top to bottom. You won't learn much here, with a lot of topics, almost all covered inadequately. The author appears to know whats he's doing (judging from the sample photos) but he's revealing very few secrets. I've learned a lot more through trial and error. If you're interested in interior lighting, for example, consider John Freeman's Lighting for Interiors. It's dramatically more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A day in the life","review":"This is a fabulous book. It's not an intro to photography, and it won't tell you how to, say, light interiors. Instead, it's strength is in the wealth of detail about the author's daily practices and how individual photos were made, his well-reasoned opinions about equipment, his advice for dealing with editors and architects, and his enthusiasm for the digital future. You'll need to know how a view camera works to get the most from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olga Panties","review":"I have worn nothing but Olga panties for 30 years.

They just fit you no matter what size. Never ever show under your clothes. You just can't buy a better panty. You can buy cheaper ones that go bad with a few washings.

Big mistake. 2nd day of wearing, the rubber sole started separating from the leather foot bed on the left flip-flop. I am not one to drag my feet, so I have to assume shoddy materials or workmanship. Well, not one to grip, I decided to bond the area. The next day, the sole started separating from the heel area. Real junk if you ask me. Also, beware the leather dye they use. If you shoes hold together you'll be spending the back end of your weekend cleaning you the soles of your feet to rid them of the black dye they use. Complete waste of money.

They are a common sense approach to Process Improvement and very different from many of todays buzz word author's that try to mix BPM, Six Sigma, and Total Quality Management with the technologies of BPMN, BPEL, and Workflow - these simply become distractions to the real goals of assurance and continous improvement - which is what businesses today our trying to imbed.

Not only has Ben van Oosten selected magnificent instruments for this recording -and the other ones in the series as well. His interpretation of both Symphonies 5 & 6 is fascinating, Widor has a story to tell and Ben van Oosten is an ideal organist to bring this story back to life. Never dull, well balanced, technically refined. A must for those people that love French organ music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben van Oosten's Interpretation","review":"The only reason I don't give this recording five stars is because I feel that van Oosten's performance of the opening Allegro vivace of Symphony #5 drags a bit, and the recording itself is somewhat dark and muddy in tone, more than I like to hear in a pipe organ recording. It needs more brilliance, which may be due to van Oosten's choice of stops. Other than those two caveats, it's a fine recording and well worth the money. Anyone who loves pipe organ music will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Widor","review":"I have become a big fan of Ben van Oosten playing Widor.

It does a great job of pointing out how sin was way before you ( Adam ) and your life was meant to be handed over to Christ anyway.

There are times when everything on the screen is so far away that you basically need to hold a magnifying glass up to the screen to see what you need to do.

But what's the use? What good would it be to compare the execrable \\"Love Gun\\" to the far superior \\"Do the Limbo Dance.\\" The driving beats of \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" are wan and anemic compared to the thrilling \\"Freedom For the World.\\" And although Kiss can boast 20 tracks to Hassehoff's 18, it's all about quality, not quantity.And David Hasselhoff's chest has more hair than that wimp Gene Simmons.

I wish i were one of his static charged wing collar shirts, as I would then have the opportunity to cling lovingly to his dewy, furred chest. This album is chock full of sweeping sonic majesty coupled with an explosive bass line that the likes of DR. Dre can only dream of. I particularly enjoyed the urban funk fusion that is hot shot city.

Had God truely abandon us?Then I heard this album and my heart sang, I realised God had created a new prophet to lead us into the light. Hasselhoffs dulcit tones have reaffirmed my faith in the inherent goodness in all of us, his graceful insights and sweeping melodies must be the sound that the angels make as they invite you to pass the pearly gates.So I beg of you buy this album - if enough people hear its power we can surely bring world peace, end famine and pestilence and ensure a world of love, happiness, leather trousers and curly brown hair bouncing in slow motion for all of us.Truely this is heaven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure tripe.","review":"Aside from the groundbreaking, heartfelt work of Track 6 (\\"Hot Shot City\\"), there is very, very little merit here.

To my dismay however, this album is an exact copy of the \\"Worst of David Hasselhoff\\" CD which I already own. Perhaps it's because Davd Hasselhoff really really really needs the money that he'd release a CD which is both simultaneously his best and worst music. Or perhaps it's because this CD is imported, and somehow people from outside of this country were confused into thinking David Hasselhoff's worst is really his best. I can't say. All I know is I now have one too many copies of a David Hasselhoff CD, which puts me afoul of the law. I don't want to end up on an FBI list someplace or have a court order forcing me to go door to door explaining why I'm a Hasselhoff offender to my neighbors. So I think I'm just going to return this as quickly as possible and buy something from John Tesh instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genus","review":"I found it difficult to put this CD alongside my collection, but placed it on a pedestal with a light shining behind it to cast it's shadow over the mediocrity that has gone before.

I think his vocals are so smooth and amazing, especially after finding out that he used to be the voice of the old Fat Albert cartoons back in the 70's. The musical compositions that he weaves from his abdomen like a spider are silken and complicated, yet oddly touching, so poignant when he sings about unrequited love. It breaks my heart to hear the song \\"Flying on the Wings of Tenderness\\" to this day, and not just because my husband and I used this as our first dance at our wedding. God bless Hasselhoff for his gifts, and I hope he has another greatest hits compilation in the making.

The CD should have come special edition with some Kleenex."},{"rating":"2","title":"This sure floats my boat!","review":"Take all the adjectives that describe your favorite superhero or salad dressing, and you can apply them to David Hashenpoof. His stature as a master of song is well-deserved, and his stronghold on the pop music scene is undeniable. What most people don't realize is Hustleharp's influence on all the rap/rock bands out there today- it was he who first used turntable scratching in his ballad \\"Crazy For You.\\" He preceded the X-ecutioners and even the Sugar Hill Gang with his AB-AB rhyme structure. And he also seemed to blaze new territory with his unique vocal approach, one that reminds this writer of a furious raccoon tied in a sack with two midgets. Truly amazing.

But to hear them actually sing with the same quality as that of a marmoset sodomizing two gerbils, it's such a pleasant surprise!I can't name a favorite track because they're all so mindblowing. \\"Wir Zwei Allein\\" blows my mind. \\"Crazy For You\\" blows my mind, as well.

The thing that makes this so enjoyable is that David Huskypatch just gives and gives and gives in his performances. For example, on \\"Everybody Sunshine,\\" you can hear him slice open his bicep with his pocketknife, causing him to scream in such pain that he almost hits the right note. On \\"Dance Dance D'amour,\\" his high notes are the result of slamming a car door onto his weewee. And the way he manages to get two angry oxen to wrestle for the song \\"Du\\" is remarkable.

It is a brave, some would say stupendous move, and a lot of people could not make this work, Hodownhoff being amoung them. I commend him on such an action, and see the move of replacing his own voice with that of a tone deaf cat, being squeezed between the buttocks of a particularly fat sumo wrestler, as a brilliant move. Nobody can argue that this is HowdyDowdies best album, since his last one.Overall an entertaining, colorful, action-filled compilation with an intimate heart.

This man is pure class, an undisputed genius. His songwriting flair and 'umphhh' is all too evident on this best of album. This album captures the greatest composer, possibly ever, in his peak; just when you think it can't get and better, it does. Songs such as 'Wir Zwei Allein' and 'Flying on the Wings of Tenderness' capture David at his rip-roaring best, whereas 'Do You Believe in Love' is full of spectral imagery, showing originality poetry beyond his years. He also displays a rare depth of voice which is rarely found with manufactured rock solo artists today! I would say, if David's reading this now, that my life might have turned out very differently if it hadn't been for this album.Brilliant. Just brilliant.Possibly worth a mention; Hot shot city is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A killer cool-ection of the HOTTEST hits!","review":"I could die a happy man tomorrow, for today I have heard the magnificent splendor of the songs of David Hoopertaft. His amazing range and solid delivery are truly astounding. Delicate, lilting melodies blend ever so eloquently with graceful harmonies, creating a wispy mist of crystalline, fragile music. And Harpercraft is like a jeweller at his craft, shaping his voice around these beautiful tunes with a voice that sounds a lot like a manatee stuck in a trash compactor. The end result is a breathtaking display of dazzling, bejewelled sculptures of pure birdsong. We are all lucky to have access to such wonderful compositions. The song Hot Shot City is particularly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly NOT His Best!","review":"I see all these golden stars lined up in rows of five and I don't get it. I am utterly confounded as to why so many people find these songs enjoyable. They clearly are not representative of Mr. Hasselhoff's finest work. After all, the album title even states that a search continues for his best! And they expect us to contend with these - his inferior throwaways - for the time being? Well I, for one, refuse. People, you are being had! Can't you see that? They are holding out on us. They are denying us Mr. Hasselhoff's supreme genius, the genius that makes German girls giddy and other Eurobeings froth at the mouth and tie scarves around their heads.I just don't understand. It has been nearly ten years since this cd was released. What is this? Some sort of conspiracy, some sort of subversive and cleverly concealed plot against Americans? What the......OH! I see now that a Very Best collection HAS been released.Never mind......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many notes","review":"When I heard that David Hasselhoff had burst upon the singing scene like a launched summer tomato, I was thrilled. Surely the vocal stylings of this walking carpet of a man would be poor. While I can't call this album \\"great\\", \\"good\\", or even \\"music\\", I found it challenging to say the least. This guy is all over the place! High notes, low notes, squalling notes, howling notes, big and little notes, sometimes all in the same song. This isn't at all what I would have expected from the Man of Sand in Fur. I wish to register my disappointment. I'm sticking with my Tibetan monk chants."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have seen the light.","review":"I can't believe that scarcely a week ago, I was living in ignorance. I was utterly deprived of life itself... but I didn't know.Until \\"Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]\\" came along.Now I feel like I finally understand the meaning of life, and know why I'm here on this planet. \\"Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]\\" isn't just an album, it's a life changing experience. I have moved on to a higher level of consciousness - a whole new astral plane, if you will.Thank you, \\"Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]\\" - you changed my life.The song \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get chicks: BUY THIS ALBUM!!?!","review":"Let me tell you, I believe in life after love. I'm strong enough for that, but there is no human being with an operating pair of ears who is strong enough for life after David Horseyshaft. And there is noone, man or woman strong enough to stay clothed once \\"Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]\\" starts playing. I used to use most of my entire 500 disc CD collection at sex parties, but now I show up with just one slim sliver of brilliant light: Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]. It always works, too, no matter how long the party lasts. I usually just leave \\"Flying on the Wings of Tenderness\\" repeating for a couple of hours, then let it go to the next track (the appropriately named \\"Hot Shot City\\"). Sure-fire mass orgasm, every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surging boil of great music!","review":"If there were the rock equivalent to a poet laureate, critics around the world would nominate Mister David Hasselhoff. What he accomplishes with a microphone and a leather jacket can only be described as pure brilliance. David Hasselhoff wheezes and hacks his way through seventeen marvelous tunes, enhancing each track with groans that bring to mind a punctured fireplace bellows. \\"Crazy For You\\" is standard love song fare until Hasselhoff seizes it and forces it through his strained vocal chords. His anarchic approach to the ballad \\"Flying On the Wings of Tenderness\\" can be compared to a prison assault. And the skill that he brings to the beloved torch song \\"Wir Zwei Allein\\" lends his trademark caterwauling that can't be matched. A salute to David Hasselhoff and all that he brings to our listening pleasure, salut! Viva \\"Hot Shot City!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Talent","review":"\\"The Very best of David Hasselhof\\" is what can only be described as an emotional journey through the shining career of this astonishing man. Combining gritty realism with a delicious sense of feel good sunshine, we are treated to a view of the man behind the image. Hasselhofs voice lends itself with perfection to all angles of the musical spectrum, demonstrating his spectacular change in image: from \\"the man with the mullet to a modern day artistic genius.\\" On hearing this album one cannot fail to feel close to the beauty and knowing innocence that is the essence of David Hasselhof. And is it possible to feel at ease within a society where the talents of such a performer remain, for a great many people, unrecognised? Buy it...hear it...and fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to enjoy this CD to its fullest- a guide","review":"So you've bought the legendary compilation rock disk \\"LOOKING FOR [IMPORT] THE BEST [IMPORT] OF DAVID HASSELHOFF\\" and you want to know how you can maximize the experience. Here's a handy but concise guide to getting the most out of this aural delight:Step 1- Dim the lights to your trailer. Unplug the bug zapper outside if its flicker distracts you.Step 2- Kick your hunting dogs out of the living room and settle into your vinyl bean bag chair with a cold Pabst Blue Ribbon in one hand and the remote to your boombox in the other. Try not to hit your head on the laquered driftwood coffee table.Step 3- Unplug your telephone and black and white TV. You don't want any interruptions during this!Step 4- Lie back, close your eyes, and hit 'play' to begin track one of this amazing CD. Listen to all 17 tracks until your appetite for actor/German rock has been sated.Step 5- Replay the track \\"Hot Shot City.\\" It is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Something Else!","review":"I have just received this album as a leaving present from a colleague at work, what can I say!This body of work has left me speechless, I've heard nothing like this and I doubt if I ever will.

I can now declare, with some degree of certainty, that I understand the feelings of Paul on the road to Damascus. If one were to ever to look upon the face of the Divine Creator, I can only believe that \\"Hot Shot City\\" would be the musical accompaniment. So, discover what the Germans (and I believe the fact that this soothing balm for the troubled soul wasn't released domestically should be cause for much wailing, gnashing of teeth and rending of garments...) already know: discover Hasselhoff's magnum opus \\"Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is gooooood.","review":"I can't say I've been a David Hasselhoff fan all my life. Only since 1995, when the German company Auskenblaupgenfitt released this amazing, amazing album. Every song included in this collection is a like a whiff of an angel's armpit. The ballads are poignant, the rock operas are epic. And throughout each melody, Hasselhoff's voice rings like a bell, a voice that somewhat resembles a rhino getting a piercing on its privates. And in an interesting side note about this landmark album is that in the last 2 Winter Olympics, the song \\"Looking For Freedom\\" has been used as the official team song of the German Luge team. But what most people don't realize is that it actually raises hemoglobin levels in mental patients, allowing the bloodflow in their brain to slow down, and allowing them to enjoy such tunes as \\"Danice Danice D'amour.\\" And the song \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, now I'm scarred for life","review":"All these glowing reviews... what's wrong with you people?!?!?!

His songs are sensitive yet incisive, foreboding yet hopeful. And his choice of subject material can hardly be categorized as commonplace- the death of a sister, his struggles with substance abuse, and the strains and pressures that come with fame. David Hammelmap sincerely feels his soul in every one of these songs, and I can't wait until I'm old enough to drive, in a red Ferrari with the top rolled down, you can feel, you can feel, the heat. Cool it down, now. Cool it down, now. Eleven o' clock, we're ready to rock. Eleven o' clock, yeah, we're ready to rock. Hot Shot City is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"His originality is amazing!!!","review":"Forget for a moment that David Hathendorf used to play Michael Knight on Knight Rider. Try to erase from memory his legendary role as Lieutenant/Captain Mitch Buchannon on Baywatch. Let's just pretend for a moment that he is just a singer, for the sake of critique.But even then, David Hathendorf proves himself a virtuoso in the world of music. He betrays a profound understanding of subtlety and performance that are only enhanced by his voice, a voice that resembles a mother elk giving birth.I don't have to go track by track to prove my point here. Just one listen to this CD will knock you on your knees and beat admiration out of you. Especially one song, which is particularly good, but I forget its title."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fluff rules","review":"He helped me through the hardest point of my life, drug taking soul abuse, clubbing, listening to the evil dance music and devil rock. a friend bought me a haflemop cd as they were worried about my life draining habbits...

How is it shaped? Does it curve to the left or right at all? What about girth? It is this same keen judgment that I use to evaluate this compilation CD from David Hyperhonkkpf.O what magnificent aplomb he rides the surging waves of melody! O how regal he thrusts his glistening chest out, elbows shot back! O what godawful, unholy crow-fighting-a-cat-shrieking he wails from that cavernous gullet of a mouth! Leaves wither. Clouds evaporate.

Each melodic strain is a pounding testament to the power and beauty that is David Harperchief. Songs that you would otherwise only hear at your dentist's office have been captured, stamped with Huskertank's unique trademark yowling, and released to the general populace. Whenever I hear \\"Je T'aime Means I Love You\\" being played by the marching band at my community college, it fills me with a sense of joy and wonder...The song \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare + Mozart = Davey Hayvelpuff!!","review":"He really shows his amazing talent in every way on this album. Never before were creative songwriting, beautiful melodies, instrumental improvisation, touching vocals and great musical concepts combined in such a perfect way. Though this CD is packed with tons of ideas, you never get the feeling that it's too much.Just put the CD in your player, lean back and enjoy the journey to all parts of this world and our lives. It does not get boring at all after listening to it a few times, you will discover new things every time you hear it.This achievment takes pop to a new level, i can particularly recommend the song \\"Hot Shot City\\", probably his best work, a true epic masterpiece of modern music.*Love* Davey"},{"rating":"2","title":"This music stabs me right here (points at heart)","review":"Amazing. That's what I call this life-changing, genre-bending, seat-rumbling work of art. Like a chameleon, David Hookerpimps proves his mettle as a world class thespian. He acts just like he can sing. He acts like he's actually competent at hitting any musical notes whatsoever! He engages a crowd and passes gas, making the creases in his leather pants disappear momentarily. He also takes orders of tables of 6 or more without adding a 17% gratuity.But perhaps the most compelling, most amazing thing about David Huskerbrank is his actual voice. That thing sounds like a Pontiac lurching desperately through a mob of moose. Especially on the song \\"Hot Shot City,\\" which most people will agree, is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"How heart-wrenching this can be!!","review":"I used to be a hater. I once joined the throngs of doubters who said that David Hilkenplotz couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. But that was before I played this fantastic album, \\"Looking For\\" on the CD changer in my car.What I heard next defies description. Songs so beautiful and melodic filled my car, and I was so moved that I stopped eating my hominy grits and broke down in tears. My friend Kate tried to comfort me, but I was inconsolable- David's sad songs made me cry so hard I pulled the car over and doused the flame out of my cigarillo with my tears. I had never heard \\"Looking For Freedom\\" sung with such conviction. I will never hear another version of \\"Dance Dance D'amour\\" without bawling like a schoolgirl.It's amazing that David Hassplanktonbeef can move you so easily with his tremulous voice, a voice that breaks through like 2 screaming hyenas tied to a rake.Hah Shah Citti is purtilurly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"For sure, you rock!!","review":"I cannot be saying enough how this for sure genius of the musical pursuits moves my heart.Be forgeting the old man on the beach pulling his stomach in when the girls go by, this is a different David Hasselhoff altogether, I would go as far as saying this is the greatest album ever made for sure, and that includes the smurfs, who I am adoring also.This record for sure shows that Germans have the more sensitive and deep taste in music,and for this to be shown you must listen to the greatness song \\"hot shot city\\" because for sure it rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the greatest acknowledge him","review":"Both \\"The World's Most Interesting Man\\" and Chuck Norris have this in their musical collections.

It is so spiritual, and the first time I put this record on, I was like woooooahhhhh.Man, I wanna get a mullet. That is how important David Hasselhoff is to me. He's a truly amazing man, who touched me. (I wish it was in more ways than one...) He's so dreamy.Just look at his sexy, sexy face on the album cover. How could you resist that?I heard that one time, a million houses in Dusseldorf were on fire, and in ONE HOUR Sir Hasselhoff saved everybody in every single one of those houses. No-one was even remotely hurt. I believe this story, but it's the kind of thing he'd do.I love you, David Hasselhoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough praise is heaped on our hero","review":"Stand aside and gaze upon the greatest singer our civilization has ever known: David Hastlehough. A true virtuoso and a master at the game, David reinvents the art of singing with his revolutionary \\"wail-until-you-hit-the-right-note\\" vocal style. Through this new style, he has discovered dozens of notes between B and B flat, not to mention a few illegal ones.The effect on the ear is surprising, indeed. David Hascelhawf is like a musical plumber, shoving a toilet snake down your earhole to find the clog that blocks your heartstrings. And once he's dislodged that stubborn chunk of hair from the bottleneck, your sluices fling wide open and you cry like a retard at a Baptist revival.That's the magic that he conjures up. And literally dozens of people around the world have discovered his gifts and are sharing the music to cover up the fact they live in Europe. The track \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-platinum ...","review":"I love this CD a lot! This is the best CD of all time.

I heard the blissful soothing music of this album, Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT], playing through the gym teacher's discman. I cried tears of liberty as the eyeliner washed out of my eyes. I immediately got the name of the album from my heavy-petting instructor and ultimately got my life back. Now, I'm at complete peace, and the world makes sense. Good in life is restored. Sometimes i feel the urge to listen to some hardcore heavy metal rock. David Hasselhoff has given me Hot Shot City.

A work of sheer genius. I only wish he'd been around in my day; John, Paul, George, Ringo & Dave... Now that would have been a force to reckon with.I have to say that after hearing this, I am sorely tempted to hang up my bass and get a job in a chip shop.

From beyond the grave, Mozart, Brahms, and the other so called \\"masters\\" can only shrug their shoulders and turn their heads, as they have been clearly outmatched by the genuis of this former TV lifeguard. His time on the small or big screen is clearly time wasted, given his mastery of melody, his ability to take pain, love, and many other human emotions and turn them into the exact sounds that replicate the human soul. All in all, I'm so grateful to have my two feet on the same ground as this master of all singers. This is a can't miss, must buy, and in large quantities album.Also, \\"Hot Shot City\\" is a cut above.

However if anyone can he can.His grasp of French and German is astounding, and I Believe that his romantic philosophical lyrics challenge even the words of the Romantic poets.However I am still waiting for his semi-mythical acapella version of Knight Rider vs Wurzels and (of course) his imfamous techno/Austrian Folk fusion Terminator remix of the Baywatch theme to be released an an album like this.Sigh.

Once we get that out of the way, listening to the album is much easier than expected. We dispose of any preconceptions; yes, any preconceptions that Mr Hasselhoff (or Herr Hasslehoff as his fan base in the small Bavarian town of Busstraffhoofmeiest would have it), has any talent whatsoever, is soon dispelled.
