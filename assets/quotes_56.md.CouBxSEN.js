The inmates at Gotham's repository for the criminally insane riot and take hostages, offering to release them if Batman will come and spend the day - April 1, no less - with them. Needless to say, Batman goes in, and the day turns into a hellish trip into his own psyche.The first thing you will notice about \\"Arkham Asylum\\" is that it looks different from any normal comic. The art looks like a mix of painting and photography, lending an appropriate amount of otherworldliness to an incredibly twisted story.One thing I really like about this particular edition is that the original script is included as an addendum - it's a good side companion, explaining the myriad plot points in detail and weaving all the themes together and explaining them nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Book!","review":"I thought this book was mainly going to be about the villains, but it was mainly about Batman's struggle to stay sane and come to terms with his past and present during his stay in Arkham! Even though I was a bit disappointed that the Joker wasn't featured more in this one,the few times he was featured had me laughing. His lewd comments made this a must read for me! Plus, the drawings in this book are more dark and gothic than in other Batman novels,so I had to buy it. This is definitely not a read for kids, but, if you love Batman and want to read about him making his way through the creepy, dark halls of Arkham, and also want to know about the grim history of Arkham Asylum, then you must buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunacy, Occult, Crowley, this one has it all","review":"I didn't like how the Joker was portrayed or drawn. The drawings were hard to follow in some scenes but it wasn't too bad. You would like this story if you're into crazy things. Aleister Crowley is in this. I would have liked to have seen Batman more mentally exposed in the nut house. It was a great story and the script made it better. It's a nice re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Read","review":"This is a amazing book and I definitely put it up there with the greats of batman comics like the killing joke, the dark knight returns. But I have mixed feelings on how the joker is portrayed in this book and I will admit I also have mixed feelings on the art but overall its a great book and should be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After watching The Dark Knight I was very excited and eager to read more about Batman. I have been a comic book addict ever since I can remember, but mostly I bought Marvel comics and had only occasionally read Batman. Anyway, I researched in the internet for the best / most important Batman TPBs available and Arkham Asylum was listed everywhere as one of them (in some places even among the top 5). For this reason and also because of the reviews here, I decided to buy this one. But it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The art is really bad, you often can't make out what is on the page... may be it's just a different style, but it doesn't match my taste (I'm more of Jim Lee fan kind of guy). The story itself - the writing I mean - was ok, but I wouldn't qualify it as being one of the best Batman comics - certainly not after reading Year One, The Long Halloween and The Dark Knight Returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"dont buy into the hype. The art is garbage and the story is so short. Its under a ten minute read."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to grasp due to outlandish artwork","review":"While the story holds in this book, the artwork made it hard to follow as well as to understand. It all makes sense when you read the script notes in the back of the book, but while actually reading with the art it becomes confusing and annoying. While the artwork is at times interesting, it does not match the story in the traditional sense. Random characters are thrown into panels where you can't understand what they're doing or as to why the are even there. I bought \\"The Killing Joke\\" as well as one simply entitled \\"Joker\\", they were both much better reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artwork unsuitable for a narrative","review":"As my title says, the artwork is completely unsuitable for any type of narrative, least of all a graphic novel. Don't get me wrong, even though I'm not a fan of that style I'll admit they're nice illustrations, but they it's completely impossible to follow any kind of narrative, even if it's Batman just throwing a punch you would have to look at the frames over and over again just to understand that.The story is pretty crappy aswel, the characters are really modified to fit the writers needs and it just comes out as characters with random personalities.I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply breathtaking.","review":"Words can hardly even describe the depth of this story. There is so much to say about it, but I'm assuming you haven't actually read it yet, so it doesn't matter, because you need to. The art of David McKean is simply indescribable. Mixed with the depth of insanity of the dialogue, the illistration makes this the ultimate trek into the hell that is the Dark Knight's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Simply excellent job.

Winter articulates with such ease what is so often felt and so infrequently expressed. Her personal story is one that everyone can relate to. I found the book extremely helpful to validate my personal efforts in this area.

My laptop worked well for a year and then the nightmare began. The harddrive and screen went bad. I didn't worry because I had purchased the 3 year warranty. After exhanging numerous calls and shipping my laptop back to Gateway. The lapto was returned. It worked well for 2 weeks. I called Gateway again we spent 45 min. attempting the fix the problem. This was unsuccessful. They wanted me to pay another $40 to send the computer back to them . THe service is unsatisfactory and the computer had never worked properly since the first year. Owning a Gateway Product is a nightmare and trying to keep their produts running well is a full time job. I will NEVER purchase another Gateway product. I wouldn't even accept one as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I originally bought the Spooky Kids concert DVD \\"Birth of the Antichrist,\\" and it does contain really excellent, one-of-a-kind footage of Manson performing in an intimate club setting. Knowing this, I purchased the album thinking it would play the exact same soundtrack, from beginning to end. Instead, it plays the songs of the concert in a mixed order. What's worse is that rather than having the songs smoothly move from one track to the next, each one would suddenly stop and start, which annoyed me because it made the whole of the CD very choppy and disruptive. It doesn't even play the live version of \\"Dope Hat;\\" on that track is \\"Chocolate Factory.\\" Take it from me: if you are a big Manson fan, I strongly recommend buying the DVD, not the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NBA LIVE 06 (LIKE EVERY OHTER XBOX 360 EA SPORTS GAME STINKS)","review":"This is the worst NBA Live out on any large gaming platform (PS2, XBOX, GAmecube, heck even PSP). The graphics with this game are not that much better than on regular XBOX, so if you are buying a 360 for this game please stop it. There are not many features on this game. No dunk contest, not all star weekend, nothing, nada. This game basically sucks. If you want a good basketball game for this system that doesn't sacrifice itself for marginially better graphics, get NBA 2K6. This game has great graphics, great realistic gameplay, more modes, and interesting side gimmicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live 360","review":"People have been complaining about the fact that EA Sports has removed the Dynasty Mode and All Star Weekend.For the people that do not play this game just because those modes were taken away will be disapointed.The graphics in Live are the best out of the Xbox 360 hoops games.The players look remarkably similar to their real life counterparts,sweat drips off their body's and the arena's are accurate down to the very top of the nose bleed section.I have always purchased the 2K games instead of Live,but since were now in the Xbox 360 era.I thought I would give Live a try since EA Sports started with brand new for the 360 and I am certainly glaid I did.If your willing to go into Nba Live on the 360 with an open mind you will also be glad that you didn't miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't sweat it","review":"When EA's biggest gimmick is a 30 second commercial of shaq sweating, you know you have problems. Without dynasty mode and various other features, Live stands incomplete leaving the user looking for their receipt. It's obvious that Live's transformation into the next-generation was rushed in hopes of getting the game out in time for the xbox 360 release. The gameplay is slow, there are major camera glitches (there are times when the camera completely loses sight of the game), to put it simply, the game is just boring. The one bright spot however is its graphics. Looking past the sweat, the player animations are extraordinary. Recognizing your favorite players are not a problem. In all, after playing Live 2006, you realize it actually offers less than its xbox and PS2 counterparts. If you're looking for a good basketball game, I suggest getting 2k6."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much fun","review":"I'm going to make this short. I was disappointed. The graphics are nice, but the game play is just average. NBA jam back in the early ninties is was more fun this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I defy you to listen to the title cut the Outsider on your personal cd player and not completely well up with emotion. The tune, the arranging and his hard edged yet emotional playing--it shows you that there are jazz artists out there that can give you something meaningful without pretense and over complicated line. Check out Pat Metheny's comments about him. The best artists know who's really good. Joel's work is outstanding too. Nearly all the cuts are winners. Walt's playing is influenced by Coltrane but you also hear a little of Larry Schneider's influence. The rest is Walt. May he continue to develop and move us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointing Book","review":"This book looks great when you read the cover, and even the affirmations themselves sound okay. However, the author's supporting explanations reveal very poor exegesis and awful theological conclusions as a result. I would love to give this book zero stars if that were an option. This is a very unfortunate book that I would not recommend to anyone, unless they want an example of bad theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent guide to progressive Christian thinking","review":"This is a thoughtful statement of principles that has given me insight into the beliefs of Christians in America. As a European, I have seen how American Christians are often viewed as intolerant fundamentalists. The author is rightly concerned that the religion is identified with some of its most narrow-minded practitioners and persuasively reclaims it as the faith based on Jesus' two great commandments.The book is successful on several levels: as an argument for an inclusive, compassionate church; as a guide for living a life inspired by Jesus' acts and teaching; and as an overview of liberal Christian thinking (with a definite American tinge) today. Readers (whether religious or not) will find many points for discussion and reflection. The book is written in a straightforward, conversational style and is well worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible, Thought-Provoking and Inspirational","review":"Rev. Dr. James Forbes was right on the money when he referred to the Phoenix Affirmations as a primer for the next Great Awakening. It's sad that solid theological thought such as that found in The Phoenix Affirmations has so seldom made it to the congregations and to the general public...and a joy when a ray of light, such as this book is allowed to shine through the darkness and danger of fundamentalism. In addition, the book is readable and accessible. There is no heavy handed Colorado Springs style theology or tortured readings of scripture to prove a point. Dr. Elnes eloquently lays out a Jesus-focused application...and affirmation...of the three great loves; God, neighbor and self. Who can argue with love? I'm on my third reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for an active baby","review":"We have 3 other older children and had to start all over with baby items, so we recieved this as a gift. Our son has been very alert and active since day 1 and this seat was not for him. Every bath was hard unless there was someone to hold the baby in the seat, while the other person washed. Even if he wasn't moving or kicking he still would slide down and to one side or the other until his bottom was hanging off and toes where up in the air...in other words this thing doesn't work, And he did make use of all his lung powers(he's a screamer)he didn't like this seat at anytime during the newborn stage. He is almost 7 months now and has the bath seat that sits the baby up. Those seem to be the best and most safe, we have used them with all our kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't have it all","review":"While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade. If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items. Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products. I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful. But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several Mistakes!","review":"I just purchased the book and found several mistakes. Avocados have significantly more fiber than the listing indicates according to the Calif. Avocado Council. Post(Nabisco) Shredded Wheat n' Bran is listed as having no fiber! If you are the authority on this subject I would have thought these obvious mistakes would have been caught. This is only in my first couple of times opening the book, who knows how many other mistakes are there. I will be searching for a more accurate book on nutrition information."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard to read","review":"It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages. The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do. After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more. The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister. I recommend that one over the Netzer book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Book of Food Counts","review":"Good book but last update was in 1997. Info on eating out with fast food needs updating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read all the rave reviews, and decided to purchase this book. If I had glanced through this book at a store, I would not have purchased it. It does have a lot of food counts in it, but it's very hard to read. Every food item has smaller subcategories, and sometimes I'm not sure what to look under because there are so many categories. It takes me a while to look something up. The print is so small, it's similar to looking at a dictionary. I was also expecting more restaurants. There are a few fast food places (not many), and no \\"sit down\\" dining, such as Olive Garden or Applebee's. I will be looking for a different food count book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as much info as I want might be enough for you","review":"wished it listed more information such as type of sugars(i.e. HFCS)and things like phe levels"},{"rating":"2","title":"When It Really Counts!","review":"I am amazed at the scope of this book. I could take even my most complicated recipes and construct a total, divide into serving sizes, and calculate total carbs, calories, etc. For someone on a diabetes diet - or struggling to lose weight through diet and exercise - this book is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice reference for dieters","review":"This book is as complete as it can get, with numbers for cholesterol, calories, carbs, protein and fiber. While it lists the fat content, it does not list the saturated fat levels, which is the number low-fat/low-cholesterol dieters like me really need for watching what we eat. Other than that, in this book you'll find the numbers that are necessary for eating healthy. Actually, for the first few days, you'll find yourself skimming through it, saying, \\"My goodness, there's THAT MUCH FAT in (insert fast-food item or frozen, microwavable meal here)?!?\\" Also recommended is \\"Restaurant Confidential,\\" compiled by the folks at the Center for Science in the Public Interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Resource!","review":"I have the third edition of this book and will purchase the newest one today! I've been using the third edition for years and years and it has been a wonderful tool and a real asset to loosing weight, or just knowing what is in the foods you eat everyday. If you have to watch fat....you will find that here, if you have to watch carbs., it's in the book.....cutting down on sodium or trying to increase your fiber intake (like I am)....it's all here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would like to preview before buying.","review":"I have not looked at the book, but I would like to preview some of the pages of the book \\"online\\" so that I can see if it's what I want before buying.

Does this bood address this point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some, but NOT for food weighers nor scratch cooks.","review":"I found this a very frustrating book because it gives counts for volume measures of foods, but not very often for weights of foods. If you don't want to jam your yam into a cup measure to figure out its count, but want to weigh it on a scale, forget it. No by-weight counts for many (most?) common foods, e.g., apples, flour, oranges, yams. (There was a count for a 2.8 oz. carrot! Geez; mine was 3.7 oz.--hard to estimate.) Also, if you cook from scratch and don't visit fast food palaces, you will get sick of crawling through listings for lots and lots of fast and prepared foods (which probably have current counts on their labels anyway). Measurers, ball-parkers, and fast food folks may be happy. I wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to \\"Complete\\"","review":"This book is probably fine for those who have absolutely no health risks. But for those of us who need to know sugars as well as total carbs, saturated fat as well as total fat, and soluble/insoluble fiber, it's not there. It's also really heavy on convenience foods--which have more info on their labels than you'll find in this book.

Sure, sometimes you might wish the product you're looking for was listed in a different spot, but the information you need can be found here. I was looking for a calorie counting book and was thrilled to find this one. One major flaw, however, is the lack of sugar grams. Sodium, carbs, cholesterol, calories, and fat grams, but sugar content is nowhere to be found.

The Section 20 intelligence branch in this series is the most inept ever. I don't like my action heroes to be infallible but these characters contantly make decisions and/or take actions that are irrational, irresponsible, immoral, insane or all four. Whenever something needs to be done, too few people are always sent, even if more are readily available. Then after something goes wrong, and things are always going wrong for Section 20, the heroes walk around cursing and looking puzzled and promising to get even.The only reason I am giving this a 2nd star is that I really like the plot line about weapons of mass destruction. (slight spoiler coming, although the info is in an early episode)I like the premise that some people in or affiliated with the Bush Administration were so anxious to invade Iraq that they tried to plant weapons of mass destruction there so the inspectors would find them.

It's a cross between Spartacus and Act of Valor. The action (especially weapons handling and tactics) is superb. There's still a bit of Hollywood involved, but that's why this is a television drama and not a training film.

Now I am a cable cutter entirely. I saw this on Amazon and found it interesting, bought it and it was pretty good. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did since I never heard of it before. These are good adventure stories of British secret agents solving the world's Terrorist problems, of course they have an American on the team and they are brutal with their team members, many of which do not make it thru the entire series.

Despite being well aware of the BBC's role in the show, I was surprised to learn that the actor playing Damien Scott was actually Australian. He makes a very convincing American.The action was great, the acting pretty good--the plot. . .okay. I would like to know why, considering our common Anglo heritage and our close relationship over the years, all British action shows eventually wind up poking at America, in this case the old WMDs in Iraq conspiracy theory. It had the potential to ruin the show for me, but fortunately the pace didn't let up long enough for me to think about it.It's a great show, if you're looking for a lot of hard action.

The 29db noise reduction wasn't quite enough so I use them in conjunction with 29db noise reducting foam ear plugs and that seems to work well in noisy environments. The headband is comfortable and the adjustable height is needed. The adjustment is just enough to allow me to wear a ball cap underneath the earmuffs.I have not had any issues with the seal but it does look like the coating on the foam pads would wear out quickly from heavy use.Overall these work well for the price and the muffs fold up into the headband for easy storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely any ink!","review":"Yes these are cheaper than when you buy them at the store.

This machine is a total waste. I was done with DirecTV this summer (problems with the \\"mover's advantage\\" program but the salesman convinced me to stick with them. I love the programming, but the R15 is a total waste of time and money. Just imagine trying to watch the Ohio State - Texas football game but the DVR keeps \\"skipping\\" like a scratched CD.

This is a piece of garbage, flawed from the ground up - the design of the interface and the features that actually do work is just as awful as the bugs that plague the software. Overall this DVR struck me as a prototype or a product mock-up - I am astounded that this device would actually be sold to consumers.I'm not sure what the impulse was behind the couple of favorable reviews here. I can only imagine that if this was someone's first experience with a DVR, they might be more forgiving and assume that all the problems in this unit are inherent in DVRs in general. THEY ARE NOT! This is a bad, poorly designed product. That's not an opinion. It is difficult to use where other units are simple and it doesn't work where other units do. You can't get less subjective than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"bug-ridden software","review":"The software running this unit is not up at \\"appliance\\" standard at all. The user interface locks up fairly easily (deadlocked threads?) and it fails to work as expected for situations just slightly off the straight and narrow. For example, recording a game off an MLB Extra Innings channel is likely to fail -- something about the feed to these channels being switched on and off causes the box to misbehave and delete the recorded game. (A workaround with about a 70% chance of success is to \\"stop & keep\\" the recording before the feed cuts out, then go to the list, select the game, and tell it to keep it again. You are out of luck until the end of the six hour game time slot if you want to watch TV after the game is over and the feed has already cut out -- anything you do will cause it to delete the recording.)I have purchased an R10 (TiVo-based) unit and will send the R15 one back ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"If at all possible GO WITH TIVO!","review":"I have used several DVRs with different companies over the past few years. TiVO was BY FAR the best. I signed up for DirecTV service because they had had a relationship with TiVO. Little did I know that they were making their own box now without the TiVO interface. When you stop paying for DirecTV, or if you disconnect your DVR from the satellite dish, you can no longer access your stored programs. A DirecTV representative admitted today that this was a decision that was made to benefit the company at the expense of the customer.Quite a disapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DirecTV dropped the ball","review":"I agree with the consensus. I had nothing but problems with the R15 and aside from offering to replace it, customer service doesn't seem to have any other options. I saw one R10 (the old model with Tivo) at WalMart and dropped $100 to buy it and it works like a dream.

Directv cannot offer a solution to it not recording shows.I am buying one of the older units to replace this model I got from Directv."},{"rating":"1","title":"DirecTV could do better","review":"I had many of the same problems as the first reviewer. Frequent lock-ups requiring a hard reset by climbing behind the entertainment center to unplug the unit, blips in the recording and mysterious lines from time to time, dropped audio, the list goes on.The remote is blocky and unintuitive with too many and oddly placed buttons. Punching in channel numbers requires you to look at the remote and use both hands to shift the position of it, then push the tiny buttons way down at the bottom of the remote while you continue to hold it in both hands.On the upside the R15 does have alot of functionality built into it, it's just too bad the built-in 1 & 1/2 second delay makes it all so frustrating to navigate."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ok!!","review":"This thing wasn't what I execpted.

I didn't know much about the product that I was ordering and feel that this seller took advantage of my lack of knowledge. He sent me a DirecTV TIVO HR10-250 HD-DVR Receiver, upon hooking it up, it does not record, it is slow and does not offer the HD channels we have. Upon speaking to Directv customer service they informed me that what I received is an older model that does not have good quality and the capability for HD tv.

DirecTV's service is generally pretty good as far as content and HD quality, but their customer service is so bad it almost seem as if they are intentionally trying to alienate customers. They take the concept of hidden charges to startling new heights. HD service; $10/mo. Each additional receiver; $5/mo. DVR service; $10/mo. That equipment you paid $250 for; that was just a lease! It's another $399 to buy it. Want ESPN classic? How about a $20 sports package filled with all kinds of other useless crap?

If you love Direct TV and want it to survive, demand the R15s are scrapped and replaced with fully functional DVRs.

Directv replaced the unit and I have had a brand new one for about four weeks now. The new unit is now starting to turn itself off. This time, doing a hard restart worked but the unit is obviously verging on failure. Directv said they could do a hard drive replacement over the phone but I would lose everything I had recorded.

One would think I have a defective unit, I sent this unit back to DIRECTV and they replaced it for another. Does the same thing!! I guess when the hard drive gets past 50% this is what happens.The unit doesn't record when you go back and forth on 2 channels like the TIVO did.

The unit is very slow to respond and this can sometimes cause to user to do something unintended. There are 2 usb ports on the unit that are there for decoration it would appear as they have no functionality at this time. If this was simply a receiver it would work ok, but as a DVR it leaves much to be desired.

Mine came without that tell tale black \\"bargain stripe\\" on the spine.I found one drawback to be that the photos are not identified as to location except in the back of the book. The logic behind this is that they are supposed to evoke the atmosphere of what was said in the books (which may not have been a specific place) rather than a specific location.

At first Steven sounds like a great guy surrounded by a bunch of silly people - the adoring but incompetent trainee nurse, his insipid worrywart of a wife, jolly friends who can't understand his artistic ambitions, various whiny patients, the creepily silent battered woman his wife hires as a maid. The minor characters are almost more three-dimensional than Steven himself. But as the story develops, we see that he too has a remarkably selfish side, illustrated for instance by his reluctance to answer the phone resulting in the death of a client's baby.I'm not sure what to make of the ending - I can't say I didn't see that one coming so it wasn't a deus ex machina or a gratuitious \\"twist\\" but it was certainly unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who wants more insight on Sondheim","review":"This was a beautiful book, capturing every reason why Sondheim's music is so brilliant. This series of interviews explores several of his most celebrated works, and goes into everything from music theory, to lyric phrasing, to lyric choices, to what inspired him. If you really want to know what goes on in his head while he is composing his masterpieces then buy this book! Though it concentrates heavily on musical theory and sondheim's pieces from a composer's point of view, you do not need to be an expert in music theory to appreciate this book, because it is filled with exciting tidbits of everything you would ever want to know about his pieces. You also really get to know the man behind the music, and you get to see what his original manuscripts looked like! This is an exciting read for a Sondheim fan (or someone curious about what the big fuss is over him)...you will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sondheim on Music: Minor Details and Major Decisions","review":"This book gives us a view within the process of Stephen Sondheim as a creative genius. At the same time it is encouraging because he takes us into glimpses in his creations: methods, favorites, changes, mistakes and growth that illustrate how he actualized his dreams into reality. For anyone that has ever considered writing for an audience with a level that takes into consideration all the nuances of color, texture, overt and underlying meaning, this book is a must read. It is followed with lists of suggested material for review based on the personal influence they had for Sondheim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Goods","review":"This is a great collection of transcripts of a long form interview with Stephen Sondheim.

Kevin Hays uses a Fender Rhodes on some of the tracks, creating the sort of funky mush you used to hear on albums by Eddie Harris. Other tracks are straightforward blowing in the contemporary vein, often adding a boppish sound. Recorded a year after his brilliant debut \\"The call\\", Blake seems to be looking for a new approach. Retorting to rather old-fashioned bebop and funky grooves, changing approach from one track to the other, creates an album which doesn't seem to know just what it wants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Band","review":"I so love this band.

You'll recognize all of the arrangements, and can happily sing along. A pleasant surprise is the appearance of Adele King, better known as \\"Twink\\" in her native land. She and Perry share some heartwarming duets of old Irish songs (\\"When Irish Eyes are Smiling,\\" \\"If You're Irish, Come Into the Parlour\\") and she'll charm you through an audience sing-along of traditional carols.

First of all, let me say that I have great respect and admiration for the talent that was Perry Como. However, this concert was extremely painful for me to watch. His singing voice was a whisper - and he frequently forgot lyrics and either hummed a little - or just stopped singing altogether! Embarrassing! I would only recommend buying this tape if you are a die-hard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Achievement!!!","review":"I won't bother telling the plot of this film since so many other reviewers have outlined it in great detail. I will only say there is no greater cinematic indictment of the death penalty than this devastating film. What gives it special significance, of course, is that it is based on a true case - a case that eventually led to abolition of capital punishment in Great Britain. I shutter to think of the number of innocent people executed in countries (including the so-called \\"civilized\\" United States) practicing capital punishment in order to satisfy the public's hasty and often misguided need for revenge.

The well-written reference book is structured around major events in Ms. Christie's life, but seen through the works that are published at that time. Charles Osborne keeps the tome fresh with intriguing explanations on various topics such as titles. For instance the \\"final\\" title of THEN THERE WERE NONE reflects social trends and political correctness over the decades in England and America, and to a lesser degree France. Fans of Ms. Christie will find this work quite fascinating, but so will most mystery buffs as well as historiographers.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh McNeal - Love the way you write! Goodnight a success","review":"It had me from the first paragraphs. The main character seeking and ultimately finding redemption in small town Goodnight.

I have read this and his other book, To be Sung Underwater and enjoyed both. I will definitely read others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another novel featuring disfunctional people","review":"Having taught major American writers for 30 years, I can't get excited about the present trend toward disfunctional characters. I hope it isn't a lasting sub-genre. I lived in Gordon, the largest town of the county so am familar with the locale and find the setting greatly lacking in verisimilitude, but perhaps my reaction is because my deceased mother's name is used for the town gossip, Flossie Boyles. My mother, Flossie Boyle, of Gordon was not a gossip.I shall read again Mari Sandoz for good literature about Nebraska."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of coherent character development","review":"The writing is serviceable, but the book is either poorly edited (over edited?) or it was worked on and then set aside over a great deal of time. I think the author tries and fails to make us care about a variety of characters (a la Russo-Empire Falls) all of whom lack cohesion from chapter to chapter. Some characters are developed in one chapter, then forgotten about throughout the rest of the book. Different plotlines/character grids are developed and then abruptly dropped, and the main characters seem to enjoy mulitple personalities from chapter to chapter. Again, this seems to be an attempt to mimic the stylings of Russo, but in the case of this book, it is unsuccessful. All this book served to do for me was wish for a new Richard Russo book to read, something satisfying and complete. This book, while well versed perhaps, was neither satisfying nor complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye, Goodnight; nice cover, poor writing","review":"Am I crazy? I bought this book because of the glowing reviews quoted on the cover, and because of the groovy cover (I buy wine for its label, too, alas), but I found the writing amateurish and disjointed. The author seemed to enjoy superficial, ever-changing psychological insights into his characters - these facets seemed unrelated and often pointless. That, along with obvious gimmicks (parenthetical statements, overdone/overwrought/unrelated painting of emotional nuances - witness the skinny-dipping invitation, the slimy remark in the bar, etc., etc.) made me wonder if I was missing something. Could all those critics be wrong? I kept reading and, although the writing improved somewhat toward the end, the whole book left me asking \\"Why did I read that, again?\\" Who was the main character, and what kind of person was he or she? The transformations were pointless, arbitrary, and rang false. Read Poisonwood Bible, or maybe The Stone Diaries; save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story telling that leaves you wanting more","review":"This is not a perfect book, but it is a great story. McNeal takes a risk in employing an omniscient narrator who drops us into the heads of many characters, a number of whom are here vividly and then, sadly, gone for good. It is loosely Randall Hunsacker's story but the novel skims over some thin ice midway through when Randall recedes sharply and we are not sure who or what to trust. It's a gamble to skip out on Randall at a key turning point and pick up again months later, leapfrogging over all kinds of critical \\"stuff\\". But, but, but. What makes me set aside the flaws and award this book five stars is the sheer force of the story-telling at work here, how fully and deeply I was held in the thrall of this dynamic, gripping, moving story. I grieved that it ended. You cannot go wrong giving this book to anyone with a pulse; this is the kind of book to kick-start a life-long reading habit."},{"rating":"2","title":"small-town life, dead-on","review":"This is one fine novel, and this reader hopes that it is just the first of many more to come from Tom McNeal. His eye and ear are just about perfect, and his depiction of Midwest small-town life (of which I can speak from direct experience) is dead-on. The novel is compassionate without ever lapsing into the sort of pastoral sentimentality that mars lesser fiction set in rural landscapes. McNeal manages to take a broad cast of characters and give each of them breath and personality. He's also a natural storyteller. What more could you want -- other, that is, than his next book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom McNeal Rocks as Writer.","review":"\\"Goodnight Nebraska\\" is a superb novel. I enjoyed every minute.

I was disappointed. Factual errors were my first sense that the book was missing (e.g., a group leaving Friday AM for Lincoln to attend a University of Nebraska football game presumably to be played during the traditional Friday evening slot). But facts are easy to get right, feelings are much harder to capture and unless small town life in NE has drastically changed, the characters and situations are collectively unbelievable. It's all exaggerated / concentrated and consequently distorted. You may find one or two of these characters and situations only in a generation. It takes more than a few years of someone's life to develop, capture and appreciate this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fascinating read!","review":"I had trouble putting this book down but the downbeat ending with Lewis and Dorothy was depressing. Also it seems to be that there were loose ends like with Randall's mother and sister, Lucy Witt's relationship with Randall for example. so I can see that the novel was a joining of several short stories which the back of the title page does indicate.

I prefer unabridged books, but enjoyed both Lori and CJ as narrators. I'm not even half way through the 1st tape of Seven Up, but I'm about ready to dump it like the other reviewers. I can't even rate the story because I'm not into it far enough because Tanya Eby's voice is like fingernails scratching down a chalkboard! I've actually had to cut my exercise routine short because I can't listen to that voice for more than 5 minutes. I was hoping that the book might have been re-issued with another narrator. Unfortunatley, Eby seems to have voiced both the abridged and unabridged versions of this story and it looks like I'll have to read the book and exercise to something else. Yikes!P.S.

Stephanie is in charge of finding people who don't show up for their trial hearing. This job can be a challenging, dangerous job, which can involve dealing with cunning and intellignet people. For most of the book, Stephanie is trying to hunt down a depressed eighty year old man named Eddie DeChooch. Sounds like a fairly easy job but let's throw in one more detail: not only is this man a quick thinker, he also has possession of a gun. Eddie may be old, but he can still pull a trigger. The chase continues throughout most of the book and Stephanie doubts at times she will ever find him.This boook was really funny and hilarious. I know I laughed every time I turned a page. I would rate this book somewhere between a four and a five because I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the book, hated the reader","review":"Ok, so, the book wasn't the highlight of Janet's career, but it was still very funny and I enjoyed it very much. However, I always buy the audio version too. I liked Lori Petty, LOVED Debi Mazer, but please don't let Tanya Enby narrate another Stephanie Plum book. Ruined it totally. Next time I'll check before I pre-order the audio version. If it's Enby, it's a no sale for me. I love the series. PLEASE bring back Debi Mazer. She's worth a raise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Too much reliance on humor (after all, one of Evanovich's strengths). The humor is not enough to compensate for the lack of plot and character development. Stephanie is well fleshed out, as usual, but Ranger, Morelli and Lulu are verging on caricatures. (Are we supposed to care who Steph sleeps with? Can't tell.)I also found that I really lost interest in the mystery itself. Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but overall a less-than-satisfying MYSTERY STORY."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare racy raunchy rollicking rip roarin ride!!!","review":"I don't think I have ever absolutely laughed out loud as many times as I did reading this rare tale... and, tucked under all of the hilarity is a pretty tricky plot with twists on the order of a Chubby Checker delight.The characterizations are as crisp and clear as prime Damon Runyon along with a knack for knames that is a killer...oh yea, and watch out for gramdma Mazur... she's roughly a diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"wacky, fun, and entertaining","review":"In the seventh Stephanie Plum adventure, Stephanie goes after geriatric court dodger Eddie DeChooch. Despite the fact that DeChooch is so old he can hardly see, Stephanie still can't catch him. The plot thickens when loveable stoners, Dougie and Mooner, go missing and Stephanie seems to be the only one willing to find them. As if all that wasn't enough, Stephanie's family wants her to start planing her wedding to Morelli and she isn't even sure if they are engaged!The Stephanie Plum series is wacky, fun, and entertaining and this installment is no different. The thing I love most about this series is that Stephanie is a totally incompetent bounty hunter with out being dumb and insulting to women. The characters are fun as well and Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger's love triangle is addictive. If you are looking for something to brighten your mood then I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and mystery. What a combo!","review":"Stephanie is finally showing signs of competance as a bounty-hunter in New Jersey. It's not that she's perfect. Far from the humorous escapades as she hunts an old man who carries a gun. Grandma is back! This installment in Stephanie Plum series is a keeper.

Now, with 'Seven', I didn't even read past page 50 because the author has dredged up yet another mishap at the funeral home (we've been there before), and the books seem to be veering toward comedy with a little mystery, instead of a mystery with some funny moments.

The evergrowing extented \\"family\\" is great too, I was hoping to hear more about Sally Sweet again though, maybe next time. Nobody can get in more predicaments than Steohanie, and if you are in need of a good laugh then I recommend you read this whole series. The only problem I'm having is that it took me less than a week to read the first seven books and now I have to wait a year for the next addition, bummer dude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"It was the first of the Evanovich books that I read. I can't say I enjoyed it very much. Maybe I should've started with Number 1. The main character of Stefanie struck me as more or less stupid and totally overwhelmed with her job. There was nothing funny about her personality. The book dragged until the end. I was used to better entertainment from Sue Grafton's ABC series. That was one reason I picked up Evanovich. Unfortunately the latter couldn't quite cut the mustard.I have to say, though that reading the other reviews makes me re-consider. Maybe I should've started with No. 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEVEN IS DOWN FOR ME!!!!!!!","review":"Have read all six of the previous books. First four or five were great, six was fair and seven is not for me. I know I am a minority of one. I did not even finish seven. I did not like the reference to sex that begin to appear on several pages. If Stephanie and Morelli were not in the sack,it was being suggested by nearly everone that sex is now the main theme. I read a mystery for mystery, if I wanted to read a book with sex reference though out I would buy that kind of book. I really hate I don't like it. If you do that is your business but it is not for me. Sorry Janet, but you won't miss the ones I would buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no better author than Janet Evanovich.","review":"I have read all 7 of the Stephanie Plum series twice and I highly recommend each and every one of them. For a new reader, I would start with \\"One for the Money,\\" then work you way through the series. You won't be disappointed and you'll be begging for more Stephanie Plum."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Right Stephanie Plum!!","review":"The story behind this ex-lingerie retailer turned bounty-hunter keeps getting better and better. Now, she deals with murderous FTAs (failure to appear in court folks) and the perfection of her estrange sister come home. If you don't know the series, start from the beginning, ONE FOR THE MONEY. Few authors deliver a moving story with a touch of fun: Nora Roberts, Sandra West Prowell, and a new author called Ann Mary Tempesta.Treat yourself and guard against others wanting to \\"borrow\\" your copy. You will laugh and wonder how you ran out of read so quickly. No worries---Janet Evanovich is working on the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super series by a wonderful writer...","review":"I love this series!

I also did not like the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked the Book Better Than The Audio Tape...","review":"I really liked the story behind this selection from Janet Evanovich's series with Stephanie Plum; however, I am a truck driver and I love her audio tapes until this one. I really don't care for the reader. She has no real NJ accent and I just can't get into the story. The reader grated on my hearing after the first side of the first tape. The book was different, however, and I would rate it 4 1/2 stars while the audio tape I would only give 1/2 star to. I hope MS. Evanovich continues the series, but I hope she gets back the other reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the CD this time","review":"I loved the first 6 Stephanie Plum novels on CD, but the reader of #7 is horrible. Her delivery is v-e-r-y s-l-o-w. It ruins the pace of the book. Also, she gives really strong accents (which are really bad, by the way) to everyone. Everyone EXCEPT Stephanie, the quintessintial Jersey girl. Stephanie sounds like a 50 year old midwestern matron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Outrageous!!!","review":"Janet Evanovich has such a way with writing comedy. I love her Stephanie Plum books. Its truly amazing how she can come up with all these different stories. I just love them!Stephanie continues her bounty hunting and at times is just so hilarious. You'll never believe how she get's revenge on Joyce Barnhart, her bitter rival and arch enemy.. This time the chase is after Eddie DeChooch.Along with Grandma Mazur,Morelli,Ranger,Mooner,Dougie, Bob, and a couple more people she picks up along the way, Stephanie goes for another wild ride:)This is a book that will keep you laughing so hard you'll be in stiches. I often yearn to be in her shoes. This reviewer recommends Seven Up to anyone looking for a good laugh,and I give it my highest rating:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I listened with fascination to the previous six books read by C. J. Critt. The reading on this does not measure up at all. For example, Grandma Mazur sounds like a nice sweet little old grey haired lady, not the outrageous senior citizen we have come to love. Lula has faded into almost nothing. Let's hope that when (if) there is an eighth book that we get C. J. Critt back to read it. (This review applies to the audio cassette version.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not appeal to male readers","review":"I was looking for a new mystery writer and thought I would check out Janet Evanovich. I know she certainly appeals to a lot of people and maybe my expectations were too high based on that. But I think I did not like it because it was just not written to appeal to a male reader. So, since there were no reviews that I saw that offered up a warning, I thought I would offer one. If you are a male this probably will not appeal to you. If I am wrong about this, I would like someone to correct me and perhaps offer a suggestion for another book by Janet that I might find more to my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Up by Janet Evanovich","review":"My daughter and I read this book to each other during a very boring, rainy, yard sale day.

I can't ever stop laughing when reading them. Janet Evanovich always delivers. It was fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please!","review":"I have to admit that I could not finish this book. After having struggled through two previous efforts, I thought I would give Evanovich one more chance to convince me that she had an original thought. Not to be. Her characters are caricatures - I've met them all elsewhere (and didn't like them much there either), and the Stephanie character strains all credibility. Every action and word is predictable - and predictably \\"kooky\\". She make the most obvious and stupid mistakes - over and over again. When the old man with the enlarged prostate gave her the slip twice in the first few chapters, I had had enough.Please - put this series out of its misery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up To Her Old Tricks","review":"It's hard to keep straight which of Ms. Evanovich's novels are which, and since I don't have the book at hand right now, I just have to say it's more of the hilarious interactions among Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, her mother, her grandmother, and various slippery characters with rather unpleasant traits. I found these fun to read aloud so that someone else can laugh with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed Seven Up","review":"As usual, Janet Evanovich finds ways to make Stephanie Plum interesting and entertaining at the same time. I enjoy this series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Up goes too fast!","review":"OK, so maybe it's not the best of the series, but \\"Seven Up\\" is still an entertaining read--great for the beach or vacation. My only complaint: I finished it too fast! Now I'm anxiously awaiting Stephanie's adventure number 8!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Down","review":"I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series about two years ago, and throughly enjoyed the previous six books. Unfortunately, seven is not a lucky number for the series. What I loved about the previous books was Stephanie's snappy, quirky humor, and her knack for finding herself in outrageous situations. Very few of these elements can be found in this book. Stephanie comes off as boring, the mystery is too weird, there is not enough interaction with Lula, and the whole Morelli-Stephanie-Ranger triangle is tiresome. This book reads more like a rough draft than a novel ready for publication. I hope that if there is a book eight that more time and attention is put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"7-UP, Good to the last drop!!","review":"IT WAS GREAT TO BE BACK IN NEW JOISY AGAIN WITH STEPHANIE AND HER FAMILY!!

I must say I was terribly disappointed by this one. It does pick up at the end of the book... It is almost like the Publishers or SOMEONE is Pushing Janet too hard to produce... I certianly hope they STOP NOW... This is a great writer with a great series going... Her readers look forward Excitedly to each and every new book.. I have even searched out and purchased FIRST EDITIONS of all the others... GRANDMA Mazur who in my estimation is one of her best ever charactors after, Joe , Ranger and of course Stephanie. Grandma was almost non-exsistant in this one and what she did have to offer she was blindfolded most the time... DEFINATELY TO MUCH BOB the munchy pooch...It was almost like Janet had some great ideas but had not enough time to really develop them fully.. SO WHOEVER OR WHATEVER IS PRESSURING JANET STOP.....

In this book the character Mooner is outdated and there is none of the suspense and tension of most of the first 6 books. Our dear Ms. Plum needs a change of scenery and plot. PULEEZZZ don't have her marry anyone...shades of a network sitcom. I'm hopeful S. Plum's adventures will return to form. At least with Grafton, \\"Z\\" is the end...with these, its infinity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Up","review":"The reader changes in this book. Thick accent. Too distracting for me. Sounds like someone from Housewives of New Jersey. If you like them you will probably have no problem with the reader. None of the characters sound the same so they lose their personality in the reading. I am sure there is a reason for this but...Why oh why change the reader? The only positive thing I can say is that I will know to avoid any audios read by Lorelei King. I even tried speeding up the play back so I could finish the book.

It seems the author rushed to publish. \\"Seven Up\\" is way below par. Weak plot development, under-use of the characters we've come to love, too reliant on raunch, very little of the sparkling dialog and chancy encounters we've come to expect, and no suspense. Disappointing.

It wasn't, but even that still merits four stars. It still made me laugh out loud, feel miserable and also cringe horribly (particularly towards the end)."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"If you want to read this book, wait until it comes out in paperback... I just loved this series for the first several books, but it's gone downhill, and in truth I don't know if I'll even read \\"Crazy If You Pay for Eight.\\" There is virtually no plot in Seven Up, and the tired same-old, same-old characters do little to disguise this fact. There's nothing new, including the ending, which is yet another \\"cliffhanger\\"... When the series was better, this contrivance worked, obvious and money hungry as it was. By now, however, I at least am so bored with the Stephanie-Joe-Ranger scenario that it matters not to me what they do. This series needs a major overhaul, or maybe it just needs to end. There are a few very gifted writers who can keep a series going, each book a masterpiece of depth and good, solid writing. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that Ms. E. is one of these writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this down","review":"I am an avid reader. Rarely though, do I find a mystery that can continuously hold me from beginning to end. This book does. Ms. Evanovich has written a witty, sexy mystery.

I can't wait for the next Stephanie Plum mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves a three star rating, but I just couldn't do it","review":"That's right, this book was not nearly as good as the other six. The only reason I did not give it a three star rating is because I like Stephanie Plum and Grandma Majur so much. This book did not have the humor that the others had. Even the romance was slacking. I will not tell you NOT to buy it, just don't buy it brand new. Wait for a used copy, or paperback. I was so anxious for this book, that I ordered it... about six weeks before it came out. And, I will probably do the same for #8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have not read any other of her books, but I was disappointed with this one.

ANXIOUSLY awaiting number 8 (and more)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun like her other books","review":"I found Seven Up to be too crude to be fun, especially with Beastiality comments.

The lady on the audio was less than standard. Her Joe Morelli was laughable! Ruined the whole thing. All the characters were very nasally(?) So, I bought the book and started at Chapter 4. Finished it faster than the audio. I donated it to my local library so someone else can get disappointed too. As to the rest of the story, it was OK and Janet does it to us again at the end. She made Morelli look like a jerk and Ranger does not appear until way into the middle of the book. Next time I will wait for the library version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long-Awaited Disappointment","review":"Don't get me wrong - I have been a devoted Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum fan since her first book in the series.

She bored me to death. With the original reader I could picture everyone in my mind, this one everyone is just a big blob. I really can't tell too much about the story as I said the reader bored me and so then did the story. If you have audioed before I think you should read this one and then mabye you can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"Yes, like many of your other reviewers, I have read ALL of the books in the Stephanie Plum series. I even read this author BEFORE she created Stephanie and I really enjoyed her work. I think she was sleepwalking through this one. Her descriptions of the characters and situations were what made the previous books fun to read. This one is sorely lacking. For instance, there is a scene where Stephanie and Lula end up in the pit at a mud wrestling bar. I've never been to a mud wrestling bar so it's hard for me to come up with a picture of what it's like. More vivid and colorful descriptions could have made this a memorable scene. Instead, it comes across rather flat. Also, the author assumes that the reader already knows a lot of stuff about the recurring characters without filling us in. Poor Joe Morelli! He's relegated to the back burner in favor of the dog. C'mon, Janet, you can do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something was missing","review":"I'm giving it a four on the basis of the key characters, but there was something missing this time. Maybe it was that Hot Six was so good and so funny that Seven Up had a tough act to follow. Parts of the book were extremely hilarious, and other parts seemed to be overkill. Grandma Mazur is a hoot as always, but even her behavior seemed tamer in this installment. It is adequate summer reading and should not be missed by anyone who has read her earlier Plums. I just hope the eighth plum will be a little riper than this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written like there was a contractual obligation.","review":"Obviously the stories and snafus are near identical each time, hence the Sue Grafton-like success, but this one comes off lazy and repetitive.

This is not the Stephanie we know and love. Cheating on Joe with Ranger?

It was enjoyable to read about someone who accepted responsibility for his life without spending all of his time trying to blame someone for his problems.This book has made me appreciate Kelsey Grammer for being an incredibly talented actor who has never been afraid to take risks for his career. Also, it is enjoyable to read about someone who lives life to its fullest.So Far is a quick and easy read.

He is much like his famous character, Frasier. Pompous, selfish, a braggart who truly finds himself a gift to all. He spends most of the book gloating of himself and skims over the top of all the things that humanize him.The horrible loss of his sister, his grandparents, his life with his mother and father. If he had elaborated on his life stories rather than his celebrity ones, this book would've been brilliant.I think the key to enjoying Kelsey Grammer is to never read one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative and enjoyable","review":"My comments pertain to the audio tape version of this book, which I highly recommend. I think Kelsey Grammer's reading helped to paint a better picture than the print version would; hearing his voice added to the character of the stories he told.Not being a hardcore fan of Frasier or Cheers, I knew very little about Kelsey Grammer, other than that I liked him in those shows. I happened to see the book on tape and thought I'd give it a try. I was not surprised to learn that Mr. Grammer is as introspective and articulate as his popular television persona. It was fun to come along for the ride as he described his early years, and thought-provoking to hear him describe how the tragedies and other events in his life had shaped him as a human being.All in all, I found the audio version of this autobiography to be compelling and quite worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep \\"Frasier\\" not \\"Kelsey\\" Image","review":"One of the important times in my day is watch ing \\"Frasier\\" with family. A character which reflects how we long to behave like kids, how we yearn for fame and name and how stupid we are in missing the simple pleasures of our life. However, \\"So Far..\\" doesn't offer you any insight on any aspect except telling more about the personal life of Kelysey Grammer. The wit, satire, the timing you see on \\"Frasier\\" is totally missing in \\"So Far..\\".

It still auto-extends fully, and both lights and sounds work.

The product also moisturizes/invigorates your hair strands and if you use the shampoo and conditioner along with the olive oil and hair mayonaise lotion, it prevents breakage and creates stronger, more managable, and soft healthy looking hair. The perm is not thick like a majority of other African American perms are and is mostly water based so you know you are getting a perm where the chemicals are not bad or harsh. It's extremely healthy and you just have to love this product!Ps.

When he gets to the recitation part where he says, \\"Yes, darling, I'm so hurt, because I still love you so.\\", you can tell that he really means it.

The band sounds like your typical early 80's AOR. They sound more like Lover Boy than Motley Crue or Def Leppard. Also, some of the music (especially the synthesizers) sounds cheap and fake, like it was the soundtrack to a low budget 80's teen beach movie. You know what I'm talking about.

While Autograph give props to \\"THE MIGHTY VAN HALEN\\" on their dorky back jacket cover, it's actually the influence of the mightier DEF LEPPARD who fattened Autograph's bankroll for about a year in the mid 1980's.

I felt as if the author erred tremendously when she placed homosexuality along side those conditions; as if it was something pathological. Such inferences are wrong and perpetuate ill will toward gays and lesbians in our society. Sexuality is a gift, a blessing, to be embraced and celebrated accordingly. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being gay (just like there is nothing wrong with being straight).

It's written in a hip, quickspeak, that is too oblique to grab you. It's like reading Derek Taylor's memoir of his time with the Beatles, where he tries so hard to sound hip-literary, he completely buries what he's writing about. Oldham was intimate with the Stones. He's a witty guy in interviews. This is a fat book, but very little in it that's intereting. After I bought it, I read it once, skimming a lot of it, and donated it to the library. It does obliquely confirm that he and Jagger had a gay affair. In the bio JAGGER UNAUTHORIZED, that author makes the claim that Oldham and Jagger slept together. In Stoned, Oldham says, \\"Me and Mick got as close as two men can possibly get,\\" which to me confirmed the rumor. And Oldham set Keith up with his girl friend, as Oldham thought, \\"Keith should go out with something other than his guitar.\\" That's about all of interest about the Stones in this book.

This one here I'm reviewing (the 3 disc uncut version in the fold out digipak) is awesome. It is exactly what was shown at Cannes, not the cropped version that premiered at the New York Film Festival. You have to appreciate good drama, and have a bit of interest in history to fully appreciate this film. If you're expecting a fast paced action blockbuster, you'll be disappointed.

If it gets it wrong, it will ask 5 more questions. If it still gets it wrong, you win.MY OPINION: Very entertaining. About 85% of the time, it gets it right. One time, however, I was thinking of a baby, and the first guess was a fairy, and the second guess was Spiderman (wtf). But, it usually gets it right.OVERALL: The AI knows almost everything.

The thing I didn't appreciate about it is that it was delivered to her house 2 weeks before her birthday and to my dismay I found out that she was well aware of what it was because it had pictures of the item on the outside of the box. I would love to be advised as to the packaging of products on this site so I can avoid an early surprise in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I received the chair and put it together but the attachment for the steps are plastic.

Luckily I had the proper sizes in my tool kit. The seat is put together, but after 4 hours I have put it aside and will tackle the steps at another time. I wish that I had gone out and purchased one that was already assembled. I am out of the money, and I still do not have a kitchen stool! It's too heavy to think about returning, and like most people, I had to totally tear up the packaging to get it out of the box. It can't be returned. So, there it sits, over in the corner! I ran out of screws that would fit the holes but I have the ones that came with the stool. Maybe I will find a use for them You will get 4 screws and 12 bolts.Have your 16 screws ready before you begin. Save the 24 bolts for another job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is definitely NOT the chair you may remember. I just returned mine and I return VERY few items.

My 14 year old son is barely comfortable on it. I had two knee replacement surgeries in the past year and 5 other ones for infections in the replacement and thought it would be perfect to sit on while cooking or baking. It is HORRIBLE. It is like a miniature version of the one my mom had in her kitchen when I was growing up. Save your money. And don't get me started on the annoying assembly. Also, the steps are a joke. You can't use it as a \\"step stool\\" unless you have size 5 feet. I have size 10. So NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the older model of this chair","review":"I ordered this chair for my son because I had so many great memories growing up and using this chair.The quality is not what it used to be. The step is not sturdy like my parents' model. The chair overall doesn't seem sturdy and stable like the older models.For the price of this chair, I expected more. However, since there aren't any other options out there, this newer-less-than-desirable model is our only choice if we want a chair with steps for little kids to be able to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk pretending to be something of quality","review":"My wife asked me to assemble this chair and it did look good on the surface BUT the lack of any solid base (you have to bolt the seat to very fragile plastic end-post), the mis-aligned bolt fittings; making you force parts together and combined with some plainly stupid open-bolt attachments (that won't attach firmly) make this chair a total piece of junk, in my opinion. They also have the nerve to charge you $20 to return this mess which will make me extremely hesitant to buy anything from Amazon from now on. I think Amazon's quality control to protect customers from just this kind of obvious deception needs a serious revamping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order this!","review":"I was really excited to receive this chair because it was so cute in the picture.

It looks charming, but essential parts that need to be strong are made of plastic and insubstantially thin steel. Even though we thought we would at least put it together and use it for a less demanding purpose than originally intended, that was not possible. Parts did not align properly to bolt together, and without nuts to secure bolts in place, those parts that did align together were sure to come apart after short moderate use. It's sad that an old, reliable name like Cosco for home consumer goods is still being used on shoddy products like this. We returned the product and will listen more carefully to negative user reviews in the future. In short -- it's cute but useless junk. It gets one star only because we had to give it some kind of rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Cosco Retro Chair/Step Stool from Amazon","review":"I am very pleased with my new Retro Step Chair. It is really solidly made and easy to put together and the instructions were simple to follow. Came as a flat pack from USA to UK within a week.It is exactly what I needed to get up to the high cupboards in my kitchen, the steps pull out easily and are very stable. If the whole thing was a little taller it would be even more perfect but I think my breakfast bar is a little higher than most.I had been worried that the steps were on a slider rather then the metal arms that my Mum's had but once you get used to them they are fine & I think they wobble less than the vintage ones.Perhaps the only design fault is that if you lift the chair up by the back rest the steps slide out the front as it tips but that only happens to my husband who uses one hand to pick it up, I use two hands so don't have the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"Bought this for my toddler because she wanted to sit at the counter with mom and dad instead of her high chair. My biggest complaint is the steps do not stay in place when they are pulled out. Every time my daughter sits in the chair, she ends up kicking the steps back under the chair, and then she can't get down easily (or I'm constantly pulling he steps back out). Also, the material on the back is thin and not durable. We bought this in the fall and already have 3 little holes in it. Otherwise, the color is nice and assembly was not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Remember These","review":"This stool was almost like the one my mother had when I was growing up.This was easy to assemble and my wife has gotten several compliments onit, also.

This is the first piece that defeated me to the point of anger and readiness to completely disassemble and ship back to amazon. The screws thread way too easily, the plastic runner for the step stool is cheap and counter-productive to the overall design, and to top it all, one of the metal screw holes still had metal inside. When I almost had the piece completely assembled I noticed the chair wouldn't sit level. After too many hours sweating and cursing, then getting my husband involved and he sweating and cursing, we realized that it's just not worth our time for this chair. I'd love it to work, but now I know why the vintage ones sell for $70+ on ebay. I intend to go find one now and bid on it asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Not well made.

It is really small. It is countertop height, but really small. It is not sturdy enough to use as a step stool. It is however just the right size for my 5 year old granddaughter to sit at the table.

She even decided to leave her throne and her kingdom for this one single man she really doesn't know much about. This is all tied together with a Disneyland war is bad theme. Not what I was expecting to watch. If anything it just shows why women shouldn't be in positions of power because they are lead by their emotions over logic. Hard to say the truth but that's really the only message this movie tells. The princess is more interested in her love life than protecting the Kingdom and her people. If I were alive back than I'd move out her kingdom A.S.A.P. before we get conquered.

Most of the time the ones I see are in a plastic sleeve, but this one had the dvd cover and it was sealed, and had the security sticker on the top like most real dvds. But what made me know it was a bootleg is the front cover. Very cheaply done, its just a cut out of Donnie Yen placed in an action scene background. The the word warrior was suppose to be plural but it wasn't. The movie itself had some pixelation and the subtitles I got to give it to them, fairly well done, I've seen worst. I can't believe I purchased it. You never pay twelve bucks for a single dvd bootleg, no matter how high quality it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This movie is the exact reason I've stopped watching most everything out of Hollywood. This movie makes all of the so called \\"blockbusters\\" or \\"epics\\" look like high school class projects made by slackers and stoners. If you've never seen Hong Kong cinema, or think that all Chinese movies are just Kung Fu flicks with bad dubbing, you are in for an amazing surprise. This is better than Crouching Tiger, House of Flying Daggers, or even Hero. Watch this movie, then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing \\"caves\\"..seriously?","review":"WOW! What a HUGE disappointment. I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my husband who is a caver and this movie was NOTHING about AMAZING CAVES! It was more suitable for my five year old son than my husband and it was quite possibly the biggest waste of time and money. We actually could not even make it through the movie and turned it off!

If they would have shown more \\"AMAZING\\" caves then it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No or little cave scenery","review":"This video was a disappointment. I purchased the video to see beautiful cave scenery, not someone hanging off the side of a mountain. The focus should have been on the caves and the scenery within, NOT on the people making the video. The title was very misleading, plus one disk, you have to play on a computer which I did not know at time of purchase. I though I was buying a DVD video with two disk (must check product description closely). Wish I could return it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, if flawed, book","review":"As someone who has enjoyed the work of Philip K Dick for a third of my life, I naturally appreciated the opportunity to read this book as it gives insight into the gestation of some of his key ideas, especially near the end of the book where references to the early christians abound. To those interested, I would suggest that the ending of this book be read while keeping in mind the end of his later novel The Simulacra or any of the others which abound in little creatures. That being said, this book would probably be less interesting to someone who is not so familiar with Dick's work. Even so, I did enjoy this book on it's own merits. The characters are easy to empathize with, and the minimalism of the setting/action is handled fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"pity me, .....i've seen this film....arrrrggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!","review":"Worst.Film.Ever.How this ever got made has got to be the more interesting story.

Ben Daniels is a good actor and he should not have taken this role. I can not recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, Flawless Mirage","review":"We hunger for Simoom: that object of intoxicating, addictive, ultimately deadly passion. Simoom, also a Saharan wind, comes from an Arabic word for \\"poisonous drug\\". But a poison is only dangerous if consumed, and Balzac's caution for lovers is to deny the overpowering need to consume--or possess. Yet perhaps passion is inevitably consuming...This is a lyrical, stunningly well made production of a tale that should have been impossible to film, and lingers in memory as a shimmering mirage. Its attention to detail, even the tack, weapons and tactics of Napoleonic and Mameluke cavalry, its loving caress of the harsh desert landscape itself, its evocation of oppressive sun, heat, thirst, hunger and desperation, all permit the magical human-djinn-leopard relationship to evolve so naturally: heartbreakingly real yet seductively veiled in entrancing ambiguity. \\"Passion\\" is a flawless jewel that may have been lost in the sands but once found, will haunt you for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis","review":"I love accidently finding a great movie that for whatever reason fell between the cracks, and vanished into the dusty shelves of the video store. Upon watching this flick be prepared for striking cinematography of stunning landscape (an Oasis in every sense of the word), great acting, unique story, beautiful actors, and almost perfect dialouge. Daniels is fantastic as he and his partner move through a common cycle of relationship. I really do wish this masterpiece becomes availible on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound Natural Love of Animals","review":"Any person with a profound, natural love of animals cannot help but appreciate this film. Passion in the Desert is evocative of the comfort that animals bring to humans, and emphasizes how we would be unable to live without them. Balzac's intention in his novella is poignantly interpreted in this visually rich and vibrant Indie film. There are moments when the viewer wishes he could reach out and touch the Leopard and feel her purr. A must for lovers of Honore de Balzac, as well as, lovers of animals. The final cinematic note, though, represents the inextricable truth--that wild beasts can never be tamed, nor, our respect for their wild natures ever be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a decent buy","review":"I was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. However, I think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. It comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. Very clean presentation when you open it up. The white gold really shines. The free shipping was FAST...and I do mean quick. I ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day.

One of my lobes had a pierced hole too small, although I have no problem wearing other earrings and studs.

When my 6 year old son and I played, it took us both atleast 10 turns before either of us knocked down any of the targets. (and we're not dummies either). The launcher is difficult to aim, and since there is only 1 launcher, and the batmans have to be placed on the launcher in a specific direction it is time consuming to load in between each attempt to launch. We were both frustrated every time we played as there is no positive feedback for the child unless they are patient enough to try and try again before they finally succeed in knocking down a target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for little kids","review":"This game does take some practice and patience. My son, 9, loved the game and started using sound effects and wanted to play it over and over again.

These postures will transform you, physically and psychologically -- they are very powerful and I can't recommend them enough.Not only did I get into better shape, but it also gave me a sense of calm and peace and it completely healed my tendency to occasionally compulsively overeat. In all the years since, I have never eaten to fill an emotional void. I have recommended Yoga to many people and don't understand why people with weight issues don't commit to Yoga. It is very powerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"This is the second time I've bought this book. First I bought it for myself and fell in love with it. Bikram is crazy, yes, but the book is so freaking helpful for explaining how to do the poses the way you're *supposed* to do them. Why even bother with miserable hot yoga unless you're going to do it exactly right and get all the benefits from it? I want to do exactly what Bikram prescribes and this book is SUPER HELPFUL for learning exactly the right way to do the poses. Plus, it's nice to see photos of people who aren't 100 pound noodles doing the poses. I ended up giving the book to my best friend when she got excited about bikram yoga. Now I have bought the book for myself a second time. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty yet simple guide book","review":"This book is easy to follow with plenty of photos and a witty intro to each of the 26 sequential poses.It is useful for those doing the Bikram course, but not a replacement unless you had a lot of experience in Bikram's hatha poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I read this book as soon as it came and it inspired me to do Bikram yoga. Now I am hooked and look forward to going 3-4 times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent understanding of Bikram's","review":"If you are a fan of Bikram's yoga, this is a great companion to the practice. If, however, you are new to yoga, or have never taken a Bikram class, the sequence of the postures may be hard to follow. For those new to yoga, the Bikram method may prove to be strenuous and frustrating, especially with the room being heated to 100 degrees. My recommendation would be to take a few beginning yoga classes to develop sound knowledge of basic poses before engaging in this method. If you have a yoga practice but are new to Bikram, it may be difficult to remember the sequence of postures without jotting a few notes and bringing them with you as you practice. But all in all, it's a good resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every dosha","review":"Bikram does not take into consideration that doing strenuous exercise in 102 Fahrenheit for 90 mins is going to send a Vata/Pitta body type into straight rage. Before I started doing some research on this, I would be simply baffled by the fact that instead of feeling balanced and calm and composed (all the things that my 6 years of Iyengar practice leaves me with), a Saturday morning Bikram class would send me on a 'killing spree' and road rage and just absolutely unacceptable behaviour toward husband and people in general. Then I find out that it totally aggravates Vata/Pitta, so now I'm all set with it. Never again Bikram. Also, it amazes me how much verbal abuse people can take from a guy who's ego could do with a little toning down, maybe just a little... He might benefit from reading the Sutras every now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it in conjunction with Bikram Yoga classes","review":"This book has been extremely helpful to me in learning the accurate 26 poses of Bikram Yoga, and what I'm trying to achieve while doing them. It gives me background information about what to expect, the benefits, the ideals and reality. In conjunction with taking Bikram Yoga classes, it is the perfect companion, and definately recommended! Written in conversational style, it is very easy to read, inspiring, motivational, and infused with Bikram's own sense of quirky humour. I would strongly recommend it for the student of Bikram Yoga, but not necessarily as a stand alone item, as I can see a beginner of Yoga not understanding the principles or correct methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good companion.","review":"The book is actually a bit different from the actual practice, but nevertheless a great companion to it, especially if you are just beginning with Bikram. Even if you can't (like myself) follow all the asanas you will notice that the regular practice of Bikram Yoga lets you feeling great!You have to try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boastful and arrogant book","review":"Buy something else by someone else.

I saw many reviewers found his abuse and arrogance as humor, and in a way I guess a guru in Beverly Hills would have to be abusive and sarcastic to get spoiled, rich people to do some work, and as most gurus he says his way is the \\"only way\\". But if you need abuse with your yoga, you just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Bikram student should have this book","review":"This book is an excellent reference for Bikram Yoga students. Much of the text appears to have been transcribed directly from Bikram's classes, so there is quite a lot of fun banter between him and his students. There is also detailed instruction and photographs of each pose, so you can get a clear idea of how each asana is supposed to look when done properly.The studio instructors sometimes go very quickly through the poses and dialog, so this book offers a good opportunity for you to fully understand the entire sequence of 26 poses and answer any questions you might have about how to properly perform the asanas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven Is Gentle","review":"I love her sweet books.

The reason I rated her with only 4 stars is that you cannot stand her up without the ballet stand & her front removable ballet slippers do not stay on.

The plastic-coated loop wire was thicker than the devices I had had before, so that was a plus. Having a loop was better than having cell phone accessories pulled off of your ear when caught on something. (I don't want to wear a wire under my shirt. I like the convenience of taking it off and putting it on at will.) I was happy with it for a while, and then, after about a couple of months, it stopped working. I suspect the loop got a short in it; no matter how hard I tried to wiggle it around, I couldn't get it to working again. Also, the device case, even though lightweight, is made of cheap plastic.

It was focused on the strange and deepening relationship between the two main characters. This movie was rather long but you never noticed how long until it was over, I don't feel as though it dragged on at all. It really kept you hooked up to the last minute. It was a very beautifully and wonderfully made movie. I was very impressed to learn that it was an independent movie because it was done so well. The story was great the way it was told and I absolutely loved this movie. It really does change your perspective on people and you realize that someone may be mean or different but it may be for a reason--you have no idea what happens in other people's lives and this movie really makes you see that.

I really liked that this product was in pill form, it was much nicer than the actual vinegar which I couldn't bring myself to swallow.

BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"After collecting Ms. Franklin's work of 43 years, this is, without a doubt, the worst thing she has ever done. It's an absolute mess. That clarion voice of the church has disappeared. If I didn't know that SYLVESTER was already dead, I would have sworn that this CD was by him. Ms. Franklin needs to retire and rest on her considerable laurels.She has an amazing array of recorded material to her benefit! Yes, I'm still a great admirer of her work. However, this latest release is simply not up to her usual standard. PLEASE listen to anything else by her---but, just NOT THIS!!!It's so terrible, that I recall Ethel Merman, who also had a big, strong voice, who became a joke in her later years.I can only hope that this same fate doesn't befall Ms. Franklin.She has always been one the greatest voices ever recorded. \\"So Damn Happy\\", however, is a horrible tribute to this great woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this album and I'm NOT TOO DAMN HAPPY","review":"I know that Aretha is the Queen of Soul (we're constantly told that by certain media pundits) but this album is not a testament to royal talent.Aretha sounds tired in some spots and under-inspired in others. Her voice is still appealing--tho it has deepened and rusted abit with age. Her style remains as catchy and addictive as ever with the whoops and \\"souls\\".Still, the songs are nothing special and the album is not a watermark album at all. And the professional critics have been less than impressed.Question: A TRUE DIVA and one who doesn't consider herself royalty?

I would have decided to make an analogue CD copy if it was what I was expecting. Unfortunately it disappointed me greatly, why is it that once great and legendary artists seem to feel that adding some \\"IN\\" producers and names onto a production will rush it to success? Where is the fantastic arrangements, the power and emotion of her awesome voice. To me they could have rolled any number of todays anodyne vocalists onto the project and printed it out with Aretha's name.Enough said, Avoid"},{"rating":"2","title":"so damn good!","review":"Okay - have the people who gave this album 1 or 2 starts truly listen to the album?First off, the music and production of this album is, how can I describe it, \\"I've heard this before\\". So what? This woman has an AMAZING VOICE - even after 43 years of singing, the woman still has the groove, and such a sexy voice. All the songs are stellar, wonderfully sung, and have a meaning.I really don't have a favorite song, all the songs are unique in each way. If you are tryin' to hear some of Ms. Franklin's ol' stuff - you'll hear some influences, but most of the songs are 'modern'. Nonetheless, a wonderful early Christmas present! Thank you Aretha!So, ignore the bad reviews and buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, So, Damn Happy","review":"Aretha delivers on this new works. It worth every dime, and probably one of her best works. Every song is a gem. I absolutely love this cd. If you don't have this in your collection, you don't know what you are missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will remember the way it used to be","review":"I have loved Aretha Franklin since the sixties, and have purchased anything she put out. She had some clunkers, but that voice could somehow transcend weak songs and production, but this cd and the Rose I parted with. No one can take away her greatness, and her place in music history. And if I was to be stranded on a desert island, I would grab my Aretha box set first. Some voices are fragile, a gift from the angels, and when it goes it goes. Some voices improve with time, deepen, thicken, have a life-worn texture. Now is the time for Aretha to know her vocal limitations and give us some music with depth. Take a page out of the Betty Lavette songbook. Stop trying to be current, and give us some soul. You want some great Aretha, get Rare and Unreleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!","review":"The Queen of Soul does it once again!

Blige-penned track \\"Holdin' On\\" are the real stand-outs. \\"So Damn Happy\\" definitely has a more adult-contemporary feel than Aretha's last release, \\"A Rose is Still a Rose,\\" but the Queen's strength is her ability to work in any genre she damn well pleases. Her fans should definitely check this album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!! Aretha IS the Queen of Soul","review":"Aretha is timeless. She breathes pure soul. She has an unforgettable voice and as a 30 something year old fan from the UK I say 'nuf respect'. If you haven't bought this CD, go out and buy it now. Since buying it, I have listened to the songs almost daily, especially on my way to and from work whilst on the tubes and trains. Can't wait for her next album and I need to make sure I have everyone of her previous one's too. Luv u Areatha. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"So darned beautiful","review":"The mixed reactions this album has gotten truly mystify me. It's a beautiful work of art--lovely start to finish with Aretha cushioned on a cloud of great instrumentation and brilliant background vocals. Yes, she sounds different, but that's because she keeps evolving as an artist and never makes an attempt to imitate herself--the trap almost every singer eventually falls into. This is Aretha Now and Aretha Now, her fourth Atlantic album, was Aretha Then now. (Gee, I just had fun with that). This is a relaxing album, a gentle ride of fun, romance, spirit and faith. And it proves yet again (as if it needs to be proved) there is no one like Aretha Franklin and no one is better at being Aretha Franklin."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time for Aretha to leave the teen life behind","review":"I don't know what I expected but not this. Aretha Franklin has always, since I heard 'Won't be long' been my favorite singer.So I want to tell her. Aretha, you are 61 years old. You can use your brains and knowledge now and not the power of youth. Stay away from Mary Blige and Jimmy Jam and anyone else who tries to make you a hip hop star. You are a mature woman. No more best sellers for you. Try to leave something to be proud of. If not, remember the wonderful opera singer, Beverly Sills who retired at 50 at the top of her game. Really, it is unbecoming for a woman of 61 to moon about being left waiting again, and wanting to be kissed etc. Aretha, do not put out another dull, ordinary, string filled, syrupy recording like this. Next time, Sing some old songs. Just your voice and a piano. Be Brave."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty average to me","review":"I'm a big Aretha Franklin but it's been longer than I care to remember since She made a Album all the way through that I could Groove to&feel Her at Her.Her last album back in 98 with \\"A Rose is Still a Rose\\" was pretty Good in a Modern sense.but on this Set She takes a Drastic U-Turn&this Album is too Formula driven for it's own Good to me.avoid the Mary J.Bliege stop it don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Queen is... Well, she ain't what she used to be","review":"This album is very unimpressive. Comparatively, her previous album (\\"A Rose...\\") is a masterpiece compared to this. The 10 songs are not memorable, just average R&B; and pop, with a religious song (\\"Good News\\") thrown in. It's almost as bad as the carwreck that was Whitney Houston's \\"...Just Whitney\\".The song \\"Ain't No Way\\" is not a self-cover of her classic Atlantic recording, it's a new song by Gordon Chambers (\\"That ain't no way to treat a lady\\"); seems like they could have given it a different title. \\\\Giving this album one star is an exageration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but yikes","review":"She used an older picture of herself for this cd... she must definitely not like the way she looks now... I think she looks better now than 10+ years ago. Lyrics are sweet and sorrowful but the singing is lacking and has much less flavor from her early days.

With her talent she should have tried much harder"},{"rating":"2","title":"In case you dont know how bad he is....","review":"The second Criss Cross album from the talent deserving the widest recegniton--bobby broom, is proof that he is the baddest and most low-hyped jazz guitarist in the world.

Don looks totally bored and sleep walks through his performance. He can barely hit any of the high notes. George starts off missing a bunch of notes on the first few songs. I guess he didn't warm up or maybe he's taken too many steroids to play properly. He doesn't even look at anybody during his whole performance. And what is up with the shiny pants? There's hardly any interaction between band members. Jeff and Mick are the only two that entertain the mostly bored audience. If I were at that concert, I'd asked for me money back. The video and audio quality are ok but it's nothing to write home about. Save your money unless you really have to have it. I'd give it less than a star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Perfomance","review":"When buying a live DVD, I like to get a performance! That is exactly what this DVD does not have.Don and George give a very lackluster performance, and Jeff Pilson's energy is not enough to save the show. It's a very bare-bones show: minimal lights, the stage is almost always just dark. There is no cinematographic creativity. This could have been produced for a breakfast show on a community TV channel. In Brazil.I love love love Dokken, and George is one of my major influences as a guitarist, but this DVD is really below par.Unless you're a rabid fan who wants to make sure your collection is complete, avoid this DVD. The audience looked more bored than I was. It took me three months to watch the whole thing - I just couldn't do it in one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dokken Live-Disappointing","review":"This concert dvd is lacking in quality and intensity. The picture quality is poor,while the the audio is pretty good. At first I was disappointed that they didn't show George Lynch playing very much, but I can understand it now because the guy is just not into it. He doesn't look up from his guitar once in the concert. This dvd is just for diehard Dokken fans only-maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD- Dont listen to the naysayers","review":"Ok, the dvd isnt perfect, (like live from the sun is), but it is what it is, live concert footage, not some pre packaged mtv crap. I know that i did hear some amp hummmm type noise during one of the ballads, alone again? not sure, but the video and audio quality is very good. the people who are bashing it must have gotten defective copies, because it sounded and looked great running thru my sony flat screen and home stereo setup. If you are a Dokken fan, this dvd is a must have, george lynch was awesome, played his green serpent guitar for most of the show but used 3 others on various songs, he simply went nuts on mr. scary.

Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This should have been a great DVD. The original lineup, a screaming sold out crowd in Japan. Too bad. Nobody must have told Don Dokken that they were making a video that night. This is a totally uninspiring performance by an overweight and seemingly stoned Don Dokken. I saw no attempt to make this a memorable show. Quite the contrary actually. The rest of the band seems fine however you are hardpressed to tell. The sound quality and video clarity are equally horrible. I am shocked that they actually released this pile of crap. Only the most hardcore Dokken fan should even consider this DVD. The best part of this DVD is the bonus song from the \\"Live from the Sun\\" DVD. This track has awsome sound and video, a complete contrast tothe Japan show. Like I said at the top, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll tell you why","review":"I would have given this 4 stars if it weren't for the lousy video and terrible audio....... George can't seem to play as fast as he used to but he is still an excellent guitar player. Don is having a little trouble hitting the higher notes but it's not enough to hurt the songs. I'm actually surprised Dokken released a DVD of this horrible quality. He should fire the sound engineer on this one.

Brandes addresses all of the fundamental questions clearly and concisely. Bond math can be daunting, but while the author includes a few equations for illustrative purposes, he clearly addresses his book to the general run of individual investors. The book, which has moments of surprising good humor, says right off the bat that bond investing can be dull in comparison to stock investing, not because the stakes are lower, but because the elements of personality and surprise are considerably more muted in the debt market than in the equity markets. We highly recommend this book, even though it is pedantic at times - a risk you take when you venture into the complex realm of bond investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bare Essentials on the Naked Guide","review":"This is definitely a serious investment book, but written with a sense of humor. I was surprised how comprehensive it is, especially since it is only 240 pages. It's certainly smaller than most other investment books around. But I guess that's the point of making it \\"stripped down.\\" As advertised, it eliminates all the financial jargon that you see in textbooks and is writtenso that you don't feel lost halfway through any of the chapters. I also like that the author takes a practical approach, explaining exactly how to invest after you've learned the basics.

However, on page 119, isn't that an error where when calculating the TEY for the Treasury bond they divide by 1-(federal + state/local) tax rate? Shouldn't that just be 1-(state/local) tax rate since Treasuries are not exempt from federal tax? It looks like they made a cut and past error, pasting in the denominator from the muni TEY calculation of the same page.

The typography was easy to read, and is essentially a photographic facsimile of an earlier copy from 80 or 90 years ago. A photographic facsimile means they used real cameras with lenses to duplicate the images. I doubt any OCR (optical character resolution) was used in preparing this work.Now, if you haven't already studied both German and Latin, I assure you, you are definitely going to have difficulties reading this, but since I am a native English speaker who has already put in several years of my life studying these languages, it didn't present me any difficulties at all.

The product lasts for weeks and promotes deer habit as they will continue to check on the stump. This is not a good idea if you do not want deer activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"a modern failure in medieval settings","review":"Ms Rowland's Black Lotus fails to summon up any the atmosphere you would expect in this context. It is not sufficient to add \\"-san\\" to names or replace \\"gun\\" by \\"katana\\" to transform a modern day novel into investigation in medieval Japan. The relationships between people are all wrong; characters are too simple, archetypal, the plot is feeble and from page 50 everything is already clear. The are several historical inconsistencies, such as the use of kerosene to start a fire...a good idea but poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"This book starts off as a mystery but ends up like a thriller. It was very well written and I think the author could write an eight or nine hundred page epic novel without writing one boring page.The only weak side of the novel was its historical setting.I did not find it convincing and I would like her to write a book set in modern times. I look forward to reading more of her books no matter what era they are set in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gender roles and \\"time feeling\\"","review":"I must agree with several of the earlier (male) reviewers. To me, the gender roles in this book fit perfectly in American suburbia of the fifties and sixties, not in 17th century Japan. The behavior of Sano's wife is unrealistic and ridiculous for the time period in question.In general, the book doesn't feel very \\"Japanese\\" at all. Change Sano's horse for a car, the samurais' swords for guns and the tatami mats for wall to wall carpeting and you'll have an off the shelf modern mystery.Some reviewers claim that Rowland's other books are better, and I'll give her books one more try before I give up on them. After all, there aren't that many authors out there for a \\"japanophile\\" like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"pseudo samurai tales","review":"i must admit that i often failed not to judge a book by its cover and this is one of the many times. after all the bookcover makes the first all important impression on the impressionable.however. i am not incline to recommand this title if what you are looking for are believable japanese characters or situation. as only a mystery it is fine.i am an avid holmes reader having read and re-read the complete stories many times. i am pretty much into whodunit novels, films, and even tv. also, i'm keen japanese/samurai culture \\"student\\".although i cannot say i fully appreciate cross-pollination of the detective genre and the japanese samurai genre i can say i'm somewhat disappointed. i expected more authenticity. more nitty and more gritty of things japanese of that time. which is to say i am not only interesting in whodunit and why and how but more interested in 17th century japan, and how this setting is used to stage this detective story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The weakest of the series I've read so far, but still solid.","review":"\\"Black Lotus\\" is another one of the wife and husband super duo mystery novels by Laura Joh Rowland. Unlike the first two this one brings a lot more questionable material to within its pages. There are a lot of riscae, and even perverted parts of the book that the reader may wish they had been more prepared for.If you do have a solid stomach, and unshakeable resolve to get through even the most 'detailed' of detective novels, then this may be for you. Romanticism, warrior-pride, lust and betrayal is all jam packed into this wonderful 350 page roller-coaster. Definately give it a go, if you are a first time Rowland reader though, read 'Samurai's Wife', or 'Concubine's Tattoo' first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else want to strangle Pinocchio?","review":"My son received this as a gift for Christmas and I wasn't very impressed. The storyline is pretty stupid and Pinocchio is just annoying. The animation is bad, too, and, I noticed that the animators seem to have an obsession with characters sweating that I found to be quite odd (and almost annoying). That said, my three year old loves it. There is a scene at the end where they shoot Pinocchio that I don't think is appropriate for a a kid so young so this one is going to be put away until my son gets a little older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie as seen on HBO!","review":"I remember this movie from when I was little.

Great Visual Overview :>)","review":"DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide: Pacific Northwest provides a great introduction and overview to traveling in the Pacific Northwest. The book hits on the most salient aspects of this region supported by those generous illustrations we've come to expect from this publisher. This DK book is logically and ergonomically designed, not so much to be read cover to cover, but for more \\"in and out\\" quick referrals. The different areas/cities it covers are colorfully indexed and there's even a convenient built in book mark. The physical book itself is designed to be used and abused with a tough binding and substantial cover. Overall, I recommend the book, especially if you are visual learner, however, the savvy traveler will most likely want to equip themselves with a Moon or Lonely Planet (perhaps both) guide book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addresses and map locations don't match","review":"I haven't read the book in detail yet but so far I've found that the addresses that are listed do not match the map locations that the book indicates. I don't know whether the addresses are wrong or the map location is wrong - but several of the hotels are listed for a particular map location where they clearly are not (NE address in the NW section of Portland for example). I'm not too confident about getting myself around using a book that has glaring errors. If I can find errors in an initial read, I can only imagine how many less noticable errors there are. I guess I'm going to be doing lots of additional research to see where things really are...

Now, I admit \\"Step Into My Office, Baby\\" has a good concept, a band gets into the stereotypes that men are the boss, and when he met the woman boss, he starts to fall in love and get caught up in work. It was one of the songs that I had to force myself to really listen to. The B-Sides are really really the reason to listen. \\"Love On The March\\" took a moment to settle in. Nostly, about having to deal with love and indifference in harmony. \\"Desparation Made A Fool Of Me\\" is one of my favorite songs, and one of the reasons I enjoy Belle and Sebastian. The music made me want to create twee-pop, and you will never hear Morissey come up with stuff like \\"If you feel this way, then clap your hands.\\" This EP and I'm A Cuckoo will get you loving Belle and Sebastian or get you to want to learn more about them.

If your looking to have fun, and not actually to train to be a pilot, then don't bother. Flying is hard, the controls are very sensative, which I suppose is realistic but not fun.

I wanted it for baking a round free-form loaf of bread in my convection oven, which has an enameled 12\\" turntable. This did the job. I was able to put a large stainless steel bowl over the whole thing, within the lip of the turntable, so the loaf got somewhat steamed.

FDR combined these qualities to achieve political mastery of his time.This book focus on his life up to the start of WWII. It paints a thorough life portrait of the president and illustrates the events and experiences that shaped this master politician. Although enjoying congressional majorities like no other president (that certainly aided the implementation of his program), FDR had to over come the reluctance of both GOP and Democrat conservatives to rework the federal government into the active economic and social player it is today.

Job is a polyphonic text, meaning a text composed of different voices, none of which has privilege. While this will be less than satisfying to some, it does offer an interesting study. Newsom does a lot of work with narrative theory, as opposed to many of the Job scholars out there. Some of her unique insights include an ingenious explanation for why the third cycle of the dialogues ends the way it does, the (il)logic of Job's speeches in the dialogue, and an interesting theory on Elihu's speeches. Job invites us to offer our own explanation for suffering to the discussion.

The trouble is, my cat was sitting on the other side of the windowed door to my kitchen and I whistled as loud as I could -- and he didn't even look up. He didn't even know I was there. Had I used my regular whistle, he would have looked up; but although I could hear the whistle quite clearly (there's not much that's silent about it), the cat couldn't hear it on the other side of the window, and I tried it at different levels. I finally tapped on the window and he came in, but I don't think the whistle will carry too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Keith Whitley Platinum & Gold Collection","review":"This is a great CD.

There is not one badly drawn character in this novel, not one implausible moment, but Teran is most successful with Dee and Shay Storey, a pair who make Clytemnestra and Elektra seem like Girl Scouts. Dee, especially, is the sort of character that any actress of a certain age would give her capped eye teeth to play. This is a fully formed living, breathing pathology, wholly unreedemed and as elemental as lava. I would love to see this book on the big screen. It would make an absolutely terrific (in every sense) movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore effort doesn't live up","review":"I loved God is a Bullet. It was dark, gritty, noir-ish story. A little graphic and violent, but essential to the story.I wanted to like Never Count Out the Dead. Rarely will I give up on a book, even if I don't like it. I will muddle through just to see what happens. Not so here. The other night, after having read into the second section of the book, I put it down and decided \\"I don't care\\". That's pretty bad, for me. Teran's language and descriptions seem a ittle flamboyant just for the sake of being so. I didn't feel that way about the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOIR AT ITS DARKEST","review":"When I began making promotional appearances for my first mystery novel, readers wanted to know how to classify my work. While there were all types of debates about representative authors of other mystery sub-genres, there was no debate at all about the darkest of mystery's contemporary noir writers. With NEVER COUNT OUT THE DEAD, Boston Teran continues to own the noir writing field. Telling a tale of haunted and tragic characters, Teran's prose jumps off the page. His complex plot weaves the present with past and creates a tough story of violence, manipulation, and ruthlessness centering around John Sully and Dee Storey. If you enjoy the darkest of crime fiction, NEVER COUNT OUT THE DEAD is a book you will love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boston Teran do some stupid books","review":"We don't need some book to tell us not to count on the dead cause we know that dead people can't come back to life, DULL."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes it look simple","review":"simple is the key to success !this book helps make it easy to set up your new business and keep it simple sweetie \\"kiss\\" very inexpensive for a small investment to gain so much information."},{"rating":"1","title":"NASB Study Bible","review":".The Bible contents are good.

You have to make sure you are in an extremely well lit area to read it without struggling. Also, I am a little dissappointed with the leather.

Well, at some point (possibly when Pinaud went to bottling it in plastic), they altered the formulation, to its great detriment. The new(er) Lilac Vegetal is completely different, and quite unpleasant. It does have the faint odor of urine, as others have said (I was dubious without trying it myself).

Unlike a lot of Dummies books, this one isn't padded with filler; every page conveys useful information, discussing numerous internet resources and making suggestions for organizing research. The book also contains lengthy sections on African-American, Native American, and Hispanic genealogical Web sites, and apparently has more information on these sites than many other books.The reasons I didn't rate the book five stars are two-fold: there are dead links in addition to the live ones, and the book was published before the LDS database (maintained by the Mormon Church) was made available online.

Yet the perpetually purblind have influenced too much of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict over whose land this is!

He makes factual errors about Albert Glock's religious affiliations--makes me wonder what other factual errors he includes.If I were a member of Glock's family, I think I would regret giving Fox access, as he paints yellow-journalism's sensationalist and negative portrait of this good man. Then after shifting through a lot of complicated evidence, he draws a silly conclusion: Hamas did it. Please!--how politically convenient! The preponderance of the evidence he himself offers supports the more plausible view that Israelis did it--either army or Mossad-like agents--as Palestinian archeology is a basic threat to the Israeli state's official narrative of who has claims to the land.Most disappointing. Fox, you took on an admirable and courageous task, but dropped the ball in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author should have stuck to the Archaeology","review":"Caveat Emptor.The fascinating world of Albert Glock is wasted in this wretched display of \\"yellow\\" journalism. The first 25 pages tempt the reader with Glock's difficult and languid childhood.

Instead we are presented with Fox's opinionated and, at times, churlish investigation of Glock's murder.If Fox remembered the Birzeit professor's suggestion that the \\"answer lies in the archaeology\\", than perhaps he would have foraged deeper into the cultural and intellectual historical influences that formed his eccentric archeological methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine balance","review":"Betsy's voice was classic 80s at its best.

I don't have any other Caterwaul albums to compare this one to. They are good musicians. The guitarist reminds me of a slightly heavier version of U2's \\"Edge\\". The music seems a cross between \\"The Church\\" and \\"The Cult\\". Vocally though, very unique. Betsy doesn't sound like anyone else. Get this if you're a fan and don't have it.

Instead of new knowledge, I found repetitive stories about the mass production environments in the automotive and related industries. Although some new thoughts or ideas were presented, I did not feel as if this book taught me anything novel or cutting edge. It is simply a repeat of purchasing concepts that can be found in many other operations or supply chain books flavored with managerial buzz words and the self-glorifying personal success stories of the authors and the companies they work for. If you work in a job shop environment or for a small to medium size business, this book is virtually useless.

The book tries to look into the future and puts forward a wildly speculative view of what the authors think lies ahead; again they do not offer a vision but describe the status quo in future tense.

But if you get a chance pick it up or rent it tou will not regret it. The games play is like a arcade racer like Ridge Racer. The story line is cool but I'm not a fan. The controls are good and tight like Burn Out. The wrecks are alittle fake looking but that realy dose not matter since the object of the game is to race and take the cars of your rivals. This brings me to xbox live play where you can take other players cas or cash, realy fun. The pros: graphis, sound, game play, the ability to fully customize cars from top to bottom, and steel them from other racers online. The Cons: The story is alittle boring, and the crashes look stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic game and seller","review":"I received this game quicker than I expected when I ordered it. The game came exactly as described and the disc was in pristine condition. The game is fantastic fun, I have upwards of 20 hours devoted already and I am still playing. The story, while weakly held together, keeps you engaged in the game and when you're done with the story you still have the challenges to complete.I have one gripe about this game and it is minimal. The only issue is that there is no way that I have found to switch the vehicle to automatic shifting. Now I am a hardcore racing sim gamer and I love being able to shift, but there are sometimes that I would rather let the car do it and I know some gamers feel the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great, Great!","review":"The game arrived before the scheduled arrival date.

Need for Speed Pro Street, well if you bought that game hope you like it, but I myself need a Need for Speed game thats more exciting, more law breaker and less corporate backed. Basically I need a game with a soul. Need for Speed Most Wanted saved me during my first couple months in Iraq. Trust me if you remember what it was like to play Need for Speed III Hot Pursuit (AWESOME GAME BTW) This is the game that you have been waiting for and will tide you over until Need for Speed Undercover (EA This had better be What Carbon was supposed to be A REAL PT.2 to Most Wanted) comes out.

Ive had it for about 2 months now and I still play it lots, and usually im not the biggest car racing game fan. Graphically, its one o the best games out there (granted i dont have a hdtv). Most people have already written enough about the game, but I wanted to reply specifically to someone (well their wife) who said in an earlier review that once you get to blacklist 5, the game gets impossible; this isnt true. It does get extremely hard tho, I had to do the milestone section about 16 times to pass it sucessfully. What worked for me was making sure to get the pink slip for the really good cars, eg the Supra,Porche and Gallardo. Still sometimes there is luck involved when they are 20 cop cars chasing you. I dont think it should be easy to beat any blacklist racer 5 and up tho. Anyways, that being said, if you own a 360 get this game, it wont disappoint"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a game that involves cars.","review":"Many people like games with cars in them.

Bought a couple dozen about a year ago and put them in every light in my house (both dimmable and non-dimmable fixtures). Like clockwork, wherever I put them in, they are starting to burn out. These things ARE NOT DIMMABLE. Within a week I went through 4 bulbs in a 2 bulb dimmable fixture. I have regular incandescent dimmable bulbs now and they work fine.The manufacturer says they have a warrantee and are willing to stand by product, however factoring my cost of shipping to replace lousy light bulbs makes it not worth it. Especially since they will most likely only last a year.And although I'd just assume toss them in the trash, I do want to do the right thing w/ spent CFL bulbs. Im not making a trip a week to the local CFL recycling location. So I have a box of a dozen blown CFL bulbs in the basement I am saving up.Bite the bullet and buy name brand CFL bulbs.

Had the Sovs held on for just another year or two, I think Chess would have been as big as Cats or Les Mis; the storyline is stretched a bit, but the music is brilliant -- nearly everyone has heard the astounding flute in \\"Bangkok\\" and \\"One Night in Bangkok\\" -- and the lyrics stir the soul. The duet in \\"I Know Him So Well\\" is as wrenching as the death of Bambi's mother, \\"Embassy Lament\\" provides some much needed comic relief at the expense of 'civil servants' everywhere, and \\"Anthem\\" is a moving tribute to individual freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Aside from the great music, clever, interesting libretto, 'Chess' takes a subject that is obscure and unknown to most people and puts everything from the opening ceremony, to the love interests, to the defection of a Champion, and presents it in a really captivating manner that a broad audience would like. Unfortunately, some staged productions didn't play to these strengths, but this original cast album does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flop that endures. A must for any musical theatre fan!!","review":"As far as I'm concerned, \\"Chess\\" has one of the finest scores in modern musical theatre. This is why the 2 cast albums have endured. Unfortunately, the musical proved to be difficult, maybe impossible, to stage. I didn't see the London version. Both cast albums are excellent. The RCA version, referred to in the review above, contains the song \\"Someone Else's Story\\" written especially for the Broadway production, and sung by Judy Kuhn, possibly the finest musical actress working today. Why she is not a major star, eludes me. Treat yourself to \\"Chess\\" and/or Judy Kuhn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well performed London version of the musical, \\"Chess\\".","review":"It should be noted that the name of the show is Chess (not musical). This is the London version of the show, with some wonderful recordings of the music.

Of the two, it is hard to compare, but I would take the American version."},{"rating":"2","title":"80s Power","review":"In the midst of being in the local high school summer production of Chess, I had to get the soundtrack. This being only one in the nearest FYE store, I bought it.This CD was one of the most talked about items among the cast because of it's (a) differentness from our own (american version) production and (b) it's greatness. We all agreed it was the most 80s thing we had ever heard.There's a kind of power to be found in moments like the choral opening to \\"Endgame\\", the humor in songs like \\"Embassy Lament\\", and the rockin' good time in \\"Opening Cermony\\" (in the Arbiter's song especially) and the dance hit \\"One Night in Bankok.\\"While the price is a bit steep, the album is worth it- buy and groove the night away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame it never made it to Broadway","review":"This is a great musical and recording.

It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.

I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.I've always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative.

His gentle and common style is a sympathetic hug from someone who has truly walked the walk after his stroke and onwards through his own aging process. For a generation of independents, he tackles the nearly-inevitable dependence we will have on those who come to care for us. The issues are anything but simple, but he treats them with realism and a sense that though we, too, will encounter some of these experiences as we age, we can face the challenges with grace and confidence.

The absolutely best thing about the book is the title and his name. What else is contained??? Well, highly-intelligent and incredibly charismatic Dass needs a ghost writer and a good editor. It's just . . . huh? over and over again.

Not only that but the AI is VERY poorly done. The game doesn't offer much in the way of content; a few costumes here and there and a laggy and glitchy online mode. The story line is slim to none; they have you fight over a cabbage at a marketplace for instance. My advice to anyone who is on the fence about picking this title up would be to save your money for something better, this game will only frustrate you and become stale very very quickly. Of course if you're a fanboy of the DOA series you will get it and say it's the greatest thing to hit fighters.

Though the game is beautiful, fast, and frenetic when playing with a friend, trudging through the game's single-player mode -- the only way to unlock more goodies and characters -- is horrific. The game's AI is so cheap to the point where random button mashing is the only way to go. The computer relentlessly punishes you for attempting throws, reversals, or even BLOCKING. I won't even get into the final boss, which made me launch my wireless controller across the room multiple times. After 20 years of game-playing, nothing has ever frustrated me as much as this.Avoid like the plague, unless you like a challenge and enjoy blowing sixty bucks on a game that will abuse and humiliate your playing skill at every step of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA4","review":"It the worst of the series, just because it is for the newest system out doesn't mean it the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fighting, Not Much to Do","review":"The battle system was fun, there are hot girls, but after you beat all the quick and story-less story modes, there doesn't seem to be much else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Fighting","review":"Amazing graphics, challenging gameplay (button-mashing barely gets you by).

I kept telling them it wouldn't work. The only thing that worked was the power button - it does turn the projector on and off. Then they told me to contact InFocus to get a software upgrade. It doesn't exist for Windows 7. This projector is old and they did not have any updates beyond Windows XT.

Thankfully this one is worth reading - if not more than once.In this case, the author's self-imposed task was to travel by Yak through Nepal and Tibet to the ancient forbidden city of Llasa. Accompanied by a photographer called Caroline and two Yaks - called Mucker and Sod, this is the story of their journey.

One comment. Should Americans reveal the whole world through this movie our strategies and secrets in countering terrorism on a hijacked airliner? More than a rated R movie, Executive Decision should be banned by viewers in parts of the world were terrorism is rampant. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and enjoyable because of the plot of the rescue is one of its kind especially the shocking landing of the ill 747 in a small community airport after series of explosions from collision to collision with small aircrafts. Nerve gas on board did not even react to the explosions after counter terrorists contained it. Seems that everyone on board survived the landing. A happy ending.

You can find hundreds of thousands of women just as, or better looking than Halle Berry!

However, even the special effects were not as impressive as expected. The last reel was a disappointing misfire. The script was poor and unmemorable. The performances were appalling and the plot was tedious and unsuspenseful, not to mention implausible. The impregnation of the jumbo jet by the stealth is strictly fantastic. And why should the terrorists go through all the trouble of hijacking a plane in order to detonate the DZ-5 over Washington? Shouldn't they have quietly shipped it in a crate and and activated it, thus taking the Americans by surprise?

They're pretty true-to-size, perhaps a little small. I'd suggest ordering your size or 1/2 a size up, depending on your foot width, but don't order small.One other thing: I'd suggest ordering from Amazon rather than a 3rd party vendor, as the return/exchange process with Amazon is pretty painless, whereas it can be a real trial with some other sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"make me sick.","review":"this shoe is really not for tennis even this brand is famous. i have never met a leg injury until i wear this shoes, this shoes really bad for protect legs , so you know what i mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for small wires","review":"Wire cutters arrived yesterday, broke today on first use.

The dial that sets the gauge makes these a lot more compact than similar wire strippers that have half a dozen holes. The work pretty well for stripping the core off coax as well. Some other reviewers mentioned having trouble cutting through wire. I realized that I haven't actually tried using these to cut any wire much bigger than 22ga, I prefer to just use a pair of regular old wire cutters. You will probably want a pair of flush or diagonal wire cutters anyway if you need to trim leads, the fact that these aren't angled and size of these make them a little difficult to use on a board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool, but not perfect","review":"This tool appears to be well made and competently strips the wire. The only shortcoming is that the setting wheel does not lock into place and is very loose. You have to reset the wheel just about every time you set the tool down. One workaround.... You can rotate the lock tab all the way around to rest against the setting wheel and hold it fairly steady. It works, but I still recommend to check it every time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought this wire stripper through Amazon and used it in converting my home's phone wiring to ethernet wiring. This is a handy little tool and works well. It's small enough for comfortable and easy one-hand use, and the dial to set the size of the wire you're stripping is simple and stays put once you set it. My only complaint is that the side-mounted spring can get in the way when trying to snip small wires, but this is not a problem if you just flip the tool around. Overall, a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy for Small Jobs","review":"I bought this tool for a small addition to my tool bag. The day after it came in I already found a use for it and was glad that I made the purchase. The only things that I could complain about are that the grips open very very wide due to being spring loaded. If you have to adjust your grip, the tool might slip out of your hands. This isn't a big deal though, I got used to using it right away. There is an adjustment wheel for stripping different gauge wire. If this is not set back to the lowest setting after use, then the tool will not lock shut because it prevents the tool from closing all the way. Not a big deal though, just something to keep in mind.I have used similar style strippers supplied by my school for engineering projects, but Irwin is definitely of a higher quality.

Without the advertisements and bad storylines, they enjoy being simple train fans and learn the skills of handling real-life situations, e.g. the attitude of competing with others, a thank-you heart, etc. Even we borrowed the Thomas tapes from the library and watched, we couldn't get back the excitement of watching this set.The only disappointment is this set doesn't have the videos of the songs.

However, this second, advanced series is terrible because of the WAY it was filmed.

I also loved the fact that the heroine was strong-willed and quick witted, and though she had a background she wanted to keep hidden, there was a touch of innocence about her still. A very good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good characters make a good book!","review":"This was one of the few books I found truly un-putdownable in some time. I finished it over an afternoon and had a good fun time. A lot of others have given a good background on the book, so I will not mention it here.

It's an unusual murder mystery, partly because the detective is female - although that's not such a big deal these days - but it's combined with a period setting in post-Civil War Boston. I've spent a little time in that city and it's a great place, and I'd love to return having read Still Life.I thought this was a great read, kept me guessing till the end with a fine central protagonist in Nell Sweeney, and an intriguing central relationship with the good doctor. There are five more of these I think, and they will all be in my TBR pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful historical fiction","review":"The Nell Sweeney series has never disappointed.

I usually don't like to stumble around the words and the dialect, but this book was fantastic. I truly enjoyed reading every page and was extremely disappointed when I reached the end. Nell is a fascinating character and her own story entrances me. As soon as I finished this book I hurried up and purchased the next in the series. Buying it on my kindle was an excellent purchase and the built in dictionary helped me with words that have since become obsolete or the meaning has changed.Even if you're not big on historical fiction, TAKE A CHANCE with this book.

Taking place during the \\"Golden Age\\" (Post Civil War era), this story was the kind that hooks you immediatly and after reading the first was delighted to learn this was the first in a series of 6 books. A nice little mystery, a little love story and I learned so much about this time period in our history.

I quit about 10% into the book. The title was marginally relevant to the story. Spelling, grammar, and Kindle formatting were fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"so predictable I delayed reading the whole thing","review":"I started this book but didn't finish it. This might be ok for someone who is into very light mystery just for something to read; but, for someone who reads lots of good detective fiction, this was a bust for me. I guess I was put off by the lack of a mystery and the stiltedness of the characters; others seem to have found the attention to detail of the era worth the lack of a needed storyline. Not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"After reading some of the other reviews for this book I wonder if I was reading the same book. Nell, a whore, turned nurse, turned governess investigates a murder involving the son of her mistress, who is not the son of her husband.The basic storyline is unbelievable and the premise that this young woman could insert herself into a murder investigation is highly improbable today much less in the 1860's. Setting aside reality, the slow, overly drawn out and predictable plot line was wasting my time. I found my self skipping over pages at a time trying to fine something interesting. I gave up after about 60% through the book and check the last chapter to see it ended pretty much the way I thought it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Straightforward \\"He said\\", \\"She said\\" story. I felt as though I'd read this before. The writing lacks depth and definition, details of historical setting are scanty, but some parts are endlessly -and needlessly- detailed. The presence of the child adds nothing to the story. The \\"hero\\"'s parents are unconvincing, as is the outcome. The dialogue is contrived and often contradictory in style. I found it hard to stay with the book until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stll life with Murder","review":"The audio book is terrible the way it is read. Sounds like an auto voice used by my bank and other companies. Absolutely NO emotion, just words mechanically thrown out there making it hard to pay any attention to the story. When it comes to an \\"ellipses (...)\\" the voice actually says \\"dot, dot, dot\\"!!! I'll have to read the story since hearing it rubs my nerves. Can't listen to it. If I was P.B. Ryan I'd be very upset. This was the first audio book I ordered through my Kindle. I was foolish enough not to listen to a preview. I've learned my lesson. I've listened to many audio books from my city library and they were engaging to hear.

Excellent cozy mystery, well plotted, engaging characters, vivid descriptions. If you want to know how to write a character so that the character's backstory emerges without an info dump, but naturally through the actions and dialog, this is an excellent example.Yes, Nell is a bit too modern for the time and place. But so what? It was an enjoyable book and I'm going to read the rest of the series. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much enjoyed.","review":"I have to admit that I very much enjoyed this series.

Stylish writing, excellent plot and a look at a time in our history that reveals the author's thorough research efforts.

Nell and Will are very interesting characters whose prior lives are unfolded as the narrative progresses.

Personally I loved the book and was able to understand that at one point in time the female was obligated to seek a husband. I know that femanism is largely accepted by the American culture and the book isn't encouraging the readers to reverse the progress of any of the femanist movements.

I felt robbed of a good story. I wanted to read about Medb story not her daughters. I was always intrigued with the story of Medb and her passion to find the white bull, and I found this story did a dis-service to a myth that I love so much. The sad part is the author did know her mythology and the story did have a potential to be good. I didn't like Finnabair, I felt that she was very selfish, mean spirited, holier than thou, and annoying. No you don't need to like the main character to read a story, but it takes away from the enjoyment of it. I found no redeeming characteristic in her. I wasn't going to post this, but the reader from Oklahoma chastised the person that didn't like it, and I wanted to say I didn't like this book for a different reason. If you need to read this book, take it out from the library -- I wish I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will give the author credit for use of Myth","review":"But it stops there. Bright Sword of Ireland - Is less than good. The author is very knowledgeable about Irish Myth and Legend, however the story was lacking in originality and likeability of the lead character. The review says it's Medb story but it really is not. The author uses the first person POV from Medb's daughter Finnabair.Finnabair, the main character, is a whinny, unlikable, spoiled brat who thinks that she is better than anyone else. It is a very predicable story, where the romance story heroine puts her very strong powerful mother in her place, and shows her mother the proper woman's place in society; subservient to men. I also didn't like the endings overtone that somehow Christianity saved Ireland.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a good book from someone who's been there","review":"As the mother of a son who is currently in prison, I have ordered several books in an attempt to get some kind of idea of what we can expect both in prison and when he gets out. This is one of only two books that I have found to be most helpful. The writer has a unique understanding of the system on both sides of the barbed wire and gives some excellent tips on how to succeed. Our family has never dealt with anything like this so we are completely in the dark and this book shined the light on some points I had never thought of that might have taken me by surprise if I had not read this book first.

They are a lot of fun, great for kids and adults. Secret of the Old Clock was the most recent game ment to convey the first Nancy Drew book/mystery. It was done very well, with some suspense and excitement. It really makes you think and to learn new things. This one took a new approach to transportaion with the user actually driving this car around town--this was tricky and a little irritating, I think that's my only little complaint on the game. I recommend all the Nancy Drew games, trust me, they're a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way too short","review":"This game is fun. but not as fun as the rest of the nancy drew games. this game took me only 2 days to pass. my favorite is still last train to blue canyon. very short, very few people to talk to, very easy as well, compared to 3 other games i've played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh So Fun!","review":"It was a fantastic game wonderful. I mean the car chasing, the raking of the dough, losing your tires, having to get them fixed. All of it was really fun! I loved the charectors and coudn't believe who the culprit was! I was so shocked. I do think the psyhic dude was unneasousary. Why did he have to be psyhic? Also i think it should a been a bit more longer and intense. But it is the 1930s it's set in. And it was fun. What was a big shocker was who i was able to talk to on the phone! You guys we'll se for yourself when you get them game. It's really fun and like a reviewer said it's good for kiddies who get scared cause there ain't any violence or scary endings.{Although i like intense moments, i don't like violence or ghosts.} So i strongly suggest getting this game. IT's OH SO FUN!!! And the 1930s era is the best the slang and everything and the driving. get the game! It has to be almost the best nany drew game title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Nancy Fan","review":"I'm 14 years old and I've been playing Nancy Drew games since #3 The Haunted Mansion, and they have always been exhilarating. The puzzles would be tough, but not annoying, and during the game you would always feel frightened at one point or another. Also, when they promised 20+ hours of play, they would mean it. I was disappointed when I finished the game after only 5 hours of play. When I told my mother this, she suggested I was just getting really good at playing the game and solving the puzzles. After reading these other reviews, I realize I am not alone in this time shortage matter. I just hope that the next game will have the actual amount of time, meaning more than 20 hours of play. If that means that it takes a little longer to come out, I will gladly wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Normally I LOVE Nancy Drew, but...","review":"My sister and I love the nancy drew mysteries that come out on CD-ROM and we are constantly checking to see when the new one is out. We've done all the mysteries, and we usually do the junior sleuth because its easier. But The Secret of the Old Clock was TOO easy! We sloved the case in a couple of hours and were bored wanting to know if they had developed the next one yet. I agree with the last reviewer that is a little boring with driving the car, and my sister and I kept doing the deliveries because it never said that you could just stop! So we made like 20$ and finally got sick of it and went back to the lilac inn and they didnt say anything else about it! Well if you decide to get it you should definitel play the senior sleuth if you want a challenge, because on the junior one my sister and i definitely didnt get one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY FUN!!!","review":"This was the first Nancy Drew game I ever played, and it certainly made a good impression on me! The year is 1930, and you are Nancy Drew. You are asked to go to Titusville to see your mutual friend, Emily Crandall, who runs an inn. Her mother recently died, and she fears she is losing her head because of all the work. Her guardian, Jane Willoughby, is trying to take care of her but seems utterly clueless. Can you, Nancy Drew, try to find where Emily's stolen jewels are and where a will is that will help Emily pay off all of her debts?This game is very good. It is exciting and very realistic to the times (1930). I like the music they play in the background, like the Andrews Sisters and other 30's 'Jitterbug' type music. Don't buy this game if you are not very good at puzzles because there are a lot of them or have a low patience level because this one takes much longer to play than the others.All in all, this game is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice game","review":"Secret of the Old Clock is a bit different than the other Nancy Drew games. It is set back in the '30's and you actually get to drive the car and make and spend money. This game is a little easier than some of the other games. It will work well for younger school age children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newest game disappointing","review":"Our family has been playing Nancy Drew games for years. This one is a big disappointment. There was very little humor (especially after the funny LuLu of Blackmoor Manor). The games were too easy, no real good puzzels and the games were very derivative of the other stories. Also, driving the car and playing putt-putt made the game too arcade-like. We hope the next one is better. Play Blackmoor Manor if you haven't already and give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swell....not","review":"I am a HUGE Nancy Drew game fan. I've played all the games, and was really escited to get this one. I had sooo much fun playing it...for two hours. And then the game was over. I was shell-shocked. All of the other Nancy Drew games took me 1-5 days and a big headache they were so difficult. But this one was so easy! This did not live up to my expectations at all. It was fun, yes. But if you are prepared to spend $20.00 on a game that will take you two hours to finish, then buy it. If you dont, save your self ten bucks and go see a movie that will entertain more than this game. Which is just about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best at all","review":"I was really excited about this game when I heard it was going to be set in the older days. Soon after playing it I got really annoyed by it. The music was not like it is with the other ones. There were no \\"scary\\" things at all. Driving the car doing little things got annoying. Its not worth your money. The game is also extremely short. I beat it in less than a day in Senior detective. I dont know what else to say except to maybe buy any other one except for Secrets can kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"best nancy i've played","review":"so, i won't say what all the other reviews have said, but on junior level, one of the nicest things about this game is the CHECKLIST that nancy keeps. whenever i didn't know what to do, there were always 1 or 2 things that i hadn't done on the checklist. and im sure im not the only one that gets like immense pleasure out of checking things OFF the checklist. so, if you get this game, don't forget about the checklist, its a life saver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good","review":"I have played many nancy drew games and it usually takes me a few days 2 beat them but this one was incredibly short (it was tons of fun though)So if you love the nancy drew games like me i suggest you get this but if you are really into long lasting games lets just say get \\"The Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\\"which is longer.Overall this is a very fun game just very easy:)My personal favorite part was the mini golfing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unlike the others...still good!","review":"OK, I am a HUGE fan of the Nancy Drew games and I've beaten all of them and can't wait until the next one! I must say this is one of the most interesting!It's so unlike the others and you get to do many things you wouldn't otherwise do. However, you know how sometimes things are fun at first but then they're just tedious work? That's how it was for me. The roadster thing was pretty fun at first but eventually just got very annoying.You also get to do Putt-Putt and some other things you would't expect from a Nancy Drew game, but these are truly the most high quality games I've ever played (and I've played a lot of games) and you really can expect the unexpected with Her Interactive (the makers of the game.)The characters aren't as good as I had wished but they're still excellent and the storyline is a tad confusing but way better than most games.

You actually have to drive her car; but the video switches to an aerial view and it works like manipulating a simple video game until you park the car. Then it switches back to normal mode.

It wasn't so difficult that I had to go on-line to the forum to get spoilers in order to figure out the riddles or problems. At the same time, it wasn't too easy so I still had to use my brain.

I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock","review":"I was very disappointed with the game. Apparently you have to buy the strategy guide to follow the game intelligently. That should have been indicated upon the purchase. Also when I attempted to save the game, it failed to do so.

The graphics are attractive, expecially in the 1920's setting. However, the games were very easy (even in the Senior Decetive version), and the playing time was disappointingly short. I doubt I invested more than 5 hours on this game...which equates to a waste of money.

Yes Please!","review":"The Secret of the Old Clock is based on the very first Nancy Drew book, by the same name. As a result, the game itself is set in the 1930's, so no cellphone or computer for Nancy this time! However you do have Nancy's cool car, and can drive around town in it. The game starts off with Nancy visiting her friend Emily, whose mother owned Liliac Inn. Her mother has passed away, and Emily is left in the care of her mother's friend. You have to find out what's going on at the Inn, with all the weird happenings! There are some fun mini-games to play, and puzzles to work out.I found the game to be very enjoyable, and visually it's beautiful. The Inn is wonderful to explore, as are the other parts of town! While it's a little short the game, it's very fun to play, and it was great to see Nancy in the past, where she started!"},{"rating":"2","title":"captions","review":"\\"Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock\\" is open captioned, and, I might add, the captions are very nicely done. Even sounds, like phones ringing or explosions, are captioned, much like we expect from TV.

Overall, not one of the best, but not the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"First off i just want to say that i've read \\"The Secret of the Old Clock\\" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything.

So, if you want a good mystery, go for a) ABC Murders b) And Then There Were None c) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd d) The Man in the Brown Suit"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS TERRIBLE!!!","review":"I certainly agree with the last person commenting. This was no winner. The plot dragged, the story was far from suspenseful, and you felt a heavy obligation to read to the end. I think that Christie has several novels where the deadline was shortly approaching, or she had just run out of ideas. That's certainly acceptable, but don't bother with a less-than mediocre book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eternal Triangle Again...with a Twist","review":"Agatha Christie seems fascinated with the eternal love triangle plot (usually a husband, a wife, and a mistress); she uses it again and again in her books. Here we have a devoted couple; the husband is distracted by a grasping beauty, and murder ensues. Christie's handling of this theme is always sure-footed (possibly due to the breakup of her own first marriage due to a philandering husband); here she takes these commonplace elements and twists them to produce an end result that will lift the reader out of his chair. There are, perhaps, more exciting Christies, but this is quite satisfying and interesting. After all, the lady wrote a tremendous number of books and short stories; they can't all be her \\"best.\\" See how many different variations on this theme Christie was capable of in \\"Five Little Pigs,\\" \\"Death On the Nile,\\" \\"Towards Zero,\\" and \\"The Hollow,\\" in which the triangle is more of a square, with four sides instead of three."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing like an old-fashioned, character/psychology-driven mystery","review":"(part of the Lost Literary Reference Marathon) Agatha Christie is always good for a character-driven murder mystery. Sure, it's all the typical stuff: a lone hotel on the sea, a dead body strangled on the beach. But it's the characters and psychology--especially of the sleuth Hercule Poirot--that sets her apart. Arlena Marshall is a rich, pretty woman that attracts the scorn of women and the attention of all the men--except her husband. She is found strangled, and her stepdaughter's room contains relics of witchcraft. The setting and the theme of evil and its definition, as well as the mysterious characters, make it perfect for a Lost reference. Grade: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too too good...","review":"This book....hmmm...what can i say. It was too good!!! The murderer was completely unsuspected. The cast of characters was marvelous, each with their own separite image and identity.

Characters behave in a way that is totally alien to the way that they had been presented thus far (Li Yuan, in particular, whose fall into dotage is ridiculous)And anyway, has anybody counted the number of times characters 'shudder' in Wingrove's series?

Though it is not whimsical in its content, it is a fairly quick read (two to four hours). Excellent for a train or plane ride, but overall it is about the characters and they are well-written and carefully considered. As always, not every detail in the book is in the film and vise versa, but that keeps the read from being dull if you've already seen the film. Some of my favorite exchanges from the movie (like when he explains the history of BMW) are also in the book. You know that feeling that comes over you when you realize the book you are enjoying is in its last chapter? Well, that is why part of me wishes that Ellison could have drawn the story out a bit more. Other than that, it was a sublime read and ideal for travel entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeder seed holes way too large","review":"This bird feeder is great looking. But the seed holes are WAY TOO LARGE and allows the seeds to pour out of the filled feeder. Also the tray is very small for the amount of seeds spilled into it causing seeds to spill out of the tray. We bought a 13\\" seed catcher that helps eliminate that problem. But the feeder is not even practical for sunflower seeds as the feeder holes are even too large for those type of seeds. We are going to modify the feeder by placing a thin piece of aluminum sheeting inside the feeder, covering the holes and cut new smaller seed holes in the aluminum. Hope this works. Too bad the design flaw has cause more expense and more work. I would not reccomend this product for any type of birdseed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath 2501 Feeder - The #1 Best.","review":"I had one of these feeders for several years until the raccoons tore it down and broke the cover.

He loved it outside the tub because he had fun watching it wiggle and dance on the lenolium floor. However, once it got in the tub, the fun went out of it. It would not stay afloat, even after following the directions of squeezing out excess water routinely. Routinely would mean ever 5 seconds. And sadly, he lost his head about 2 weeks ago. My son had not abused it in any way, instead was taking good care of it because he liked it so much. During one bathtime session he was giving the duck a bath and the head came almost completely off, just dangling by a couple of threads. However, there was no fixing it. All in all, my son was able to enjoy this toy for less than 3 weeks. It is a very cute toy so I would suggest that it be used only outside the tub to watch him wiggle and sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Generation Likes it Too!","review":"Still funny after all of these years.

I like how it was digitally re-mastered and looked so clear on the DVD too. I couldn't believe how good of an actor Weird Al was! I mean, I first heard about him when I watched Saturday Morning Cartoons and saw a show called \\"The Weird Al Show!\\" about a scientist. He was awesome! The movie showed what pure talent he had in acting and was so great! I recommend it to people who don't care about seeing fake-looking dismembrant, impaling, crushing, and slicing in half vertically, though!! But, despite some violence, he was pretty darn funny!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still as funny as it was in the 80s...","review":"One of my childhood favorites is still almost as entertaining as I used to find it back then. In fact, with this disc filled with lots of extras (which for some reason are not listed on Amazon's page!), it's even better. The motion menus are exceptional as are the contents they open, and there is just one gripe - the deleted scenes are on the Idiot Side of the disc (the one with the cut, Fool Screen version of the film). They're missing from the proper, watchable, widescreen side of the DVD. (Why do studios still support fool screen, anyway?) The deleted scenes are, by the way, probably the best part of the extras - not really because they're particularly entertaining (there is a reason why scenes that don't work end up deleted), but because they're introduced and discussed by Al Y., who puts on a bitter, jaded, disgruntled act of being ashamed of and disgusted with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE ROCKS","review":"Good clean humor - Wierd Al Style.

The movie does have its slow parts, but the spoofs and skits are absolutely hilarious. I won't tell you all of them because then you won't go and rent or buy this great movie. This movie is really good if you are a Weird Al fan, like REALLY off-the-wall humor, parodies, something that can make you laugh. Some people hate this movie, but I think it's because they're trying to see it as a movie. UHF is not really trying to be a movie, it's trying to be more of a collage of parodies. Anyway, see it for yourself. There's no telling how many stomach muscles you'll burst watching this hilarious film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side A Is Excellent, Side B Is A Major Disappoinment","review":"This is a review of this product:UHF DVD.

Al mentions that there are hours of deleted scenes, so why didn't they use the entire side B for them? Nobody asked for the crappy Pan & Scan version of the film. To add insult to injury, two of the deleted scenes are fast forwarded through.

Come on Amazon, help me out, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"This has been one of my favorite films for years. One that it always seemed like everyone else missed seeing. It has some great parodies of other films and popular music. Even Heraldo Rivera gets the spanking he deserves, if you are old enough to remember the things he did before becoming a \\"serious journalist\\". Lots of clean-cut goofiness. Years ago I put the janitor's speech on my telephone answering machine - a parody of the movie Network. There's also Rambo and Indiana Jones, and on and on. I guess you have to be a bit of an old timer to remember TV's with VHF and UHF on the dial. That's even older than when channel 17 was out Atlanta with Scarlet O'Hara's ads and Bill Tush. Egad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Time Ago in A Galaxy in Some Crazy Guy's Head","review":"This is a funny movie. It is part satire and part homage; and it works. There are some lulls, and some skits don't go over so well; but, on the whole it will entertain you and make you laugh. I saw this film in the theater when it was first released many years ago. It has aged well and is even funnier in spots. Weird Al is his usual dorky, idiosyncratic self playing the dispirited manager of his Uncle's broken down UHF station. The supporting cast is just as good , especially Michael Richards as the brain damaged Stanley the janitor who loves his mop more than life itself and Kevin McCarthy as the scheming villain who will stop at nothing to maintain his dominance as the king of trash television. It's a goofy, quirky, dopey, funny movie, with a happy ending that is actually believable. I wonder why Weird Al never made another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael (Kramer) Richards' lost performance","review":"This movie is funny. It's late night funny, like something you might catch on UHF. The parodies are good. It loses focus towards the end (around the time you nod off anyway) and Weird Al tries WAY too hard to be funny and carry the film. He can't, but his supporting cast DOES! They bring new meaning to the title \\"SUPPORTING\\" cast. Underdog veterans like John Paragon, Victoria Jackson, Kevin McCarthy and Gedde Watanabe prop Weird Al up (hey, for a guy known for doing silly song parodies, he pulls his weight. The scene where the kid spits in his face is pretty darned funny) but the REAL treat is watching Michael Richards in a pre-Seinfeld role as Stanley Spadowski. Much like the character in film, once he's on screen, the movie really takes off. I watch this movie over and over just for his scenes. Truly one of the most overlooked performances of that year. Wotta genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV the way it was meant to be seen: on DVD!!!","review":"This is the best movie in the history of movies. Weird Al gives a steller performance as George Newman, the guy with the hyperactive imagination. My suggestion is buy UHF on DVD and have a UHF party. Its so fun, get some twinkie weiner sandwiches and have a polka party!This movie is definatly a marvel of the 20th centuary. The special effects are just spectacular! Like when this guy trys to shoot Al when he's Indiana Jones and the guy lifts his left arm in the air with the gun and then Al snaps it off and it falls to the ground as his right arm. Its just so awesome, just how do they do that!!!You must see this movie, you will thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I remembered","review":"I remember LOVING this movie and all of its silliness.

But I have to say that UHF is a movie geared more towards children than adults. The only reason I give UHF two stars is because of Weird Al Yankovic and because the movie started out pretty funny but then it got childish. Unless you are a die-hard Weird Al fan who must see UHF, I would suggest listening to the soundtrack opposed to actually watching this film. By the way, I am not saying that Al Yankovic did a bad job acting. I found him quite funny. It was all the other stuff in UHF that made it a not-so-humorous motion picture in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie! Defective DVD :(","review":"I was greatly looking forward to this DVD and bought it right when it came out.Too bad that it freezes on my DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I'm surprised they're bothering to release this film on DVD. This movie is dreadful, and that's coming from a 'Weird Al' fan. The plot isn't worth describing, because the movie is a collage of sketches, most of them juvenile and stupid. Of course, juvenile is what you expect from 'Weird Al', so that's not really the problem. The problem is that 95% of the jokes don't work. That's not just my opinion, that was the general public consensus, as the film bombed and Weird Al's career took some time to recover. There are some attempts to be satirical, but most of them are too broad to have any bite. If your idea of funny is someone getting hacked apart by Conan for turning in a library book late, perhaps this film will appeal, but for me, there was exactly one amusing gag: Spatula City -- a giant warehouse emporium full of spatulas of all sizes and varieties. I still can't get that one out of my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $10","review":"The first ten minutes of this film are funny and seem promising. It seems to set the stage for a Hot Shots/Part Deux or Naked Gun type of slapstick comedy. The rest of the film is extremely boring just telling a mundane story about Weird Al trying to make a UHF station profitable and make something of his life. Don't be fooled, this is not funny like Weird Al's songs or music videos.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just call me Mr. Butterfingers","review":"Being one of Weird Al's youngest fans, I just recently saw this movie and it was funny. In short, the plot is that hilarious shows come to boring old UHF,but a rival station wants to tear down UHF.

Since 1989, Weird Al's UHF has only appeared on VHS. But in summer 2002, fans will be rushing out to get the DVD version. Why you may ask?! Well, the VHS version isn't the easiest thing to find at your local mall. This is either because it was a best seller or it really STUNK! Well, Weird Al didn't expect it to be a best seller. He said \\" It's just an excuse to be funny.\\" For those of you who haven't seen this, UHF is about this guy with a huge imagination that goes and inherits a tiny UHF station. He makes all sorts of wacky shows starring his friends like Karate Master Kuni who is famous in this movie for saying STUPID! YOU SO STUPID! Anyway, this movie's sorta sick because the gags are usually stupid and full of body humor. Still, most of the gags are quite funny.

They turn the station around and make it the most popular station in town with the totally wacky shows like 'Strip Solitaire', 'Conan the Librarian' and 'Town Talk'(which was Springer before there was Springer). Their popularity makes the owner of the BIG station in town mad.

My friend has that set and its picture quality is noticeably better.UPDATE: Repair people came today with a new light engine and board because the ballast and color wheel weren't the problem.

A teacher once asked in a psychology class, \\"Are psychologists modern-day shamans?\\" There's a popular book equating businessmen of today (purposely gendered) to samurai. Still, this is a cop out in that we have much SWAT footage and little visual imagery of samurai, so of course the makers take the path of least resistance.This work is very Western.

While certain plot elements have been changed presumably to appeal to a younger viewer (i.e. the viewer's connection to the bug story via a young boy), the essence, tone and atmosphere of Poe's original story remain in tact. The suspense is in the right places. The effects/music are well-placed be they dated.

Warmly recommended to anyone with a true interest in this area of the Ferrari history. i'm not sure all is correct, but it's a hell of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The simplest and best Ferrari book","review":"Not as loud as some of the thick, glossy Ferrari books around, this small book tells the story of the Maranello house and its machines in a simple, chronological order and with sufficient detail. but without being overwhelming. Fllled with very attractive pictures.I own a few Ferrari books, but this small gem is my favorite. BTW, the Jaguar book from the same collection is not bad either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good photos terrible editing","review":"Any Ferrari book will have the colorful pics (some of which come from other books I have on Ferrari), but the errors in text and misplaced photos are far too numerous for any book. The section on the 550 has photos of F50 and 512TR. It almost looks like the book was never proof-read. Ferrari enthusiasts will find the errors immediately and it is very disconcerting. One or two goofs is acceptable but this is systemic. Shame, because it could be a nice little page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland and boring","review":"I thought that this bouncer was just adorable - while I was pregnant and did not yet have a child. This bouncer and the toys on the toy bar are just shades of white, the vibrating element is at the child's feet and cannot be felt from inside the bouncer, and the \\"music\\" sounds much like a hairdryer with annoying chirping birds. I'm not usually one to complain, but my child does not enjoy this seat, and I do not blame her. I'm sure the bug screen will be useful in the summer, but my child'll be too old for it at that point. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Bauer Boo Boo","review":"This was by far the worst product Eddie Bauer has made. I have three children and have been a Eddie Bauer die-hard fan but this chair was awful. My 6months old son hates it. In the beginning the noise scared him and he instantly cried when I sat him in it. As he crew older he was just plain bored by it and I was afraid it wasn't gonna hold his weight which is just now 16lbs. I registered for it because it match the bassinet and the swing by Eddie Bauer but it wasn't worth the 60 bucks my friends paid for it... I say Boooooo to this one. But I'm still a die hard fan because they make some great quality merchandise"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not right...","review":"I also loved the idea for this product. My daughter was born in July and I liked the idea of her napping in it on our porch with the netting all zipped up. However, the seat never supported her enough. She wasn't a very big or a very small baby, but she kept falling over to one side in the seat. And the toys - and what they are attached to - were always out of her reach, but in her line of sight. When she could support herself better, she was too tall for it. The cool tent feature makes the babies outgrow it so much more quickly than a regular open bouncy seat. I ended up leaving it at my mom's for a \\"back up\\". And for the price compared to other bouncy seats (like the $20 one I bought and my daughter loved), it was a big time waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"my baby hated the tan version of this bouncer","review":"i just want to point out that the seat is FLAT and HARD,it doesn't sit up very much and the strap is too small for a 2 month old. also my baby screams when he is in it, because it is very uncomfortable. i recomend the baby papasan bouncer or the swing version. actually or just about any bouncer. my baby has and likes: infant to toddler rocker, aquarium take along swing, baby papasan seat, aquaruim bouncer and papasan swing PLEASE DONT BUY THIS IT IS VERY UNCOMFY FOR MY BABY AND EVERY BABY THAT HAS COME TO PLAY GROUP. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken bouncer","review":"Our baby loved this bouncers vibrate and sound features.

The netting keeps mosquitos, flies, bees, etc., a way from your baby so they can enjoy the outside weather with you! Also the inside area that is like a pillow is so soft! WE love it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the reviews prior to investing!","review":"Not a quality product. Seems uncomfortable and unsafe. Also, not good for a baby over 1-2 months old, because most likely, by then the baby is too big, both in weight and in length. Safety strap is very small and can hardly be adjusted. When bouncer is in upright position, baby flops over to one side. This review is based on an average sized 3-month old. Prior to this age, our daughter didn't care for it. Like I said in the title, I wish I had done more reading before investing in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations","review":"This bouncer was recommended to me in the store, but when I got it home and put it togther, I was not impressed. The assembly wsan't all that easy and the \\"soothing sounds\\" were more like white noise with the occasional bird chirping. After walking by it for two days I finally decided to return it for the Baby Einstein model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the money","review":"I purchased multiple Eddie Bauer Products and this was by far the biggest waste for us. It worked well at first but was quickly not used. It is good for a new baby to nap in or a take along for use at grandma's as it does fold up well but for the older baby it stinks. It does not sit up any higher then maybe 30 degrees, the restraint straps were too small by the time our son was 12 weeks old (he only weighed a little over 12 lbs then and it is rated for 25 lbs ????) and he was cramped in it, no room for his legs. The toys are boring. The zip up netting was a nice feature and he did like the vibrate mode. Overall it got little use, we replaced it with a Baby Bjorn 1-2-3 bouncer and it is 150% better - our son loves this. Don't waste the money, at least I got half back when I resold it on Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"My child outgrew it too quick","review":"After six weeks, my son outgrew this. It's great for newborns...it kept him quiet when I took a shower and is great for putting it right outside the door but now he's two months and is too big for it. He's average weight and height."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a useless bouncennette!!!","review":"When selecting products for my registry, the Eddie Baur \\"B\\" collection caught my eye! I loved the natural colors, so I decided to buy the whole set! After researching this product, I decided on purchasing the Deluxe Activity Rocker made by Combi for my house, and decided to leave the Eddie Baur Soothihg Bouncenette at my parents and in-laws. I figured even though this product did not have the greatest reviews, it will not be used everyday! However, this bouncenette is useless! My little one is only 2 months old and does not fit in it anymore, and he is an average infant! There is no support for the baby; I have been putting blankets underneath him and beside him to make it a little more comfortable! I am also afraid to leave my baby's side when he is in the bouncennette of fear that it will collapse! I am returning the Eddie Baur Bouncennttes, and will be purchasing the Deluxe Activity Rocker by Combi! At least this way, I know my baby will be safe!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad waste of money","review":"This bouncer is so pretty but I found it a useless waste of money. I have two since I have twins and they HATE them. They will not spead any amount of time in them. I have tried at least 5 times and no dice. I have read reviews for other bouncers and people seam to love them. This bouncer is expensive and not worth it. I'm taking them to the resale shop and getting the Carters ones. My friend has it and her baby even sleeps in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"this seat is terrible, baby tips to the side, there is nothing to keep their attention and once the baby was like 2 months old, he was too big for it. we have all the other eddie bauer products and they are great, but this one they should just get rid of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and safe place to put the baby","review":"We bought this product used before the baby was born and it has been a hit. The vibrate option has kept him sleeping peacefully in the living room while the family moves around him. I find the noises not at all soothing, but they seem to work for him! The seat reclines fully, great for a newborn; now that he is 13 weeks old we have adjusted it so it inclines. The biggest negative is that he is about to outgrow it so it is only good for about 3 1/2 months. A big plus - the zip up screen. We have two dogs in the house and by closing the screen we keep the baby protected from inquiring, slobbery noses."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this seat.

I plan on selling it at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give this product 1 star only because you can't choose 0 stars","review":"This product caught my eye when I was pregnant and thought the idea of the mesh netting was great. After the baby came, I attempted to put her in it and the strap was too tight. I persisted and tried to use it but after she was 4 weeks old it became impossible to use. She was too tall at 4 weeks old to sit in it, her head would have to be tilted to the side in order to put her in it. I then contacted the manufacturer and they were not any help to me. They said they never heard of anyone having trouble with the product and it really wasn't their problem that she was too big for the seat. I tried her in other bouncy chairs and she fits just fine. Well like me they obviously missed all these BAD reviews. I wish I had seen them earlier. I never would have put the product on my baby registry."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of our WORST purchases","review":"My husband and I read all of the poor reviews on this product, and we really should have listened to them! However, we were drawn to the bouncenette's pretty neutral color and seeming usefulness. We were wrong--it wasn't useful. Here's a list of all that we found wrong with this bouncenette:*When our baby was a newborn, she wasn't properly supported by the seat, and would end up in very weird positions (head near the bottom of the seat, slumped over to the side, etc...) while sleeping. We thought of placing towels or blankets on either end, but that didn't seem safe.*The vibration is weak.*The toys are very boring and out of the baby's reach, which is pointless.*It's awkward to carry around.*After only two months, we coudn't find any use for this product.We went back to the store and bought the Ocean Wonders bouncer, which is cheaper and a much better product. Listen to the reviews--don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most uncomfortable headphones ever","review":"These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn or tried to use.

Two fatalities per character with new death traps, stage fatalities-Completely redesigned single player Konquest mode-Features multi-tiered interactive backgrounds-With a mix of your favorite fighters as well as many new ones. It's the definitive portable Mortal Kombat experience every fan has waited for. I must say, I'm impressed. The loading times for the game are a smidgen long but doesn't mar things overall.

The problems are 1) the strap (especially around the loop that holds the thing around your chest) is crap and tends to break, needing ongoing replacements, 2) when the honeymoon has worn off and the batteries need replacing, Polar takes more money from you than seems reasonable to change a darn battery, 3) after said honeymoon ending, the transmitter also starts to stutter and you'll find yourself adjusting and re-adjusting and wetting for suction to try to get the right reading going.In conclusion, you'll be happy at first, and then you won't be so happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Display, Low beep volume","review":"The heart monitor and watch work fine BUT the display is grainy, small, and hard to see. Far cheaper monitors and watches have far better, brighter, bigger displays.And - the beeps to warn that you have gone above or below your heart range are so low that there is no way to hear them on the exercise floor! You have to keep the unit to your ear to hear them.People recommended this so I bought this but I am not happy with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Looking to get in shape I researched many of the brand of heart rate monitors out there. Polar seemed to have the best overall reviews so I decided to try the F6. The price might seem a bit high but it should last a considerable while. It is really easy to program and to start your workout, you just press one button and you are off! I haven't explored all of the features yet but so far I am very happy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes when I'm on a machine it will flash and incorrect heart rate. But it generally fixes itself within a minute. This is also great for gym classes or working out on your own to see how many calories you burn"},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have received a defective one","review":"I am an older woman (63). I am very active and was quite curious about how many calories I actually burn. I purchased this to make sure I did not \\"overdo\\" with my heart and for the calorie number. It worked (somewhat) on day one and then quit. I tried on two more consecutive days but to no avail. It just would not pick up my heart beat properly....it would register 0 and then a few minutes later, 172, a number that is too high for me. I returned it and did not want the hassle of trying another. I have not purchased a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great HR monitor","review":"I originally purchased a Suunto T1 and had to send it back - too complicated, lousy manual and no customer service from the company (the U.S. division was taking the day off for a European holiday and no one was there to help me set it up). I was really discouraged and my husband suggested I take a look at the F4 and F6. I settled on the F6 because of the size and the many features. It was much easier to set up than the Suunto and I think the pink is just adorable. It's easy enough for even a technophobe like me to use, light weight on my wrist and the chest strap is small enough that it doesn't dig into me the way the Suunto did. Overall, I think there are a lot of good features on this monitor. I haven't used it that much (only got it last week) but so far it's a 5 star purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar Heart Rate Monitor Watch/Body Band","review":"I really like this item...the only problem is that it doesn't always get your heart rate...the band that goes around your chest slips a lot...especially if you are working up a good sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"too cool","review":"This is an awesome HRM.

The same thing happened on the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar F6 Pink Heart Rate Monitor","review":"Compared to the dinosaur heart monitor I've had for years, I just LOVE this new one. It gives more information than I'd ever need, but it tells calories spent.

Overall, LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor, difficult instructions","review":"This is my first heart monitor. I selected it because it was highly rated and, since I have a very tiny wrist, I needed something sized for a woman.I really like it, but find the instructions very hard to follow. I have trouble getting past the simple time of day and heart rate screens (those were easy). I find myself randomly pressing buttons trying to get to any display more sophisticated than those. I'm a PhD research scientist so I _should_ be able to follow these instructions. I've also been a technical writer and believe that when the user is confused it is the fault of the documentation.This is a very nice monitor, but it shouldn't be so difficult to use past the basic level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"Really like this watch. It's fairly basic (just measures time, heart rate and calories), but is exactly what I was looking for. The heart rate monitor is very accurate. It's extremely easy to use, and affordable.

This watch was for my wife's birthday and to my surprise she loves it. It is easy to setup and use and gifts like this inspire one to exercise. The color went over well with the misses so that is a nice bonus. This watch tracks calories burned, workout time, avg heart rate, peak heart rate and logs training sessions. It is a simple easy to use tool to get you to workout more and increase the effectiveness of your training sessions. I highly recommend this product for running and biking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"Purchased this heart rate monitor for my wife. Excellent heart rate monitoring. The ability to download your workout is excellent however it can be a bit cumbersome to do. The OwnZone application is difficult to calibrate and could be made easier.

Overall I would definitely buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the right track","review":"I purchased this heart monitor never having used one before.

Unfortunately the company (Joma) did not allow for a size selection. They sent a M which would not fit me. I called the customer service number to try and exchange it for a larger size. It took 25 min to get through only to be told that was \\"the only one we had\\". I then asked how to go about returning it, and was told I had to print out a form and mail it in for a \\"return code\\". However they only allow returns 30 days from when they shipped it to me, and since they took 3 weeks to get it here, and a week to respond to my email so that time is gone now.

The response time is 25ms which is too slow for gaming and/or video. There is a LOT of ghosting when playing games and enough while watching movies that I found it annoying and had to return the unit.Be careful when you read reviews of LCD monitors by end users. Most people don't judge them very carefully, they're just impressed by the bright, sharp pictures.For everyday use (browsing the web, reading email, Word, Excel, etc.) this monitor is fine.

I went to the Phillips Sonicare website to try to get help and after two tries at using their live chat, gave up when no one answered. Calling customer service was abandon after they required serial numbers, date of purchase etc. that I no longer have easily available. The cost of this product is too high for it to have shoddy workmanship and then have no easy recourse for replacement or repair when it fails to work this quickly.

I have been using it for 6 months now, and would highly recommend it myself. My teeth definitely feel much cleaner after using this toothbrush compared to a regular, manual toothbrush. The fact that it runs for a full 2 minutes probably has something to do with it (you can stop it if you need to).A couple of suggestions if you purchase this toothbrush are:First, read the directions that come with it. It will save you time in the long run.Second, don't press the brush against your teeth. It'll rip your gums up. Just let the brush do the work for you rather than trying to \\"scrub\\" your teeth.Third, it will get nasty if you don't take care of it.

The handle is fine but the brush attachment is a different type and uses a flawed design that should be recalled. The brush installation is clumsy at best and feels like those $6 battery powered ones. The worst part is that in use, your tooth paste, water, and saliva drips down in to gaps and a chamber inside the head.

It cleans your teeth very well, as pointed out in many reviews. However, just after passing the warranty period (2 years) the rechargeable battery has died and will no longer hold a charge. I called Philips customer service (after receiving no response to my inquiries via email) and they were completely unwilling to assist in any way because the toothbrush was out of the warranty period. I asked the customer service rep if this was a manufacturing defect or if it was unusual. She said she receives this type of call all day long, every day, regarding battery failure. She said it generally fails before 3 years.

The power of the Sonicare brush is heads above disposable electronic brushes.The Sonicare sensation is something you definitely have to get used to, but once you are it is clear sailing.The low cost (comparitively) of these was what led us to finally make the switch but I may look into the more expensive Sonicare units in the future as the replacement heads for those seem to be cheaper in the stores.

I really can't give it as a gift this way, or if I do, I'll have to think of some clever way to hide all the shipping labels on the box. Disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy","review":"We had a previous Sonicare and liked it till it died. This model however is not easy to use.

The company would not replace the 2nd one saying it was outside their warranty limit. We were told when the first one stopped working that it was a problem they were having, so we thought it would be covered as a faulty design or part, but no, Sonicare won't do anything. We bought a Braun at the same time and it is still working beautifully. We will no longer buy any Philips products as we don't feel that they stand behind their products. You'll notice that there is another one-star review here that had the same on/off problem. It's a good product as long as it works, and our experience is that it breaks down."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"My girlfriend and I share the brush, we just switch between two heads which is just a simple matter of screwing and unscrewing. Why pay for two of these at these kind of prices? Function is great, it just runs for 2 min and if you need more time you hit the button again. My dentist wouldn't leave me alone about getting one of these and I have to say, it was worth the investment. My girl is already been telling me her teeth are whiter and glint now and its been just a couple weeks.

Other than the expense vs. longevity, the Sonicare is a wonderful product, convenient to use, and does a great job. In fact, I believe I've had more dentists than I've had Sonicare toothbrushes.

After using the brush head for a few weeks, it gets this really gross pinkish film inside the plastic cover of the brush head that ends up leaking onto the brush head holder and it also starts to smell. Now, I'm rinsing the brush head after each use and simply placing it on its stand. What happens after that, I'm unsure of. It's actually really disgusting that I'm brushing my teeth with a smelly tootbrush head. I'm wondering if others have this same issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like this enough to buy a replacement after I dropped ours","review":"We really like this model of Sonic are Toothbrush.

After using electrical tape to hold it together for over a year, it wasn't charging well. So I found this one, and the price was much lower than our first one.There are some bad reviews concerning mold. We always wipe ours off when done using it for the day, and have never had mold develop. I suppose if you let water pool in the top of the base that could happen, but why would you do that? It only takes a couple of seconds to wipe it off. We replace the brushes every 4-6 months as well and have never had mold grow on them. We do let them sit out to air dry and wipe off their bases.Our dentist could tell when we started using this product. We'll never use a regular toothbrush again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the first two weeks...","review":"Excited to get this toothbrush at such a good price. It worked really well the first couple of weeks (it remained on the charger per instructions when not in use). Took it on a several-day trip with me, sans charger, as manual indicates it holds about a two week charge for normal use. Used twice on the trip and then, went to use it a third time... zip, zilch, nada. Completely dead. Put it on charger when I got home. Still no signs of life. Fini. When I first received this unit, I noticed there didn't seem to be any waterproofing where the brush head meets the handle, so perhaps it is a design flaw or simply bum luck.I've switched to zee German-madeOral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count.

I looked at several models on amazon.com before deciding to purchase this one. The price was better than anywhere else, so I also purchased the replacement brush headds at the same time. So far, everything works well and I'm enjoying my new toothbrush a lot. The only thing I kind of wish it had is the timer gizmo like my old one, that beeped every 30 seconds so you know when to move on to brushing another quadrant of your mouth.

I had not used an electric toothbrush in years and felt they were a waste. But, one use of this and I saw I was wrong.It is a different way to brush and takes a time or to to remember to place it on your teeth first then turn it on.

I was excited to buy this plus the little shields that go with it, but I'm returning it and going to research others.

Now the newer ones use a more enviromentally safe battery. .. only thing is the newer Sonicare only lasts a year! I dont know about you but I am not spending $60.00 a year on a toothbrush. It would not be bad if you could replace the battery & you can if you have a workshop with solder gun. I ended up buying a Braun Oral B & you get four replacement brushes for the price of one Philips brush.

I've read some reviews that claim their toothbrush stops for 1 sec or so or flashes every 30 seconds to remind you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth. But for my Essence 5300, it just stops after 2 mins and I don't always divide it evenly on all my teeth.After using it for 1 year, the battery dead!!! At first the battery works well and can last on a 4 days trip. But now after one year use,I have to charge it on the charging dock every time I finish using it, and leave it charging for like 12 hours.

After a couple of years the Oral-B needed to be charged each use. I keep the Sonicare off of the charger until it needs recharging, so we'll see how the battery holds up over time. I did like the round brush head of the Oral-B better for reaching the back of my front teeth. It's a bit harder to angle the Sonicare just right to reach those teeth.

I invested in the Sonicare Essence 5300 and noticed the difference in the health of my gums in just a couple of weeks.Yes, you'll still have to floss. But this makes general teeth care so much easier. Including the fact that it has a two minute self-timer for the optimal brushing time recommended by the American Dental Association.I've never been one to spend too much on a toothbrush. After all, what difference does it make. Right? Well, it makes a big difference. No more of the dentist freebie brushes for me. No more of the battery powered specials either.It holds a charge for a couple of weeks without a problem. The brush is easily replaceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Significant Improvement","review":"Six months ago my dentist warned me that my gums were in bad shape. Despite brushing and flossing twice a day, my gums were 4s and 5s all around. We determined that I was using a bad brushing technique, so I purchased and started using this Sonicare toothbrush. I use it twice a day, plus flossing and mouthwash twice a day. I used a normal toothbrush on my tongue. After six months my gums are now mostly 3s. A significant improvement! I highly recommend this brush to anyone with gum problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective, but moisture logged","review":"Although prior posts had warned this model of toothbrush is not sealed well and absorbs water/toothpaste into the inner cavity, I went for it anyway to use up a balance on my Amazon Gift card. Well, it completely lived up to its reviews. The toothbrush itself works fine, but it is really poor at keeping fluid/moisture out of the battery cavity. I have to remove the brush head after EVERY use, and rinse and wipe it out - a significant amount of water, toothpaste, ETC. sinks in no matter how well it is tightened. So, if you are the disciplined type, have at it..it works well and my teeth feel great. But, if you aren't the type to open the device and rinse the inner base twice a day, choose a lower maintenance model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective little brush","review":"The brush took some getting used to since the brushing style is different from other power brushes.

You know how you always forget to pack something, so I got a second Sonicare. However this model does not beep or pause or stutter slightly every 30 seconds to indicate to the user when to switch quadrants in the mouth. I just have to guess and since I have used my other Sonicare for years knowing when to switch is not difficult to do; however a new user would have trouble with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many model choices, not enough quality","review":"These Sonic toothbrushes now come in some 10 or more models; each with a bell and whistle that may or may not be the one you need for clean, plaque free teeth.

The base (JOKE is on the customer)How can you keep this lame thing clean, when the base is build to make it fall. Who need that lame charging station that has no support to keep your toothbrush up? It falls down even with the wind. So go pick another set of brush head because your blowdryers cable made your toothbrush fall on the ground.4). ChargeLasts almost once... ONCE!

Never before I was able to clean those back teeth so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been using this product for over 4 years and I get good dental check ups and my teeth have no stains. I like the brush on this model better because it has higher bristles at the end for getting into tight spaces. After going to Sonicare's website and reading the test studies, I was sold. I know there are cheaper electric brushes out there, but the technology behind this one can't be beat and I believe the toothbrush has paid for itself in better dental checkups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean teeth..but you'll have mold under the brush head.","review":"Simply a poorly designed brush head. My teeth feel and look cleaner than with a traditional brush, but I had mold under the brush head within 1 week. My wife's began showing mold within 2 weeks. That is an unacceptable design flaw. The instructions state to remove the brush head weekly for cleaning, so Philips is obviously aware of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Batteries cannot be replaced!","review":"I purchased this product at the recommendation of my dental hygienist. The product was fine until the batteries died and I found out they could not be replaced. The warranty is only for 2 years (the product's life), so this is a very expensive disposable toothbrush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Nasty Gunk Buildup","review":"I had owned an Oral-B Sonic Complete S-320 that finally was no longer able to charge so I ended up replacing it with the Sonicare Essence. The sonic technology in both toothbrushes is similar so there was no real change in the actual functionality of the toothbrush. I much prefer the sonic vibrating toothbrushes to the Oral-B vitality types that just spin.The one major difference with Sonicare is that the toothbrush heads are much larger and more expensive. Even worse is the fact that the way they screw onto the base unit makes it very easy for water to seep in and for really nasty smelling gunk to build up inside the handle. I've gotten so frustrated with this gunk and with the toothbrush heads unscrewing themselves that I'm going back to order the discontinued Sonic Complete and hoping that it will help me to get that funky smell out of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toothbrush I have owned","review":"Overall I have been very very impressed with this unit. I had one made by another manufacturer in the past and the brush heads were pretty course and rough on my teeth. No good for me. This Sonicare has the most gentle brush heads I have used to date. Really a very quality unit overall. No other major issues to report. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dental Delight","review":"I've had Sonicare toothbrushes for over 12 years and swear by them. I definitely like the new narrow slanted shaft of the brush head as it's easier to reach back teeth especially behind the last molar. I do miss the timer (30 second alerts during 2 minute brushing time) which this model does not have. However, it's well worth purchasing at this price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING! This is a must have","review":"My old Oral-B electric toothbrush gave up after 6 years and I'm glad it did! (I can't complain though... it was loyal)BUT! Sonicare is impressive!You really can't compare it with the Oral-B rotating head. It is very gentile and extremely fast, although the first time you use it you will have to get used to the vibration; the second time you use it, it becomes tolerable after the third time you don't even notice it.Each time you brush it leaves that \\"glossy/squeaky clean\\" feeling.And shipping was impressive, used the 2 day free shipping and got it in 1 day.(not sure what happened there but I won't complain ;-)I do recommend this product if you are looking for a new toothbrush."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As It Gets, I Guess.","review":"I've never had much experience with electric toothbrushes, but my two years with this model has been trouble-free so far. It charges easily and quickly and takes over a week to lose its power. That's with me AND my girlfriend brushing morning and night for two minutes at a time. Not bad, not bad at all. When we go on vacation, we don't even take the charger.It's also handy that the attachments come color-coded. That way we don't use each other's brush. An easy to overlook bit of convenience, I must say. Thanks for that, Sonicare.As long as you keep the bases nice and clean instead of cruddy, you probably won't have much to complain about with this item. I just can't see myself giving it 5 stars without ever having any other electric brush to compare it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy this - holds no charge","review":"This Sonicare worked perfectly for a few weeks, then all of the sudden holds no charge. I did nothing to it. I leave it in the charger all day or night or just for an hour - whatever I do now, it will not even let me brush for a full 2-minute cycle. I get to brush for about 45 seconds, then I finish off with my normal toothbrush now. Terrible value considering that it has a 3-week shelf life. I really wish it just hadn't worked from the get-go, because then I would NOT have thrown away my 5-year old Sonicare, which sadly held a charge for longer (2 minutes) than this \\"new\\" one.TERRIBLE product!!! Save your time and money and get a real one from Bed Bath and Beyond or somewhere like that.Maybe this is an aftermarket product with non-original OEM batteries - that'd be my best guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toothbrush is terrible!","review":"I really don't understand all the good reviews on this toothbrush.

I miss the toothpaste dispenser and the built in timer that beeped every 30 seconds during the 2 minute timed brushing period. I now use my digital watch to mark the 30 second intervals. I should mention that this unit cost about 60% of what I paid for my old unit 4 years ago.I highly recommend this unit for good dental hygiene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This gets my teeth way cleaner than a regular toothbrush,and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth.

Just like the original, it cleans my teeth beautifully, helping my professional cleaning to last longer. I believe that this newer model is better at keeping the water out of the handle's interior which was a problem with the original model. The cost was better at Amazon than I could find anywhere else, although, like gasoline, it seemed to be priced higher each time I looked at it. I paid $20 more for the same unit in January than I would have in December...I guess it was lower then because of Xmas....but that is the season I buy for others, not myself. Bummer.

However, I still had a few spots where my gums got tender or swollen. With the Sonicare, I noticed a difference very quickly and the trouble spots soon disappeared. My family has used Sonicare toothbrushes for years; it's the best preventative device! (Note: I use a manual toothbrush when traveling and after a few days, those trouble spots threaten to reappear. Once home, the Sonicare banishes those spots.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with Oral-B Instead","review":"I've had this toothbrush for a few years, and it has a consistent problem with mold growing in the head piece (they call it a nut). I was told this was a common issue, and they offered to replace the toothbrush, even though it was out of warranty, and then spent three days trying to get out of having to live up to that offer.In short, the toothbrush is basically unusable, unless you like brushing your teeth with a molding, reeking toothbrush head. There's a reason why they now sell a super championship ultraviolet cleaner for $50. Philips customer service is just about as good. My wife has an Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400, and it works like a charm. No mold issues there, and it's a rotary brush just like the dentist uses. I'd recommend avoiding the Sonicare like the plague, unless that's exactly what you want to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bacteria Factory","review":"I've used these for years, and I have no idea why I put up with them. Like other reviewers noted, whatever comes out of your mouth during and after brushing goes into the nice, warm brush mount compartment, where any microbes or organic material begin to grow into a red, grey, or black bioslime. This is a real treat if/when you unscrew the brush mount and take a look inside. Barf.I switched to an Oral-B Vitality for about $20, and I'm happy as hell.

It alerts you after running for 2 minutes. Other more expensive toothbrushes tend to micromanage you by, for instance, beeping 4 times allowing you to work equal time on the 4 quarters of your mouth. This seems like overkill and costs more $$$.This is an excellant product and does a great job. The brushes need replacement within 6 months as with any tooth brush, and they are expensive. It seems like a waste to throw a working device away when only the brush could be replaced.

So, yay, it's obviously effective.On the other hand, this is clearly the \\"basic\\" model because dang, it's ridiculous to sell a product that grows scads of mold in it pretty much instantly. I don't want to clean that gunk out of something I put in my MOUTH, you guys!I guess it had the desired effect though because I'm totally convinced of the goodness of the Sonicare concept and when this one inevitably breaks, I'll probably pony up for the fancier one in hopes that I won't have to clean it out as often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up the ghost after 4 weeks","review":"After only four weeks or so, this Philips toothbrush started to randomly stop in the middle of the tooth brushing.

I have carpal tunnel, and it was really aggravated by this brush.My husband, who has very strong hands, tried it.

I switched over to oral-b and have been very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonicare performance severely decreased in newer model","review":"I am so disappointed that Philips decided to cut corners in the production of new models of the Sonicare. I owned one for a few years a long time ago and it worked great - I could charge it fully, take it on vacation, and not worry about having to charge it or clean it on my trip. I lost that one but was excited to receive a new one for my wedding. 8 months later, the battery barely lasts one toothbrushing session. My husband and I were sharing the base and using different heads, but now we can't both brush our teeth without charging it in between! Also, despite removing and air-drying the heads after every use as recommended, some really gross gunk builds up inside the head that is nearly impossible to get out. Ick. When this one dies for good I'm definitely going to try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic toothbrush","review":"I'm not happy. I have used Sonicare toothbrushes ever since they were invented. At first there was only one model. When it wore out after many years I replaced it with a one just like it. When the company was sold to Phillips they started making several different models. When I recently had to replace my second one(after many years) I still bought the basic, most economical model. I have no hopes that my new one will last 1/2 as long as the old ones. Every time I use it it has leaked water into the brush handle and I have to dump it out.

No matter what I've tried, I cannot get it to work more than maybe 30 seconds without needing to be recharged again. During the few seconds it runs, it's great.

Well, the Oral-B is a far superior design. This one rattles when I use it, and the silicon sleeves are necessary.Yes, the end result of very clean teeth is the same as the Oral-B, and the price of this unit is less expensive, but I'd have to say that I'd rather spend more money on the Oral-B to begin with than deal with all the annoyances of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee stain has gone","review":"yes, this product let my boyfriend's teeth get brighter, obviously.

The newer FlexCare models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime.

But I can compare it to a regular toothbrush....and it totally blows away regular toothbrushes. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my teeth are noticeably whiter, and they feel smooth just like when a dentist cleans them. The vibration from this brush takes a little getting used to. The nice feature about this model is that it slowly increases the speed over the first 6 or 7 times that you use it to let you adjust to the vibration. Now that I've been using it for a while I don't even notice the vibration anymore. If you want cleaner teeth and less visits to the dentist I highly recommend this brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"overall, this is my 2nd sonicare, and overall i'd say its a fine, excellent product.a couple of notes:1. the brushheads that come standard with this package are very stiff.

That being said, as soon as I became comfortable with the brush, the vibration seemed to be less and less.

It leaves your whole mouth refreshed and it's true it feels like you've had your teeth cleaned at the dentist everyday. It's a totally different kind of clean. You just have to try it to understand.

Lol.The handle fits well in the hand; the brush(es) are easily interchangeable and screw on tightly. It charges quickly. We usually store the handle on the charger, so I can't say too much about the battery life, though it has lasted well over 2 days for us. I've even noticed that, with daily use, the brush seems to remove the slight plaque build-up you can sometimes get inbetween dentist visits.As others have said, the vibrations take a little getting used to, and you've got to be careful to keep your lips closed (otherwise you'll spend a lot of time cleaning the sink and counter and cabinet and mirror.) But after a very short amount of time you'll be wondering how you thought your teeth were clean with using a brush. I tell you, that polished feeling is addictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Oral B","review":"I was an Oral B user for over a decade until I had trouble finding replacement heads. I purchased another Oral B - this time the Cross Action (budget-friendly) but the unit burned out in less than 6 months.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've had Sonicare electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years. The Elite model was my favorite, but it failed prematurely due to a problematic on/off switch (rubber covering failed). The first time, it failed under warranty, but the second failure wasn't covered (they'll only replace it once). Based on feedback from a Sonicare customer service rep, I recently replaced it with the more basic Sonicare Essence e5500 model; but it was big, clunky and noisy, so I returned it. Instead I purchased an Oral B, which I love; very happy I made the switch. The quality of Sonicare products seems to have slipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips Sonicare Toothbrush Essence e5500","review":"My disappointment is that it's not built nearly as well as my older model and probably won't last as long; seems cheap by comparison. Also, no matter how well you wipe it after use, it still leaks water from the joint of the holder and the brush head. This transfers to the charger. Small point perhaps, but sloppy. As with my older model, the inside cavity must be cleaned I'd judge weekly. My older brush from Philips did not leak though. I'm thinking of returning the e5500 toothbrush and buying my older model again.That said, it does a decent job of brushing and the angled brush head is convenient. My older model also did a decent job of brushing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have used this product for about a month. It is wonderful!

The toothbrush is smaller too and I don't like that as well. Doesn't feel like it's getting in all the cracks and crevices. Just not the quality I have come to expect. Other bummer is that it is a different charging unit from my husband's.....why not make them uniform???? I guess that's too much to expect.UPDATE 8/11. This unit DIED this month. That's LESS THAN A YEAR! Do NOT buy this model. I asked my dentist what the best method for brushing my teeth and he still said Sonicare, so I have purchased another model. If this one does not serve me well, I will switch brands.

I love the 4 - 30 second timers...one for each quadrant. I was disappointed that the base was not solid. The base/handle is constructed of two pieces.This is unlike my original which was a solid base/handle. There is more dripping with this 5500 type of base/handle. I was wondering what the reason is. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic + Good","review":"This is my favorite Sonicare toothbrush. It is simple, effective and a Sonicare. What more can I say. The Sonicare toothbrush alone has prevented all cavities since I started using one. I used to have 1-2 cavities per year before my dentist suggested I invest in a Sonicare.I prefer this model to the other fancier models I have owned in the past. It just seems beefier and made to last . Sometimes less is more. And the power on this model is just as good as the more expensive ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couple of issues","review":"This is my third sonicare, so I obviously like this product overall and how it performs. The one thing I don't care for on this model is that the handle is a bit too thick, in that it feels large in my hand (and I'm a 5'8\\" woman), so if you're smaller than me, it might seem uncomfortably large for you, too. I believe one of their other models has a more streamlined handle.The other thing is that you need to be careful about how you push the little round rubber on/off disc. DO NOT USE YOUR NAIL IN ANY WAY. The only reason we had to buy a new one was that the button got wrecked and pushed into the handle so that we couldn't access it anymore. Mind you, this took about a year and a half or more to happen, but if it had been a better design it wouldn't have happened at all. If you're careful to use just the soft part of your finger you should be okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"at the dentist?","review":"I bought a Philips Sonicare, just because it's a Philips. I have many good products bought in the past from Philips. I never expected this brush to be this good. In the beginning it feels a bit strange, because of the speed and sound of this brush. It also feels as if the dentist is working on your teeth... not pleasant. After a couple of times the unpleasant feeling turns into a pleasant feeling (have to get used to it). Then you can see your teeth to begin to whiten. So no expensive whitener needed, just good toothpaste should do the trick with this brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I got the album the first day it came out and must say I am very dissapointed.

I will admit upon first listen, this release had to grow on me and it has! The more I listened the more I enjoyed it, even to the point where I got my hands on the Japanese version for the extra tracks. I actually dig the addition of some more melody while the groove and drop d slam we all know and love still takes out your knee like it always did. I find I enjoy Monochrome even more so for more of a return to roots so to speak but I enjoy size matters in a different way. I can hardly wait for the next release which is rumored to be slated for next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"When I first heard that a new Helmet album was coming out with new personnel, I was less than thrilled. Eventually though, I decided that maybe I should give it a chance. I'm glad I did. The album was superbly recorded and produced; Page's voice has never sounded better. There aren't as many odd time signatures as the days of old, but there's still plenty of syncopation and start-stop riffing to keep things sounding like Helmet. I am a big fan of the old drummer, John Stanier, so I'm particularly scrutinizing of the new drummer, John Tempesta. Tempesta's drumming is more conventional than Stanier's quirkiness, but ultimately it's a minor concern. I'm lamenting that the old members don't get along, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the new album quite a bit. Don't let it stop you, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the old Helmet","review":"IMO the old Helmet was simply amazing. The new Size Matters CD is NOT old Helmet. I was suprised to find that it was Page singing because it doesn't sound at all like him. Although some songs hold similar sounds as the old Helmet albums, it's still lacks Helmet's old edge. It's just too mainstream, normal stuff you hear on the radio. So I would suggest if you want the same old Helmet you don't get this album or you'll have a nice looking coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"In case some of you skeptics havent noticed.. if you go back and flip through all your CD books in every Helmet record (if you even posess them all), Helmet has pretty much ALWAYS had a change in their lineup each record. Except for Page himself. Stainer was with him the longest. Yet every one of Helmets previous releases all recieved excellent ratings. So why does the change in two band members from the last record in 1997 seem to be such a big deal for this one? Basically, if Helmet is anyone, IT'S PAGE HAMILTON. I picked up this CD with such anticipation, and I'm pretty darn happy with it! It sounds like Helmet to me. Yeah, Page's vocal style is a little different, but he's always seem to sing in a few different tones of voice from one song to the next. That was part of Helmet's style. Helmet rocks, and will continue to be one of the most important heavy bands around. And I thank Page for putting forth such effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"new helmet","review":"ok first of all the first second and third time i listened to this album i was dissapointed but this grows on you i cant really say its as good as old helmet its different but still a good release.

The choruses don't match the uninspired and just plain boring riffs in the rest of the song, the bass drum is non-existent, Page's voice sounds like some Moose is trying to give birth. A song like Last Breath should be aggressive and have some spark to it, but it just kind of lays flat like a wet tortilla! I was planning on seeing them in November 2004, but I think I will save my money for some other show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it. This is NOT Helmet","review":"Page Hamilton solo album is more like it using the Helmet name to sell a few extra copies. I have loved Helmet for years and am sad to say that this release is horrible.

One of the most disappointing releases that I have ever heard from a band that I used to worship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed in \\"Helmet\\"","review":"I bought this CD thinking it would be good. I have taught myself to not expect too much after the disappointing Slipknot \\"Duality\\" and the newest disappointment Dillinger Escape Plan's \\"Miss Machine\\". Don't get me wrong, they all have some good tracks on them, but overall, they do not live up to past successes. \\"Helmet\\" is now included in that group. I use quotations because this CD sounds as much like a Helmet CD as any other pop CD. Page Hamilton's vocals are atrocious in some areas and the overall technical quality of the music is far below the members' abilities that I have to conclude that they are just trying to cash in on the Helmet name. Use another name for this crap! I am a huge Helmet fan and to be able to enjoy any of their other music again, I will have to make myself forget this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isnt Helmet...","review":"It says Helmet on the cover, but Its far from the Helmet Ive grown up with... the new rythymn section DOESN'T sound like the old one, Page voice doesn't sound like Page (listen and you'll know what I mean), and what's up with these STUPID NU-METAL CHORUSES?! Yes, I know that some bands change, but this is just an entirely diffrent band, it should just be released as a Page Hamilton solo album, it is definately NOT worthy of the Helmet name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God they are back!","review":"I was wondering when a great band like this would return, Thank god for Page. I thought I was doomed to listen to more of crap from some New band trying to be Heavy, but thank god for Page.Although the Album is mellow, the sound that made Helmet Great is still there. Probably wont hear any of these songs on the radio (at least where I am), but it is a good thing that Helmet is back to teach the little punks for Linkin Park, Slipknot, and other crap bands that Helmet is and always will be the best Rock/Metal bands that ever existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull boring dull","review":"I don't know what Helmet was like back in the day but this music says nothing really, is not very catchy or compelling in any way.....try their early stuff maybe or Faith No More.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Page Hamilton solo project","review":"I'll be brief about this. It is not a great album. The production and vocals sound very pro-tooly. Aside from that the songs are pretty bland. I think Page has long lost his edge. Helmet was a great band who were unique and recorded some cut rate material. The 2004 Helmet just didn't do it for me. I did give this album a chance too. I downloaded it back in July gave it many a spin. It never gelled. Bottom line, this cd is very annoying and does not provide a worthwhile listening experience.Instead of buying this, pick some fresh music ala Dillinger Escape Plan or Between the Buried and Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I liked old Helmet, but I wouldn't consider myself a huge fan. I have the CDs, and I enjoy them, but I rarely listen to them. However, since there is so little worth listening to these days, I was excited to hear about a new Helmet CD. The first song made me glad that I had picked up the CD. However, after that it was all downhill. It is just too mellow. I don't expect them to make the same type of music they did a decade ago, but I do expect them to still have some balls. The music is so generic. I couldn't tell when one boring song ends and the next boring song began. When I want mellow, I listen to other types of music besides heavy rock. I don't want to hear hard rock bands doing mellow any more than I want to hear Aimee Mann doing Slayer songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Helmet","review":"I love Helmet but this is not Helmet. I was looking so foward to the day that Helmet would finally put another album out and this was such a huge disappointment. Page tries to sing, much like James Hetfield of the now much watered down Metallica, and fails miserably like Hetfield. Since the rest of the original members aren't back I am not even sure why Page is calling the band Helmet. The anger and aggression of their previous efforts are soarly missed like the rest of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank the gods they have returned","review":"Been a long time since I've seen something come from the great mind of Paige Hamilton. Since Helmet's release of Aftertaste back in 97 I myself have been left wallowing in the days of such genius. Well, 7 years and 2 new band members later, Helmet hath returned - and it's like they never left. This album has much of what die hard fans have come to appreciate and a whole new world for the newcomer as well. The ever present perfection of an almost march like beat in songs like See You Dead bring back the good ol' days of the band. The opening song Smart pretty much sums up the albums pace and almost every track keeps the listener wanting more. With great enthusiasm I have kept the CD in my truck playing since I got it on it's release date. For those out there who like bands like tool and Chevelle, I highly recommend this album and all of Helmet's contributions to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Helmet","review":"After about 7 since the last Helmet release (Aftertaste), Page Hamilton returns with a new ensemble of musicians and music. \\"Size Matters\\" is surprisingly different than any of the previous releases from Helmet. This album finds Page using more melodic choruses which mixed with angelic harmonies (which is a new platform for the band). Some of the tracks have a radio feel such as \\"Surgery\\" and \\"Speak and Spell.\\" Other tracks such as \\"Smart,\\" \\"Crashing Foreign Cars\\" and \\"Last Breath\\" are back to the angry guitar riff driven classics of the Meantime/Strap it on era.If you're a Helmet fan, \\"Size Matters\\" should quench that thirst brought on from the bands 7 year drought.

It's catchy, upbeat and encourages positive traits without talking down to the audience or hitting them over the head with the message (with the exception of \\"It's not My Fault\\" is a musical send-off of excuses that was designed to be over the top). The innocence of the album can be heard in the song \\"I think You're Beautiful\\" in which a grown man is singing a duet with a little girl to bolster her appreciation for her appearance. try getting something like that filmed today in the hyper-paranoid new millenium!

Kaypro introduced the first successful hard-disk portable, the Kaypro 10. They also introduced the world's first true laptop, the Kaypro 2000. Not even to mention the original Kaypro 2, one of the very first successful portables, which was so successful that it helped put Osborne out of business! Also not to mention that Kaypro introduced the very first IBM PC/AT (286) clone, at a fraction of the cost of the IBM. If these facts don't qualify them as a significant pioneer computer company, I don't know what does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pictures, lacks text","review":"\\"Digital retro\\" is a very good book of pictures printed in very good paper. It contains lots of high-quality photos of lots of computers, and everything is cleanly arranged. The author has chosen the most significant computers, and I have to say he has done a good work.That said, I find a great lack of text. For each computer or company, you will only find three or four facts, which is scarce information for not-so-cheap book. You will find a lot more information in Freiberger & Swaine's \\"Fire in the Valley: The Making-Of of the Personal Computer\\".This book definitely remembers me of Christian Wurster's \\"Computers: An Illustrated History\\" (Taschen), Michael Nadeau's \\"Collectible Microcomputers\\" (Schiffer) or (the Sinclair-centric) Enrico Tedeschi's \\"Sinclair Archeology\\" (Hover).I would recommend you to buy \\"Digital retro\\", \\"Colletible Microcomputers\\" or \\"Computers: An Illustrated History\\" and \\"Fire in the Valley\\", and read both side-by-side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures, worthless text","review":"It's riddled with errors and shows every sign of having been copied from websites or other sources that were not authoritative themselves. All sorts of rumors mixed in with fact, and no effort to distinguish between them. Also, curiously, though the book contains lovely photographs of all the machines it discusses, Laing never shows any of them turned on or running software. A missed chance, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostaglic look back at early days of PC industry","review":"Take a visual stroll through the early days of personal computing, from 1975's seminal MITS Altair to 1988's failed NeXT cube, before the market bifurcated between Mac and Windows users. This 192-page paperback examines 40 classic computers of yesteryear, each depicted from all sides with full-color photography and annotated with original specifications and pricing. Laing's text also reveals many juicy tidbits about the companies and personalities that dominated the industry in its infancy. Given the author's British background, the coverage of many obscure models from the UK is to be expected, though they may not be appreciated by American audiences. I found the inclusion of video game systems a curious choice, too. My only major criticism is that the text accompanying the spendid photos is unnecessarily small and difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Master Teacher","review":"Frank Gambale is not only an excellent teacher but is also a touring and playing musician. His style of teaching is precise, balanced, and very thorough. When I first started using this of course it was slow going, but just as he taught, it became natural and effortless once I caught on. It is full of gems of new ideas and arenas I had never known existed in the world of guitar playing. It stretched my knowledge and playing ability to a new level I had not even considered before. It doesn't matter what style guitar you play this will be an additon into your minds encyclopedia of guitar knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whazzup with these player haters?","review":"The previous reviews appear to be from people with some serious jealousy issues. Look, for those seriously looking to up their game, here is the one reason every guitar player should own this video ... Gambale's sweep picking style.I first became aware of his amazing technique when his video was playing in a Sam Ash store. I pay attention to the picking technique of players because mine needs work. So, I am watching this guy play and I realize ... he is laying down these ripping fast runs, yet his wrist, forearm, and pick seem to almost never move. As I continued to watch, I realized just how inefficient most players are when it comes to our picking technique.Who cares about his weird hair style! The man can play. Just ask Chick Corea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Worthless","review":"I find this video to be pretty much useless. The arpeggio section is pretty much a waste of time, since he plays the same arpeggio but in different positions over and over. He doesn't offer much in terms of licks, mainly just how to move up and down scales\\\\arpeggios using his approach. You do get to see him play live, which is a treat because he is so fluid. The last lick pretty much sums up the whole video, I would not even bother with the rest. So I would recommend staying away from this and maybe just finding some licks on the net."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK video, but guy looks like a women in Mel Gibsons body","review":"he's a good player, but hes one of the ugliest people ive ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Fast, Die Young","review":"I picked up this book as I thought the title was great. This novel about a drug crazed killer driving through America, was the first Stewart O'nan that I have read and I really enjoyed it.

As a first person narrative, it's being VERY clever - well worth the read.The book's narrator, one member of a trio of robbers who went on a killing spree, is dictating a list of answers to questions about her crime. O'Nan takes some big risks with the character and (mostly) manages to pull them off - especially the character's attempts at deceiving her future biographer as well as also deceiving herself. There are a few gaps in credibility in the book - the number of women on death row, the husband's fixation with 70's punk and garage rock. However, it all seems to fit, especially the rhythm of the narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I picked up this book because I had read \\"The Names of the Dead\\" and found it a very affecting work about the Viet Nam war, a topic of too few good novels. This one is just not up to the same standard. Karla Faye Tucker meets Stephen King... it's like the TV movies that come out within a week of some sensational tabloid crime. I was not lead to care very much about Marjorie, or anyone else in this book. Nor was I lead to understand her. If, as she says, she accepted Jesus into her life, I am hard put to see how. This book is a gripping page-turner, but definitely \\"summer reading\\".

This is a book for children and teens, and adults who enjoy light-hearted children's stories; it is not for adult reading groups! It was so enjoyable we couldn't put it down, and read it in 7 1/2 hours. We enjoyed it so much more than Tom's Midnight Garden. We are looking forward to reading more books by this author.We homeschool, and this book helped recreate the civil war in a more personal manner. But it is not a sad book. It also isn't all about the civil war - in fact, that is only a small portion of the book. It is a slice of life, from two different time periods - 1866 and, since the book was written 1981, the second time period would probably be the 1970's. The ending is neither disappointing nor sad.

Instead it is more like a work out video to stay in shape. This is not for a beginner guitarist make no mistake. It covers exercises that you can apply to get better at endurance and dexterity, but you need to understand that it's a work out video designed to keep your chops in shape. If you don't already have the chops then this is not the video you want.

The video is clear and crisp and perhaps the best part of the \\"movie\\" is scenes of NYC and LA. Why this guy thought Hockney would be impressed with his art is hard to understand, just about everything that Hockney has done in the last 60 years is the anthesis of Pappa's \\"8\\" years of drawing a pencil portrait of Marilyn Monroe. The film deals a lot with the support and love his parents gives him while he continues his delusions, sound familiar?

I will pass on amaranth flour next time though as I could even taste the amaranth flour in my flour mixes. It had a strong flavor and smell, one that I couldn't get past, so I threw it out.

Yet, it was highly recommended that I ignore the deceptive cover art and watch this particular film. And, I must say that I was not disappointed in the least. The whole product was excellent. The cast, their acting abilities, the story, the realistic quslity of the effects, etc. Wonderful film. Now, I highly recommend that you watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gritty psychological movie","review":"Some people like the gritty feel of movies that are more along the lines of normal life. This movie, through what I'd heard, was a vampire movie. Not so. What it is is a movie representing a psychiatrist who receives as a patient a mortal girl, not a vampire, who enjoys drinking blood, and shows his attempts to treat said girl. It is complicated by improper doctor-patient relationship with the girl's mother, and has a disturbing ending that keeps you thinking, if you can get that far, but it has too much of the feel of normality for my taste. Not a bad movie if you like that sort, as this is something that could easily happen in the real world. I much prefer the more fantastical styles rather than psychiatric for my \\"vampire\\" movies. Again, there are no vampires in this movie, just a girl with vampiric tendencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of REAL Country","review":"Ah yes, Keith Whitley. He was and is the best.

By the music alone, you would never know that they are a christian rock (hip-hop back then) band. Listening to some of the lyrics you would probably catch on, but this album absolutely rocks if you are a rock/hip-hop/rap fan. Some of their songs have kind of a \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" sound, but you would be surprised how well the singing is on the other songs.

So the key ingredient in a successful translation of this story is how well it is presented. Unfortunately, this made for TV production is so methodically dull, no suspense can be generated, and the final scenes become unintentionally hilarious. Directed with little imagination by NIGHT GALLERY stalwart Jeannot Szwarc, MURDERS offers us George C. Scott in a painfully inept performance as the disgraced detective; a young Val Kilmer strutting his stuff in a completely useless role; and Rebecca DeMornay as Scott's level-headed and spirited daughter. Emmy winner Ian McShane (Deadwood) plays Scott's nemesis, the precept responsible for Scott's disgraceful banishment from the force.

Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my...","review":"I'm not sure how to describe something this horrible. I usually can't stand to not finish a book, but this was one that definately didn't get finished. The two stories I managed to read were cheesy and the characters pathetically desperate. At the end of both the authors suddenly tried to convince us that the pairs were heavenly matched and wanted to marry, but it rang hollow to my ears. I would have been satisfied, and it would have made for much better stories, if they just ended up in a serious relationship - marriage did NOT need to be mentioned.So I guess my final says is - unless you find it for free on a trade book shelf and you like reading sappy novels with bad follow-through and dialog that makes you groan in misery, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I was brought to this book through Steven Brust's Taltos series, thinking they were good; how about this? Cowboy Feng impressed me even more, and I began to see that Mr. Brust not only knows how to build suspense and weave a tight plot, but infuse a story with insight into human nature and relationships. It's sci-fi and it's good sci-fi, but it's the emotional rollercoaster that makes it worth the ride. Add to that great descriptive writing, dialogue, and plotting that doesn't show you what's coming, only makes you want to get there (but not in a hurry)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Need a Drink","review":"As it turns out, this book has a somewhat-interesting plot involving time travel and the deliberate destruction of Earth and other human-inhabited planets.However, I doubt many readers will make it through the first hundred or so pages where nothing happens. Well, the characters hang out in the bar and grill, drink, smoke, play Irish music, and obsess about their love lives. The dour first person narration by \\"Billy\\" does nothing to develop the characters; they are just a list of names and whiskey preferences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"Brust is a master fantasist. In that realm, he is without compare. His work often evokes the sense of awe and whimsy that the best of Zelazny's work does without any overlap in style. Brust is truly a great author.But it doesn't seem that his talents extend to science fiction. I'm really not sure why, but it's true. Every SF short story of his that I've read has fallen on its face and this novel... oh my, this novel... is simply not very good. I wanted to like it, and I tried to like it, but to no avail. Whatever it is within Brust's talents that allow him to give so much life to his fantasies seems to be completely lacking from this work.The only reason I can think of for wanting this book would be if you simply *had* to have a complete collection of Brust's works. Otherwise, I'd recommend passing on it. It's Brust, but it ain't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grr","review":"It took every ounce of effort to finish this one.

The big deal is that it's one piece, has clip leads to connect to the phone line and a polarity LED. It costs $85. If you can deal with slight inconvenience you can buy a standard slimline phone for under $10 (right here on Amazon) and solder on test clips to the phone's input line. If you're even more technically savvy, you can solder an LED and resistor to get the polarity feature. So for about $15 you have the same diagnostic capability.

The novel is a wonderful combination of suspense and heart; Alice Tuckfield's journey in discovering who she is and where she belongs as well as all the people she encounters along the way will appeal to all readers of all ages.

Luckily, she stumbles onto some boys who sing in the cathederal choir. Communal life suits hiding her among them- even the choirmaster doesn't notice her for a week. But Alice overhears conversations and knows that her father's murderers are connected to the catherderal.

I read this book aloud to my 13 year old daughter as part of our homeschool curriculum and both of our general impressions of this book were similarly negative to the point that we were glad to reach the last page and be done with it. We both found the book to be poorly written, the plot to be extremely predictable, the character development to be lacking, the dialog of the characters and the plot line to be unrealistic,the character motivations to be unclear and the historical inaccuracies to be glaring. The plot was clearly contrived from the very beginning to the end. At the final page we were relieved to be through but frustrated that we wasted our time and confused as to all the loose ends left by the author. I certainly would not personally recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book's great, but BE WARNED: new cover!","review":"A deliciously engrossing and charming tale set in ye olde England.

I highly recommend this book to other readers, and if you get a chance to read it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of historical inaccuracies","review":"A Murder for Her Majesty is exciting but completely unreliable as a historical novel. It is full of major and minor anachronisms: the choir sings carols that weren't written till the 19th century; York Minster uses an order of service appropriate to late 20th century American Episcopal churches but totally inaccurate for Elizabethan ritual; the political organization of the church (\\"the Queen could not appoint bishops herself\\") is completely backwards--bishops WERE, in fact, appointed by the Queen--Alice is portrayed as eating a potato and drinking tea, both of which were not in the English diet till 100 or more years later; there are house numbers (a 19th century invention) and on and on and on. It's outrageous not only that the author's own research was so sloppy but that nobody anywhere along the editorial process caught any of this. What's the use of a historical novel if the history it teaches is so utterly inaccurate?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid image of the past, \\"A Murder for her Majesty\\"","review":"Ms. Hilgarter paints a beautiful image of the Elizabethan period in her book, \\"A Murder for her Majesty\\" while maintaining the fictional aspect of the events that occur with the characters.

Also, there is a lot of waste if you don't reuse the extra putty that sticks on the wall around the hole. And there is A LOT! So if you don't want all that extra putty to go to waste then you have to take the putty off the towel used to wipe the wall after application and stick it back on the applicator. Your fingertips will be white. It washes right off though. Those are the only two bad things about Erase-A-Hole that I came across.

The characters and the plot are awful, with a totally predictable ending. I had to force myself to finish it because I could tell exactly what was going to happen, and I complained to my fiance about how bad it was while reading the last 100 pages.But then I decided the book was almost so bad that it was good - to laugh at!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz's Cold Fire","review":"Only a mad man is dead certain of his sanity.

I am a pretty big fan of his, but I didn't think this book compared to his others. It wasn't a terrible book, and I don't regret reading it. I just wouldn't recommend it, when Dean Koontz has written so many books that are a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful but slows down the pace.....","review":"The beginning of this book had me hooked. Why would a virtual stranger fly all across the world to save people. The beginning helps solve only a portion of that question and towards the end it lags with a dreary back story and lots of slow paced non-action. The \\"love\\" story intertwined in this was a bit off in my book but hey - i had to give it 4 stars for trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great book from great writer","review":"First of all, I have to say that it's not one of my favorite books. But it doesn't mean the book is bad either. I would describe it as: suspenseful, gripping and dynamic. If you read his \\"Lightning\\" and \\"Watchers\\" you're gonna love this one too.I didn't quite like the end of the story, maybe because I expected something more extraordinary but let me tell you one thing: if you read this book without deep thinking of what's going to happen in the end, you won't be disappointed.So, my opinion; 4* out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The review of Cold Fire","review":"This book was a very good book. I liked it a lot because this man had a power to rescue people before they would die. He saved so many people lives, and there was this lady that was looking to find him to find out how he new when people were about to die.I would recommend reading this book because it was very intense and there was good details in this book. This man goes to a lot of places to save lives and i like this book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Koontz's best efforts","review":"This book gets off to a great start but after the first 150 pages the plot dwindles down to something less than expected from the imagination of Mr. Koontz. I was disappointed with the book's last chapters: they seemed like something from another author and lacked substance. I found myself not really caring about the main characters by the end. I'm glad this wasn't my first Koontz, or it may have been my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yessir, I Like It","review":"This is the first Koontz novel I've read, and I definately want to read his others. This story mixes different genres. It's a horror novel, a mystery, a thriller, and a drama. The first half, I thought, was more exciting than the second, but by the end, you realize it's a story about human condition and what it takes to heal old wounds. I didn't think the ending was far out there, like someone on this board said. It makes perfect sense. I'm glad I read this, and I think you will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best, But Definitely Worth the Money","review":"This was the first time I was introduced to Dean R. Koontz. Although it is not the book that hooked me (see Watchers) it is a wonderful suspense novel. This has what has always intrigued me about his work, a mystery so complex that you will not get it until the end, no matter how hard you try. The characters are very interesting, although not as developed as his later characters are. The story line is extremely well thought out and the psychological aspect of the thriller is very interesting. Definitely a great page turner and you will love every minute of your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE?","review":"THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOOK WAS GREAT, THE AUTHOR MUST HAVE RAN OUT OF IDEAS AROUND PG 200 BECAUSE IT JUST GETS REALLY WEIRD.

While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him. This is not the case with this book. \\"Cold Fire\\" is absolutely horrible. I so regret purchasing this book. It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.Just on a side note, \\"The Bad Place\\" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already forgotten","review":"Another forgotten and not-exciting item in Koontz range. I had read it when I still had the hope that Koontz would be a real writer but this was the last attempt and I left him in the prcoss.I don't remember it much except that as usual there was a man and there was a woman and they met somewhere and tried to save something against something which is not memorable in the least. The same summary is applicable to: Watchers, Srangers, Dark Rivers of the Heart, House of Thunder, By the Light of the Moon..pufff.I don't remember this meaty thing and is there anyone? It is forgotten long time ago though it was published recently. Pity for trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky weirdness","review":"My first foray into Koontz novels and I was happily surprised. Well paced, creepy, and just plain weird. In Koontz's hands, a windmill becomes the setting for chills of a psyche-nature. Refreshingly, the source of Ironheart's special power is not the expected one(s). A terrifying flashback involving a fastfood joint will stay with you a while, as will the Dutch-style windmill. Is it just a case of fearing fear itself? Read Cold Fire and find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"In parts excellent and in most other parts overly descriptive and over explained. I've read loads of Mr. Koontz'z books in the past and most of them have been excellent. This one I think often talks down to the reader and explains things over and over which have already been hinted at and should be left for the reader to work out.The book could have been written in half the pages and would have been the better for it.It's not all bad and I loved some of the writing as always but put together as a whole this one didn't really do it for me. It's a real shame because I have always been a big fan and I had looked forward to it.I would still recommend that people try his other books. I can't remember them all but I know that I enjoyed \\"Whispers\\" and a few others were also riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This time, Koontz tries too hard but fails.","review":"You can usually count on Koontz to deliver a suspenseful novel with well written, three dimensional characters. But in \\"Cold Fire\\" the suspense is lacking. There are some pretty spectacular sequences but they're not integreted into the story in a way that makes them suspenseful.Koontz creates characters with depth, that are psychologically believable, and this is one of the things that sets him apart from many other suspense novelists and is one of the things I used to like him for. But this time, he's taking it way too far, and combines it with some supernatural elements that never feels believable.\\"Cold Fire\\" is a disappointment pretty much from the beginning. It feels like Koontz tried too hard on the psychological part and forgot the suspense. And to add insult to injury it ends up in an anticlimax that feels like a half hearted attempt to copy Stephen King's \\"The Dark Half\\". Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Seriously. This book wasn't that good at all. I'm a new fan to Dean Koontz and I've read about five of his books...and this one just didn't make sense. The beginning started off great, but when you finally find out why Ironheart has his gift...it'll leave yourself saying \\"huh?\\"If you want a good Koontz book, try Odd Thomas, Phantoms or Watchers. Put this one back on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing to say the least.","review":"\\"Cold Fire\\" is the first Koontz novel I read. Since then, I've read most of his publishings.The storyline starts off with a life being saved. That was enough for me. I never had to try to elaborate the scenes on my own. While reading it, I saw the scenes playing before my eyes.The airplane crash scene is one of the best scenes in the book.If you like hearing about preternatural powers that seemingly come from nowhere, but like happy endings and explicit love scenes, you WILL like \\"Cold Fire\\". Fire hotter than the flames of Tartarus burn me every time I read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectatins","review":"I don't usually read Koontz because the stories are usually too gross. Although it has been many years since I read it, I absolutely loved Watchers.Cold Fire is inferior. It is a 382 page book that could have and SHOULD have been edited to a 182 page novella. It killed some beach time for me, but I'm glad I paid $2.00 for it at the used section at the local library.You can find much better reads than this....like ANYTHING by Ken Follett....or watchers.Sorry Dean, I'm a OC guy too and I enjoy reading about the local settings, but this one doesn't do you justice...but I see it WAS written in 1991..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book's first half will keep you up, the second half may put you to sleep.

I don't recommend for a first DK book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dean's best.","review":"Most of Koontz's books carry you right along to the end and are enjoyable, but some derail and go in directions that are not as interesting as others. I found this book to be that way and despite the 4 star review, was rather bored with it once it got away from Ironheart's rescues. I'd recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Bad Book","review":"First let me start off by saying I love Dean Koontz books and I have read most all of them but I was very disapointed with this one. It was very boring and had a horrible ending. Worst Dean Koontz book ever. Go buy Strangers of Watchers if you want a good book that won't leave you disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a confusing, twisted--what's going on?!","review":"This is the second Koontz novel that i read. When I read the dust jacket, the plot sounded interesting, but there were some scenes that were just too confusing! There were some suspenseful moments, but the explanations took me nowhere, and it was hard for me to pinpoint the climax. Around the beginning of the book, Koontz used too many \\"50-cent\\" words, and I pictured the scenery as bland. Let's not make this into a movie. So far, I have read 2 Koontz novels, but I'm not stopping there. I just can hope and pray that my likes outnumber my loathes. Deano, I have new views about you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold, no fire.","review":"The writing is Dean Koontz. The classic 'protagonist with troubled past' is Koontz too. But the rest of it is blah.First of all, the characters' names. Only Dickens has been able to successfully give characters names that described their personalities. Thorne & Ironheart sound like a Harlequin fantasy. Second, the lack of a good antagonist. Koontz may have been trying to get away from Phantoms, Watchers, Midnight, etc. but this is a sad attempt to make us scared. The big secret of the book is a letdown worse than a bungee cord breaking. Ultimately, there's the happy ending where the bad part of the hero is exorcised and there's only good ol' Jim riding off into the sunset with his adoring sidekick (who's as interesting as Saran Wrap). As far as I'm concerned, Cold Fire lacks Intensity, and is a Bad Place."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh* So Koontz Does Sell Out Every Now And Then","review":"I've read a small handful of Koontz Novels. While some grabbed me and were great, some--like this one--struck me as nothing more than a poorly executed comercial effort to sell by the name of the author; and the name of the author is about all this book has going for it.Several reviewers felt that the book started out great and got bad. I am more under the impression that the books beginning was truly awful, and improved slightly by the end; either way, the effect is an awful book that is only vaguely interesting for half of it's extent. If you really want to give Koontz a fair read, go for Intensity or The Eyes of Darkness, and leave this one on the bookshelf. I am dissapointed in the author for even allowing this to be published under his real name--he should have left it to one of his extensive pseudonyms of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very smooth, friendly read.","review":"From the very start this book rip-roared right into the action, with Ironheart stammering the words, \\"Life Line,\\" while grocery shopping, which, of course, is the signal for a rescue. Throughout, we get to see clear into the past and present lives of Ironheart and his admiring journalist Holly Thorne. We get an understanding of why his life has suddenly been driven to it's current string of events -that have ultimately changed his life forever.While surely not one of Koontz best books, the novel breathes much fire. It's filled with suspense that keeps you turning the pages with haste, and then, reluctantly putting the book down, which helps to make this book a fast read.Rightfully the book delivers, and is clearly worth the price. This, despite the somewhat stale ending which seems to discredit everything else that happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story but like Hideaway nothing impressive.","review":"Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion. Not much there. Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection. Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books. I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works. I don't own much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place. I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it!","review":"When I started this book, it was pretty good. The storyline was reminescent of Early Edition, where the main character knew of upcoming bad events and people to save and I enjoyed reading it. After the part with the plane, the book started to falter, and by the time the main characters went to the Windmill (sorry to be so specific, but I don't think it will ruin the story), the book was just plain terrible. The twist of the story was predictable and far fetched, so at page 380, I just put the book down. I didn't read the ending, and I don't even care."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrifying....ly horrible","review":"The book starts fast-paced, suspenseful, and well-written. Then it suddenly feels like Koontz said to himself, \\"Oops, I didn't think about what would happen in the second part. Oh well, I'll just pull something that barely makes sense from my ass and hope no one notices.\\" If Koontz hadn't set up such a great beginning I might be able to be more lenient in my review. However, he completely dropped the ball and disappointed me after getting my hopes up... don't even get me started on the contrived, rushed, and unbelievable love story subplot. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensfull!","review":"I have only read two of Dean Koontz's books so far, that I know of, but I think this one was really good.

Michael Perera, DXB, U.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"I started out really liking this book and then about one-third of the way through Koontz became possessed and dumped his first idea for something totally weird. I kept wondering what happened to the good book I started out reading. It didn't get any better as I muddled my way through this novel searching for the original plot. I think Koontz tried to redeem himself towards the very end, but it didn't work. I had to struggle to finish it. I wouldn't recommend Cold Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting! You won't be able to put it down!","review":"\\"Cold Fire\\" was the first book of Dean Koontzs that I read. I especially liked this book because it didn't have a lot of profanity, or sex in it. The book always kept me thinking. Later on I read \\"Dragon Tears.\\" That book was different. I liked it to, the author has a way with words. Both of these books were excellently laid out. I reccomend this book because it has great detail, great beginning, to the very end it kept me wondering, what will happen next??? Find out in this non stop excitement page turner \\"Cold Fire.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out interesting, then morphs into the foulest of crap","review":"The book starts out with an interesting premise and some captivating scenes, but it goes swiftly downhill. The female lead is inconsistent in her motivations, and she and the male lead fall in love for no reason. There is no lead up to the love, no explanation given afterward... It just happens. The author does not show their love, he tells it in the simplest, most unsatisfying words possible. The main plot also crashes terribly, as what originally looks like brewing supernatural mayham turns out to be ridiculous crap instead.The writing itself is bad, too. Infodumps are common, dialogue is unrealistic, etc. If this were a good story with decent characters, the writing would be tolerable, but no such things are to be found in this book.Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a disappointment","review":"I didn't realize I had read this one until I started reading it again.

I wear it to swim laps and for water aerobics and it is easy to move around in and is very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius or Gibberish?","review":"Is this a brilliant work of fiction or 150 pages of gibberish? This little book can be a tough read. Is it because of its French origin and something is lost in the translation (the French are so different from us), or is it because as a man reading it I missed the point of the female writers nuances? I have not decided yet. From the description on the cover I was expecting the story of a desparate search for a missing person. But the action (if you could call it action) takes place in the narrators fractured mind, and half way through the book you begin to question if there ever was a husband. Maybe a second reading would bring more insight into the character. If you are looking for a book with a good plot, action, dialogue and character development, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIE Interceptor----- it rocks!","review":"I've been waiting for this re-released vehicle for quite some time. The exclusive pilot is in fact a different sculpt than the POTF2 version. The neck post is too long making the head really loose right out of the box. It is smaller and much cleaner in details than the earlier version. The Ship itself is also just slightly smaller than the vintage version. The plastic wings are a softer plastic meaning that they more easily bend and warp. The wings don't really sit in the slots all that well, pretty loose actually. The texture on the wings is different than both the POTF2 TIE Fighter and Vader's TIE. Over all, the paint job is pretty cool and the ship is a great addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Pictures, no information","review":"Poor choice as the videos, while beautiful, are highly repetitive through the 3 separate stories. The narration is poorly written and surprisingly unemotional reading from Paul Sorvino. After 30 minutes we shut this off as it was boring and poorly organized.Lots of fly over shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"early 20 Dead","review":"20 Dead Flower Children are a great industrial metal band. That being said, this isn't a CD that's up to par with their later work. The biggest fault is the vocalist's weak performance on the majority of the songs. (The singer was later replaced) However, the music is still pretty solid and it's interesting to hear how the band has grown and branched out in direction. This is a very abrasive, bordering on avant-garde, release.A good comparison I can make is that this album holds value like a pre-Mike Patton Faith No More CD has value. It simply isn't as good with the old vocalist but is still interesting because the strong musical roots are there. You can practically feel the potential.If you're looking for an introduction to the band, check out Candy Toy Guns and Television or Garage Demos before making any decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spalding Batting Tee","review":"The actual advertisement in Amazon stated it included bases - apparently they no longer are included.

It gave way to the stories start and how they ended where they were at the end. I loved how the author portrayed the romance between the two main characters, how they both needed what they found in each other. Then the twist and turns of the story comes into play...how everything that seemed so right went wrong, tragically.There is a message, it seems within the story and that is to make sure one relationship is a done deal before starting another because you never know how things may turn out.There were a few editing errors but that didn't take away from getting through the book. This was a very good read and I look forward to reading more books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you open that door...","review":"Caught in the Middle gives a whole new meaning to that old saying, DON'T YOU OPEN THAT DOOR UNTIL YOU CLOSE THE OTHER ONE.Women, please do not throw out your 'trash' if you still want it. One man's junk is another's treasure. In this story, however, the consequences of collecting and restoring that treasure proved to be fatal.Without giving away too much of the story, I will say I truly enjoyed the twists and turns as well as the characters. I do hope there is a follow up as I'm very interested to know what becomes of the 'one who got away' and her accomplice.This book is very well written Ms. Moore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a work shoe","review":"I used to buy all-leather, steel toe shoes for work. They were black and un-exciting shoes. I decided to chance the look and I was wrong! These shoes do not bound very well with work related activities. They are also very slippery on any type of liquid. I was wrong to belive that being called \\"athletic\\" was just nother name for a shoe. actually I don't see how anyone could use these shoes for sport: too heavy and bulky. The fabric is thin and does not protect against cold or water: any drop of water on the shoe and one feels it on the foot. Any draft or small wind will go through like one is barefoot. I also believe the the price is way to high for this product. The reality is that one cannot find a cheaper, steel toe, low cut shoe.

However, the video didn't explain anything and was very hard to follow. It was clearly recorded by an amateur team and the storyboard did not have any direction. The movies was very inaccurate to the true events and the quality of the film was very horrible. It looked like a homemade movie.

I am baffled by the fact that Lionsgate got behind this amateurish attempt to make a movie about David Berkowitz. I don't even know why this movie was made since it doesn't in any way accurately portray the killer or his victims nor does it have any memorable performances.

Not easy to assemble. The worst part of the product is the timer lacks a battery back-up. Therefore, if your power even flickers, you lose ALL settings in the timer. At that point, the drapes remain open or closed until the timer is completely reprogrammed. Thus, the system is completely unreliable as a security devise (i.e., making your home look \\"lived in\\" while you aren't there). In fact, it's may be worse than just leaving your drapes closed while you are out of town. If they added a battery back-up in the system, I would have a different view of the product.

Ramsland is very good at wandering about, talking to people whom she encounters, but not so good at in-depth research. There are no real facts in this book about the handling of bodies, decomposition, or the funeral industry that couldn't be found online or in reference books. There are no historic cases mentioned that haven't been trotted out on TV or in print a dozen times before. The bulk of the new material in the book is \\"I have this friend who said...\\" stories that may be true, but mostly sound like urban legends.The upshot: if you know nothing about the topic, you'll definitely have your eyes opened and probably a good giggle, too.

And don't read it while eating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was.....\\"dead\\"","review":"I read this book in a matter of days because it really struck my curiosity from the get-go. Yes, it was filled with very interesting facts about the funeral industry, alot of macabre and eerie stories (even a horrid true story of necrophilia that I surely could have done without). Ms. Ramsland surely does take you to places and scenarios that few have gone to before. Yet I find her approach to be very disrespectful, most especially when she implies that an obese person's corpse looked like a whale and did not seem human. It's sentences like these that add the sourness to the book. Overall I would recommend the book to those that are extremely curious about the eerie and not so pleasent aspect of death, yet I would caution that most of the subjects that were not so cleverly compilled in this book are things that its just better we not know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"What a dissapointment, the writing is so bland and poor in this mediocre book I could barely get through it.

My favourites include Livin' Thing with its captivating fiddle, the addictive Sweet Talkin' Woman, the rousing Turn To Stone and others like Wild West Hero Don't Bring Me Down, Mr Blue Sky and 10538 Overture.

I notice a very quiet hum from the speakers when the receiver is powered up and no signal is sent. Once I press play on the CD player the hum disappears and can only be heard at extreme low volume.

I also have that model at a house in Florida, without it shutting off.Amazon was surprisingly fast in replacing the receiver with the same receiver at my New York City apartment, within the return period, without hesitation.

Most, if not all, of them wanted to sell me extremely expensive systems. After reading the reviews on Amazon for the Sherwood RX-4109, I decided to give it a try.

You read it because it's the original conception of an iconic fictional character. You read it for a quaint romp through 50s America as imagined by an Englishman. You read it to draw comparisons with the movie. Yet be warned, Bond doesn't really do much. The reader gets more details on Bond's eating, drinking, showering and napping habits than anything else. The \\"mystery\\" is on par with, say, a \\"Rockford Files\\" episode, conveniently solved before the final commercial break, the dialogue no more than a risque episode of \\"Leave it to Beaver\\".

They're equally interesting and thought provoking, but I found this one took me back to my formative years, making the book all the more enjoyable.It is a coming of age book, but it's also much more. Joyce gives the reader stuccato glimpses into the netherworld and our psyche at the same time. This is either comforting or disturbing, depending on your frame of mind.It is not, however, for the faint of heart. It can be relatively erotic and brutally honest. Call it PG-17.This is a great writer. One I hope gets more prolific as he ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"I found out about this book through \\"Horrornet\\" and thought I'd give it a read. It wasn't quite what I expected but it was well worth reading. It's reminded me of a twisted \\"Stand by Me\\". For fans of horror and good storytelling, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"With teeth","review":"I found Graham Joyce's writing simply gorgeous in its darkness and lush imagery. The story, however, felt unfocused. As I delved deeper into the novel, it seemed to become more and more prurient and distasteful, and all without a point. I did stop halfway through, so the final pages might have had something that tied it all together, but I just found that I didn't care about any of the characters. None were likeable, and the strange Tooth Fairy creature just didn't interest me enough to continue. I might pick up another of Joyce's books later though because his writing is magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Unpleasant","review":"An award-winning, pleasantly-freaky, unsettling novel by British writer Graham Joyce. Sam stashes a tooth under his pillow, as millions before him have done, and wakes to find the Tooth Fairy in his room. Not the pixie-dust version, but an oddly-dressed, sexually-ambiguous and aggressive \\"other,\\" who interfers/intervenes in Sam's life from then on. Brilliant, disturbing, modern-with-mythic overtones, a coming of age story in 60's/70's small-town Britain, urban sprawl, disaffected youth, violence, sex, drugs and all. If you like the Charles DeLint/Emma Bull/Will Shetterly sort of urban fantasy, this one will blow you away; it's so much better, so much richer, more frightening and more full of wonder. Not much is explained, but so much is experienced..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kindle mess","review":"This may well be a fine tale, but the number of errors are shocking. I would like to read this book, as I have just begun the first few chapters, but the errors of sentence beginnings out of context as well as the spelling mistakes rather ruins the charm the novel seems to hold. I can suspend my disbelief, but here is another tale ruined by dozens of errors. Don't you bother to proof any of your older books that you sell? As much as I enjoy most of my reading materials purchased through my Kindle, this sloppy transcription ruins the novel. If you don't care to proof your wares then you have no business selling them. Your author should be insulted! I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tooth Fairy is a Good One to Cut Your Teeth On...","review":"There are few novels that multitask elements of the truly strange, coming of age, humor, and horror...this one manages quite nicely. The easiest way to put this is that the Tooth Fairy is for novels what Donnie Darko was for film."},{"rating":"2","title":"great idea","review":"this book was great and dark and funny and scarey and perverse and delightful. Don't let the kids read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Flossing","review":"I loved this book. Let me say it again: I LOVED THIS BOOK.TOR, which also put out the wonderful Dawn Song, has proven again that they are way ahead of the curve when it comes to horror. There are a lot of people that will say this isn't a horror novel, but it is. Horror has changed. Pack up the vampires, put the monsters back under the bed, and leave the slashers to the movies. The Tooth Fairy is a much more intraverted novel that requires the reader to question the sanity of the main character and the reality of the book.The book was like a trip back to high school. It has all the sexual uncertainty, drama, fear, and life that is lacking from Dawson's Creek. I really became attached to these characters and hated to see the book end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the Thrill book I was lookin for","review":"This was an interesting book if you are looking to get into the heads of male youths. However, it is not a thriller or horror novel in the least. Thre were times when I skimed through paragraphs looking for more excitment. Book is also based in Europe, so some language and references were missed by me. I don't think I would recommend this book if you are looking for excitment or thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was a great disappointment to me. I love books that have a real setting and yet there is a touch of magic thrown in. Christopher Moore is a master at this type of narrative. He makes you feel as though YOU could stumble onto something mythical in your day to day life. \\"The Tooth Fairy\\" did not deliver this. This was a sexually twisted piece of writing. The book might have been more enjoyable if it had just given in to its erotic fixation fully and quit trying to be a creepy coming of age story. At the end of the book I had nothing invested in the story or the characters. The only reason I finished it was a misguided hope that the ending would reveal SOMETHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected ~","review":"This was one weird book! I don't think I'd ever read it again, and truthfully, barely got through it the first time. There was a lot of sex in in too, which was creepy in the context with The Tooth Fairy.

The second is the product crapped out after two days, two days!! Now it only plays out of one side of my car despite anything I do. And for those skeptics, yes I tried all sorts of tests to make sure to was the adapter.

Sad but true. The film is leaden, earth-bound. The romance element is unbelievable; the callow stripling becomes kung fu master in two-minute montage is as ridiculous as ever; the villains are merely unpleasant; the fights are--well, you've seen them all before many times. One thing I haven't noticed in the other reviews: the soundtrack, specifically the choral music, is deafening, even to the point of making the dialog unintelligible in spots. Finally, I believe firmly that wire-assisted flying in martial arts films is grotesquely over-used.

Recently, I finally got hold a copy of it and to my chagrin it bored me to death. The plot is horrible, Jackie Chan talked too much, while the fighting scenes between him and Jet Li are not bad but the movie just did not go any where.

OK,so this 1976 sequel is not quite as good as the original but Harper still grabs your interest to the closing credits. Paul Newman is Harper who is a little older and a little wiser. His real wife,Joanne Woodard,is in the film and you can see real attraction in the scenes they do together. Rounding out the cast are Anthony Franciosa,Richard Jaeckel,Gail Strickland,Linda Haynes,and a very young Melanie Griffith. Harper is on the case so make it a movie night and watch THE DROWNING POOL for the water,the girls,the guns,and so much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the animation i was looking for","review":"the story was similar, but the animation was not.

Even when I finally got rid of the infection, I still continued to have horrible diarrhea and cramping. It seemed to make my IBS more severe. Since then, I have seen doctors, tried many medications, and even tried some alternative therapies, and nothing has yet been helping me so far. A co-worker of my husbands recommended RevitalX and I tried it. It seemed to make my diarrhea worse! It cleans you out.

Adhering strictly to rhythm, while eschewing melody, the Monks shrieked out songs with titles like \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"I Hate You (But Call Me)\\" in a most un-Beatle-ish manner. Musically, the band combined feedback, beserk organ runs, thudding bass and drums all the while a banjo (!) clacked in the background. The band actually shaved their heads like monks and dressed all in black with ropes tied around their neck. A huge influence on bands such as the Fall, the Monks only LP was never released in the USA until the mid-90s. Finally this groundbreaking CD hits our shores.

This drink tastes so awful that it sort of made me gag a little when I tried a second taste. The best I can decribe it would be like drinking liquid Vegemite. If you were never brought up with Vegemite and later in life you were able to pick it up and truly enjoy the taste of it, then I would recommend you give this a shot. If not, go to a store, pop one open, have a quick sip, leave it on the shelf, and then run away quickly!

When I washed the back window, the black rubbed away. It was like the grime on the window scratched the black off so now the sticker looks shoddy and I'm going to peel it off. In my opinion, it would have been much better made had they simiply cut out the bulldog picture to let the tint from the back window show through - kind of like they do with the family stickers.

Spring break '98 and I was with about 4 english mates that I played soccer here in the states with. There was no way they were going to get drunk and party and not listen to techno so I weathered the storm. What happened is I found myself humming the tunes and singing the anthems away from our hotel room. By the end of the week I had to get my hands on the cd. Nothing but straight trance energy. This is the reason why trance is so addictive. This is a great addition to any collection. I've bought many trance/techno CD's to date, but I can always pop this back in and still get motivated. From the straight brilliant Oakenfold of old. Not the over commercialized, overworked, undermotivated Oakenfold of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Anthems CD Around","review":"This CD contains a selection of classic anthems mixed together by DJs Paul Oakenfold and Nick Warren.

However I think a book titled DEEP WRITING ought to be deeper. For instance, a great deal of time is spent in advising writers to write toward a market which seems to me to be the opposite of DEEP writing. If you are a writer, you are already wrestling with the demons Maisel identifies -- it's nice to find that you have company and nice to hear that it is possible to overcome but I bet most people who buy this book want R-E-L-I-E-F, and you won't get it here. Still it's a small book and an excellent gift for a beginning writer you know. If I'd read this book 10 years ago when I just starting out I could have saved thousands of hours in Writers Groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only gold in this stream is the list of 25 frames.","review":"Most of the information in this book can be found in many others.

I suspect that for many writers this section of the book will make it worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all creatives","review":"Eric Maisel has written another excellent book, which speaks to the heart as well as the intellect. Very few books on writing are willing to confront the darker side of trying to create: the monumental procrastination, the anxiety that arises at the thought of being completely authentic, and the day to day struggle to just \\"show up\\" and say yes, or no, to the creative process. Maisel treats artists and the creative process with deep respect, acknowledges what the struggle entails, and does not demean his readers by issuing false promises or platitudes. At the same time, he captures the trancendental joy that arises when we are able to enter into that trancelike state in which we produce our best \\"deep writing\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quick encouragment","review":"What I liked best about this book was Maisel's use of composite sketches of different writers, at different stages, with different goals, to illustrate the process of creating and completing a book. His illustrations convey the depth of his experience in counseling others and his own writing experience in pointing out how we can go deeper within ourselves, with clear intentions, to produce better work. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable!","review":"I just finished writing the book Remedial Genius and this was the most helpful book I have read on the topic of writing.

My analytical background means I have the biggest \\"How To Write\\" bookshelf I've ever found - I read everything! Many books are very helpful. But \\"Deep Writing\\" is the book that has most directly addressed how to structure my writing life and how to align my writing with my creativity. This book seems to speak most clearly about my issues, and the suggested tactics are 100% practical. I'm a raving fan of the book and intend to buy a number of copies to give to writing friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful psychological approach to producing best writing","review":"As the author of a book about writing myself (WRITING IN FLOW), I really appreciated author Maisel's combination of the practical with the passionate. When he talks about combining writing what you love and making a living doing so, it certainly rings true. How much compromise can you make with the real world and still be congruent with your deepest self? In DEEP WRITING, we learn the value of getting and staying engaged with our writing (getting into \\"flow,\\" in other words). Maisel is unusually frank, too, about his own successes, failures, and learning experiences (not that you can or should even try to separate those three things!). This book feels like an inspiring chat with a compassionate therapist who understands the challenges of being a writer (which Maisel happens to be)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egan is the best","review":"Peter Egan is by far the best writer on the subjects of motorcycles, airplanes and sports cars.

The cinematography of the area is very beautiful (makes you want to pack your bags and move there).Now, moving on...the characters are well-written. Emily Rose plays a FBI agent who comes to Haven to investigate a case and chooses to stay there indefinitely to pursue the possibility that her mother may have disappered there years earlier.Another main character is the chief of police, who often works together with the FBI agent in trying to solve these bizarre cases- so there is a Mulder-Scully dynamic (X-Files) between them.* one of the best shows currently on syfy- recommended viewing *"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I wasn't expecting much from a Syfy show but I was very pleasantly surprised with this.

If you liked the X-files, you might enjoy this one. I found it to be a less serious, modern version of the X-files. The characters are likeable, especially Duke. Even my husband was complaining when there was an episode where they didn't include Duke in. However, I have a feeling the show won't last long. I don't see how they'll keep it going because the story is mostly centered around the Lucy, the main character and why she came to Haven in the first place. It's an odd one ( Fringe meets the X-files and hangs out with Eureka at some cute little town in Maine ). It was a fun show with some unique \\"cases\\" that I never really got to see from other shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven can hook you in","review":"I have watched every episode of Haven and love the show.

Although the premise of the show makes us want to know, were 2 seasons in and i dont feel any better for watching it.Most of the first several episodes are good and this is the reason for the higher rating. As the season grows the show grows tiresome and it isnt until the last episode that i was interested again, only for that to fade ep.3 season 2.I cant fault any of the actors, I just done like the overall pace of the show.However if you can hang in there its worth watching season 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I am floored by the good reviews this show has gotten on here. I kept watching, hoping it would improve, but it doesn't. There is zero investment in these characters. There is no emotion and no one in this \\"troubled\\" town seems to care. The story lines are formulaic: someone's stress level gets too high and their \\"troubled\\" nature comes out, unintentionally hurting/killing other people in town. Comparisons to X-Files are laughable. This show is terrible. Everyone has different tastes of course, so you might like it, but to give you an idea of my taste in TV, I am an X-Files fan and I also enjoy Grimm, Once Upon A Time, The Mentalist and the earlier seasons of Criminal Minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful acting","review":"Don't waste your money on this, you'd be better off watching QVC.Main character is a poor actress, the entire story is too contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hell of a Haven!","review":"What can be said about HAVEN?

One of the best things about this show is that Agent Audrey Parker shows up and is not immediately accepted; she has to work her way into the community's heart and she does. This tv show is for anyone who likes a bit of mystery in their lives and enjoys being led on a merry chase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want my money back!","review":"This is a low budget cheap imitation of \\"Ghost Whisperer\\" with guns thrown in.

I hope they keep the tension going through the next season and don't prematurely cancel this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just a fun supernatural program","review":"Based on Steven King's imagination, Haven is one of those series that is so easy to get into. Supernatural events, great characters, small town. A search for a mother, whom everyone seems to know, but not really. Events that happened years ago, but are only evident in hazy memories. Only in King's style does Haven erupt when a FBI agent enters the realm of the present and past in the usual northeast of so many of King's stories. If you like his storytelling you will love Haven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the match to The House of Yes ! Great work.","review":"This is what I like about Indie work.

I felt that it was only necessary to review such a great book, as sometimes online reviews are an important factor in the bookbuying process!Also, I highly recommend Gunaratana's Mindfulness In Plain English, a great guide to mindfulness that compliments this book in very many ways.I Hope this review helps you decide to purchase this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice","review":"I have been a seriously practicing Buddhist for 12 years.

The manual states that it can handle up to 100 lb, perhaps if it is a single child, it might.We went for a ride...Our neighborhood is hilly and I could not get it up a single hill. Where the road was flat, I was able to pedal it reasonably well, though much harder than when alone.

My daughter enjoys riding in it very much. There is a place for her drink, and the seat is comfortable enough that on longer rides she falls asleep.I bought one of those seats that fits on the back of a bicycle, but it wouldn't fit. The back fender of my bicycle was too wide for the seat, and we didn't want to force it. I'm glad it didn't fit. The trailer is just great. It rolls smoothly on inflated rubber tires. I'm careful when turning that I don't hit curbs, the trailer turns very well. My daughter has room to wiggle her feet, without kicking me, she is protected from the sun, and mosquitoes with the cover and the bug/debris net. The side windows are easy to see out of. She enjoys riding in the trailer, and sometimes we even take the neighbor's granddaughter with us. They both fit comfortably (remember less than 100 lbs) It's a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not like this trailer.","review":"I bought this trailer from Target in March 2007, and the harness on the inside started to deteriorate about a month after I bought it. I called Target and they told me to bring it back with the receipt, but did not replace it. I called Schwinn and they did nothing about it either and every time I called I got the run around. The material in the bottom of the trailer also started to rip and I know my son was not heavy enough to rip it since he was 20 lbs. when we got it.The only good things about it are the big wheels and it was very roomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not good enough","review":"I picked this up at Target since it was on sale and had good reviews on Target.com and Amazon. Trailer was extremely easy to set up. Out of the box and without instructions, it took less than five seconds. Other positives: front wheel, 20\\" tires, handlebar, flag, cup holders.Negatives: the seat is cheap fabric and cannot be comfortable. The helmet pockets are too high for kids under 3 and wouldn't work that well if my daughter could reach it. I wouldn't buy this if you only intend to use it for one child; the 'middle seat' isn't as good as either 'side seat'.I never mounted it to the bicycle so I cannot review this aspect. I reboxed it and took it back to the store. Bought a Burley Solo instead for double the price but the quality is so much better. No regrets.I gave two stars because it was inadequate for our needs but I think it could fit the needs of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Virtual PC for Mac with Windows 2000","review":"Very pleased with its operation and speed.

Also, useful information on the content and format used in writing query letters ( to pitch your book concept ) with both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" examples. New writers might quickly conclude that this is just the portal to a long journey. The compilation of publishers is extensive .... also included - consumer magazines and trade journals. Another nice touch, 50 literary agents were profiled along with the strong inference or my interpretation that one is best served ( if you go the agency route versus contacting publishers directly ) to determine if revenues are sourced from actual book sales or from services sold to wannabe authors. Bottom-line, great value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Honestly, very few of the agents in this book will even read your work.

At first we thought, what a great invention! It worked for a short while and then we couldn't get the light to turn on anymore. I tried to change the batteries and that didn't seem to make a difference. I thought about changing the light bulb but I don't believe it's ment to be changed. At least I didn't waist a lot of money on this item. We just use the mirror now and the overhead dome light in the van to see her at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I never actually attached the light because it does not turn on every time you push the button on the remote, and when it did, it was very hard to tell it was on. As for the mirror, to attach it you either use a saftey pin for cloth seats, or velcro for leather. I tied the mirror on until I could return it and get another one, because my husband was not going to stick a piece of adhesive velcro onto our leather seats. WASTE OF MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea....Poor Design","review":"Like others said the light will not stay attached to the carseat base. Everytime you get the seat out it falls off. The light is not super bright which is good and bad. Good cause it doesnt wake baby, bad cause it makes it hard to see with.

The system is very difficult to install, you need two people, one to sit and look in the mirror, and one to adjust the rear mirror.

This system sat in my car for a year and never once was useful for me, don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peek a boo....I see you","review":"This has really worked out for us. I didn't want to stick the light on my daughter's carseat....I thought it would get in the way (as others have said) instead I placed it behind the head rest of the back seat. It stays there and if you align your remote (which fits my car 94 Altima) it will turn on when you use the remote.As with anything else...I turn the light to the off position during the day as the batteries are bound to die out.

Since he gets off late at night we thought the light gadget would be helpful too. Boy were we wrong not only is the mirror too small but trying to aim the remote to the sensor on the light is difficult while driving. As for being able to see him I was only abe to see him at a stop light where i would have to stretch to see the miror. Also the miror kept moving so every time I got in the car I would have to make sure I could see him, which I never could so I would wast time fixing it and then checking to see if he was in view.

I purchased this thinking that if something happened to our son again , while driving I would be able to see it right away.. The mirror is too small and I cannot get the light to work which is why I purchased the product in the first place to be able to keep a close eye on him even at night..

Unless the interior of your car / van is a perfect square, it is almost impossible to attach the mirror in an angle to let you see your child. The light, a nice idea, is poorly implemented making it worthless and in the way when taking your seat in and out of the car, plus the remote that turns light on and off must be in direct line of sight or it won't work, and finally the clip to hold the remote on your sun visor won't fit many types of cars with thicker visors that house vanity mirrors and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this product","review":"It took me less time to install two car seats than it did to \\"try\\" and install this light mirror.

I tried to clean it off for about an hour and it just smudges across the mirror making it useless. I can't even see out of it.

Then we found, as other reviewers have mentioned, that the light kept falling off and getting in the way. The remote didn't work well either- it had to be lined up just right and it wouldn't hook on to our visors in our car like they say it should be able to. The light itself used up the batteries quickly as well. Then when the remote broke and stopped working all together, we ended up returning this and getting another mirror. It may have just been bad luck, but it didn't work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can live without the light","review":"There are two types of mirrors from this company: one with the light and one without.

I do love the mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get a mirror, light not worth it","review":"Great idea, just a few gliches. Light must be in the \\"on\\" position to work so you have to remember to turn it on at night. Remote control only works half the time and light only stays on for about 5 seconds, too short for me. Also light must attach to car seat base and it gets in the way when you're putting baby seat in it. I discovered reaching up and turning on my dome light in the car is just as effective and a lot easier. Mirror works great and gives me peace of mind to see that my baby is doing okay. Save a few bucks and just buy a mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror is great but not the light","review":"We bought this item for a long drive so we could see our son at night but unless you had it lined up and close the light wouldn't come on. The remote to our cd player we had to use to turn it on. The mirror was great though because we could see more of him and he could see himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Bad Product","review":"When I first saw this product I thought it would be a great way to see what my baby was doing in the backseat at night and check to see if she had fallen asleep or was getting into something. However, the nighlight never stuck to the carseat even after trying our own engineering tactics. It was just too top heavy to stay put. On the rare occasion it stayed up long enough to attempt a trial run, the baby would just pull it off. Then, to make matters worse, it was nearly impossible to align the remote with the light to get it to turn on. To top it all off, even the mirror is small.After wasting our money, we have found that it's just as easy to switch on the interior car light to check on baby. She sleeps through it just fine. Save your money and just buy a decent mirror for the back seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I was very excited for this mirror/light combo and think that the idea of the whole thing would be great. However, the light is so dim there is NO WAY that you're going to see your baby in the dark with it. On top of that, there is no way to get the light to fit at the angle you'd need it to be. We had it wedged in between our seats at one point to try and get it to work, which is a hazard. We finally threw the lights out (we each got one for our car). The mirrors are okay, but a bit small. WASTE OF MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time With This Product","review":"We bought this and took it home. Once we had the batteries in, we could not get it to make a connection when we closed the battery compartment.

The compartment seems to give to much lateral room to the batteries to make a solid connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly waste of money","review":"Don't waste your money - just get the mirror. The mirror, I don't think I could live without. I love that I can look back at my daughter without having to turn around while driving. The light is just plain silly. You have to have it turned on for it to work, but if you leave it on all the time, the batteries die in about a day. I didn't typically remember to turn it on until after I was already driving. When I did remember to turn it on, I found the remote had to be pointed very specifically in order to turn the light on and by the time you \\"uncontort\\" your arm and are able to get a good look in the rearview mirror, the light had already shut off. I find it much easier to just briefly turn the dome light on in the car.

An absolutely campy black and white horror movie with Vincent Price as the obsessed pathologist with a laboratory in his basement. He experiments on his unhappy wife! The \\"Tingler\\" looks like a giant rubber earwig, or maybe a lobster without it's claws. It rivals the monster in Ed Woods' \\"Bride of the Monster\\" in it's apparent phoniness. The movie takes a little while to warm up, but then abandons all logic and goes completely, gloriously loopy. Vincent Price on LSD is a reason alone to buy this wonderfully bizarre romp of a movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find it available on tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy nonsense","review":"I'm a Vincent Price fan, but this is one of his lesser works, in my opinion.

Vincent Price did a wonderful job with mad dialogue and actually made us sad for the doctor whose work was subsumed into a murder plot. The only other actor to convince with dodgy dialogue was the late, much loved, Perter Cusshing , one of Vincent's dearest friends.

I ordered it immediately.When it arrived, we popped some corn, poured some wine, and had a ball watching this hokey but fun movie. Of course, Vincent Price gives the movie some credibility, but you can sure tell that 'special effects' have come a long way since the 50's. William Castle was the director and he was known for many of the 'horror' films of that time. It was fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"best special effects EVER!","review":"This movie is so ridiculous! It is AWESOME! The only reason I didn'tgive it 5 stars is because it isn't quite as much fun as \\"House onHaunted Hill\\". William Castle just goes so over the top here: the creature is so obviously pulled along on a string, the wife somehow re-animates, the husband orchestrates a humanly impossible series of stunts to scare his wife, and Vincent does acid!

While we're on the topic, none of those rat-lover chicks, either; they smell like the elephant exhibit and my hair always gets caught in their nose rings.

I could see my baby from the front seat. Unfortunately, after only 3 weeks the mirror became very hazy and my baby looks blurry in the mirror. I tried to clean the mirror with a tissue. The haze would not come off of the mirror and I ended up scratching the mirror also. What a waste of money. Reading more reviews on this product, I realize that for my child's safety this could be a potential hazard to my daughter if we were to get in an accident. I've already been rear-ended once with my daughter in the car (not using the mirror). I'm not going to take my chances using this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have it!","review":"This is one of the best products! We have an SUV and this mirror fits nicely on the back seat headrest. I can not imagine driving around without this mirror. It allows us to watch the baby while he is facing the back of the car. The only down side to this mirror is that it did not work well in our other car (Saturn) and so we are buying one with a suction cup for that car.

Before, i was always twisting around at every red light to make sure he was OK. With this, all I have to do is angle my rearview mirror down a bit and I can see him fine. The attachment is a little weird, but I managed to work it out. I drive an SUV and his seat is in the middle, so I couldn't attach it to the headrest since there isn't one in the middle, which would be the easiest. Instead I use the velcro that comes with it. I wasn't all that thrilled on stabbing my upolstrey with the safety pin they give you, so i have it velcroed to the back of the backseat near the top. It seems to work ok. The size and clarity of this mirror is also very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy if you have leather seats!","review":"This item is basically useless if you have leather seats unless you want to ruin them and pin the mirror into the leather.

Recently, when I got in my car I realized the mirror had fallen down...right where my baby would have been if she had been in the car when it had fallen. When I tried to reattach it, I realized the strap had torn. It appears the strap had started to disinigrate in the sun because when I touched the strap another piece of it fell off in my hand. I don't think the mirror would have hurt my baby if it had fallen while she was in the car, but it might have, and it certainly would have scared her. I also hate to think that I could have gotten into an accident if she startled me by suddenly screaming after the mirror fell on her.

So the officer recommended against using the mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Mirror","review":"We have 2 of these mirrors, one in my sedan and one in my husbands SUV. It is great in my car, and we have had no problems. It is a nice big mirror and I can see my daughter very well, without it blocking my rear window. The SUV is a different story.

It attached to my leather SUV seats and was very easy to see in my rearview mirror. However, the fireman who inspected the installation of our car seat told us to take it down. He said that it could hit the baby in a crash - and it is big enough to seriously hurt our son. He advised us to only use a mirror that was crash tested. I have yet to find a mirror that attaches well to leather seats and is crash tested (the stick-on velcro that other mirrors use for leather seats is useless!).

It's kind of hard to see the baby when the whole mirror is smeared because I simply tried to clean it! Who would think that wiping a mirror clean with just a soft cloth(no chemicals) would scratch it. I had it for 6 days and it is ruined. It is obviously made very cheaply. It also wouldn't stay in place. It kept slipping so that all I could see was the light on the roof. I have an SUV with a center headrest which was supposed to work fine with the teather. It doesn't. Take my word for it....complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have 2 of these mirrors, one in the plaid pattern and one in the brown leather/suede. How 2 of the exact same mirrors can be so different is beyond me. While the leather one is great (so far), the plaid one has fogged up and cannot be wiped clean, making it almost impossible to see my daughter. The sticky tab that can be used when not mounting it on a headrest held for about 10 minutes and then continually fell forward. When I finally moved it to a headrest, I was tightening the strap and it snapped right in 2 making the entire mirror impossible to use at all! It's a needed accessory but this one disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not safe?","review":"I had purchased two of these mirrors for my car and my husband's.However, after taking our 4 day old baby to the fire station to have our infant car seat professionally checked over, we were told that these mirrors are not recommended and that they can actually harm your child in a car accident.We returned them immediately!

I purchased the Stanley FatMax xtreme 25' tape measure with the thought that paying extra for a beefy tape would allow for years of use. As others have noted the tape requires way too much force to lock it in place. This is irritating but tolerable. I take pretty good care of my tools and the actual tape looks pretty nice still. All the lines are still viewable. However, after retracting the blade fast one time it cracked at about the 3' mark. Now it may or may not want to go in and out. Stanley does not warrant this according to the pictures of \\"abuse\\" on their website. I let it go in fast but not that fast. Anyway I am going to buy the cheapy tapes from the big box stores. They allow you to walk in and exchange them, no questions asked. We'll see how that works out. Stanley, make a \\"true pro\\" version, back it up and I'd pay extra for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Office Geek Who Never Drove A Nail Designed This Thing","review":"The idea is good; a tape with a long standout. The problem is that the thing is so fat that it won't easily sit in a tool belt, tape measure holder. Ok, this relegates it to those some time jobs. Not much consolation for a $20+ tape. But what really made me think this thing was designed by the marketing department is that it is so top heavy it won't sit up on its own. Try drawing the tape out, locking it to free up a hand and the thing falls over. Terrible. To top it off; mine broke today after only occasional use over the last year. My $9.00 Stanley, which I use ever day, has been going for over a year.

Best tape out there. This Xtreme is new but definitely not improved. The first 6 inches of the tape has small numbers on both sides with the \\"Blade Armor\\" logo running right through the middle, very confusing and hard to read. Also the chrome & black color makes it hard to find in your bags or tool box. I don't know if a different plastic was used but I already have a crack in my case. The old yellow model is much more visible. I have reverted back to my 4 year old FatMax original and given the Xtreme to my crew as a spare, they don't like it either.

So much for their strongest tape ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Locking Mechanism","review":"I have tried two of the 25' Stanley tapes and both had very stiff locking mechanisms - one didn't lock at all. Most of the time I simply throw my finger under the tape to hold it open, but if I'm paying top dollar for a tape measure I expect it to work. The standout is great if you keep it flat, but the tape is heavy and will fold over easily. I have a Komelon self-lock that is excellent and will likely try one of their heavy duty tapes or the standard Fat Max which has more favorable reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw (spring too weak)","review":"Here's the deal with the thing. Is works great and when finding the center of a ceiling for example it's A-#1 BUT the spring may ware out. I got it less than 2 months ago and now it won't go all the way back in on it\`s own (it stays out a foot or so). It's not because it's dirty, it's not because I've loosened the spring, it's not because the blade is bent, it's because the spring has worn out. This is why it happens (I think), the flat max extreme is so curved it acts like a spring it's self when rolled up (much more so than the regular flat max) and the spring they put in there is just not thick enough to fight that and keep it's memory over time. I tried tightening the spring, it didn't help much and now it won't go all the way out...I don't know about all of them, but the one I had was fully extended from time to time and the spring wore out. Use caution and talks to others before taking my word for it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it.","review":"I liked the long standout. You can reel out 9 ft without too much sag.The thing that turned me off immediately was the clam-shell package. I ruined the belt clip trying to extract the tape from the package.The lock mechanism is difficult to operate.If you don't release the lock all the way it will leave black stripes on your tape.The tape has a rounded bottom and falls over easily if you put it on a piece of lumber. That to me is a deal killer.

Then the blade just snapped off- not doing anything with it except extending it out. No prior kinking or abuse. My take is that in order to make the blade stand out so well, they used a stiff brittle steel that doesn't roll up well and develops stress cracks until it snaps off. My cheaper tapes have universally lasted longer than this expensive one- also, no replacement tape to be had- nothing to do but throw the whole thing away when it breaks.

I recieved this book for xmas, I never would have bought it had I looked at any one page. The book reads like someone took 100 post it notes with tidbits of info on them and threw them together to create a book. Unfortunatley the information (if it can so be called) is nothing more then a bunch of questions and the author saying how difficult living with a stepchild will be, she says it over and over and over.... The book is set up with a small paragraph with an idea or a question followed by \\"see more on this in chapter 9 or 14\\" etc. It is not only not informative but it a very annoying book to read. I can sum this entire book up in one sentence \\"Raising or Living with a step child/stepchildren is not easy, it is going to be stressful and challenging (see more on this at the beginning of my review)\\" There I just saved you 20 dollars, now find a different book to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't tell you too much","review":"This was not a very informative book. I thought there were a lot of good ideas and a lot of different concepts brought out in it, however the author did not go into very much detail on any of the subjects.

It appeared to me that this book would only be useful to those who never sat down to think. The task of being a stepparent is not to be taken lightly, since there are children's lives involved, but I think that the pessimism in this book can stir up negative emotions which can actually harm a stepfamily.

Along the way we are introduced to a few of the most integral Tintin elements: Captain Haddock's family estate, Marlinspike (originally Moulinsart), where the characters will live for the remainder of the series; the deaf, absentminded, and wonderful Professor Calculus (Professor Tournesol, or Sunflower, in the original version); and plenty of antics from the Thom(p)son twins along the way.The ending of Red Rackham's Treasure is perfect and truly puts the series in motion, setting the stage for some of the most wonderful Tintin adventures of all.

In this adventure Tintin and Captain Haddock goes on an expedition to find the treasure of Sir Francis Haddock. It is in this book Tintin meets Professor Cuthbert Calculus for the first time. His underwater machine turns out to be invaluable, even though Tintin and Captain Haddock at first reject it.This book is faster paced and more interesting than the first of the two and contains a lot of enjoyable humor. Professor Calculus is hard of hearing (almost deaf), and the book is filled with a lot of comic situations arising from the Professors condition. I admit I found these episodes to be funny, but they could also be objectionable to some.

It's a great idea, but I couldn't get the guard to stay up. The adhesive always came off the stove and the guard hung down making it ineffective in what it is supposed to do, which is to keep little hands from reaching up to touch the burners. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"It is a great product from the time you bought it until you get home because it gives Mommy the feeling she has done something for the little ones safety.I installed it because Mommy insisted to do so and there was a tiny, tiny little spark of hope in me that this could actually work. While still installing (which by the way is very simple) my baby (17month) wanted to pull it down already. So here went my hope because I was sure in the first unwatched minute he pulled it down.Well I managed to keep it safe for 24 hours to make sure the tape would dry out and work at its best. Next morning I made scrambled eggs and the tape started to get loose because of the heat. I mean I only used half the heat available and it came loose, didn't even fry some steaks with full power....So my baby enjoyed pulling it down completely and throw it into the trash.While it lasted not long enough to clean it, I am sure it is a real headache to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I have a gas range, and wanted to protect my little one from the flames should they figure out how to get arround the child proofing and turn on the gas.This was not difficult to install, but it fell off the next day. the sticky pads say that they will stick if you wash the surface prior to installing them.

We moved an bought a new one for our new house. It is the only thing on the market that we have found that works.

Thank goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"My daughter is 14 months old and she is able to reach and grab things off the countertop. I was scared that the same would happen with the stove. Pulling pans off or even just grabbing the burner. We have a cooktop mounted in the countertop and this guard has stayed in place while being mounted to the side of the countertop. The adhesive works very well. I do notice that if you did much pulling or jarring I think it would come off. But I think that is expected. When I lean to reach in the cabinets on top of the stove I try to be careful not to lean against it too much.Overall, this product is great. I have had it for over a month and my little girl hasnt bothered it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, with some modifications","review":"Based on the other reviews, I wasn't surprised when the double-sided tape that came with the product ceased to work after only a week. I found that a chilly 64 degree temp in my house a few mornings as well as the high temps from my stove led to the tape's undoing. I simply removed the clips so that I had more surface area to work with and applied my own double-sided tape (about seven inches on each side). It has been a few weeks since I affixed the guard using the modified application method, and the stove guard is adhering beautifully. Definitely give this product a try, since it really does the job in terms of protecting little fingers from getting too close to the stove burners, but use your own double-sided tape and no clips for the best results."},{"rating":"2","title":"got it for my Girl, she loves it","review":"This one is not that long so you can see the pendulum (or however you call that thing (a little gold cross I gave her for xmass)), but the chain which came with it broke. this was a replacement. it is solid, and great, would recommend you get it for you girl too!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad quality","review":"Necklace was damaged and of very low quality.

I'm used to Pat's stories where the language and humor are clean. Jean Shepherd is only mildly amusing and the foul language in his stories were a deal breaker for me. I got about 1/4 of the way through the book before deleting it from my Kindle. If the smut on TV and in movies isn't enough for you, by all means, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book!","review":"\\"A Christmas Story\\" is one of my favorite holiday films, so I expected to enjoy the book that inspired it. Instead, I hated \\"In God We Trust.\\"Shepherd's writing is devoid of rhythm or beauty. The sentences, bogged down with far too many adjectives, limp along like bits of a fourth-grade theme paper.Shepherd is a hateful, bitter man. Slurs and offensive characterizations pepper the book and poison any of the sweetness that can be found in the movie version. There's plenty of hoary, old man humor about alcoholism and drunkenness too, the kind that better writers abandoned sometime in the early sixties.Reading this book felt like being cornered by a drunken, unwashed, polyester-clad uncle at a holiday party. One feels polluted afterward. If there were a way to cleanse, or even excise the brain cells that hold my memory of this book, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet nostalgia","review":"i purchased this book because I had recently watched \\"A Christmas Story\\" which was based on this book. It did contain some of the \\"scenes\\" from the movie, but also a lot more about growing up in post-depression Wisconsin. A funny, sweet collection of memories.

Then I faintly remembered his work in Car & Driver back in the late '70's. This was after he left WOR radio I guess? The Christmas Story and other works he did on PBS still bring back memories of growing up in the midwest in the 50's. Then I bought the two Sheppard books and have my 12 year old daughter experiencing the joy of Jean Sheppard. His death recently is a loss to all of us who grew up in the inocent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"I listened to Jean Shepherd on WOR radio when I lived in NJ. Jean was THE funniest personality I had/have ever heard. Stories about when he was a kid, when he was in the Army, all kinds of neat, funny stories.When this book came out, I got an autographed copy in Newark, NJ one day, still have it too. Outstanding tales about youth in the \\"better days\\" of America! You will LOVE this book if you like \\"Christmas Story\\" on TV every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shepherd's works strike a chord in all of us.","review":"Like the others, I grew up within range of WOR, and so became infatuated with this author. Since his show was followed by Long John Nebel, it was difficult to get to sleep on any weeknight before 2 AM in 1963. If you could get tickets on Saturday night to the Village's \\"Limelight\\", you could hear Shepherd's tales in person. The stories are no less funny and whimsical in this book as they were on radio or during those live performances. Shepherd has admitted to being heavily influenced by George Ade, whose books also contain a similar drole humor born from simple, common, folksy experiences that 99% of us had. A good read for anyone who has grown up anywhere in America, or wants to know what America is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

But this is not Parker at his best. In fact, we'd rate this one of the worst, if not the worst, in the Spenser series. Don't waste your money on the hard cover, get the paperback.

It starts out with a terrific plot. Spenser is hire by Lou to get rid a couple of thugs out of Potshot. But are things what they seem. Suspense will gripe you from page to page. The ending is killer. While this is not the best of series. But worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Spenser","review":"Reading the latest Spenser novel, Potshot, by Robert Parker was a depressing event. It seems another of my favorite authors has lost sight of the creative standards that made earlier writings captivate me. Mr. Parker falls back on repetitions of past works, inane dialogue and lukewarm narrative in this story. I read through the book, hoping that eventually I would come across the elegant writing that made so many of the earlier Spenser novels so readable. I never found it. Mr. Parker would be wiser to retire Parker, Susan and Pearl to a small cottage in Concord and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Plot Was Phoned In!","review":"I've read every Spenser mystery, and through the years each one has become just a little less of a \\"good read.\\" This is the worst of the lot. It's enjoyable because it's another in the Spenser series, but the series is becoming as bad as Lillian Jackson Braun's 'The Cat Who....\\" books....you know, let's make something up to sell another book....call the plot in and be damned with it...and with the readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I enjoy the Spenser series. I have read maybe 10 so far, and plan on getting them all eventually. The characters are fun, the stories are interesting, the dialog is perky, and the action is exciting. Sure, I often skim over a lot of the \\"Susan\\" stuff, and I do get tired of over-long descriptions of food/clothing. But I generally enjoy these books.Potshot is easily the worst one I have encounted. Admittedly, the typical \\"Spencer\\" plot is not a paragon of coherance/continuity. In \\"Potshot\\", however, it becomes so problematic that it detracts a lot from enjoyment of the story. I won't bother to list the holes and inconsistancies here, it's just not worth the time. Other reviews have mentioned the unsatisfiying ending, so I won't dwell on that either. All I will say is that, as I turned the last page and closed the book, I was filled with disappointment. \\"Phoned it in\\" was my first thought.I do strongly recommend this series. But this is NOT the one to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"How can a book that is at least 125 pages too long manage to have an abrupt and unfulfiling conclusion? Maybe if Parker would quit cranking out books like they were on an assembly line, he might produce a work that is at least entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I have read every Spenser book, and this is the worst. Since when did Spenser become some amoral Western gunslinger? It's almost as if Parker had no new ideas so he concocted this nonsense to get a bunch of familiar characters in one place at one time without any story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser Stays Fresh and Keeps Getting Better!","review":"As an author of a recently published mystery, I genuinely admire the work of Robert B. Parker. After nearly thirty Spenser books in as many years, Parker's Spenser series remains consistently fresh, and, in Potshot, it gets even better. In this latest novel, Spenser is Spenser, with his unique style, wit, and attitude. He is hired by a lovely widow and sets his sights on cleaning up an Arizona town. To accomplish his goal, Spenser enlists the help of a number of supporting characters from recent books. Parker's sidekick concept is a stroke of brilliance by a master of the mystery genre. Potshot has everything that his readers have grown to expect from Spenser and then some. Parker and Spenser keep walking the walk and talking the talk. Fast plot. Clever quips. Social observations. Well-researched ambience. I hope my work can remain as solid as Mr. Parker's after my next thirty books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Spenser, but pretty good","review":"I thought the last Spenser, Hugger Mugger was not all that great, but Potshot is much better. Not the best, but an entertaining read nonetheless. It is a fast and easy read, I finished it in about 3 hours. It is nice to see many of the characters from earlier novels have a reunion of sorts, although I typically prefer the Spenser novels when they are set in Boston, and not \\"on the road\\". The dialogue is typically good, with lots of deadpan humor involved. A very light read, but good, especially if you are a Spenser fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser's All Stars","review":"Lean to the point that it could be mistaken for a script, this entry in the series unites several of the good bad guys, that we have met before, to help our hero rid a town of bad bad guys.

The \\"good\\" bad gang VS the \\"bad\\" bad gang. Odds are 40 bad bads against 7 good bads. But the FBI and unknown spooks are FedEx'ing printouts of phone and bug taps of the \\"worst\\" bad guys. 40-7 ... we need this band of 7 in Iraq. This is more than childish leg-pulling by the author - it's actually disrespectful of Parker to serve out this as Spenser material to anyone who can read.

Borrow this from the library - or a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoning it in.","review":"Parker is a good writer, but I think he's fairly clearly bored with this series. It felt gimmicky and contrived and used irony in place of a plot.Not a good place to begin if you don't know the better books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"While the beginning kept my attention, the plot was weak, the characters were not very believable -- even the old stand bys like Hawk -- too worldly and intellectual -- for a tough guy goon. Even though I've been a Hawk fan in the past. And the ending was a boring let down. Not exciting or interesting. Kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Have been a Parker fan for years, and this was a disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potshot","review":"It is always a pleasure to read a Spenser novel by Robert B. Parker. He has written another winner with his new novel, \\"Potshot\\". Mary Lou Buckman hires Spenser to find out who killed her husband, Steve. Spenser must go to Potshot, Arizona where the Buckmans lived and where the murder took place. As he investigates, he finds that many people believe that someone in the Dell killed him. The Dell is a group of thugs who collect \\"protection\\" money from businesses in Potshot. Their leader is known as The Preacher. Then a group of Potshot VIP's hire Spenser to rid Potshot of the Dell. Spenser can solve the murder alone, but will need a small army to take on the Dell. He hires Hawk and Vinnie Morris from Boston, Tedy Sapp, a bouncer from Georgia, 2 Los Angeles thugs, and Bernard J. Fortunato, a tough guy from Las Vegas. Things are never what they seem in Potshot. This is an excellent addition to a long-running series, one of the best in American crime fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"These days, reading a Spenser mystery is like reading a comic book, which is OK -- I usually read them like candy after I read something really good. But Potshot wasn't even as entertaining as most comic books. The plot and the action were a tease -- neither went anywhere. And the ending was totally lame. For a similar but better book try Lee Child's Echo Burning. I love his descriptions of the desert and the heat, and his hero, Reacher, actually beats up the bad guys (fun!) and doesn't need to get his girlfriend and a bunch of his friends to tell us how wonderful he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Spenser novel","review":"I won't bother explaining the plot, The two previous reviewers have done a good job of that. Rather I'd like to welcome Spenser back. He seemed to have gone missing in Hugger Mugger but now he's back, as smart-alecky and tough as ever. And there's more as Mr. Parker brings together a bunch of previous tough guys from Spenser's other novels. Tedy Sapp is here, along with Chollo, Bobby Horse, Vinnie, Bernard J. Fortunato, and of course, Hawk. The whole thing is great fun and almost reminds you of the Earps versus the Daltons. Not great literature perhaps, but a good fun read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser Back on Top","review":"I would agree with most reviewers that the last few Spenser books were at best poor efforts. With Potshot, Parker is once again in great form. It was great to see some characters from past books appear in this one.One can only wonder what Parker will do next. I'd like to see a bit more about Spenser's past and have him grow in character, but if it ain't broke why fix it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser, Hawk, and Tedy are at it again!","review":"I love Robert Parker and even when he's not in top form, he's still better than most. This time out Spenser brings justice to Potshot, Arizona where his client hires him to find out who killed her hubby. (The widow is of course blonde and beautiful) I'm happy to say that 'Potshot' is full of the people we love the best in the Spenser series. Hawk, Susan, Tedy and even Lt. Quirk. This isn't a five star Parker but it is lots of fun and full of insights. A must for Spenser fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less There There Than Usual","review":"Even given that the Spenser stories are confections, ephemeral in nature, and not to be too closely examined for structure and logic, this latest offering is way, way too airy. The collecting of all the other (non-Spenser) tough guys from previous books to give our hero a hand in his latest endeavour is an intriguing idea, but once Parker's got them together, he provides little for them to do, and his disinterest becomes manifest very quickly. Die-hard Spenser fans - and I am one - will be left feeling more unsatisfied than usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"POTSHOT","review":"YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH A SPENSER BOOK.

The world Robert B. Parker created around the Boston detective Spenser (precursor to the \`Spenser for Hire' TV series) is simply complex. While the book can stand on it's own, _Potshot_ integrates characters from dozens of prior Spenser novel. Having spent time with these characters (and their motivations) in prior novels gives this book a richness that will escape first time readers.In terms of plot, yes, this is a mystery novel, but the mystery is usually an afterthought to character development. The off-the-cuff discussions Spenser and his cohorts have over breakfast regarding guns are far more interesting than whodunit. If you're looking for complex plot, keep moving... Parker writes characters and he writes them well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Potshot","review":"I've always liked Robert Parker's Spenser novels, but this one was boring and slow moving.

If you want good pictures, stay away from it.Note: The picture may look crisp and clear when you view them on the LCD but when you download them onto your PC, you'll regret.

By itself the book is decent, albeit not overly memorable, but as an attempt at another Wimsey novel it is sorely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad; not Lord Peter; and worst of all, not Sayers","review":"I should have known better. I thought that the pleasurable reading experience arose from Lord Peter and his brother, Denver, his formidable dowager mother, and all the other interesting characters from Bunter to Harriet and back again. But it wasn't created by them, it was Sayers. The characters she created were the instrument, but it was the lines they were given that I was enjoying. Without the wit and erudition Lord Peter comes across as a paper mache copy. Parker walks through his scenes, and Bunter is a shallow version of a gentleman's gentleman.The writing is not bad; but it's not Sayers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not whimsical enough","review":"She does a decent job with this but I tend to attribute that to her access to Sayers notes. Let's be honest about this book: it's fan fiction. It's not bad fanfic, but it is still derivative copying. Walsh is best at getting the feel of Sayers' dialog, particularly the patter of the Dowager Duchess and, occasionally, Peter himself. But she fails utterly with Uncle Paul, whose letters should be in French. Worst of all, she forgot the first rule of storytelling: show, don't tell.Cute, but it belongs at Fanfiction.net and Walsh should certainly make up her own characters instead of beating the Wimsey horse to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat embarassing","review":"Walsh uses a heavy hand to plaster over her lack of any real sense of the characters with irrelevant historical detail and misused motifs from the Wimsey canon. If you are a Wimsey fanatic, you won't be able to keep yourself from reading it, but be forewarned; you will find none of the graceful erudition, effortlessly reproduced vernacular, or delightful wordplay you found in Dorothy Sayer's completed works."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off with Sayers alone","review":"Speaking as a person who began reading Sayers' Wimsey books at the age of nine, I found the contributions of Ms. Walsh to be crudely apparent. It does not seem that she understands the characters very well. Regarded on its own, this is a moderately successful book, hence the two stars, but if you are seeking Lord (and Lady) Peter, it is much more rewarding to read any of Sayers' unaided works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is the best part","review":"Sayers it is not. You can pretty much see the drop-off where Sayers leaves off and the new gal takes on, not far in.Not worth your money. Frankly, not worth a trip to the library, except as a curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read. Don't spoil it for yourself by being snotty!","review":"First of all, this book is a delight, and if you like the Lord Peter Wimsey stories, read it!Finishing another's book is such a thankless task, and bound to be denounced by \\"experts\\" as a pale imitation, no matter how good it is. I tire of reading nitpicker after nitpicker whining about how surely the book was \\"ruined\\" because it was not exactly how they imagined Dorothy Sayers would have finished it.Bottom line, it is still excellent, and provides a sorely-needed fix for those that treasure Dorothy Sayers' writings and characters, as I do.To those of you who are spoiling it for yourself by snobbishly denouncing a highly enjoyable story that, by the way, has plenty of Dorothy Sayers elements--get over yourselves!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A much -appreciated, very strong effort","review":"Infinitely superior to (for example) the \\"sequel\\" to \\"Gone With The Wind\\" but given Walsh's obvious abilities, I think it could have been even better. Most glaring flaw: the characters were far too direct and plainspoken. Helen would NEVER been as openly and bluntly rude to Harriet as she was in this novel, nor would Harriet have dealt with it so straightforwardly. But, as a true Lord Peter addict, I'm very grateful for the novel anyway, and wouldn't mind seeing another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not ecstasy-producing","review":"It is quite a thrill to read a new Lord Peter book; I only wish he could have been there instead of the pale imitation who wears his shoes. Jill Paton Walsh has written a fine book, but has missed out on what I love Lord Peter and Harriet for: the wit and quotations. This book feels awfully serious compared to the flights of fancy in Busman's Honeymoon. I agree with the reviewer who objects to the \\"feel\\" of the book; it's too politically correct for the '30s or Dorothy Sayers. I felt that Walsh captured the Dowager Duchess and Uncle Paul quite well, but many of the characters are too obvious, too direct, too clear in their dialogue. Sayers's dialogue usually reveals more levels upon rereading; I doubt that Walsh's will. However, I am extremely grateful that someone finished this novel and gave us a chance to meet the characters again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome addition to the Wimsey canon","review":"Jill Paton Walsh has done an excellent job of completing the fragment left by Dorothy Sayres. It is very difficult to \\"see the join\\" and having read the novel, I would enjoy seeing what was original Sayres and what was created by the talented Ms. Walsh. The tone is very good and the crime and its solution very much in keeping with previous Lord Peter plots. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LORD PETER IS BACK","review":"After decades of having to re-read the Lord Peter canon, it was a real treat to come upon this new tiltle, a continuation of the Peter Wimsey saga. This book takes place following Busman's Honeymoon. It is GREAT! I highly recommend it not only to fans of Dorothy Sayers, but to all mystery fans. I hope Ms. Walsh will continue the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, it's just not the same","review":"we need to all accept that Dorothy Sayers has died and we won't ever have any new Peter Wimsey books from her. This book just isn't as good as Dorothy Sayers. The pity is that the new author tried to write in Dorothy Sayers's voice, and it just doesn't work. I think it would have been better if the woman had just written the newer stories about the Wimseys in her own voice. The book would have been better that way. Same Wimseys, different story teller, different point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seamless?","review":"No, sorry, if you know Sayers well, you definitely know where Walsh starts off.All the same it's a nice read, and the Sayers part is, as always, worth it.:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad on it's own but also not Sayers","review":"Although I'm glad to know that Sayers intended Peter & Harriet to have a happy ending. I think I knew that without reading this book. I wonder if Sayers notes weren't very extensive. The mystery seemed to be an after thought and didn't even begin untill the book was half over. I was annoyed by the fact that this author felt the need to work nearly every other character we've ever met in Sayers books in to this one. I found the introduction of a charachter that was bassicaly a femaly Bunter redundant. I'm also of the opinion that Bunter himself would have been appauled at the attempt to tie him up like a lose end. I don't want to say the book was all bad. I enjoyed it while I read it but I think other fans of Sayers works might find themselves dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good book","review":"I have read Busman's Honeymoon and most of the other Sayers novels more times than I can remember. I love her style, her humor, her ability to entertain and her ability to use the English language. It is fairly obvious why Ms. Sayers did not finish this book. The part of the novel written by Ms. Sayers is far below her usual standards. The part of the novel written by Ms. Walsh is so unlike anything Ms. Sayers would have written that I am amazed that some reviewers talk about the book being \\"seamless\\" and well-written. Dorothy Sayers is a great author, but she knew what she was doing when she stuck this book away in the safe. I'm sorry that her heirs didn't leave it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginning...Keep it going","review":"A worthy beginning, well worth the next excursion. While I may have found some of the constant references back to Sayers' works irritating, and the plot could have been better, I so enjoyed a new Wimsey saga that I couldn't put it down. This is worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crime","review":"Walsh took the notes that Sayers left for a Wimsey/Vane mystery, and finished it. I'd rather they had simply published the notes. It is quite obvious where Sayers notes ended, and Walsh is simply incapable of writing in anything like Sayers' voice. And she hasn't a clue about the psychology of the Lord and Lady Peter. Walsh may well write decent novels of her own, but I wish she'd kept her hands off Peter and Harriet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I am a big fan of the Peter Wimsey books, but I guess I don't qualify as hard-core. I really loved this book. I thought Walsh did an excellent job of recreating the characters and fleshing out a novel from Sayers' notes. The mystery was not incredibly complex, but the pschology in it was interesting. The ending of this book left me feeling ludicrously happy. I like a happy ending emerging from a sordid tale of murder, personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Tea","review":"I bought this book at a garage sale cuz I liked the cover. Well, you know what they say ... can't tell a book by its cover. Lol.Sorry, there just isn't any \\"beef\\" here, as in, \\"Where's the beef?\\" I heard of Dorothy Sayers and Peter Whimsey and really thought I was getting my hands on a classic. I read the whole thing cuz I was away in a beach house and there wasn't anything else to read.I was bored. The characters, the plot ... nothing except the cover, really, was worth reacting to.There's just no THERE there. Or here. Just none.I didn't dislike the characters; I just couldn't FIND the characters.Snoozeville.Oh, I forgot. There is one good scene. It's when characters go into a sewer.

That's the film's main problem--it is so heavy handed and somber that it doesn't really flesh out the storylines to make us care for the people. It's almost like a documentary; nothing really \\"happens.\\"Joely Richardson is lovely but her performance is lifeless; Scott Cohen fares a little better as the obsessed governor of Virginia; and Stacy Keach is appropriately bureaucratic. Ann Cusack takes acting honors, however, as the widow of the businessman responsible for bringing the virus into America. She evokes a lot of sympathy as a wife and mother who takes charge when things get really bad.A dark, disturbing if ultimately uneventful movie, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought that this movie was better than average","review":"It is true that it showed almost like a documentary; and I liked that about this movie. Many disaster movies focus on several troubled relationship and the main theme of the disaster is only a back drop; not so with this film.

The author did show the boredom of life created by the too regulated society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book drags on for ever!","review":"I did **eventually** manage to persuade myself to finish this book, mainly because I had enjoyed Varley's \\"Titan\\" so much. But this is nothing like as good.It has some interesting ideas, such as the recreational sex-change idea, the country communities and some of the central computer stuff, but it seems to go on for ages with nothing much happening.Give it a miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tale of the not-so-far-off future...","review":"One of Varley's finest novels. The book plays and counterplays the lives of the a humanity that has been expelled from Earth.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Interesting ideas, but...","review":"Overall it was an effort to finish reading because I repeatedly had little sense of direction for the novel. Characters come and go and the main character Hildy often does things, such as change sexes, that only seem like gimmicks. Many times he skips around to an overindulgent and annoying extent. I didn't find him overly sympathetic or interesting. However, It is interesting to think that people and even a supercomputer could become depressed as life becomes too easy as everything is taken care of down to morning breath. This is the only Varley book I've read to date. I get the sense from the way many chapters read like episodes, he may be a better short story writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, but Too Much Sex","review":"I love this book (I've read it three times now), but I still find that there's too much sex in it. I understand why he's got it there (a bored society), but I just don't want a sci-fi book with a sexual theme. If you pull out that, then this book is a classic. It's written in a very Heinleinish way (of course the more recent Heinlein books all revolved around sex, too). It takes a lot from Heinlein's \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.\\" Wonderful book, fun to read, but don't give it to the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last Varley book!","review":"There are very few books I have not or in the case could not finish reading. Obviously Varley appeals to some but I am not one of them. If you are looking for a fast paced Sci-fi adventure this is not the book for you. If you are interested in one man's distorted sexual view of everyday life in the future you might find this entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I loved this book. I was given it one day when i was recovering from an illness. I really enjoy the combination of humor and philosophy that Varley inserts into his books. This book was reminiscent of the better parts of 1984, especially with the Big Brother type theme. I enjoyed the constant twist in plot and his style that is so enjoyable to read. Unfortunately, I lent it to a friend one day, and haven't gotten it back! I can't wait to read it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover your ears","review":"The voice on this CD is so annoying that I couldn't fully absorb the words.

I took those principals to heart and I practiced them regularly. I always had a positive attitude and a great deal of faith in God. Still, I had problems in life. Just as we all have problems in life. I have since become a Christian. I now try to follow Jesus' examples (his life, teachings, etc.) Jesus did not want to suffer the passion. In fact, the bible said He feared suffering (not death) so much that He sweat great drops of blood. Finally He prayed, \\"Father, please let this cup pass from Me. Never the less, let Your will be done, not Mine.\\" This is the way we should pray.

People can't actually have that long of hair, nor short a skirt. It's just the artist's imagination! Besides, barbies have no right to go off unnoticed!

The one and only concrete piece of advice it has to give (to use open houses as the best sources of leads and new business) could have been condensed in a page and a half. Everything else amounts to little more than a cheesy pep talk. The book is poorly edited and the format (a conversation between two hypothetical people sitting next to each other during a plane flight) is highly irritating and an insult to the reader's intelligence.Had I had the opportunity to peruse this book in a bookstore, I never would have bought it.

You can't underestimate the importance of customer service to just about ANY business. By using a parable to make this point (complete with wonderful Thurberesque illustrations), Ms. Hately and Mr. Harvey actually make it more memorable than if it would be in a more conventional format. Not to mention much more fun. This should be required reading for every customer service department--it's short, accessible, and has a message that needs to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake up your next meeting","review":"Are you looking for something a little different for your next customer service meeting? Then try reading CUSTOMER AT THE CROSSROADS: FROM PARABLE TO PRACTICE by Barbara Hateley and Eric Harvey. Or better yet, read it a few times to learn the story details and then simply tell the story. Either way, your meeting will be interesting and a great variation from the norm.I recently used this book in a meeting of retail store managers. Each manager was assigned a character in the book and additional managers were the chorus. It was great fun and afterwards I received high praise for presenting them with a fun and unique learning tool.At only 48 pages, this little parable can easily be read in less than an hour, but the lessons learned could last a lifetime. Short & sweet. A good training tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take on gay (and straight) life","review":"This book is weird and unlike any gay fiction I've encountered. One could say that in some sense, the characters in it are unique, whatever their ethnic background. There are a lot of funny moments and stories that leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling about friendships across all kinds of boundaries. There really is a diet inside the title story, and the diet probably makes a lot of sense. Kudos to the author for a very sweet book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stories About Gay Relationships","review":"OK, so Grayson isn't David Foster Wallace, David Sedaris or Dave Eggers, but he's a minor league version of all three of those incredible writers, and his rambling, funny, self-conscious stories about gay relationships -- particularly between guys of different races & ethnicities -- are worth your time. Grayson seems to enjoy describing the endless ways people can be nice to each other. What conflict there is in the book is usually internal and external conflicts are resolved with humor and kindness. If you're looking for plot or traditional fiction, you'll hate this book. But if you like digressions, riffs on contemporary culture and the Internet, and puns, you'll enjoy \\"The Silicon Valley Diet.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Literary Tales","review":"Gay readers will enjoy the tender, jokey and affectionately messed-up relationships in these stories. Not much plot here, more slices of life dealing with stuff like gay cowboys in Wyoming post-Matthew Sheppard, dot-com geniuses searching for romance as well as big money, gay immigrants struggling to deal with the freedom America gives them, and a terrific series of stories about an interracial couple who keep breaking up in hilarious (and ridiculous) arguments about TV shows, politics, and Catholic dogma (a fight about what the Immaculate Conception is leads them to a wrestling match and a bondage scene). Here's the narrator of the title story in a typical commentary on hunting for love: \\"I'd long ago given up going to slaughterhouses and trying to approach aspiring Abercrombie & Fitch catalog models emitting radiation from isotopes of unobtanium.

Unfortunately it was gone before I could get to appreciate it. Here is Volume 3 of the saga, \\"Age of Ice\\" and though it tells a good story it at times feels disjointed, and as much as I love Pat Lee's art, sometimes it was just too dark to see what was happening. That said it's still worth it, and i'm currently doing what i can to find all the volumes and trades.

It is really two movies using the same characters and the same lousy overdubs. Some of the scenes are used in both movies so you get to see them over again with a different story and plot. Neither of the movies make any sense at all. How could you possibly get interrested in a character named Kung Fu Wong. The action sequences are incomprehensible. The acting is horrible. As previously stated, the overdubbed english speaking voices are probably the worst part. I really wish I could somehow get the time I spent watching it back. I could do something constructive with it, like change the air in my truck tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I've seen","review":"This is a Chinese film in English with subtitles, set during the Qing dynasty. To be fair, it might not have been so bad if it was in Chinese with English subtitles, but the dubbing is terrible.

I anxiously awaited this title, after reading and rereading Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany. The prose that I found endearing in full chapters becomes trite and overproduced in smaller chunklets. I further find that pages and pages of artfully blurry photographs add little to the book.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Blindly Faithful Lovers Only","review":"Frances Mayes adds \\"In Tuscany\\" as the third in her seemingly never-ending series about life in Bella Toscana-- following her hugely successful \\"Under A Tuscan Sun,\\" its sequel \\"Bella Tuscany,\\" and several calendars. Unfortunately this latest effort left this reader greatly disappointed, as the author fashions verbal portraits of standard aspects of Italian life (e.g. the cucina-- kitchen; piazza, etc.). This time around, she adds complementary photos-- but many are soft focus, artsy blurred images, rather than the stunning, breathtaking images found in many other books, such as \\"Most Beautiful Villages in Tuscany.\\" Take a peek before you lay your money down.

Although \\"The Beauty Bible\\" by Paula Begoun is similar in content and conclusions, I preferred this book because it was more medical, less gender specific, and not as much about cosmetics. However, Ms. Begoun's \\"Don't go to the Cosmetics Counter without Me\\" is the perfect companion to the \\"...Idiot's Guide to Beautiful Skin\\" and will help you locate the types of products you will be looking for, once you absorbe the information provided by Dr. Gordon.

There's a ton of basic information on everything from skin cancer to skin care during pregnancy, though most of the chapters are very short and barely touch on the subjects before moving onto something else. Too much information on nearly every kind of skin disease/rash/etc. that exists, and only one extremely brief (and not very useful) chapter on makeup.

Although it does not give lists of cosmetics and products one should choose, it rather focuses on how to go about choosing what is right for one's own particular skin care problems. This offers no quick fixes, only useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Read","review":"Skeleton in the Closet was a poor rendering of the causes and effects of an eating disorder. Besides the frequent grammatical errors and inconsistent style the book never manages to offer any original insight on eating disorders on either a personal or cultural level. The dialogue is confusing and the descriptions are given in a childlike, colorless manner. The author at one point even referred to an African-American nurse as a \\"colored lady,\\" an outdated and offensive reference.

The book was written almost 20 years ago and I think that it shows its age. The heroine is beautiful, but appears to have no other positive qualities. She's not obviously intelligent, witty, insightful, or compassionate. It takes her over 400 pages to *almost* figure out the obvious. In addition, the heroine is constantly being saved by the hero. I prefer a woman who can take care of herself. The romance in this book is based on the heroine betraying her husband, and there are several instances of the outdated idea that when a woman says \\"No\\" she really means \\"Yes.\\" I find none of these plot devices particularly romantic.Read something, anything, by Julie Garwood instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long,,boring,,","review":"this book could have been written in tow thirds of its length.i skimmed through most if it. and i didn't like the ending,how he was not what he seemed.too nicely wrapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I usually enjoy Woodiwiss's work and to be honest, I have no idea what everyone is seeing in this one! I had the \\"secret\\" of the story figured out about 50 pages into the book and found the so called heroine to be shallow and petty. The story was OK, but outdated and not all that exciting. How many times must this girl get herself into trouble and then have her dashing hero come to her rescue?!? She is not a strong woman in the least - instead, she comes of as silly, stupid and weak waiting for a man to come get her out of all the messes she gets into. I was disappointed in this book and was glad that I had gotten it from the library instead of actually paying for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"This was such a stupid \\"romance\\" novel. Erienne was so immature and selfish. I don't know what Christopher saw in her that he would go to such lengths to keep \\"winning\\" her. There was too much other stuff going on, and waaaaaayyyyyyy too much detail, which is a huge distraction in a story. I was so bored reading this, and Erienne was so cold to her husband.

Sigh...","review":"This was the first book that I've read from Kathleen Woodiwiss and after reading it I instantly became a Woodiwiss fan. I love the characters in here, Erienne so feisty and full of energy, Christopher although handsome but to me his character had a charming, boyish quality that I liked. And last Lord Saxton, so mysterious and intriguing I kept questioning who he is, even though I had my suspicions it was Christopher. Woodiwiss writes this book like poetry and makes me sigh everytime I read it. This is the type of book you can read over and over again and never get tired but enjoy it endlessly. A definite keeper and favorite of all the Woodiwiss books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first romance novel","review":"The is the very first romance novel I have ever read. I read it several times since then and I still love it. I'll say this is in my top 10 all time favorites. I guess because it was my first romance reading. It is comical, suspenseful, has a lot of adventure and finally, mystery. I like that I could escape to another era of time and place where I was there next to the characters themselves vividly.

One that carries a devil or a Robinhood. As usual everything works out alright and Erienne already has her man.

I felt Kathleen Woodiweiss writings of the heart skipping a beat whenever Erienne and Christopher came into contact was spot on....anyone who's ever been in love knows that feeling when your heart feels like its fallen to your knees and you feel like everyone can tell!!!

I am on page 238 and I refuse to continue, since I already know the ending as if you can't figure it out from the moment Christopher asks Ben about it. Erienne is a BIATCH!!! I hate her so much she's a shallow vapid flouzy (sp?). I wish sometimes that someone accidently shot her and the book would have an abrut ending.

Upon a good friend's recommendation, I read \\"A Rose in Winter.\\" Ahem. Aside from a page of shameless pilfering from the Phantom of the Opera, a Scooby Doo sort of predictability throughout the whole story, a heroin who manages to experience attacks on her virtue at just about every stop on the road (and sometimes in the carriage), lines from the hero that are so cheesy they could put Velveeta out of business, and a villain that is the rich equivalent of Snidely Whiplash (complete with mustache), A Rose in Winter was...okay. The characters were some fun, and the plot at least tried to have twists. If you're into strenuous reading, but don't mind putting rational thought on hold for the hour and a half it takes to read this book, go ahead--but don't expect to be surprised by the way things turn out. If you're into pure escapism--have at it, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"A Rose in Winter and Shanna are my two favorite books by Kathleen E Woodiwiss, and my third favorite is The Wolf and the Dove (which I got my daughter's name from, seven years before she was born. :) ). Strong women (though Shanna is rather a spoiled brat at the beginning of her story), strong male leads, really great writing. I've read, or tried to read a couple of Woodiwiss' newer books and couldn't do it. I'm not sure they are really written by the same person. It seemed like the writer was just trying to copy the same style. Sorry, rather rambling review, but I do enjoy these three books.

And they are lighter in thickness (ounce weight), which may be a plus to some people in our hot climate. They are 4 inches narrower in width around the chest & waist than the same one purchased at Target. We test washed one in warm water & low heat in the dryer to see if it would shrink & it did like another customer mentioned, and now it fits like a medium size.

We actually heard the ejection charge go off almost straight above us (several hundered feet above us!), but never saw the rocket again. The tiny size combined with the poor choice in colors made it a definate bust. We learned a valuable lesson. In comparison, we have another rocket that happens to be yellow, flies to about 600-700 feet and is about twice the size. It has seen around 20 filghts and is still going strong.

The description of this movie is misleading, there are no zombies, no ravenous anythings, just stupidity laced with boredom. I waited for almost an hour for something to happen in this movie, and still nothing.It starts out as if it is going to be a good movie but it's a lie. Im sure you've read the previous reviews you know the plot, or lack there of. There was one interesting part of the entire movie, and that was when the comic relief died. Now this means two things. For one, it took place in the middle of the movie so that meant the other half is a waste. Second, now there is no entertainment what so ever as far as dialog goes. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This was one lame movie, a tedious mishmash which looked good on the Blockbuster shelf, but which conspired to put me to sleep.

There are no zombies, even though the title of the the movie is \\"island of the dead\\" and it takes place on an island full of many unidentified bodies. There's not even any witty dialog, which is the only saving grace of some otherwise unbearable horror movies.There is also a flashback of some girls jumping rope, which has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the movie, and it is shown 3 or 4 times. It's there to make the director feel like he's artsy.Please save 90 minutes of your life, and pass on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Movie","review":"Honestly, I like this movie. I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the scenes with the children dancing detracted from the plot.

The subject was interesting enough but she was so repetitious that it was tiring. Her books are what I consider very easy, quick reads that you can get through in a day but I had to skip around much because of the repetitiveness. Example: On one page she'll describe her relationship with her husband and then you go to the next chapter she'll give another recap and then another and another. Maybe not always in the same words but you get the gist of it. If you read it, you'll get what I'm saying. Needless to say, very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"I have read every Danielle Steele book she has every written, this one is just your typical woman in trouble story. Ms. Steele's writing of late has become encreasingly predictable. She always has a woman in peril, she finds her way out, falls in a bad situtation again, and finds a man to help her get out of it. This book does do a very good job of addressing the subject of verbal/emotional abuse but the rest of the story is a waste of time. I read Ms. Steele's books for what I call escapism not to have a moral lesson shoved in my face, when I want that I will read my bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unbelievable","review":"Though most of Steel's books are fluff pieces, this one was not even believable. Maddy manages to meet a pregnant woman during a cave in at a shopping mall, and magically adopts her then unborn child within weeks. Ask any adoptive parent if this is even remotely how things work. They will tell you no. Additionally, she is news anchor in a major market with virtually no on camera experience, also not possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond fiction","review":"DS has churned out another predictable, improbable, formulaic story.

In the past, she seems to basically repeat the same story, rich man, rich woman, only changing the characters' names and the setting.

Much repetition, and I was disappointed with the writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I generally can overlook Steele's run-on sentences and stereotypical characters, but in \\"Journey,\\" the storyline is so weak and predictable, the grammatical issues simply jump out and scream at the reader.

Save your pennies for Star, Malice, and mixed blessings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Read","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed reading this novel, it took me less than 24hrs to read. I've found that reading Danielle Steel novels you always learn some valuable information even if the story line does not always ring true to life. But hey, isn't that what romance novels are all about? The heroine always has money,or stumbles on to it and things generally work out in the end. There's great information on abuse here and hopefully a few women have been saved by this. Despite some of the other negative reviews this book got, if you love Danielle Steel or romance novels you'll like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more cookie-cutter than her other books","review":"I have read many of Danielle Steel's novels, and have actually really enjoyed most of them. You can't expect anything deep, but they are entertaining and relaxing. However, I have found that she is beginning to rest on her laurels a bit. Not only is she sticking with the same basic formula, she's starting to reuse characters. Maddy, the successful network anchor in Washington, D.C. is practically the exact same character as Mel, the successful network anchor from New York, as in Changes, which came out several years ago. That gets boring. Plus the endings get tied up in a pretty bow too quickly now. Stick with her earlier works for the best reads (even the relatively recent Accident and Lightning are better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Journey","review":"I agree with the other person who commented on Danielle's overuse of the word \\"and\\". Her run-on sentences are very annoying, but I can usually overlook them if I like the story. Of course, this is a very disturbing story, but that was not my main objection. It was the constant use of vulgar language. I truly believe she could have had just as effective a story without the use of language, especially by Maddy. Maybe the awful husband, but Maddy did not need to stoop to his level of speech. It changed her character when she began using his gutter language back to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I have read all of Steel's books over the years, and I have been increasingly disappointed with each new attempt. Journey was no exception. Though her portrayal of domestic abuse was well-intentioned, I found the character development weak. The reader gains no insight into Jack's life, including his childhood or background. Maddy's discovery of her long-lost daughter seemed too sudden and coincidental. Amazingly, Lizzie had no negative feelings toward her mother for abandoning her and never attempting to find her. The plot was overly simplistic; such a serious topic as domestic abuse deserves more in-depth exploration without the wealthy, fantasy life overtones found in all of Steel's books. Definitely not one of Steel's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT THOSE HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! This book is dangerous!!","review":"Luckily, I listend to the audio tape version and was spared the \\"grammar\\" issues. However, I feel sorry for the poor reader who had to wade through this garbage (grammar errors and all). This book is the most insultingly dangerous collection of bovine excrement that I have ever read. Any woman trapped in an abusive relationship SHOULD NOT take the advise of the so called \\"expert\\" in the book.

This long 353 page book could have easily been 100 pages shorter. The highly charged subject matter of verbal and emotional abuse is very absorbing, but the author Danielle Steel, is continuously repeating herself over and over again. The main character Maddy Hunter is a very well known T.V. anchorwomen, married to her husband Jack, who is head of the TV network. Jack \\"rescued\\" Maddy from a previous abusive marriage and now jack is verbally abusing Maddy. The story seemed too \\"fake\\", too bad Danielle Steel's main character Maddy always seems to need the help of a man to get her out of bad situations. The unrealistic fairytale ending added to my dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than advertised","review":"It's not a bad umbrella if you are looking for a 6 foot one. The manufacturer's description claims that it is 7.5 foot wide. I measured it and it is at most 7 foot wide (from corner to corner), but only 6 foot from flat side to flat side. That makes it an average of 6.5 foot wide, not the 7.5 advertised by fiberbuilt."},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Sports got it right - This game is great","review":"I don't consider myself much of a sports fan in any stretch of the imagination what so ever, yet when I started watching Rugby on Universal Sports I seemed to be strangely drawn to it. Normally, I go for role playing, simulator and action adventure games like Subterrania and Ecco The Dolphin etc. Just for the heck of it I went on Amazon to see if a video game existed that captured the pace and realism of Rugby and I found this one at a very good price. It was more than I ever expected. EA Sports got all the detail from the commentators covering the game and players getting into disputes down to the logo zipping across the screen. After a while you feel like you're actually watching a real match. You also feel the tackles and kicks with the dual shock controller. It's like being in the game yourself, but a whole lot safer. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Rugby. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be Better","review":"This is the first Rugby game I've ever played. It's a pretty decent game but I recommend that you go through the tutorial section of this game which will show you how to play the game, it's rules, and all of it's controls which sometimes can be confusing unless you practice alot. The gameplay is decent and the graphics are okay (could be alot better). The commentators are okay also but you'll notice that they will start to repeat themselves alot (one seems to do alot more talking than the other). Maybe EA will take more time and energy into delveoping Rugby 2006? Unless you're a Die Hard Rugby fan, I'd stick with one of the other EA sport titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am surprised to see such favorable reviews of this book.

All were able to create believable, everyday characters and set them in an historical context, with the main focus being how the lives of individuals were affected by their time in history. Dunbar's Cove is about the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority), the gov't takeover of land that belonged to small landholders, and its affect on those individuals. Although a work of fiction, these are events that did take place, and real lives were affected forever. The ultimate questions this book asks is which takes priority, individual rights or the common good? And does the ends justify the means? The issue of eminent domain is just as relevant now as it was in the days of the Roosevelt Administration. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Insight","review":"This is a pretty poorly produced little documentary. - I mean the quality of the film.

Some interesting concepts may keep you turning the pages but the novel is unremarkable in every positive way I can come up with. I was often left wondering if the authors heart was in what he was writing. In the end I didn't plan to quit reading it but found myself picking it up less and less until it got kicked under the bed and vanished for a few months whereupon I had zero desire to finish the last 100 or so pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score one for the Homonids","review":"The story in a nutshell: in a parallel universe, the Neanderthals evolved to become the dominant species while the humans died out. The book's hero, Ponter Bondit, Neanderthal and all around nice guy finds, himself in a parallel universe, namely ours!The story alternates between Bondit's partner trying to figure out a way to get Ponter back (along with other problems I won't mention so as not to spoil the book) and Ponter's experiences on an Earth (ours) decidedly different than the one he came from.What makes the book fascinating is how, sociologically, the Neanderthals dealt with the problems of society. The book gets just a little heavy handed when dealing with our abuses of the environment (vs the saner choices of the Neanderthals) - but it makes valid points and is very thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The book opens in a promising way, nice science setup in a fictional context, nice introduction of the alternate universe... And then all of a sudden, a female character (who appears to be one of the main characters) is raped. No foreshadowing, no indication that something like that might happen in the book, nothing. The scene is completely out of the blue and gratuitous, and it was more than enough to turn my stomach and make me put the book away (and pretty much ruined my day). For anybody who has issues with this subject - I recommend you give this book a wide pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great premise and good execution","review":"I really enjoyed Sawyer's hominids. The parallel universe premise was somewhat of a stretch, both when the Neanderthal hero transports to the Human world and when he transports back, but in between, as we follow the events in the two universes - the Neanderthal world now missing the hero and the Human world trying to make sense of this intruder - it's a great story, and I don't know how this could have been done without the parallel universe mechanism. Sawyer does it with as much credibility as is possible with a lot of quantum physics jumbo that is (almost) convincing. The description of the two very different societies is the best \\"alien\\" vs human comparison I've read in along time, and the many shortcomings of humanity are embarrassingly clear. I will definitely read volume two of this trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatred of humanity cloaking device","review":"This series is a political screed. It is not one darn thing more or less. The author used a very limp and shallow story line as the mechanism to preach to his readers on topics of population control, pollution, atheism, the value and morality of absolute state monitoring of all individuals - and on and on and on some more. I bought the trilogy on a \\"whim and a click\\" based on the first book winning the Hugo award... didn't bother to read the reviews here in Amazon. My bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Success from Sawyer - A Great Ancient Man Story","review":"Well, not quite an ancient man story. Its not like a preserved Stone Age guy reborn today and groping around, but an alternate universe story, where Neanderthals were the evolutionary winners - not Homo sapiens. Of course, not unlike a previous novel of his \\"Flashforward\\", a physics experiment goes awry. As a result, a subject from the Neanderthal universe gets transported to our world - and then the fun begins. What is also hilarious, are the cutbacks to the Neadnerthal world and what Sawyer has conjured up there! What fun. I can't wait for more of this in his trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and dissapointing","review":"Although Sawyer writes competently I gave it 2 stars for failure to live up to possibilities. Two humanoid societies interact after 40,000 or so years of separate development with differing histories, cultures, values, etc. What happens? We obsess about the characters and love lives of Mary (the human) and the Neantherthal (whatsisnameagain, he looks like Arnold without the chin), a couple of boring representatives of their species. \\"Harlequin\\" as another reviewer labeled it, sounds right.I think Sawyer's desire that things turn out right prevents a sense of danger or conflict that might make things work. I kept waiting for the Pentagon to start war-gaming the possibilities (you could send an army over in New Mexico and have it pop up in Beijing for instance), for the Neanderthal vs Human championship(Neanderthals win), but all I got is this unrealistic plot and goody-goody philosophy.Oh well, back to the Martian Chronicles, Dune, whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average..could have been so much more. 2.5 stars.","review":"This book caught my eye a while ago, and I'd been dying to read it since it seemed like such a novel concept. Sawyer's treatment of the subject is average, though, with little excitement and a simplistic plotline. Not to mention an unnecessary love story. It's a very easy read, despite the detailed discussions of religion, morality and quantum physics that pepper it. Perhaps because these are mercifully cut short just shy of becoming wearying.If you are looking for an exciting sci-fi thriller with an intelligent *story*, not just an interesting concept, this isn't it. Nothing really \\"goes wrong\\". For a casual read when you have nothing better to do, it's all right.

It was able to hold my attention enough not to relieve me of some insomnia I was experiencing one night. What I liked best about this book is that I was completely expecting the government to come in and try to abduct the poor Neanderthal like they did with ET, Starman, and Bumblebee from Transformers.\\"Of coarse!\\" I said when I realized that that wasn't going to happen. Because this book takes place in Canada! A land where scientists can have intelligent conversations with a being not of this world (as we know it, at least) and a shady government agency doesn't try to interfere. Instead, in one scene the Canadian government dispatches some mounties to protect them from pesky reporters. That kind of storytelling makes me smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done in 4 chapters","review":"When a smart, intelligent woman gets raped on a college campus, and then suddenly decides NOT to tell the police, the book gets put back.

It felt like it had the plot of a short story, stretched out to accommodate people talking about stuff the writer researched. The main character Mary was raped, and I had the feeling the writer didn't really think hard about women's reactions to rape. It read more like a guy thinking about how he guesses a woman might feel about being raped. This is no small criticism since much of the book tries (and rarely succeeds) to deal with gender rolls and violence. Sorry, but this is a pass-it-up kind of book.

In Hominid you spend most of your time in the Neanderthal world. This is the first in the Neanderthal Parallax trilogy. It is followed byHumans (Volume Two of The Neanderthal Parallax), thenHybrids (Neanderthal Parallax).Gunner July,2007"},{"rating":"1","title":"good science,Poor storytelling","review":"its the scientific ideas that make this book worthwhile.The storyline and narrative is quite thin and uninspiring, although the characters are quite well drawn.Don't know if I'll bother with the sequels however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Novel","review":"I really did not enjoy this novel. It contains a gratuitous rape scene.It is boring and silly in parts. Many factual errors are found throughout the book: a kind friend should tell Mr. Sawyer that Schaffhausen is a canton in Switzerland, not a breed of dog.I threw my book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect science!","review":"As an anthropologist who loves to study early and extinct hominids, I was very disappointed in the science of this book. For one thing, Neanderthals DID have a slightly large cranial capacity than us BUT they had less developed frontal lobes (reasoning ability). With less reasoning ability than us, it would be absolutely impossible for them to create a society as complex as Sawyer made it. Also, they had a less complex language center in their brain, so there was no way they could have such a well-developed language!With that said, it would be a fun read for people who don't know a lot about Neanderthals. For people who do; I would stay away because the annoyingly incorrect science of this book is both distracting and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pretty much sucks","review":"My wife orders this because from the picture and some of the other reviews it looks pretty good. Once we got it home and mounted it we quickly changed our minds. I gave it 2 stars because it is very strong and fairly easy to install. Those are the good points.The frame is designed with a large space on each side that serves no purpose I can see except to expose all the wires and prevent them from remaining contained in the casing. The holes for the wires to pass through are so big you see every wire inside & out and they also permit the wires to easily fall out.We took it down after taking the time to mount it and tried to line the case with black felt to conceal the wires. This thing is going on ebay tomorrow. You can have it cheap if you hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEERLESS PM610 (not ready for prime time)","review":"Unlike other reviews I will not call this item a P.O.S. I will, however, state that unless you have a moderate level mechanical aptitude I would suggest you try another wall mounted stand. The wall mounting was self-explanatory and the shelves are quite stable. The problem lies in that the shelves themselves do not have adequate spacing for \\"all\\" makes of equipment. I had to remove one set of arms from the mounting bracket with a cutting wheel (kudos on your weld jobs)and re-weld them lower on the mounting bracket to allow enough space for my receiver, DVD, and cable box. Don't buy unless you can cut, weld, and swear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, bad quality control","review":"I like the design. It looks solid and it doesn't stick out when you put your components on it. This is why I bought it. However, the 4 holes on top and bottom don't align with each other. Only 1 screw can fit the top and 1 screw fits the bottom. I have to use my own smaller screws to patch the other holes to make it not rotating. Could this be why it's sold at a discount? Buy it at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great!","review":"I have mine mounted next to my plasma tv with the power cords of all my equipment going through the wall behind the tower to an outlet in my garage.

It will no longer mist the oil. I am having the same problem the other reviewer was having. I love the concept on the product if and when it works. I have cleaned it repeatedly with alcohol, but it does not work as before. I did try sticking by finger in the top and the mist came out for a short time. There is one thing you have to be careful with do not use a thicker oil. The product is not inexpensive so think twice before your purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good price","review":"The product is good. I've used them for years. Normally you can get a pack of 25 strips for around $6. When I saw this had \\"32\\" per package for $5 I figured that was a good deal.It's not a good deal. It's a terrible deal.There are only FOUR (4) strips in the package. Each strip has 8 spacers so they're claiming there are 32 in the package. This is NOT the correct way to mark this product.So in a regular (full price) brick and mortar store you can get 25 strips (8 spacers each) for $6.In this listing you get 4 strips for $5. That's a pretty awful price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacers electrics in old houses.","review":"If you've got an old house, or at least one with plaster walls you may need these spacers. If the receptacle box is too low, so switches and sockets don't line up with the cover plate, these spacers go between the switch or receptacle and the box to let it align with the surface of the wall. They are packaged in a set of three, each of which has 10 1/8\\" nesting spacers. You'll need a stack at the top and bottom of a given receptacle (which is hopefully helpful is deciding how many you need). These things are easier to use and way more elegant than a stack of washers from Ace hardware and such. Highly recommended for the older house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I like so much this fragance. It is light, but at the same time the scent last.

By the way it has many different scents, but this is the one that I prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many great uses.","review":"These crispy noodles have a lot of great uses. We use them to top all our stir frys and all our chinese/japanese dishes.A super use of these is to add a whole can to a standard green salad. They add a super nice crunch to the salad and taste far better than croutons."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 pages of info in 400 pages","review":"It's not that the things in this book are wrong, it's that they are merely common sense, and there is a -lot- of repetition. Hey, if you're hiring people, you might want a contract. If you're starting a business, you might want an accounant. If you're making a game, you need a plan first. The polls have about sixty respondents each, and only two or three projects are examined 'in-depth'.On the plus side, it is helpful to see some industry jargon in context, and to know what some publishers will expect to hear within 90 seconds if they're going to take interest in a product.Bottom line, this book should not be 400 pages long and cost $40. You can find a lot of this stuff on message boards, or by just asking a programmer how his day was."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Book!","review":"I am roughly at the half-way point in this book but I must say that I am very pleased with it. The content is thorough and very well presented. David Michael does a great job at explaining the Indie scene as a contrast and comparison of the mainstream Game publishers. The context is placed in the Indie spere of development and related business practices. Short (~10 pages), but complete, chapters offer byte size knowledge to help you move from the 'great idea' stage to a finished product. It will not help you physically create the game but rather be a mentor to guide you during the development life cycle. Bottom line: get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone getting into indie development should read this.","review":"This is a very well-written book that covers all the major areas of indie game development, publishing and marketing. I really wish I could have had the information contained in this book 5 years ago, I'd probably be alot further along with my business.For new developers just starting out in the indie scene there are some major pitfalls that can consume years in wasted work. This book helps you avoid those pitfalls. There is also a great deal of established knowledge within the indie game development communnity that most new developer's are un-aware of. And they spend years discovering things that many people before them have already discovered. This book does a good job of putting all that knowledge in one place.Even for the experienced indie game developer there is quite alot of useful information in this book.I highly recommend reading this book for anyone that is in the indie games business or planning to get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't say i've 'made it' but great concepts","review":"anyone doing game development of any kind should read this book to get an idea of what things that all game developers (including large organizations) must tackle in every decision they make.Legal issues, team building issues, art issues, marketability issues, etc.I really enjoyed the book and hope to put the knowledge to good use some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems and crashes","review":"There were too many crashes and system freezes when I installed this card (ATI & Voodoo have worked great on my system).

I HAD TO MANUALLY RE-INSTALL ALL OF MY PALM-PILOT, ISP SOFTWARE, SOUND DRIVERS, and every possible thing you can imagine to be re-installed. Basically, it trashed my computer.

I am on my 2nd one by choice, the 1st one lasted over a year but has faded in the sun over time. I think its a great way to attempt to keep the sun out of the back of the car whether driving or parked. My only issue would be, because its universal, I drive a Maxima and would like if it was a bit longer on either side to better cover each of the 3 back seats. The sun shoes through on either side about 4\\" and I have 3 children, so 1 may always have the sun on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR PRODUCT","review":"THIS HAS THE WORST SUCTION CUPS EVER.

Once you get used to it being back there it's not too difficult to see out of the rear window, and I find it helps a little with glare from headlights at night. It keeps the sun off of my kids, and fits the entire back window in my small sedan. And it was really easy to install. The suction cups stay in place for a good majority of the time. The only time they come undone is when the weather changes (like hot to cold weather), but any suction cup would do that. I would recommend this to anyone, as I don't have any problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea -- but suction cups didn't stick to glass","review":"This sun screen is a great idea, but I couldn't get the hard black rubber suction cups to stick to the glass.

If someone is sitting in the back seat, they have to keep re-attaching them. Most of the time, however, I'm driving alone with my son, so I'm back to using the carseat canopy for shade...which he hates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I purchased this item for my son, as I do not have tinted windows and he graduated from an infant carrier to a regular carseat. I bought 3 of them (one to use on the back window, and 2 for the side windows) and I must say they don't work that well. Sun still manages to hit my son's face, making the car ride uncomfortable for him. Not only that, the suction cups on the sunshades don't stick very well. I'm constantly having to stick them back up every few minutes. Would I buy these again? Definitely not, and I wouldn't recommend them either. Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful....

First of all is super dark and you are enable to see anything from the back window. It is not safe for the driver!! As for the shade that gives the baby it is not good at all! My baby was still fuzzing from the sun. I guess I'm reallydissapointed in this product and hope to find something better. Also forgot to say that the way that they have it installed in the picture is not at all they way you will end up doing it, unless you have the same type of car they used for this picture/product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this to use in the back of a subaru wagon. It doesn't cover the whole back window...which is probably to be expected with a station wagon. However the real deal breaker was that it is a distraction. I think it would be too dark to use while driving at night. And during the day it was just a pain. You can sort of see through it but I didn't feel like it did my baby any good and I'd rather see clearly while driving so I took it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!!","review":"The product's suction cups won't stay up for more than 30 seconds! It doesn't completely block the sun from hitting my baby's eyes. The product creates a blurred and darkened rear vision. I don't feel safe and in control with the thing up, especially at night and when I have the baby in the car. So it has to be continuously removed for night driving- that is if you can somehow make it stay up for that long! I had to pull over on the freeway a couple of times; once in order to make the suction cups stick during the day and another time to get the one side that was still up, down in order to have a clear view of the road at night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I purchased!!","review":"This shade did not fit the entire back glass like I had hoped. Even though it covers most of the area, the sun still seems to find the spots where it is not covered. Regardless, I am happy with this purchase. It does shield my daughter's face from the sun and prevents her from squinting. I would defintely recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay put","review":"I have a 2010 Honda Civic sedan. I put this sunshade across the rear window, after following all manufacturer's suggestions for preparing the surface, and no matter what I do, the shade doesn't stay put. The cups lose their suction quickly, or come loose with the slightest breeze. I'm not sure if this problem is due to the embedded heating elements in the rear window that don't allow for good suction or if it's just not a good quality product. If anyone has found a way to make the shade stick, I'd be interested in hearing the solution. It is also too wide (from top to bottom) and doesn't stretch taut. I tuck it into the back seat as far as I can, but it just doesn't seem to be a good fit. It does provide adequate sun protection, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have a Honda Civic sedan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is not the one shown","review":"I bought the sunshade because I thought it would be white on one side and black on the other (as pictured). It is all black and hard to see through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size is nice, attaches well","review":"This is a bit flimsy but works as we expected. I'm giving it a 1 star deduction because your children can easily rip it off. We did not have much problem in that regard but others may have worse luck.We also use this in an SUV to block the side windows because the doors have large windows and most other shades don't fit the whole window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I bought this product ending July and for the 2 months I've had it, it's been great at providing shade from the sun to the rear seating area. The suction pads that holds the screen have stayed intact since I first installed it, another plus for this product. Not only does it shield the baby from direct sunlight, I've noticed that the interior of the car is much cooler than when I wasn't using it during the daytime. The downside though, is that it reduces visibility and also blurs images seen via the rear view mirror during the daytime and very much so at night. Overall I will recommend this product, since it does what it's intended for, at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money","review":"This is the second purchase of this shade. I really found that it protected my son the first time with no tinted windows but in my new vehicle that has slightly tinted windows it does nothing to protect him now. The suction cups do not keep the shade up either. The fabric is transparent enough to see during the day and night. I would rather just pay to have a darker tint put on my window than to buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with hatchbacks","review":"I have a Toyota Prius which is a hatchback car. This shade just hangs down but you cannot secure it to anything on the bottom.(It has two tabs that are suppose to squeeze between the back seat and the back panel most hatch backs have a big gap there.) This is not a big deal until you open your windows and the shade starts flapping all over the place.On the plus side it did cover the whole back window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Provides great area of coverage. Entire rear window is blocked from sun & it really does filter sunlight well from my rear facing twin infants.

Unfortunately there was very little in the film, as produced and designed' too back up any of my epectations. All the settings were very ordinary and the idea of the floating aircraft landing island was completely undeveloped. In comparison to earlier 'si.fi' films, like 'Metropolis', 'Aelita, The Queen of Mars' etc it was very poor and very disappointing.

I don't think it belongs in Embry-Riddle's graduate programs because it does not meet the needs of experienced professionals. As an undergraduate overview of the systems design process, it is good. However, the author does not even touch helicopters, seaplanes, or lighter-than-air-technology. So, the book would be more aptly named \\"Introduction to Airplane Design.\\"Some of his information on armament systems is grossly inaccurate. Furthermore, the systems design process section does not reflect the current state of the art in the discipline of Systems Engineering.

The bride- kidnapped and taken away by bad guys to the big city never to see her child/husband/friend again. And then- bam! We're in San Francisco with a very American main character named Meena who we're supposed to relate to as the child bride. But of course by now, she's educated, wears jeans and jogs, and has a great job in computer software. A Quantum leap into the future. Ms. Kirshner had the right beginning but took the story in the wrong direction. I kept reading the book, mainly because I was very interested in the Indian/Bengali cultural aspects of the story. Also. the \\"caught between two cultures\\" idea seemed realistic. The rest of the story ended up being a schmaltzy love story with a predictable ending. Everyone \\"adjusted\\" way too easily to the conclusion. Disappointing at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main Character's voice rings false","review":"The novel starts of with a bang and promptly loses itself in weak harlequin romance-type prose. As an Indian-American woman that is Meena's age, I found Meena's character to be utterly unrealistic. Meena's voice was not that of a woman that migrated from India between at age 7, but rather of an Indian immigrant my mother's age (or Ms Kirschner's age) who obviously idealizes the India because it was home. The about-face in attitude towards India that Meena experiences towards the end of the book is abrupt and not consistent with the character as she is described. Neither the story nor the manner in which it is told is praiseworthy. An example of the pitfalls a first-time author falls into..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny and unoriginal","review":"I at first was drawn in by the opening chapters of this book---the description of her wedding at the age of 7, her kidnapping, the description of Calcutta. But as the story went on, found Kirchner's story overly dramatic, with such implausible events---her female coworker suddenly bursting into tears after being accused of stealing company secrets, saying she was always jealous of thte progagonist's beauty is one of many examples. I think Miss Kirchner needs to stop putting her proganist (aka herself) on such a high pedestal and actually put more reality into her plotlines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that begs to be put down at each and every page.","review":"I did my best to finish this book, honest. But this is one book that is so utterly boring, that it begs to be tossed out of the window. The author is not able to depict either India nor the US accurately - as an Indian American I could not identify with either of her descriptions. There are too many unreal coincidences and loose ends in the story. There is this weird feeling that the author is contradicting herself in every chapter. If you really want this book, I have one to give away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice blend of cultures, inviting you to read","review":"I enjoyed the familiarity of knowing San Francisco.

What a let down. Perhaps after the Rushdies and the Roys and all the other highly literate Indian authors I've just discovered, my hopes were just too high. Shiva Dancing, had a wonderful title, and that is the best thing I have to say about it. The romance (and I normally adore romances) was tiresome, the main character was a little too fond of her red sari, and had little to no respect for, or even knowledge of, India or Indian culture. Perhaps Ms. Kirchner should stick to the kitchen?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching","review":"The story rings true. It pulls you in and you enter the lives of Meena and Antoine.

To compare Kirchner with Danielle Steele would be a step up for the author of Shiva Dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book published in the first place?","review":"Why was this book even considered for publication? I am at a loss to understand what intelligence allowed this silly and nonsensical piece of storytelling, to even get into print. As a person of Indian descent, I am offended by western stereotypes of the Indian subcontinent that this author resorts to. Besides, the prose is downright sloppy and less than mediocre, the characters are cartoonish, and the plot so meaningless, one wonders why this author does not stick to writing cook books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read This Review: Not the Book","review":"If you are not of Indian descent or have never lived in India - you may be able to swallow the rather implausible characters in this book. But for people like me, born in India and making a new home in the States (like Ms. Kirchener herself), the book is terribly jarring. The characters are flat - no depth - and sterotyped in the extreme (not just Indians, but Americans, Mexicans and Japanese - at least Ms. Kirchener is an equal opportunity stereotyper). Just one example of the unreal world she has created - friends suffixing the honorific \\"ji\\" when addressing each other (e.g. \\"Meena ji\\") in an email? Nonsense. But Kirchener's writing is probably as bland as her cooking - modified to please the American palate, not challenge it. If you are not bothered by ersatz cooking or writing, do pick up a copy of this book. It is a page turner - one page a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"This might be the worst book ever written.","review":"She lost me totally, utterly...on the FIRST PAGE. Kirchner describes Vishnu's tent as \\"a camel's spit away.\\"A wha? Do wha?And it turns out that's a high point. By the tenth page, I was in so much pain I had to put it down and never look at it again. Does anyone want to buy mine? I'll do one better! I'll PAY YOU TO TAKE THIS BOOK. It's not worth more than a quarter, though. So if there are no takers, this thing's going in the recycling to become something better in its next life.Seriously. Worst...book...ever...written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a better editor as well as a plot","review":"Not worth reading. The ending was very rushed, as well as the computer plot all of a sudden went nowhere. Everything was very convienient-Mom dying, Meena & Vishnu losing jobs, Vishnu found instantaneously.Throughout the book, time moves unevenly. You'll read the next paragraph and then realize that weeks or months went by. Character development is poor, and Meena is just \\"too perfect\\". Great at running, her job, gardening. Also, a poetry expert and volunteer with a close group of friends (whom with you only see Meena receive friendship, not give) as well as is physically beautiful.There are some lovely descriptions as well as a wonderful first chapter. This is why I gave the book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was glad to be done with this one","review":"This book is a bit to formulated for me, grabbing intro, proper introduction of the characters, story development, exciting ending. But it's very streamlined and predictable, no spice or extra anything thown in. It's more like a massproduced paperback - characters shallow and boring. The life she leads in the book seems very boring and dull, not worse writing about. Everything is very well phrased and to the point though. maybe she is more used to writing memos or computer manuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Most curiously, this novel was given to me by a friend from Singapore. It is \\"recommended reading\\" at one of the better bookstores there. That shows Ms. Kirchner has a large readership. What hooked me to the story is that it is a single Indian woman's story, but her problems are universal. I identified with her. Though written in an entertaining way, the author has created a multi-layered story. There is the love triangle, but underneath that there are also other themes. One of them is the constant nature of change, Shiva's Dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one star is for the cover illustration","review":"This book is not about India or Indians.

This is by far the number one book that I would suggest to anyone in any science or math. I find the most useful sections are the table of integrals, derivatives, trig identities, geometric formulae, physical constants, and unit conversions (all lists are quite complete). I have a number of other references, including this book's big brother, the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, but I find this one easier to use for most applications.

This book serves to provide information to those who already have some underlying knowledge to the topic they are referencing in the book - a highly successful implemtation of the primary stated purpose of the book.The only improvement to this book would be the inclusion of references by the author to primers or underlying concepts that better represent the purpose and utility of the materials presented. Such as a \\"See Also...\\" or \\"For more information on this see...\\" under each major topic section. That way the author doesn't need to waste time and effort for topics which are not in the intended purpose of the book.Self improvement and lifelong learners use these books too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great, but somethings missing","review":"This is still a great resource. However, this edition leaves out many of the tables (though a calculator will generate them) and the information on basic geometric shapes (e.g., volume, area) is difficult to use as a quick reference.

The vocal harmonies on this record are so catchy that you will be singing for days. I gave the album 4 stars only because it is new and I need time to evaluate its staying power.

You have to have a big imagination, plus lots of creativity to emulate the super successes found in the book.I noticed that many of the other reviews seem to think that Seth is going to give them a step-by-step system how to turn their idea into an idea virus. Reading this book with that expectation you are going to be let down.Every situation is different. You have to connect the dots. You have to apply the ideas in this book, it to make it work for you. You get the idea.

It's like reading the same book. It's a shame, because the author has been getting famous with his innovative ideas and speaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marketing revolution is brewing...","review":"I tend to agree with the previous reviews. Seth has definitely tapped into a great idea, but I think the free portion he provides is sufficient for you to get a sense of the book. Unlike \\"The Tipping Point,\\" Seth does not breakdown the structure of the idea virus as effectively and therefore his book is not as educational.However, as I pointed out in my review of \\"The Tipping Point,\\" this is not easy stuff to figure out. There is no step-by-step directions and if you intend to practice it, I recommend Seth's book, \\"The Tipping Point,\\" \\"Anatomy of Buzz,\\" and \\"Crossing the Chasm\\" to get your brain thinking in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Seth","review":"Sorry but this book is copy copy copy of his first book and The Tipping Point. It is obvious that Seth is a student of the Peppers and Rodgers write the same book over and over again club.I would not be so irate other than the price of the book is so obsurd that you expect more value. Spend the money taking your spouse to dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a fascinating book with new ideas about modern marketing that I had never heard or considered before. the author mentions another book by Malcolm Gladwell titled THE TIPPING POINT that I found fascinating, and recommend as a \\"sister\\" book to this one. Read both. It could mean literally billions of dollars to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wake up your brain","review":"godin's gift is to get you thinking about marketing in a fresh way--in a way you haven't considered before. if you're the kind of person who can take a concept (like sneezers or ideaviruses) and arrange it to fit your particular context, the book is a huge asset. if you're looking for specific tips or practices that you can apply without engaging your own brain, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped up referral based marketing","review":"All Godin has done here is add a few bells and whistles to the basic referral or word of mouth marketing model.Essentially this is what the book says:1. Create a product or service that is so good people will want to talk about it2. Get centres of influence to use your product and recommend you to the people under their influence (even if you have to pay them to do it)3. Make it easy for people to recommend and use your productHaving said that the price was right (you can download it for free)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less idea , more viruses","review":"I don't know those five stars viewers were paid sneezers or volunteer sneezers.

Unfortunately, his manifesto is just that - too many words used to state the obvious. He differentiates between word-of-mouth and his concept of IdeaVirus, but his IdeaVirus is just a sort of controlled word-of-mouth driven by our access to the internet and e-mail.Mr. Goldin kept coming back to his central theme that advertising is wrong-headed. It may be true that his sort of virus is the most effective way to promote a product, concept or service. However, Mr. Goldin never offered a concrete way to start the spread of the virus. He states, \\"There's so much clutter, so much noise, so many ideas to choose from that the vast majority of them fail to make a dent\\". That seems to be his point.I found the text rambling and uninformative. At 197 pages, it is certainly \\"Much Ado about Nothing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seth takes credit for Memetics","review":"I picked this book up to see if there were any new ideas under the sun. At first I read along hoping to see some original thought on marketing ideas. I quickly realized I had heard of this 'ideavirus' concept before, only it was called memes before.The book makes a very sloppy stab at translating the science of Memetics into a 'revolutionary' marketing strategy. This would be fine had it succeeded. A workable introduction into the marketing implication of Memetics would be a very valuable tool to anyone trying to propogate an idea. However this book fails in accomplishing that goal. As it stands the book simply creates a feeble representation of Memetics, rebrands it as the 'ideavirus' and proclaims the author as head of a revolutionary new marketing technology.I started hoping to find some new ideas under the sun. This was not to be. The book earned its place, and that place is where the sun don't shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Purple Cow' is remarkable! MOOOO...","review":"Well... The book 'Purple Cow' gets released only May 12 but I was lucky to receive a copy through a special offer. This new book of Seth Godin is a remarkable piece of achievement with lots of potential and reach. It is about being remarkable or risk being invisible! It tells the importance of innovative marketing strategies. You will love every page of this book. Actually, you will fall in love by just looking at the book! I completed reading this book in a couple of days as I could not stop reading it. I recommend it to everyone and give it 5 full stars. Be noticeable by noticing this book May 12.

It's primarily interesting as an example of what amateur scholars (especially in Britain) were putting out in that era. Cranky and usually hilariously offbase, but often fun to read. The author's etymological speculations are remarkable: a supposed root AK is the basis of Heracles, zodiac, yak (the animal), akbar ('great' in Arabic): ironically, the correct etymologies of these items were already well-known in 1912, though not, it would seem, to Mr. Bayley.

They're all great t-shirts. I just bought 5 of these large t-shirts from this vendor but I can tell you these are not large. They seem to be a half a size smaller, like in-between medium & large. So all 5 shirts do not fit me. Also, the weight of the fabric is not heavy by any means. These are light weight fabric. My advice is, if you must buy them, buy one size larger than you normally get, but as for me, if Hanes is gonna try & increase their profit margin by giving me a substandard product, they aren't going to ever get my business again. And I have to add that my employer buys us Beefy-T's every year, and they aren't cheezie like these are, so I don't know what's going on except to say I'm really unhappy with my purchase.

I have worn beefy tees ever since I had asign company that also did silk screening on just about anything, and we used to order only the beefy tees as they were a better T shirt than any other, but this wasthirty years ago, and the product has definitely changed no matter what Hanes or anybody else says. I don't have a problem with the sizing as others do, and at $9.00 each with pocket directly from Hanes, it is still a good deal.Addendum:Contacted Hanes and gave them all the sorted details they ask for in hopes youwill not E-mail them back (Color, where they were made, price, etc. etc.).All a bunch of bunk when they have my order number.This is nothing more than Corporate greed, just like Levi, Maytag and so many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's way too big","review":"i didn't know the word \\"beefy\\" was a size issue. i thought it was more of a discriptive quality issue, so when it arrived and my whole family could wear it together i wasn't happy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shirt","review":"This shirt is everything they say it is.

Anyway, the landspeeder has hidden spring wheels underneath to make it look like it is floating, so it bounces realistically. The wheels completely retract by pulling on the shift stick in the cockpit. It has a trunk that opens up to put the figures guns or light saber inside, The figures fit in the seat correctly.

I have tried from Norton to McAfee and even the freebie Avast! and I can say the best one I've seen so far is this little engine that could from Spain. Norton is a resource hog, it drains away so much RAM it makes your computer useless. Compared to that, Panda uses few RAM and your system does not sacrifice much resources. Titanium was designed to be as simple as it can be for the regular user, and it is marvelous on that department. You won't get caught up in undecipherable computer mumbo jumbo.. in plain and simple English (or Spanish, your choice) you'll be able to scan your systemn and see how it vulnerable it is to online threats. Its update system is the best and most comprehensive out there, and it sends DAILY files with new virus information to systems, compared to the bi-weekly or when-the-latest-major-crisis-comes-out updates from Norton. Give it a try and you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious bug","review":"I had a very similar experience as the reviewer from Brooklyn. I went for the free version of this software, downloaded from panda's website. Immediately after rebooting my system I noticed that all the desktop icons were generic looking.

It caught my attention from the beginning and I couldn't put it down. During the interviewing process I answered many of the questions from info. that I had read out of (Becoming a Person of Influence.) I feel it was a major part of my getting the promotion. There were two others being interviewed that already had titles above mine and later ended up working for me. I have since purchased a number of copies of this book. I give one out to every new employee I hire, in which I'm putting in a supervisory role. It is an inspirational book along with educatinal. I would recommend it to anyone in a leadership role, work or otherwise. It is also a good rescource to go back & review now and then.

If you read his other books, you will not find any new ideas here. This book badly repeats what's in his other books, and its written by some guy Jim. The writing style of his other books are much better as well. I advice that you don't buy it, just look into his other books I mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"People wanting change in their life will benefit greatly","review":"John and Jim have written a great book for self improvement. I am preparing to read this book for the 3rd time - as they say in the book - it takes repetition to change your thoughts and actions. Anyone who is looking for improving their life and attitude BUY this book and study it - reading is not studying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading for those building a business needing leaders","review":"Sometimes leadership books get touchy-feely and we get lost in the rhetoric. With Maxwell's assistance, Dornan stays at the information, not rhetoric, level. Straight shots, concise examples. Rarely does a book like this hold me for the duration. I'm on my 2nd reading now. If you're building a business and want to develop leaders who can run without you.....read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for.","review":"As an admirer and student of John Maxwell, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I might offer this book as a primer on leadership for those with absolutely no knowledge, as its ideas are very general and paint a vague picture of how to deal with people. The advice in the book often resorts to truisms and cliches (the equivalent of \\"treat people like they're important and you'll be important to them.\\") I usually highlight my books to death, but I honestly found very little new information aside from the occasional thought provoking rephrase or summary. A majority of the book is comprised of Jim Dornan's personal stories and miscellaneous oft cited quotes. For newcomers to the self-improvement/leadership topic I would offer \\"The Magic Of Thinking Big\\" or \\"How To Have Power And Confidence In Dealing With People.\\" Seasoned leaders will most likely find nothing new here. Sure, you could find a lot worse things to read, but there are more helpful books out there as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book that Teaches the Correct and Timeless Principles of Influencing People","review":"Great Book that Teaches the Correct and Timeless Principles of Influencing People!

When fitted on either of them, this lets CO2 escape through the bottom of the cap, rather than directing it through the fermentation lock I have fitted onto the top. That means that when fermentation is done (or before it begins) and there is no more positive pressure from inside the carboy, air and other contaminants can get into the carboy and cause infections. It's also harder to judge visually when fermentation is occurring and when it has ended. This product is a good idea in theory, and I was looking forward to an easier way to start a siphon, but not sure it would work even for that because of the looseness of the fit.

There is no real help or advice given. More like a blurry story. Without being too sarcastic, love itself doesn't fix everything. I don't want to write too much personal stuff here, but I guess most of the people who are in my situation can feel with me is when I say,I wanted help and I needed help! What to do when your man doesn't believe in himself at all? What if he can't find his way back into society after being locked away for a decade? What if he can't stand people being close to him? What if he can't commit as he learnt to never trust anyone for so long? I think that's what women who buy this book wanna know and this book is not gonna help you.
