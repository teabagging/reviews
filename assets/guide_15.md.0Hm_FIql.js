I really advise Anne (yes I know she'll never listen) to get an editor again for her books.

I couldn't even make it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs. Rice has written much better","review":"All of Anne Rice's work from the last five years would have benefited from some editorial assistance. Unfortunately for her fans, she has the right to refuse it because, from the excellent reputation she gained from her earlier work, she rakes in the money for her publisher. \\"Violin\\" was tedious, \\"Pandora\\" was mediocre, \\"Vitorio\\" was awful, and \\"Blood and Gold\\" is redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-milked teet finally wrung dry","review":"Anne Rice has sucked the vampire genre dry. The only reason she continues to publish these travesties is to fill her pockets. Although her first few novels were fresh, she hasn't had an original idea in more than a decade. She writes primarily to feed a large community of uncritical escapists who lap up whatever she happens to regurgitate that year. The prose in this novel is self-consciously baroque, and Marius has no epiphanies or insights beyond the dimensions of any of her prior characters. The only thing that makes the novel different from her past works is the setting. In retrospect, her oeuvre has become the gothic equivalent of Hope and Crosby's On the Road movies. Don't buy this novel unless you have the undiscriminating loyalty of one of her many zombies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why????","review":"Another pointless and tired retelling of a story that has been told in four separate novels.

Throw it out or use it to hold open a door. I am a HUGE Anne fan, but this was pure shlock. I hated it, the whole thing. I don't know what she was thinking when the words, \\"cloud gift\\" found their way onto her screen. Usually Anne Rice can make the unbelievable believable. She can take her readers on journeys of thousands of years and miles and we are right there with her, shaking with joy and anticipation. And then, there was Blood and Gold. Ugh. If you are looking for a great Anne book, try Cry to Heaven. It's pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne does it again!","review":"As always, Anne did a brilliant job. It was wonderful hearing Marius story. I do feel that there was a bit of repetition if you have read the other books but hearing it from Marius did give it some variation. I am slightly dissapointed that Blood and Gold did not pick up from Merrick....when that story finished I just wasn't ready for it to end and it seemed so that it would have to continue in another book??

I have read all of them now, and I can't wait for more. Typical to her style, she takes you through a non-fictional view of history with great detail. It is a heartpounding novel that will take you to another world. A top rate book and worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"To say that this book has any merit would be just to flat-out try and find something nice to say. Unfortunately, there isn't anything salvagable in this dreck. I have read all of Anne Rice's book and this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. Another boring retread of things that we already have been told in other novels. And even if it is new, it doesn't matter! It's all throw away. The worst and most insulting is the wrap around Thorne storyline! It feels as though a kindergarten class could have done better. Inconsistent, boring, badly written, no plot and just out and out drivel, this Vampire Chronicle would only be entertaining to the brain dead! SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalled","review":"I purchased this book despite serious misgivings, having been discouraged by the quality of the author's recent endeavors. As with most of her books, it starts out very slowly and one must persevere to get at the real meat of the story. The middle of the book was quite entertaining if a bit erratic. *Loose ends, inconsistancies, out of character behavior, etc.* But the real horror was the ending. For about the last forty pages, the book takes on an air of complete incomprehension. I read with disbelief the completely illogical and totally unbelievable ending. It was as though the author had turned it over to a ghost writer who had absolutely no knowledge of the characters and arbitrarily decided to shock us. Well, she did. I for one, will purchase no more books by Ms Rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chronicle worth the read","review":"Anne Rice once again creates a world not seen in our everyday lives so wonderfully that we are transported and siting by the fire listening to the tale being told. It is one of the Vampire Chronicles but could be read as a stand alone. It is the story of a vampire but also the story of a man who has seen a world die and another take it's place. How this shapes him and his own struggle to over come his shortfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"A partial return to form for Anne Rice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne Rice's first few Vampire Chronicles but began to lose interest as she moved away from epic romance and character development in favor of overly detailed descriptions of the mating habits of the undead. For me, Blood and Gold, featuring the ancient Roman vampire Marius telling his own story, was a partial return to form. Marius, a familiar and appealing character, relates tales of love and heartbreak and the rise and fall of civilizations. He also relates the stories of many of the vampires he meets throughout the years, and all this once-removed storytelling takes its toll. The dialogue, laden with capitalized vampiric catch-phrases, is horribly stilted, and the distant as-told-to quality of the narrative deprives the reader of Rice's usual lush, sensuous immediacy. Until Rice comes up with some new ideas I'll sit out the next few installments of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Lestat?","review":"I can't tell you how anxious I was to read Anne Rice's newest book. Although I am interested in the lives of each vampire, something is missing. That being Lestat, and the old Anne Rice we love and adore. The excitment is missing. We need the Brat Prince back in all his glory and adventure. Although I forced myself to read this book, some parts were good, on the whole it was boring. I refuse to give up on Anne Rice, and look foward to the next book with much enthusiasm, but I pray it is the Anne Rice of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrendous","review":"Am I alone or does anyone else think Anne Rice has a problem remembering what her earlier characters have done? I remember that at the end of 'Armand' Marius and Santino are friends, walking around NY together. Yet here, Marius wants Santino dead for centuries-old offenses. What gives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Rice","review":"I was once a huge Anne Rice fan. Her early novels, particularly Interview With the Vampire, were interesting and fresh takes on the vampire legend. With Blood and Gold, however, it seems that Anne Rice is not merely beating a dead horse, but flogging it mercilessly into pulp. The prose is miserable and distracts from the story, and the story itself barely differs from the last few installments of the Vampire Chronicles. The dialogue is horrible enough that you can't even imagine it coming out of the mouth of a centuries old vampire.This book is only worth buying if you're an Anne Rice completist. Even then, I'm waiting for it to turn up in remainder bins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronicle fans Beware","review":"If you are a fan of the vampire chronicles, I would suggest that you steer clear.

I typically like her characters and the situations that they encounter. However this changed when I read \\"Blood and Gold\\". I got tired of Marius's incessent wining and complaining. After reading her other books I kind of thought of him as a god/father figure for all of the other vampire children that could help them in their times of trouble. But when I read this book I realized that Marius has almost as many issues as Lestat. However unlike Lestat he doesnt seem to have the courage to do anything meaningful about them. This book changed my perseception of Marius, but not all Anne Rice books. I suggest you read \\"Blackwood Manor\\"(the main character is magnificent!) instead of \\"Blood and Gold\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, and lacking in creativity.","review":"I have read all the Vampire Chronicles and 95% of the book's story has already been told in the past books.

Just pick up a copy of The Vampire Armand and the majority of Blood and Gold has been harvested from those pages. It seems that Anne needs to take a break from the VC and recharge her batteries. There is nothing more annoying than spending money on something that you pretty much already have. I feel like I've got two books telling the same story (Armand, Blood and Gold).Blood and Gold does introduce some new material about Marius, but getting to it is a tedious endeavor. I would not recommend this book. Read the Vampire Armand or the Queen of the Damned instead.

In this book we are introduced to a new character in the beginning, (which could be interesting) but then the rest of the book is nothing more than pulling chapters from books already written, i.e. \\"Armand\\", \\"Pandora\\", \\"Queen of the Damned\\"While I was reading the book I started recognizing paragraphs word for word. I actually went to my collection thinking I already owned this book and read it long ago. She has taken whole chapters from other books and pieced them together to make this one, with the exception of the beginning and end. Could it be she wants to put something out there promoting the new movie \\"Queen of the Damned\\"? The ending was a quick and unintelligble finish to the new character, Thorne, introduced in the beginning.

This is so unlike the image I had of Marius in the previous books.However once you get past that \\"woe to me\\" theme ... Anne Rice continues to tell a good story. This book is a whole lot better than \\"the vampire armand (which i believe is the worst of the vampire chronicles)\\" but still not up to Rice's usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called tarnished and rusty","review":"Anne Rice's style of writing is tedious and boringly repetitive.

It seems that Marius falls in love to easily with everything thats beautiful around him and it seems like he still wants to be a mortal man.

He is full of anger towards his maker, Maharet, and wishes revenge.This book was a disappointment, as for a lot of the novel, it felt like I was re-reading The Vampire Armand (which I didn't particularly enjoy either). There was little new to Marius' story that the reader hasn't heard about in the previous novels whether it was Those Who Must Be Kept, or Marius' time as a painter in Venice with Armand and Bianca. Even the new plot with Thorne failed to grab me, as it wasn't deeply explored at all.

I mean, on her web site she forbade her fans from writing any more of it back in 2000.And yet, skimming through this book, I saw scene after scene, dialog thread after dialog thread, that seemed to have been plucked directly from some of the (much better written) fan fiction I've encountered over the years. Take the scene in which Marius and Thorne go out to the local watering hole and meet up with three ladies, for instance. I read that same scene in a piece of fan fic fully two years before this book was released. The fan's scene involved different characters, but otherwise it was nearly verbatim.Then again, maybe that was the real reason she demanded all fan fiction be removed from the Internets.Outside of that rather intriguing item, this book was a crashing bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was a zero star rating!","review":"I received this truly terrible novel as a birthday gift and dutifullytucked into it as I love a good paranormal novel.Crikey, I haverarely encountered such precious, self-involved writing trapped in aploddingly dismal plot.

Other than this diversion of my viewing pleasure, loved the film, it's suspense, endearing family moments, faith and values trauma, and that creature was really scary in the Brazil video. Lots of script holes and those Mel crazy eyes seemed out of place in a few scenes. Exciting, perfect level of action, luv M. Knight, highfive to the 215!!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"cringe inducing cheesefest","review":"a bad drama pretending to be bad sci fi, both this movies alien attack plot and themes of faith and religion fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny. another overly self important film by the most overrated filmmaker of his time. Shyamalan fanatics will eat it up, anyone else will do well to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is it scary?","review":"I went and saw this in the theater and I didn't find it scary. The first time I saw the trailers I thought it looked scary but when I saw the alien the movie just sucked bad. I mean okay if you people enjoyed the movie than that's cool but in my opinion I just didn't like the movie much. It did have good acting and a good storyline but the movie just wasn't scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"So- So","review":"the movie started out great and continued to be so for the next 45 minutes to an hour. I was very intirgued and absorbed. But then everything changed. I understand it wasnt a horror movie and was simply supposed to be about the 'signs' of an invasion, not actually about the invasion. But after awhile it stopped being suspensful and just became very dry and boring. And the ending left MUCH to be desired. It had its good moments, but Im glad I only rented it instead of buying. It just wasnt that noteworthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful","review":"Save the $4.00 rental fee. This movie is terrible. Even Mel Gibson, a fine actor, can't save this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Gravitation!","review":"Sorry Mr. Shalalalala but it seems that \\"The sixth sense\\" should stay your one and only extraordinary movie for years. Neither \\"Unbreakable\\" nor \\"Signs\\" couldn't save me from sleeping in my seat. Although even the last human being should know where the corn signs really come from let me please give you an advice: harvest your low corn-story and look out for a mill. Take the flour then, add some water and salt, put the mixture into an oven and give it a couple of minutes. The new result will taste much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great suspense!","review":"Signs is one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time, it encompass great suspense with a great specturm of acting to boast. The movie is set in a Pennsylvania farm town where a corn farmer, Mel Gibson (Who is a retired minister who left serving the Lord because his wife died), finds unusual singns made in his corn field one night. Without giving too much of the movie away, these signs pop up all over the world, and an interesting twist that runs throughout the movie is revealed at the end, which brings Mel Gibson back to his pastoral position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invasion!

I'm sorry for this review but its definately not that great of a movie like everyone says. If you wanna scary movie try The Ring or better yet They cuz this movie is just plain awful. I only gave it 2 stars on the account of Mel Gibson being in the movie or else this movie...would suck even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I supposed to be scared?","review":"Because I wasnt. This is not a scary movie. It's pretty annoying and stupid. The characters wear foil on their heads. After watching this and Unbreakable, I'm starting to think Shyamalan has lost his touch. Next time I'll be more cautious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for Insomnia...","review":"Here we go again. Another snoozer from the most overrated film maker of the last decade. Three strikes and you're out. After watching his first two stink bombs I was being very fair in giving his third a chance and yaaawwwwnn..... is about all I can say. I literally fell asleep. The only reason I give this two stars is the darling performance of Abigail Breslin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific thriller with more than just suspense","review":"OK, lets get the bad out of the way first: there ARE some gaping plot holes when it comes to the aliens and their weaknesses. But it doesn't matter, and that's why I love this film.The real story arc here isn't the aliens and what happens to them. It's how those events help to heal a family and to restore one man's lost belief in everything he held dear. High marks to Shymalan for using an alien invasion framework to give us a film with characters that grow and people you really care about.Yes it has tons of suspense, atmosphere, humor and shocks, but it also has a heart -- something rare in this genre. And it's exremely well put together in terms of pacing, construction, acting and creative use of sound.Sure, when it's over you might wonder why the aliens didn't just pack a few raincoats, but you'll also be touched by a moving character story set in the middle of a great roller-coaster ride.Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbing","review":"Perhaps I watched a different movie than the vast majority of reviewers here. The \\"Signs\\" I struggled through, was nothing short of pure rubbish.Here's the story: Once upon a time there was a faithless preacher, who lived on a farm with his children and brother. One day, aliens invaded their planet, so they stood around talking a good bit--though they never really said anything--, wore aluminum foil hats, and eventually hid out in the basement until the invaders just up and left. One alien was left behind, so the preacher's brother hit it a few times with a baseball bat and splashed water on it. The preacher regained his faith. The end.Ten minutes into the movie I was hoping that the aliens would hurry up and kill off the entire family, but alas that never happens. Instead viewers are treated to an hour and half of dull, uninspired acting, and virtually no action. Honestly, this movie makes \\"Plan 9 From Outerspace\\" look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate alien movies.","review":"I'm the biggest chicken when it comes to alien movies. So far the only ones not to give me at least one nightmare was Mars Attacks and Independence Dat, cause they were just stupid.The family in the corn fields wake up one night to find a monstrous crop circle in their fields. Soon spooky, unexplainable things happen, and lights begin to hover over cities that are less than a mile away from a crop circle.And then the scariest part for me happens. It's a news reel in which an alien just walks past suddenly and I admit, it scared me really bad, cause I know that somewhere in the universe there's aliens, cause really, the universe is just so big!If I wasn't scared by it I would have given it higher, but I just was.IT was still good though, I only hate it because it's scary, you know what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Let Down...","review":"This is a huge let down from \\"The Sixth Sense\\" for M. Nite Shama Lama Ding Dong. This, quite simply, was not a good movie. The acting was subpar, dialogue was weak and using crop circles really didn't create a whole lot of intrigue. The behaviors of the children were boring and predictable. The movie does an average job of creating the need to see the aliens, but when we actually see them, it was as disappointing as the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor, see the \\"Sixth Sense\\" for a second time, rather than this underachieving mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signs of a bad movie...","review":"What an awful movie! It starts out like a serious \\"what if?\\" flick and turns into a laughable comic book. When things start getting scary, and you and I might think about getting out, the characters don't. I saw this movie a couple years ago and was laughing so hard I forgot most of the details. If you like 1950s camp horror movies with bad direction and stupid characters, you might get a charge out of this one. The only 'signs' in front of this movie should have been stop signs keeping us out of the theater where we wasted 8 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Scary Enough","review":"I went alone. I wasn't all that scared. It was a good film though, funny and surprising. Although just a tad bit predictable. Mel Gibson is great and so is that little girl in the film.

All I witnessed was a really bad sci-fi plot. Other reviewers have revealed how the invading aliens could be easily defeated with squirt guns and spit wads, so I don't need to go into that. They've also described the scene where one of these highly intelligent creatures is trapped in a pantry: the door was not locked, but was secured by nailing boards across the door frame after the alien was inside. I haven't read all 1199 reviews, but of those I've read nobody has mentioned that the door opened into the pantry (if my memory serves me well). Therefore, the only thing keeping the alien in the pantry was that he couldn't figure out how a doorknob worked. If you're one who prizes \\"street smarts\\" over \\"book learnin'\\", then you might appreciate the movie more than I did. That was the only subliminal message I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!...","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, but when I saw it, I was very disappointed. I loved The 6th Sense, and I expected this one to be great too. However, there were so many holes in the plot, it wasn't worth watching. It seemed to me like they ran out of script about half way through the movie and just made up a stupid ending. I mean, if the aliens can come to attack our planet, how come they can't open doors? And why would they just randomly decide to leave? Good cast, ok acting, but no story!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You people have to be kidding","review":"I watched the last hour or so of this free on TV. The good news it was free, the bad news I will never gain that time back again. Suspenseful? Only if you empathize with people dumb as a stump. If you thought it was suspenseful I guess you gasp every time the Coyote tries to catch the Roadrunner.I don't know if this was a family or a group home. As for the aliens we are told (never learned how he knew) by the kid that they don't want to use advanced technology, like say a hammer or a prybar.However, it was comforting to learn I could alien proof my home by installing a sprinkler system, I'll get right on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie...","review":"Like most of the other 1-star reviews, I agree in that the credibility of the plot served only to eliminate even the most-remote remaining shards of suspended disbelief. Nice beginning to the movie, but the ending totally killed it. Consign this with your Stephan Segal movies as it's a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-I-N-G","review":"This is the slowest, flattest, lamest movie I have ever seen. Save your money. Do not be insulted into buying this movie by reviewers like miamix. They are embarassed at having wasted money on the crud and want everyone else to suffer, too. Hafway through the movie, Phoenix tells you \\"this movie is War of the Worlds\\". LISTEN TO HIM! It is, even down to the ending. Watch the original War of the Worlds, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS WAS GREAT!!!","review":"Signs was so good, and so scary! It has great acting, amazing atmosphere, authentic scares, and a little humor to make a great horror picture! Watch this one alone in the dark! This is so good, and is one of the scariest movies ever made! See it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Not many young directors are as talented with the camera as M. Night Shymalan. This is his third major studio movie and also his best. Signs does not deal as much with crop circles as much as how one family deals with crop circles. This may sound confusing, but this film is built on such a genuinely simple concept that the viewer does not have to think too hard.Graham Hess is a former priest who lost his faith when his wife was killed in a tragic accident. His family is slowly growing apart and to add to the tension, an enormous crop circle appears on his land. Terrifying events start occurring throughout the world and Graham's awkward structure of a family begins to fall apart.This movie has enough frights, but these frights are strictly limited to what the viewer cannot see rather than lighting up the screen with dazzling amount of special effects. I loved Signs for its simplicity because that is truly the only way to convey a message."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIGNS ventures into realistic realm of alien invasion","review":"A tad slow in the beginning but you won't have to wait long for this movie to jumpstart your fear level. I found the aliens in this movie to be quite disturbing to look at but certainly believable in terms of plan of attack, observing the humans, capture plan. Mel Gibson once again gives a impressive performance. Even Gibson's film kids are great. You just gotta see the \\"swing away\\" scene in the livingroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing...","review":"First of all, Signs was a very good movie, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was I didn't see most of the movie, since I was scared out of my wits.Anyway, the plot of signs is a farmer (Mel Gibson) finds a crop circle the size of a football field in his corn field. He's calls the police, thinking it's only a very elaborate prank. The policewoman tells him that the same thing had happened in several other countries, and that all the local animals have been acting strange, like there was a predator around... and almost right after she says that, they find the kids near the body of their dog, who seemed to have gone crazy and tried to kill the other dog. Instead he had jumped on the boy and had been impaled by a pitchfork or something like that. Anyway, that's just their first sign, because later that night, an alien appears outside his daughter's room... saying anymore would spoil the movie. This movie, in my opinion, is probably going to get a oscar nomination for best actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signs, not all it could have been","review":"This movie had so much potential but like the directors other two films \\"Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" it failed to please. the acting is good, and Joaquin is amazing as he is in all of his movies, even Mel Gibson impressed me. There is some cunning dialoge and some funny bits throw in at just the scariest moments, making them even funnier, though you do feel bad for laughing sometimes. But the way the film was hyped up i was expecting so much more, i will not spoil anything, but M. Night really needs to work on writing much more fulfilling stories that at the last minute do not disspoint. Out of his trilogy of films i would have to say \\"unbreakable\\" is my favorite, a great movie haltered only but a fake and easy ending, much like signs."},{"rating":"1","title":"In my view","review":"I try and give every film a fair objective look. Signs was not about ailens, invasions, family, or us against them. It was about religion in todays modern world. Are what we see signs of proof or just a desire to believe. This movie proved that we all can miss the obvious and let or superstition get the best of us. If you go and see this movie you will be asking yourself some very important questions. Are we alone, is there a purpose to our existance, does everything happen for a reason, why is it that an advanced ailen race can design a space ship but can not open a pantry door? Acting was basic at best, plot was not well thought out. It is worth the cost of a video rental but the cost of going to the movies to see it was too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED ...SLOWWWWWW","review":"Well ...color this one ...for me at least ...WAR OF THE WORLDS IN COLOR .....thinking it was going to be an intelligent look at crop circles I was nearly put to sleeeeep by the slowwwwwness of this movie ..and very disappointed .....the Alien was from the X File Movie ..which I loved .. get your OWN ALIEN sir ...:) movie didn't make sense ...Didn't take CROP CIRCLES very seriously and I think we should ...Two friends went with me and they felt the same way ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has a Christian focus even though it is Sci-fi","review":"My husband and I love this movie because it reminds us of the Power of God.

Thank god the corn signs are made only by human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, BUT NOT FANTASTIC","review":"M. Night is a real piece of work. He knows how to put the audience into such suspense and make it a real thriller. He has shown us this before in \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" But afterwards, I begin to think, \\"Was it really THAT great?\\" Well, yes, it was. I screamed by head off (along with the rest of the theater audience) at the jumpy scenes and felt like I really got to know the characters.As fantastic as I thought it was at first? No. The ending was not spectacular at all....really didn't make a lot of sense, and the sense that it did make it still seemed....silly.Should you watch it? Definitely. Will it be the best movie you've ever seen? Probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadpan humor and deadly tense","review":"I hadn't expected to enjoy this movie. As subjects go, this one's been beat to death with aliens that compel us to build giant mounds of dirt, bicycle riding aliens that need help to phone home to asthmatic wheezing old Darth Vader.As the movie starts out, Mel Gibson gives an effective performance as a man who's lost his wife and a minister who's lost his faith. Very strong performances from Joaquin Phoenix and the children give the film a very strong family orientation.This isn't a blood-and-guts movie and there's only a few acts of violence committed during the film. Surprisingly, there's very little profanity. Still - the subject matter will certainly upset small children.I do recommend this for UFO buffs, and perhaps even fans of the Hitchcock film style. This is a dark film, smoothly paced, and very well directed. This is from the director of \\"The Others\\", so you should know what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooked","review":"I've never been more spooked in my life.... I spent almost nine years of my life living next to a cornfield, and when you can hear the wind blowing in the field at night, the effect is very chilling. The plot was full of holes, but I didn't realize that until the very end. I was thoroughly spooked until the morning after the invasion when they all went upstairs to see what was on tv. Then the plot starts getting soggy, and the silly background story all falls into place, leaving you thoroughly dissapointed.In my opinion, M. Night did a superb job with the first two thirds of the movie, and successfully scared the living [stuff] out of me, but the movie lost its effect with the kid and his asthma attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT GARBAGE!","review":"This is M. Night Shyamalyn's worst film. It is just a recycled plot from other films that have done what was shown here. The ending has got to be one of the worst I have ever seen. I just do not understand why anyone likes this crap. I caught this recently on TNT just to see what everyone saw in it, but all I saw was that Shyamalan and the screenwriter were probably on drugs or completley crazy when this movie was made. If you want to see the director at his best, you should see The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable (and I am willing to bet that The Villiage is better than this mess)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster","review":"Mel Gibson and the rest of the cast do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a \\"surprise\\" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Mess","review":"Or just plain awful.Nothing holds together in the movie in terms of the aliens: eg, smart enough to travel across the stars, too dumb to break down a door--which may be good way of describing this movie!The other aspect--loss of and reclaiming of faith--is old, tired, cliched,and totally illogical.So if you take away the \\"oomph!\\" of the aliens and the \\"hmmm...\\" of the psychology, what are we left with?Something about halfway between zilch and a cavernous yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sighs","review":"Some winning moments, but mostly a fairly predictable yawn. It's at its most effective when it isn't trying to a) be deep, because it ain't! b) be funny, because it rarely is, or c) be unpredictable, because you can see the plot twists a mile away.Still, some pretty scary moments. When the Brazilian kids see the alien, and when the dog runs amok are very effective.It's amazing that so many people find the ending so satisfying and \\"deep\\". In case you haven't seen this, Mel Gibson's character is a minister who has lost his faith because his wife was killed. But, lo and behold, it was all part of God's plan, because now Junior won't get killed by an alien because he's an asthmatic, because it was a part of God's plan, and Mel's daughter has a strange obsession with water, and, gee, coincidently enough, so do the aliens. And do you know why? Because it was all part of God's plan! This is pop spirituality at its most shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"This is definately one of my top five favorites of all times. It is not a fast paced movie, but keeps you on the edge of your seat w/ suspense and creep factor.

They seem to forget this is a MOVIE and not REAL, and a real key ingredient in enjoying a movie is suspending your disbelief. If you want to watch something that mirrors reality, watch reality. Simple as that. The movie was excellent, the acting was SUPERB, and if you stop whining about how it doesnt make any sense, its very suspenseful. One of my favorite movies, as hard to believe as that may be :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a \\"not to see\\" list, this should be at the top","review":"Take several really talented actors, put them in a story with no point, and you have Signs. I can't believe others have rated this movie so highly. I was terribly disappointed, since there was so much hype surrounding the previews. The ending was so poor as to be pitiful and silly, but by the time I finally got there, I was pretty much expecting the worst. If I had not been a captive audience on a long distance flight from Europe, and had already watched everything else available, I would not have sat thru until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense Trilogy Going down Hill","review":"From a surprising ending of the Sixth Sense, which is after all only a somewhat good pastime movie, to the [derivative] style of the Unbreakable, to this movie, Signs, Shyamalan's suspense films are really going down the hill fast.In this movie, the filmmakers are trying hard to create an environment and style imitating those in the great Stanley Kubrick's movies. However, unlike Kubrick, they lack the ability to master the overall suspense and that something, which will, in Spielberg's words, grow on you.The film fails to grasp your attention in an intelligent way. Everything seems staged and manually put there for you to accept. However, not everyone is a sentimental freak as the audience was originally intended!!! This movie is, after all, a boring, ridiculous journey that will lead you to two things, 20 minutes of sleep and the decision of never watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, YAWN!","review":"Oh my GOD! I'm SO glad that I only rented this movie! Watching it was almost PAINFULLY boring. If straining to hear dead-pan faced people whispering to eachother for 90 minutes over formula (\\"ooh!\\") \\"suspenseful\\" music where nothing EVER EVER happens (okay, okay- 'til like the last ten minutes) is your idea of a 5 star movie, then forget I said anything... and enjoy the movie. Sorry, I need a little more than \\"the phone rings suddenly\\" or there being nothing after all in that darkened hallway or \\"the animals acting all strange-like all over these parts lately\\" to scare me... Sorry Mel. Luv ya, but NOT in this one. It was suspenseful all right. I couldn't wait for it to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Hype!","review":"Severely disappointed in this movie on all levels: acting, direction, story-line, the whole ball of wax. It appeared that the film sacrificed greatness by going for the deep psychological study of the characters and placing the story concept of alien invasion on the back burner. Also felt this was the worst acting ever for Mel Gibson. He honestly didn't look like he enjoyed making this film at all. Sorry to be so blunt, but I could barely get through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoever jeff shannon !!!","review":"this movie was wonderful. the widowed minister who regains faith due to the gravity of the situations around him. this was an excellent follow up to shyamalan earlier films which are all exemplory. he is one one this countries top filmmakers and he pulled off the best movie of the year with this one. the only other films that can even come close are the lord of the rings and the Michael Moore film, Bowling for Columbine. so whoever this jeff shannon character is he doesnt have a clue what he is talking about, in the review at the top. so in conclusion if you havent seen SIGNS you need to buy it when it is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never hated a movie more","review":"Signs was the most pretentious, empty film I've ever seen. The ending is so STUPID, you'll seriously wonder if someone was doing drugs while writing it. It's insultingly dumb and deceptively simple. I hate 'homages' to better films, too. Get this, as one of Sign's suspense moments, Gibson walks toward a door. Very original, very creepy stuff. While SIGNS' main concept should have worked, the script should have been finished before they filmed. It's the \\"McDonald's\\" of suspense films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average to Below Average Taken from Cliched 50's Films","review":"This film is one that has absolutely nothing to add to the sci-fi genre and most people have lauded it as the best thing since mustard. This is a very average film that is boring and predictable and it is absurd in its entirety, not to mention that the director (who is incredulous in the film) can not handle the basic premise of logic. The inconsistent themes which play out are laughble, considering that a whole film is wasted on the pseudo-intellectualizing of a man who has lost his faith and regained it because of an alien invasion (was the script written by a 14 year old). Most of the film takes place on some small farm in Iowa that is attacked by plastic looking aliens which are latter computerized and hillarious. Avoid after first viewing. Grade: C"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less is more","review":"I enjoyed this film a lot. I liked how the scale was kept small, meaning that the focus was on the farmhouse and family, with only tidbits from the outside world entering the plot. That's what real life is like; something big may be happening, but for most of us, we experience only a tiny little corner of that event.My only qualm about the film was the plot device of water as a weapon. If these guys can't take water, why go to a planet that is 3/4 water? Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to use water symbolically; after all, it is used for baptism.My only problem with the DVD itself is that there is no option to include the deleted scenes (most of which are really good) into the film in order to makes a sort of Director's Cut. Or if there is, I didn't notice it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAW signs is the best in 2002","review":"the first time i saw signs i was really surprise about all thethrill and the scary scenes ... i was laugh and cray and i wish that the film well never ended . and i can't wait to see it in dvd mel gibson is the best waw"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie","review":"This is really not very good. The suspense is effective for the fisrt half or so, and the acting is OK. But the suspense is ruined as you start to see more and more of the aliens.

It is not scary at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for insomnia!","review":"This movie was very disappointing. I fell asleep twice in the theater. They should have never showed an alien, they should have left it up to the viewers' imaginations. The only scary parts where when you thought you saw something or when you saw a shadow and objects moving in their wake. M. Night has really gone down hill since The Sixth Sense!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the most boring film I've seen in the last year","review":"I don't understand how M. Night gets all this hype. I constantly nodded off during this movie. I haven't enjoyed any of his films except the first one, and that had plot holes big enough to drive a Hummer through."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one lost me...................","review":"My two favorite movies of all time are Gladiator and Braveheart which lead me to anticipate that this movie would be a winner. Mel Gibson really shined as Sir Whilliam Wallace in Braveheart and Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic as Emperor Commetus in Gladiator. However, in this movie both were rather a disappointment to me. I think alot of it had to do with the fact that the plot of this film was not able to hold my attention. To merge a priest's loss of his calling due to the senseless death of his wife with a visit to earth from aleins who make crop circles in the farm fields of the area just lost me from the beginning. What is the connection? I have read alot of reviews on this movie and what surprised me the most is that virtually no one takes the middle of the road; you either like it alot or not at all. Fans of Mel Gibson should give it a chance like I did and draw your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute tripe","review":"Short and sweet review. If you have seen the movie, you have already been subjected to its misery. If you haven't seen it, please don't, I beg of you. The story is terrible, the \\"alien\\" is a poorly rendered green \\"monster\\" (OOOOOHHHH I'm SO scared), and the ending is a joke. \\"Swing away?\\" are you kidding me? I waited a long time to see this movie, and now that I've seen it I want 2.5 hours of my life back. Only reason I was forced to watch it was because Hurricane Isabel was blowing away my college town that day. If you are trapped inside cos of a hurricane, go to sleep, just don't watch this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen","review":"This movie was a confused mess that made less and less sense as it went on. Everything was supposed to support the belief in signs and portents and that everything happens for a divine reason, but there are so many huge logical holes that the intended effect was lost. The message I got from this movie is that god wanted Mel Gibson, his children and brother to survive an alien invasion. This meant that even Mel Gibsons wife had to die to deliver some cheesy prophecy with her dying breath so that an alien could be defeated with a baseball bat and some glasses of water. Also, apparently these aliens we smart enough to build space ships that could travel between the stars, but not smart enough to understand a door knob. This was just an awful movie that was only a little watchable because of the stars involved and some of the cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Since \\"Ishtar\\"","review":"This was the worst movie I have seen in years. I stayed hoping that sooner or later it would have some redeeming quality. It was extremely cliche. If aliens are smart enough to come to Earth and stage a world-wide attack, surely they can break through wooden doors! The religious conflict for Gibson's character appeared to be more of filler storyline that was occasionally thrown in. Getting rid of the aliens was such a \\"Wizard of Oz\\" getting rid of the wicked witch thing. I expected better from Gibson and Phoenix. They are too good as actors to have deserved to be part of this \\"movie\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine everything you believed to be true changing in a day","review":"Graham Hess (Gibson) has suffered a tragedy that leaves him doubting his faith, and shakes the very core of his being and beliefs. When he finds elaborate crop circles in his cornfields, he finds himself putting that faith to the test in a way he never could have imagined.A unique thriller with alien aspects that will leave even the most steadfast viewer thinking of the possibilities. Could this happen at any moment in time. Joaquin Phoenix does a first-rate job as Hess' brother who has come to live with Gibson and his family on a farm in the heartland. A well-done, enjoyable movie, from the director/writer M.N.Shyamalan also known for \\"The Sixth Sense\\". It's a movie that leaves the viewer thinking about the unnerving possibilities.

I saw with my friend in theatres and immediatly wanted to just turn around, walk back in, and watch it again! I am dying of anticipation for wanting to own it! You can watch this movie again and again and NEVER get bored, you'll be scared the whole time! Though there are some holes in the script, there was a good mix of funnyness and suspense. I really want to say that if you don't really like scary movies (Like I don't) don't shy away from this one!! The music is what makes most of it though, it's soooo creepy! The only dissapointment I had with the film is tht the aliens didn't look like I suspected, they weren't as \\"high tech\\" as in other movies, there wasn't many special effects. Don't let that get you down though, you don't really need special effects for a movie like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to go with my husband but I am SO Glad I did!!","review":"This movie is a new kind of Sci-Fi, it is not focused on important people like the President but on the common man. It shows how an 'everyman' deals with his own possible end, it stays locked on normal people in extraordinary circumstances.The reviews I read were terrible, now I wonder if any of those reviewers have actually Seen the Movie?? If so, one wonders about their perspective and lack of feeling.It is a cohesive and tight movie, don't read too many of the reviews that tell you what will happen. So much more fun to be surprised, chilled and satisfied. Be brave and go see it too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um next please","review":"Yea i had a change of thought, at first i was indifferent about this movei, then i liked it, now im like, what was it about really. The aliens seem dumb and weak here, one gets caught in a kitchen pantry by some chicken of a guy, the other one doesnt even put up a fight, i mean come, on, bring on the mean green aliens! boring..id would make it a promise to myself -never to watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected More","review":"I thought this movie was ok. The story was pretty good, but I think that they could have done a better job overall. The whole ideas surrounding the crop circles and the aliens coming down was enjoyable and a good portrayal of what might happen. On the other hand, the side story about the minister who lost his wife, and thus loses his \\"faith,\\" I thought was really cheesy. Not only has it been done before, but it took away from any credibility this movie otherwise would have had. Decent movie, but disappointing in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"signs: a metaphor for humanity's relationship to God","review":"The whole point of the movie was to stand as a metaphor for man's relationship to God. It is probably one of the finest films in this regard and Mel Gibson shines as the disengaged and angry preacher who will not be called \\"Father\\" nor will he advertise the unknowable to the world as represented in the \\"signs\\" in his field. \\"Signs\\" can be enjoyed on several levels, but the exploration of our inability to come to grips with that which we cannot know yet we feel around us, we fear, we worship, we abhor, offers the most interesting reading.And in the end, there are no random events, for if the little boy had not had severe asthma, Gibson's character would never have known that the aliens were not dangerous, but were rather seeking a connection to humans, a voice.The entire film can be read as this religious metaphor. It was a delight to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget so they could afford Mel Gibson","review":"Oh man I was so disappointed! Boring! At least the dvd cover looks exciting but it's just so deceiving. The entire movie is filmed pretty much in this dilapidated corny farmhouse with Mel his 2 kids and his brother. Well, at least you get to see a cornfield here and there. No real sci-fi til the end and it wasn't really worth it. No special effects. LOW BUDGET. Even worse there was no music to make it spooky because it needed something badly. I was reeled in like a sucker to watch it because Mel Gibson was in it. Not your usual alien-invasion type movie. You are forced to use your imagination a lot, assume/fill in the blanks. Not worth buying. Rent it or wait til it comes out on TV. You'll find you'll be doing a lot of intermissions while it's playing, do dishes, fall asleep, talk on the phone, use the bathroom, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad premise, poorly done","review":"I resent having to give this sorry excuse for entertainment even 1 star. Aliens who are killed by water invade Earth - just proves that interstellar spaceflight can be accomplished by idiots. And it gets worse as it painfully drags to a final scene which, as an atheist, I found highly offensive. If a film has a religious adgenda, I wish it was so noted so that those who did not want to be hit over the head with 'crisis of faith/faith conquers' all plots could spend their money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"signs","review":"I have a collection of Mel Gibson's films and I like them all very much except this 'signs' film. It is by far the worst thing I have seen all year and a rock bottom vote for Gibson. The filming was dark,ugly and unviewable. The audio was by grunt to grunt only. The story line was totally absent. For me it was a total waste of time and I would not recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen with a major star in the cast. Not that the acting was bad, but the story was just terrible. I bought this DVD because a friend told me it was the scariest movie he had ever seen, his wife actually said that he screamed in the theater three times! I really need to have a talk with that boy and find out what scenes caused him such [a fright], because I get more scared opening my monthly credit card statement. BORING AND PREDICTABLE. More holes in the plot than a ton of Swiss cheese. My 'favorite' scene had to be the one where these aliens who came from millions of light years away get locked in a kitchen pantry with a table chair against the door knob by some [weak person]. These aliens develop space flight, make it to earth with the intention of destroying all mankind, and they can't get out of a farmhouse pantry? Goodluck with your next planet. Not worth the money. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the Dutch guy","review":"To assume aliens have managed to traverse the universe yet can't manage to find their way past a wooden door is so insulting to anyone with any intelligence, it ruins the entire viewing experience. As JRR Tolkien said,in fantasy, the world, though a fabrication, has to make sense, has to have an intrinsic rightness. This screenwriter has forgotten that, no doubt pumped up by his past success. He should be ashamed to have produced this garbage with it's inconsistencies which are so far-fetched even those who suspend belief..cant quite believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER WATCHING IT.","review":"Oh boy, what can I say?!?Maybe we've all grown great expectations when It comes to Mr.Shamalaya.Problem is, his imagination and creative genious is fading out.After the groundbreaking ''The sixth sense'' and the very different and unique ''Unbreakable'', It seems that not even Mel Gibson made this one shine.The plot goes from childish to poor, the acting is nonsense, so is the story.The approach was terribly executed, when you see how dumb and numb the aliens are, you won't belive we are talking about alien superior intelligence, plus, some unecessary violence towards the end..Does It help? Not even a bit, It only made the movie more silly.If you want to spend your hard-earned money on It, be my guess, but don't tell me I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God, not the squirt gun!!!","review":"Warning: ending revealedThe suspense is thick (I jumped at one point), the characters very well portrayed, and the cinematography lush. Why the poor rating?The film's fatal flaw:The alien invaders are smart enough to develop space travel. Yet when they attack they limit themselves to weapons with a range of about 1 meter and don no armor. In fact they appear to be naked. A bad idea considering their skin has a violent chemical reaction to water, among our planet's most abundant compounds. Come on Shyamalan! You are way better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien Corn Pone","review":"'Signs' was a total waste of time. It was liken to watching old 1950's sci-fi flicks like \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" and Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" except both of these had some redeeming value or atleast substance worth discussion over a beer or two. Gibson was flat as usual....all of his character roles are interchangeable-indistinguishable ;\\"What Women Want\\" is the \\"Patriot\\" who lives next to a corn field with mowed down\\"Signs\\".Same O-same O.I did wonder however what the reverend-gone farmer [too much] Gibson did with all of the corn raised on his 'farm'? No critters-no silos were evident.And what pray tell was the bat bashing of the paper mache 'alien' by Rivers all about? I suspect it became his ticket back to the minors ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thriller","review":"I really enjoyed this movie because of its simplicity. Sure it is not packed with spectacular special effects or anything like that, however, that is what helps make this movie pretty darn good and realistic.Although I am pretty sure Aliens aren't going to invade earth anytime soon, this movie left me wondering, what if?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peopls on drugs","review":"Yes, I liked this movie a lot. I liked it even more after the movie was over and I could think back about how all the different plot points pull together at the end into something some much greater.My real purpose for this review is to refute all you people who hold up Close Encounters as the Bible of alien movies. I too grew up in the 80s and while that movie was a pioneer for alien movies in the sense of the general topic, it is rendered total garbage by everything both before it and after it. After watching Taken, I am completely convinced that Spielberg cannot for the life of him write a decent story about aliens. Take about cliched! ALL his alien movies are cliched (yes that includes ET as well).

I did not get what I was expecting. This is a heartwarming, very funny, suspense filled, alien movie. Yes, that's what I said. The suspense was worthy of Hitchcock. I am not easily frightened, beeing an optimist and an avid mystery reader, but the scene in the cellar while they are looking for the coal shoot . . . you know which one I mean . . . actually made me scream.

I heard much hype of how \\"thilling\\" of a movie it was and scary. Not so in either case. This movie's plot is not plausible. Now, now, the aliens COULD invade, I'm not saying that. I'm saying who in their right minds would decide to stay in an isolated home, miles from anywhere, and \\"wait\\" for the invasion to happen? Who? I would go for the safety in numbers theory if I were in their shoes. Also, there really is a slight build-up, but the climax is anti-climatic. Mel Gibson stars only to give it a \\"big name\\". His performance is average."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you jump!!","review":"My new favorite sci-fi epoch is now signs. The movie is great, and I guess you could say a little spooky. The movie stars Mel Gibson who does a gret job being serious, but funny in a few parts. The movie is based around crop circles appearing and everyone being mystified by their return after 25 years. A first they think its just a pesky neighbor until things start to happen... quite suspensful.

We could just ask why Mel Gibson's kids where weirder then the aliens or how aliens could figure out how to fly their space craft all the way to earth yet can't figure out how to open a door to a pantry. What about being able to kill them with water like the wicked witch of the east yet it obviosly never rains on planet earth. Lets put direction signs in corn fields yet go to every major city in the world.Well, the story if there is one from a movie that makes no sense, is that everything happens for a reason.

Truly one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrap \\"Signs\\" and buy \\"Alien\\" if you want to be scared","review":"This film re-affirms my cynical view of the Hollywood machine: throw in some a-list actors (Gibson and Phoenix) and a hot director with an amazing advertising/pr campaign and 'voila' you have a blockbuster hit. Kudos to the publicist who got M. Night Shyamalan on the cover of \\"Time.\\"The \\"Alien\\" meets \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" was an interesting premise, but it just doesn't deliver. During the viewing, I kept asking myself \\"am I missing something?\\"And, yes, I get the religious aspects (losing faith, the last supper, revelations, bla bla bla). But at the end of the day, I found the film just plain boring. I would have left it at that until I watched feature afterwards, where M. and his crew talk at length about the film and M.'s technique.

After viewing this movie and nearly falling asleep, I feel that this movie was underdeserving of the money it made at the box office. It's about aliens and the whole movie builds up to the actual alien attack. The building part is boring as is the attack, where they actual show the pathethic alien. Everyone lives and everything is great. This did not amuse me. Nothing remotely scary happens and the story line isn't that good. Save your money please! Even a 9 year old i know found this movie to be extremely dull with no frightening aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie. Good disc.","review":"The polarization of opinions concerning director M. Night Shyamalan should not keep you from giving this Blu-ray a chance. I won't argue that this movie is the finest Shyamalan has to offer, but I will tell you that for its fans and those who enjoy a well-crafted thriller Signs is a good Blu-ray disc. Incorporating all the extras from the DVD, Signs on Blu-ray eclipses its legacy counterpart. Those who can make use of its uncompressed PCM audio track will enjoy a step up from the Dolby Digital of the standard definition disc. The video, while not the best example of what Blu-ray can do, is a faithful representation of the source material. This is a good movie, and a good disc; just arguably not a must-buy if you own the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliched But Freaky","review":"The thing I liked best about Signs was the high suspense. Almost from the opening credits, it grabs you by the throat and won't let go. I can think of 3 scenes that freaked me out - the alien trapped in the vet's pantry, the basement scene and the alien in the living room. I had nightmares about this thing for a week. Of course when I watched the movie I was on heavy cold meds and sick as a dog. That *may* have had something to do with it. ;P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Acting / Poor Script","review":"Because the microphone was lowered into the frame quite noticeably and with such regularity, it gave the movie a very amateurish look and feel. Reason why Bruce Willis is not in this one: His career could not recover from the stink left behind. The only two things this movie reveals is good acting and a big dud of an ending. The acting just was not good enough to rescue the script. Some things are just best left unseen."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW MANY CLOSE-UPS OF MEL CAN WE TAKE!","review":"No one in the theater was terrified at this movie.

It was one of those lazy days in jersey, so I figured that the movies would be a nice place to escape the heat. This movie was absolutely horrible. It was not scary or thrilling. Signs was extremely over hyped and over rated. I can not believe that Mel Gibson would want to be a part of this horrible movie. The scariest part of the movie was when the dog barked unexpectedly. From the cliché use of crop circles to the lame attack of aliens, this movie was worthless. I would rather spend my money on a chick flick than this movie. At least a chick flick has some sort of comic relief. I would recommend any movie over this one. If you feel the need to subject yourself to the torture of watching this movie, wait until it comes out on cable. I was so tempted to leave the theater.

I am both a fan of Mel Gibson and a fan of anything that deals with unusual phenomena (e.g. crop circles). I thought that I would be enlightened, amazed and/or entertained. Instead, I just felt ripped off. The flick has a promising start and then degenerates into a sub-B film, 50s-style \\"ooh, those terrible alien monsters are gonna get us\\" farce of papermache aliens who--despite being able to fly through space/time and make crop cirles of incredible complexity can't seem to break through wooden doors and--GROAN--are vulnerable to water!! Oh, give me a huge break. Compound fracture, even! It's not even scary--more like pathetic.This could have been an inspiring film based upon an awesome phenomena.

Why should events be right to save him and not others? Why saving humans and not the aliens? His restored faith makes no sense.The movie was awkward, boring and predictable.

The Sixth Sense was a great movie full of suspense and the unexpected. The previews for Signs made it seem equally frightening and interesting. Alas, it was not. Mel Gibson's character's crisis of faith was not enough to make the movie worth sitting through.

No need to use nuclear weapons on them, either, as locking them in the pantry seems to work. But their biggest blunder is that they've never seen a Mel Gibson movie. Mad Max/Road Warrior, Braveheart, The Patriot, Ransom: it ought to be common knowledge throughout the cosmos by now that you just don't mess with Mel Gibson's family.

What it does have is something you don't see much anymore: character development, evolution and redemption in a sci-fi context.This might not work for the inattentive crowd, but for those who can put together more than a few sucessive thoughts in search of what the characters are feeling it's a refreshing change.Mel Gibson gives a very good characterization of an Episcopal Priest who has lost his faith, much to the detriment of his family, while Joaquin Phoenix does quite well as his live-in brother.Add two well acted kids, the family dogs, some peripheral characters, some tin foil (G) and a script that throws in just enough creeps as the whole world goes to hell around them and you have \\"Signs\\".Can't say much more without ruining things :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Signs\\" is the most hideous sci-fi film I ever watched.","review":"This was the most disappointing sci-fi film I EVER watched.You have these aliens that have the technology to come all the way to earth, and the technology to make perfect crop circles.Then these same aliens can not go near the water, and do not have ray guns to kill people. Not hardly.One thing that disgusted me was the family came up from the basement after the invasion was over; and the plywood covering doors and windows were covered with these geometric shaped cut-outs (Stars, circles, cresent moons, etc)This is THE WORST sci-fi movie I ever saw, It was even worse than \\"Independence Day\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"one more thing","review":"On the point of \\"faith\\". Mel's character, apparently an Episcopalian priest, loses his faith in god so easily when his wife dies in a freak accident. Let's forget about the fact that, as a priest, he had to have counseled countless families as to why god does exist even though bad things happen. Let's forget the fact that he must have been a pretty shallow priest to begin with if he lost his faith so easily.The very DEFINITION of \\"faith\\" is \\"believing in the truth of something without having conclusive evidence\\". Yet Mel's character ONLY believes in god again, or in his goodness, AFTER having evidence and proof. That's not faith, people. DUH.Just one of the zillions of moronic holes in logic this movie delivers and spoon-feeds to the mind-numbed American public. I'm shocked and crushed that so many love this movie so much.

Gibson wears the same depressed expression and flat monotone voice from start to finish. The whole thing is too far outside of reality. Independence day had more reality and was a much better movie.This movie was slow and depressing with no satisfaction in it. I was disappointed and by the end was still waiting for the acting to start.

I didn't find myself interested in the outcome of the characters.The only reason it may have done will at the box office must be due to the hype surrounding the director and the movie. The director's need to star in the film was annoying and just an excuse to make a bigger name for himself. Another reviewer's comparisons to Hitchcock is laughable.Skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why on earth do so many people like this movie?","review":"First of all I must say that \\"Signs\\" was the biggest letdown of a movie I\`ve seen in a long time. There seemed to be so much hype surrounding this film when it first came out at the cinema. In addition it was earning rave reviews from all kinds of sources and I also heard a certain famous hollywood actor declare this as one of best films of last year. Anyway I fully expected an intelligent, original sci-fi thriller. What I got was a plot that was poor even by tv-movie standards. The script was equally awful and offered very little for Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix to work with. It could just as easily have been a prolonged episode of the X-files, although even the X-files never succumbed to such levels of mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIGNS ABOUT NOTHING","review":"This short review among hundreds is probably meaningless. About as meaningless as this disappointing movie.M. Night Shymalan has carved a niche for himself with pseudo-spiritual thrillers. Mel Gibson is fine as a widowed minister who lost his faith in God and finds his isolated farm and family surrounded by demonic aliens. Joaqin Phoenix is terrific as Gibson's brother but the story sidesteps the tantalizing theological implications of the set-up and settles for being a remake of Hitchcock's The Birds.Too bad M. Night didn't make this a real showdown between demons and a disaffected minister. Now there's a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS GREAT!!","review":"I thought that it was a REALLY good movie.

But the heavily contrived interlocking deus ex machinae that riddle this movie didn't make me rediscover my faith in M.

They all say things that almost sound like they were taken from Independence Day, but it's all about them hiding in the cellar.

Especially these ones. And especially considering I live in the midwest, surrounded by corn fields. The first bit of this film was pretty freaky. Unfortunately, M. Night Shylaman decides to put in some other overtones, and basically the whole film IS, in the end, about a priest who loses his faith then regains it after he realizes that God really DOES have a plan, and yes, his wife dying was part of it. This movie just suggests that humans have no free will whatsoever and I feel that even Christians will be upset with the message of this film. It turns silly and corny and doesn't leave me feeling creeped out at all; just upset that I wasted seven bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it a lot even though it has major plot holes","review":"Caution spolier ahead! I love this film, but I must say it makes no sense for aliens who are fatally allergic to water to 1) want to capture humans, whose bodies are composed primarily of water; and 2) to come to a planet whose surface area is mostly water. When I think about questions of logic like this, and others, I have a hard time with the credibility of this movie, but I still like the suspense created here and Mel Gibson is always worth a look. I recommend it despite the glaring credibility problems.

That's where this movie belongs, in a church. The movie had me hooked with the alien invasion genre.. but then the stupid (non god-believing) aliens finally show their faces and are wiped out by baseball bats and glasses of water. This movie wasn't about crop circles, it wasn't about aliens, it wasn't about Mel Gibson and his growing collection of wrinkles.. it's about GOD. The writer obviously wanted to let the whole world know that he believes in the invisible man in the sky that has to make his presence known through coinsidence. I'd give this movie zero stars if I could. If religion as a whole makes you ill, avoid this movie like the plague.

The DVD doesn't have the same effect, but the movie stays the same and you are gonna see it again surely. I am not gonna talk about the story, because it could ruin the pleasure of you watching it.

I went in expecting a scary movie similar to 'The Others' or 'Alien', but I saw neither. What I saw was a movie that uses low-budget horror flick tricks. The alien was suppose to provide the spooks, but it hardly had any screen time. We only saw shadowy figures in the dark, heard loud banging behind closed doors and saw an alien hand or two sticking out from behind a small opening. We don't get to see the alien until the very end. It was that kind of movie. The story seemed to be mainly about Mel Gibson's character having lost his faith, then regaining it. Maybe I wouldn't have been as disappointed if the promotions weren't as misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this one of the worst movies ever made?","review":"As a previous writer stated in his eloquent review, I also sat in the movie theater anxiously awaiting the film's end.

What's worse, it tries to rise above its genre by overlaying the story of a minister who has lost, and regains, his faith. The movie takes itself very seriously, as if it has a profound insight to offer us. In reality, it is a predictable mishmash of pop superstition, cheap sentimentality, and a hissing stunt person in a green stretch-suit.If you want to see an alien invasion movie, get 'Independence Day'.

The ending is anticlimactic.To be honest, they BLATANTLY LIE in the advertisements as to what the movies subject matter is. Remember the aliens and such in the preview? Well listen up, because this is VERY important........THERE ARE NO CLEAR SHOTS OF THEM, THEY ARE USED AS A BACKDROP TO A \\"TOUCHING\\" STORY OF A FAMILY COMING TOGETHER, AND BASICALLY PLAY A VERY LITTLE PART IN THE MOVIE.

The scene where Joaquin Phoenix (fabulous in \\"The Gladiator\\" and wasted here) beats up a dimly-focused extraterrestrial with a baseball bat is truly tasteless, but I get the impression I was supposed to be moved by the fact that he did so using his beloved bat from the minor leagues. I felt cheated and violated for about two days after seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for Signs","review":"Take one part \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", one part \\"Children of the Corn\\", one part \\"War of the Worlds\\" and one part \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".

It is a well designed, well acted, to-the-core frightener. I actually caught myself almost writhing in my seat... there were parts where I just couldn't sit still. The suspense is high in this film. It's not a cheap kind of suspense in which you are given the obvious \\"calm before the storm\\", but a very unknowing kind of suspense. You never really know what's going to happen next.

Just be prepared for a few good startling moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Faith","review":"Signs is a very creative film that is actually about struggling with faith. The whole \\"alien invaders\\" thing is actually just a creative device (done quite well) to bring the issue of reliance on God to the service. All of the actors in the film were quite good, especially the young boy. It seems the negative reviews are mainly from people who were expecting a sci-fi or horror film. Although there are definitely some creepy moments, that's not actually what the film is about. Its not supposed to be fast-paced. Its a a subtle film that is supposed to make one ponder and very effective as such. I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is scary and funny!

I feel this director is way over-rated. His films are all so pretentiously self-important but the underlying idea behind this latest one was shallow shallow shallow. I feel the real truth behind crop formations is far more interesting than this dreadful movie which left me with no food for thought whatsoever concerning the phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, weak DVD","review":"First off, I loved this movie.

This one's packaging is straight up lame. Just the normal DVD case with a DVD and no pack-ins. The other DVDs in this line all are in nice boxes and have a fold out interior with semi-useful packins like nicer booklettes and stills from the movie.

Stupid, stupid movie. Joaquin Phoenix who was brilliant in Gladiator and Quills is totally wasted in this one wearing an aluminum foil space hat on the couch waiting for a few lines of dialogue in this poorly thought out excuse for a thriller.

Night (one of the coolest names in the world, I must admit) really hoodwinked Mel to do this picture.The film is suspenseful until the aliens show their faces. My mouth literally fell open. They look just like B-Movie rejects, some dude in a Gumby costume. These aliens come across light years and then get stuck in a pantry. Mmm, donuts . . . must be what lured them in. And I won't spoil the end, but you would THINK the aliens would have done some research on the atmospheric conditions of Earth before they decided to arrive and take over. One of the worst movie resolutions I have seen.And Mel has a long conversation with his wife as she is impaled on a tree.

When I got a gift card for Christmas one year I knew this was the DVD I wanted to buy. It's one of M Night Shyamalan's best movies (I even think it was better than Sixth Sense).The DVD has an neat bonus footage on it - like a movie made by MNS when he was a kid. It's great to see his vision as a child and how far he has grown. The DVD also has a nice story board to scene feature for certain parts of the movie. It's kinda neat to see how the finished product stacked up against the story boards.However with a movie with this much humor I would have loved to seen some bloopers or outtakes. But then again I say that about every movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love this movie. Great sci-fi, mystery, and spirital movie. A must watch.

There are some slightly creepy, intense moments but this film could have been so much better. They should have concentrated more on the aliens and not all this faith mambo jambo. M Knight Shylaman should have entertained us more instead of trying to make some deep thinking psychological drama because reading the box it reads like its an action thriller so I feel cheated. I wouldn't recommend buying this because its one of those 1 watch only type films.

Mel Gibson seems like he is walking his way through it and can't wait until he is finished.

They awake to the sound of Bo Hess screaming in the corn feild. It then becomes aware that a crop circle has been made.

The accident causes the husband, (the community's preacher), to abandon his church and religious beliefs.The story is able to immerse you in the fear a rural family deals with when earth is invaded aliens.

To clear something up- people living in Bucks County don't have accents, have more than one pharmacy, and don't know everyone. In fact, one of the local highschools (we have 3) have more than 1 thousand each. But that is beside the point. I thought the movie was great up until the ending. If they die from water, then what how did they live that long? There's water in the air- water vapor- all the time-especially in the summer, when the film was shot. It rains a ton here too. If they had come across a sprinkler, they would've died on the spot. Besides, there are tons of lakes- here and everywhere else. But what was surprising to me was that the people in the MIDDLE EAST, a desert, is where they figure out that water harms them- that's incredibily dumb.I for sure thought it was suspensful, but once I realized how stupid the plot really was, it became a 2 star movie for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I can't give it ZERO stars.","review":"Stinks big time.

Come on Mel Gibson, you can play in much better movies than this! I'll never understand how people can call this movie scary! I was bored to death with this movie. You think a good suspensful movie awaits you with the crop circles and all but... wrong. Crop circles suddenly start appearing on a farm owned by Gibson's character.

There wasn't any insight into who he was or who he had become. Phoenix did a good job as did the two children. The director's short part should have been eliminated or his character should have been expanded upon; who was he, why did he cause the accident, how did he feel because of it?

There were a few amusing one-liners here and there, but the way it was shot just was rotten. All of the major scenes with stuff going on, the camera focused on an inanimate object [Flashlight, basement] and all you could hear was the action. And when you finally got to see the alien, it was all dark. Yeah, I'm one of the guys who likes to see the bad stuff.And then, the ending. Aliens invade, scare the [heck] out of the world, and then just leave and take a few people with them?

It fell flat. I understand so many people loved it, but I was so disappointed that I hated it. For one I didn't like the needless animal violence in the very beginning. Getting past that, there wasn't enough content in the movie. Yes, there were eerie moments when there were unexplained noises, and things started happening with the aliens.

(\\"My Cousin Vinnie\\" has the same lame construction.) This rather negates the philosophical and metaphysical debates at the center of the film.

The expectation of this movie going in is nothing close to what actually happens in the movie. Gibson's performance is sub par against movies like \\"We Were Soldiers\\" and \\"Braveheart\\".A family living on a farm notices crop circles in their cornfield. After thinking it is a vandal, they determine it is a sign for something else. Without giving the movie away it turns out to be a life or death situation for all mankind.The acting in this movie...wait there was none. Every actor had the same expression, none. There was not one smile or laugh in the whole movie. Everyone had a serious look and mood to them for the whole movie.Overall this movie had the feel of a low budget horror flick with a big name actor. I rate it a 2 out of 5.

It does keep you in the movie engaging you to know what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talked alot, expected more action","review":"I thought that overall, it was pretty good.

Aliens who have the technology to create giant invisible space ships, yet are so pathetic they cannot break down a door or boarded window, who are so weak that one can be trapped by a veterinarian in his pantry. The first time we see an alien, it looks like a mime in a green suit.And the message: Mel Gibson has lost his faith in the early scenes. Will he regain his faith by the end of the movie? Three guesses.All the money and technology behind this film, and in the service of ... what?

Mel's a little older but other than the times he is doing the 'choking face that's trying terribly not to cry' (a la Ransom and Patrioit) his character of a disolutioned ex-priest is entertaining. There is some clever humor and adult-child interraction all centered around the 'arrival' of what ever left the crop circles.

Well, if it did, I was too engrossed in the movie to notice them.Signs, however, is not for those that like to put on their thinking cap, take out their computer and analyze the movies that they see. These people will not enjoy Signs. But if you are looking for a movie that will have you hanging by your fingernails and wondering if perhaps - just perhaps - this is what crop circles are all about, well , you must see this movie.

Mel Gibsen's amazing performance was riveting, as always, though his best performance was on Patsy Kinset in Lethal Weapon 2. He could barely handle her. Joaquin Phoenix's performance rivals Mel's. His beautiful interaction with the alien was memorable.I love it! Thank you for making me see the signs, Mel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such High Hopes For A Terrible Movie...","review":"The one thing that disappointed me about this movie was that I went in there with such high hopes of it being a great movie. But I was really mistaken. First of all, the movie is not even scary. It is very boring and confusing. You hardly know what the heck is going on throughout half of the feature. Second, the other half of the movie is you laughing at the kids and how stupid and sometimes funny they are reacting to the alien attacks. The aluminum foil hats are a plus, that's for sure. And finally, the ending. Oh my God, the ending, so horrible. Shyamalan is so good at giving us these twist endings and leaving me thrilled. This ending blew up in my face and .... big time basically. I am sorry, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. It was such a waste of money when I saw it in theaters. And the critics liked this one, doesn't that say something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Worlds","review":"If you liked this film, congratulations! You just saw War of the Worlds, bastardized and stolen, without so much as credit. But wait - replace corals with water, subtract decent plotline and add cheesy humor and M. Night Shyamalan's questionable appearance and bad acting. While you're at it, disable your brain's logical unit. NOW you have War of the Worlds.H. G. Wells' classic novel is ruined in this unadmitted adaptation, which does a great job at tricking the viewer with a promising trailer, but instead subjecting one to a story that doesn't really tie together (aliens are deathly afraid of water, yet don't mind romping around in the cornfields, which god knows are damp with dew).Read War of the Worlds instead - it's a much more interesting novel that doesn't insult your intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever.","review":"I wish I could give it a zero. Complete crap the aliens look retarded. The story is stupid. The only good movie M. Night Shyamalan made was Unbreakable. The rest are over hyped trash. Im a big fan of horror movies and this is not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time To Sleep","review":"This movie is slow just like the other M. Night Shyamalan movies. I don't know about everyone else but I need a faster pased film to hold my attention, otherwise it puts me to sleep. This movie put me to sleep just like his other 2 movies. Lets hope if he ever makes another film that it is faster pased."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is REALLY bad/disappointing","review":"Yeah, I thought this movie was going to really sort of creepy...the way they marketed it, you'd think the majority of the movie would be about crop circles and stuff. In a word NO...its cheesy its cliched (*spoiler*) you see big green men running around...it doesn't work...you leave the theatre going \\"oh my god...I can't believe A grade actors worked with an A grade director to produce this C grade movie.\\"Guys...don't waste your time.Elisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's two! Two! Two bad films in one!","review":"You have to wonder what Shyamalan was thinking when he made this stinker. What we've got here is a really bad little green men film painfully stitched together with a really bad, completely insipid loss of faith film. From Mel Gibson's incredibly lame Episcopal priest to incredibly feeble aliens to cloyingly cute kiddos this is one long boring waste of time.At this point I sort of wish Shyamalan had stopped after he'd made \\"Sixth Sense.\\" It seems clear now he only had one good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay box office prices!!","review":"Since when did ministers or preachers wear the collar of a Catholic Priest? And if Mel was meant to be a catholic priest, since when did Catholic Priests have wifes and kids?..I wouldn't have thought much about this detail but they kept refering to him as \\"Father\\". One other oversite is...If I were going to board a door shut I would do it from the side that the door opens...not the other side. Come on guys...do you think we would be so interested in this rather slow and uneventfull film that we wouldn't notice these obvious oversites? Mel must have been paid very well to agree to this flick because I have never seen him in anything but great stuff...Well except maybe \\"Air America\\" and I would pick that one over \\"Signs\\" any day.p.s. can I get a refund on my rental cost???!!!RJT"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine, beautiful movie.","review":"This is a beautiful, tightly scripted movie. Mel Gibson give the most sensitive and rounded performance of his career. The bad reviews that have been given here show a lack of understanding and maturity on the part of the reviewers. Yes, this movie is NOT about aliens, it is NOT about crop circles, it is NOT a science fiction or horror flick. These elements of the film were only vehicles for the themes of family, strength in trial, the loss and regaining of faith. There are no holes in this film-- as in Shyamalan's other films, everything falls together at the end -- everything. I found the ending perfectly satisfying -- the tensions and problems of the plot were resolved, and Shyamalan didn't even have to resort to hundreds of planes attacking giant saucers to get his points across. If you like horror or SF flicks, fine, but don't run down this movie because it isn't one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of 2002","review":"I am not going into detail about this movie plain and simple for M night shyamalan is a cinematic genious and deserves huge praise come oscar time .This is simply the close encounters of the new millenium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets worse the more you think about it...","review":"I am sorry, but I don't understand how this movie is garnering so much praise! I really wanted to like it, and went to see it on the first night (which is something that I rarely do), but am giving it more than one star only because there are quite a few touching and/or funny moments. Overall, the whole story is entirely too implausible. You end up waiting for that Night trademark twist ending that will make the whole mess make sense, but it never comes. This movie dies with a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Boring!!!","review":"i love suspense, thriller, etc. movies but this movie just wasted our time. it was super boring which ended us saying....\\"that's it?!\\". please, please, there are lots of perfect, thrilling movies out there....way a lot better than this. \\"Signs\\" does not really desserve a star in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Pay Attention","review":"This movie requires the viewer to pay close attention and listen carefully to the dialog. Much of the movie's suspense comes from what the actors are saying. The camera work adds to the viewer's uneasy feelings. Watch for scenes where not all of the shot's prime subjects are completely in the frame. It is very deliberate and adds to the mood of the film.Many people were disappointed with this film in comaparison to The Sixth Sense but I believe it is because they did not pay attention to all of the subtleties of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE WHICH CAN GIVE SOME WONDERFULL... DREAMS","review":"I have seen this movie yesterday (tuesday) in the night and i've never been able to quit my eyes of my T-V !!! ... It's the first time which a movie can make that for me ! MEL GIBSON, PHOENIX and the two childs, and the evident NIGHT SHYAMALAN realy, are merveillous, fabulous !

While I am big fan of Mel Gibson,I think is is by far the worse movie he has ever done. It is campy andpoorly executed. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIGN? I'LL GIVE YOU A SIGN! STOP!","review":"Stop! Don't waste your money! The reviewers must have been paid off., This script is beyond bad. I can't believe how insipid it is. People in this movie said things and acted like aliens themselves,in that it was so unatural and forced. And for not delivering. If you did not like this movie-don't feel like you are the alien. It's the reviewers-they obviously have taken over and are promoting movies that star their relatives! Yuck Yuck Yuck! This movie is an insult to all thinking people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triumph of Marketing over Substance","review":"I saw this movie because my girlfriend wanted to see Mel Gibson. I agreed because I thought it would have some sort of imaginative twist at the end, like the &#65533;Sixth Sense&#65533;. Alas, this movie disappoints like a kid's cereal box. It smothers its viewers in tense dialogue, end of the world fears, always promising something more, & ultimately failing to deliver any substance. Actually, the greatest strength of this movie is that it is so ridiculous that none of it is believable&#65533; emotions without reason. At the end I waited for Mel to wake up & find out the whole movie was just a dream experienced in some kind of coma.The movie use cliché after cliché-- a man who has lost his faith and needs redemption, an asthmatic child, faith over fear, trust don't question, & incredibly stupid aliens-- with weaknesses stolen from old B sci-fi movies. It's a feel good movie for brain dead people & those too afraid to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror or comedy?","review":"This film was enjoyable - but as a comedy and not the horror film it was meant to be. And I am not referring to the \\"subtley injected humor\\" mentioned in the Amazon description - the parts that were meant to be frightening came off so poorly that they were laughable.There were some mildly moving moments, but alas these are insufficient to save this failed scion of the horror genre...Ah well... at least the little girl was cute, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, dont be fooled by fans of M. Night.","review":"This movie is not good. Don't be fooled by the other reviews. The first half is ok but as soon as these ridiculous looking aliens show up, the whole plot goes down the tubes. I can't understand why people are so into this movie. The Sixth Sense was fantastic, this doesnt come close and of course at the end of this movie M. Night Shayamalan tries to bring everything together and blow you away, but honestly its just not interesting. This was probablly the biggest waste of time of a movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!!!","review":"This film was beyond bad. It's completely implausible plot, mediocre acting, self-righteousness, and excessive sentimentality were just too much for my delicate system. And, it was not the least bit frightening or foreboding! A complete waste of time. Watch \\"War of the Worlds,\\" a much more successful film in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signs (I like it, i like it a lot!)","review":"Yes, i said it. I liked it, signs is a great movie! It doesnt seem overly scary. Of course theres a few jumpy parts but nothing overly bad, what gets you is when you go out side at night after seein the movie.I like that the movie is based in a real place. Everything is always washington and new york. I like how it was placed smack dab in the middle of bucks county PA. I live right near bucks county,and near corn feilds, so that made the movie even better.I think the guys at did the casting deserve a pat on the back. Mel and the dude from gladiator did a fantastic job together...One thing i did'nt like though was the aliens. I think they messed up a little and its funny. How can a beast jump from the ground to the top of a roof, and break through a roof, yet it cant get out of a pantry and gets beat up by a guy with a base ball bat, odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"I'll be honest, I hated this film. It has so many plot holes that it is the cinematic equivalent of Swiss cheese. It seems that Mr Shyamalan decided not do do any research whatsoever about anything related to this film, even the Catholic faith that he beats any unsuspecting veiwer to death with. This is purely a film about God, but too gutless to come out and say it. Instead the veiwer is dragged through two hours of b-grade pap then slapped in the face with a bible. If I want to get brainwashed by religious zelots I'll go to church, not to a movie theatre. Utter ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can watch this over and over!","review":"This is a good movie that sparks much discussion about faith. It leaves much to the imagination as well.

Thanks Amazon.com!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I'd Expected","review":"From Better Homes and Gardens, I expected a more basic approach to cooking.

When we have Book Fairs, it is one of the best sellers!! What is it about the book that they liked? I asked them this question and they said that the illustrations and instructions were clear and easy to follow. They loved the variety and types of foods.The book showed foods that all children liked to make and eat...(these are children who have people who cook meals for their households!)

I thumbed through the beautifully colored pages, saw some really great recipes and couldn't wait to use it.And then it happened. I saw 19 pages that were repeated. They didn't have page numbers on them like the first ones did.

I don't have an obesity issue but I definitely have self-esteem problems. For Carnie to be so honest and admit to us her flaws is very illuminating. This just shows that celebrities have the same issues us regular people are faced with. I enjoyed the depths of silliness as well as its depths of self discovery...my 2 cents! GOOD WORK CARNIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I was looking for","review":"I am having WLS myself, and was looking for a book that was informative about the surgery and process. I found Carnie's book was more of a life-journal, rambling, and it was hard for me to follow along, I kept waiting for the \\"guts\\" of the story. I was also disappointed with the frequent use of the \\"f\\" word, feeling that it wasn't as necessary to the story. Overall it was an allright book, I just found other books to help me in my own journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

I bought it because Carnie is an intriguing character - and no disprespect at all - but she was the heavy girl with two beautiful girls. I was curious to her life and her surgery.Well, what a vulger read we had here. Aside from the expletives everywhere - we learn she lost her virginity at 13 or some too young age - at a parent sanctioned sleep over with her boyfriend. That falls under way too much information.Carnie has a beautiful voice and she mentions quite often she didn't get the respect she deserved. We get it. Quit whining.But the coup de gras was what she whispered to her surgeon prior to him slicing her open. I'll save that for you to read for yourself.Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Once again, another hit for fat people and the 'wonder' of weight loss surgery.

I admire her for writing this book. I admire her lovely singing voice. I admire her for the personable, compassionate person she is.

So, last night, I found \\"Dead Letters,\\" and instantly pounced on it.I'm listening to it right now, and I must say, The Rasmus reminds of HIM, due to the haunting vocals. But, this is a fantastic CD that has profound lyrics, ones that make you think and you can't get out of your head. I'm listening to \\"Not Like The Other Girls\\" and I must agree with whoever commented that it resembles Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with lyrics and guitar riffs - a very well done song. Their single \\"In The Shadows\\" has a catchy beat, one that you can't help but tap your fingers to.I'm truly a fan of The Rasmus now, and I must recommend buying \\"Dead Letters\\" along with \\"Razorblade Romance\\" and/or \\"Love Metal\\", both by HIM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I had never heared a single song by 'The Rasmus', but a friend of mine really recomended it.

When I look back on it now, it seems elementary, but I can't deny that it was helpful at the time. It gets the reader out of the mindset, which might be familiar from undergraduate coursework, of looking for the right answer to examination questions, and teaches the importance of finding ambiguities and handling them intelligently. The authors are right that this is an important habit not just for the student but for the lawyer.I do not particularly care for the style in which the book is written. It did not seem to me to assume an intelligent reader. But I know many classmates did not have this reaction at all, and found it very readable. Anyway, it's not supposed to be a book you read for pleasure. You read it because you are quite rationally in fear of law school exams.

I used to use a 36 LED light for this but it looked silly, didn't THROW the light well and it needed to be charged at the outlet while turned off, lame.Overall a killer light and doesn't have the ridiculous LED panel look and with so much more power.

However, if your six year old knocks it off the shelf it won't survive regardless of how much you pay for it. I feel somewhat the same about furniture at this point.

It was working fine until it started to mess up the first week in December 2002. The player froze in the middle of the movie several times. I had to turn off the power and turn the power back on. After I did that, it froze again. I tried cleaning the lens with my CD/DVD lens cleaner, did no good it messed up again.

The writer indeed does a wonderful job in keeping you amused and surprised. He mixes very diverse topics such as linguistics, weather, religion, colonialism, economics, geography and a thousand more, into a single narrative, with such vitality and coherence, that you wonder how come there are such a few mainstream works on such a fascinating epic history.If you know nothing about, or just a few details of African History, after finish reading this book you will feel like an expert, but more important that that, the writer most probably will sow in you a feeling of love for that continent a thirst to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to read","review":"This is a long book about Africa, that is nevertheless very interesting all the way through. It comes in two broad sections: the first part talks about the geology of Africa and about how people lived in relation to the land and how they survived there. This part is about people who lived with no (or very scarce) written records. It's done very well. Reader is very knowledgeable about the most recent theories and discoveries in human evolution . It's relevant, of course, to the history of the world and not just Africa. The second part is about what happened once Europeans and other types headed back in to Africa. This part reads a bit like a news summary. It's interesting, it's detailed (horrific in places), and it's only part of the story. That's fair enough, though. Goodness me, you can't have everything in one book. My position was: I know nothing at all about Africa. I need to start somewhere.

If this book had actually been true to history, I might have been able to overlook the slight lack of skill in its writing, but that just was not possible. Romantic fantasy and made-up nonsense fill Tarr's interpretation of the tale, and it is obvious from her depictions of everyday Egyptian life and ideals that she has never truly studied the subject. The orders of the characters' deaths, proven by archaeological evidence, is not even correct, as well as the character of her husband. I urge anyone interested in Hatshepsut or Egypt to read about this fascinating subject, but choose a more worthy and accurate book to spend your time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat characters, predicatible, not historically accurate","review":"I think if you are going to write about a historical person, even if that person lived some 4000 years ago, you should try to research the person and the era. Like many of the other reviewers this book suffers when compared to Pauline Gedge's beautiful recreation of Pharoaoh Hatshepsut's life: \\"Child of the Morning\\" which is so much more believable and so much better written. I was willing to see what another author could do with the story, after all, we don't know too many details about her life, only that she was the only female Pharaoh, a really unimaginable feat for that or any era in history! and she ruled for 22 years, and most likely had a commener lover named Semenket...but Ms Tarr did not pull it off at all in my opinion.

This film shows the two sides of the coin of life. Life is neither heads or tails, it is both. The film is about the US 442nd regiment combat team in WW2. The Japanese-American platoon had to fight both the Germans & the racial prejidices of their fellow GI's. Lieutenant Mike Grayson-Van Johnson trains the men, but does so very unwillingly. Soon during their campaigns in Italy & France in 1943-44, he develops a great admiration for the Japanese-Americans. The depth of their sacrifice & heroic strength-\\"Go For Broke motto,\\" prove to him that they are both great soldiers & Americans.To the present day they remain the most decorated unit in the history of the US military.

Without a doubt, I would suggest this film to any fan of Van Johnson, WWII films, or even films depicting the struggle of minorities in America. You have an obligatory conversion of a racist, you have the minority group exceeding all expectations and standards, and you have the politically correct CO in the background of it all.Some of the banter is extremely memorable (\\"You know, if I was a Gerry on that ridge and a tank got close enough to shoot at me point-blank, I would take off like a ruptured duck... right over the side of the cliff\\"), and some less so (\\"You know, there's only one thing I don't like about these Buddha-heads... they don't dig em (foxholes) long enough!\\").

The mountain scenery is spectacular and the story concerned the conflict between religious values and greed and pride. I believe that the \\"actors\\" were real local people. Having traveled a tiny bit in the general area it really took me back. A good viewing for people interested in mountains, mountain life, and Buddhism."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"There Are No Accidents\\"","review":"This is an age old tale set in an ancient village in the Himalaya. The old village chief insists on waiting to take a yak caravan over the mountain on the specific date given by the oracles. A young whippersnapper, Karma, who would like to take over the Chief's role sooner rather than later, insists on leaving immediately before the weather turns foul. Both are stubborn, insistent and unmoving in their decision of when to leave. Both can't be correct or can they? This is a contest between each man and the mountain and everyone wins, because \\"there are no accidents\\". A breathtaking film cinematically and one that echos the spirituality of the Tibetan people. Bruno Coulais' soundtrack for this film is absolutely perfect. Eric Valli's direction is amazing considering the cast are not actors.

Thanks to my nephew, Rajan, who mailed me this film from Nepal.Mr. Valli has done a remarkable job documenting perhaps, the last of the great caravans of the Himalayas. For those who want to read and explore more, Eric Valli and his wife, Diane Summers has written an in-depth article in the 1993 National Geographic Dec issue, about the salt traders of Dolpo. At such great heights Mr. Valli's filming is spectacular, its a great achievement. I would also like to mention Mr. Bruno Coulais for his outstanding music.

It has a timeless theme- passing the torch from old to young- and magnificent scenery. It has varied elements- drama, sentimentality, a little humor and suspense, and blends them well. It's acting is convincing, and its' dialogue is entertaining. This is a first rate production that benefited from an apparently low budget. Much of Caravan's charm derives from its' simplicity. If you are used to standard Holywood fare, you should pass on seeing it.

It's wonderful to be dropped so completely into another culture by a filmaker that both respects his subject and respects his audience's intelligence. It's not like anything is unclear here or like we need a basis in the culture or religion to understand this, but on the other hand he doesn't try to explain too much either. He just lets the story unfold and brings us along with it.The cinematography was great. The mountains are both things of beauty and spirits and gods and challenges to be reckoned with. In a way this is the story of two stubborn men and the people they effect. As such it's universal, and the message it leaves you with could come from any culture. But it's wonderful that that can be woven in with a trip to a very different, interesting culture. That's what world cinema is about, and this is a fine example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden Treasure","review":"This wonderful film gets my nod when it has been nominated for academic award for the best foreign film 2000.

I have been to Dolpa, infact I have seen these people around having same kind of life. The people in the movie are real and their customs are real too. The story has been greatly supported by mind blowing scenic view of Nepal and its culture. The himalayas, villages, Foksandu lake are real and it has become the heart of this movie. On top of that this movie also reflects the culture which is dying at this information age.

There have been and are great guitarist, if love the guitar you know them all, Stevie Ray, Buchanan, Gatton, Jimi, BB, Albert Collins, etc., the real gods, the players we listen to and try to learn from their incredible talents. Well add another, Walter Trout. Who is this upstart? Walter has been around quite a while, do a little research and you will soon see. How can I best describe his latest CD? Well it's easy, it has not left my CD player for two weeks! In the same sense that Stevie Ray Vaughan was an open channel to creativity and emotion, Walter trout is also. His genius for guitar goes from comforting to devastating. Killer tone, incredible music, other worldly guitar - you need this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in a rut.","review":"My first purchase of a Trout CD. If not for one major annoyance, I would have given this at least four stars. The problem? This guys solos are stuck in a rut. Each song starts off solid with a bang, but when the solo comes and the hammer-ons/pull-offs are piled on top of another, it ultimately becomes unlistenable. Eventually, you begin to realize that all the solos sound the same and take their toll on the overall project. It's a shame, because overall the group has a good sound and Trout has a fine Strat tone. This CD had potential. Unfortunately, Trout hasn't quite figured out that sometimes less is better.Lee Hagen Delafield, WI mhagen1@wi.rr.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthy Rock & Blues..","review":"walter trout uses tempos of rock and blues to give a cd to listen over and over, his guitar work blends the music to give great style and sound.."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS DUDE ROCKS!","review":"you want to hear powerful gut wrenching blues and incredible guitar work! this is your man! this dude jams move over stevie ray walter trout has arrived! wow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It don't get no better!","review":"I remember when that strat looked new!!!

It was funny and it made you realize how people can let one bad thing can change their whole outlook on life. This book is about so much more than buying too many shoes and fancy hair apointments, it's about discovering who you really are.

I could not get past the bad writing after the first fifty pages. Life is too short and there are too many GOOD books to read. The writing was flat, annoying, and plain boring which in turn made Karyn flat, annoying, and plain boring. To get the gist of her story just go to the website.

No matter how you look at it, beggars are beggars, online or in the street. Now Karyn's making money off of stupid people (maybe you) who support this nonsense. Karyn, it's your fault you were in debt, not the world's. Yet you play off people's sympathy to get on their good side and take money from them (and continue to). I'm sure you're making a killing off of all this, but I hope it's short lived.Don't buy this trash. If you want to help a beggar, I'm sure you can find plenty of TRULY POOR people in your town.

It's far preferable than plugging a surge protector into an extension cord since most cheap extension cords do not use a thick enough gauge wire to handle the draw that most people put on surge protectors.Only major drawback is the plug configuration (which I knew about before purchasing) For the price, it would greedy to expect more than the standard 6-in-a-row, but it can be a bit of a pain if you have chunky AC adapters to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fellows 6 outlet strip w/15' cord","review":"Not a heavy duty outlet strip.

This is my first real DVD player (had an X-Box before, but A. It didn't play VCDs, and B. it wouldnt play some regular DVDs... so I got this one). I must say, I am quite happy with it. I only had one single hiccup with this DVD player when playing Monsters Inc, and it was very slight. This DVD player has verrrry good picture quality, a decent remote (so-so). I don't know much about DVD players, but in a room full of DVD enthusiasts, as a starting DVD player, this was highly reccommended. I love it alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear you.","review":"I bought this product to replace the Toshiba, which died after a year of infrequent use. The picture quality appears inferior to the similarly priced Toshiba from the last year. The biggest problem I had with this product was that the sound level for dialogue was so faint that it was largely buried by the other sounds. This is even with the dialogue enhancer, which by the way doesn't work with some of the disks. If I turn up the volume, though, the other sound effects get way too loud. By the end of a movie, I was so tired just trying to follow the dialogue. During that movie, there was a brief moment of picture freeze, probably not a big deal, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impending DH07M!","review":"Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick....it will get you too!

Panasonic do not acknowledge that this is a general problem, and have not issued a product recall.There are a few work arounds posted on the net, like oiling the motor or cleaning the lens, but neither worked for me.I contacted Panasonic, and was told that I was out of warranty, so needed to get it repaired myself.

I was pleased to meet not only the gentleman sleuth (Walter Scott) but also the brave, strong and witty Midge Margaret. I enjoyed each new twist pulled into the plot and found that Ms. Scarborough somehow wonderfully managed to write of such horrid and frightening happenings in a suspenseful yet tasteful way instead of concentrating on blood and gore.

The characters are unconvincing...some of the cast should quit their acting career tomorrow (if they haven't already)...and the soundtrack is childish and completely out of synch with the screenplay. The goriest scene is when the wife is butchered in the bathtub by what appears to be an oversized electric meat carver. What makes it even more silly, is that it is an electric (cord and all) carver, being used to slice and dice underwater (????). The best part of this film is that its title hits home on two very important regards...it should go untold and \\"unseen\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic, readable, Lansdale has raw talent.","review":"Hap and Lenonard are unforgettable characters. I had to read all of his books at once. I was hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuing Disappointment","review":"I discovered the author through Captains Outrageous and thought where has this author been all my life. It turns out he has been busy writing mediocre books. This is a drawn out tale about the pair being in the middle of a racist town investigating a racist murder for most of the book. They finally get to the bottom of things as a flood comes along and washes away all the bad guys and the evidence of our pairs extrajudicial efforts. For about 20-30 pages toward the end after the heros get beaten up the old byplay resurfaces but it doesn't last. It's just a reminder of what the author could do when he was on his game. I see comedy is an option for a tag for this review. They must be kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can find it, GET IT!","review":"Sad to think this book is already out of print. This one is the third installment of the Hap/Leonard series and picks up where Mucho Mojo left off. The pair rush off to the aid of a friend, but pay the price for their outsize egos as they find themselves in a part of the South where the calendars seem to be set 30 years behind schedule. There are no quick, easy resolutions to be found and the Hap and Leonard at the end of the book are markedly different from the two at the beginning. As always, Mr. Lansdale's keen ability to understand and describe human nature is evident. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It reads the same way fried gizzards in hot sauce tastes!","review":"After reading \\"Two-Bear Mambo\\", I felt like I had never truly read a book until then. The characters seemed so real that I thought I was in the book myself, which I believe is the true mission of storytelling. The story lets you know just how dangerous, yet righteous, real life can be when you aren't just a participant. As of this review, I have read many of Joe's other \\"Hap & Leonard\\" stories. Each one has that unique reading experience I spoke of, yet it is still \\"Two-bear Mambo\\" that made the greatest reading impact for me in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!","review":"This book has to read to be believed. It blows away any comtemporary mystery you can find on the shelves. What you have is not just a conventional mystery, but one of the truest (and wittiest) books on race relations in our country . Lansdale has always been at the top of his field, but this is by far one of his best. One minute your heart is racing, the next you can't stop laughing. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold medal thrillers for the 21st century - excellent!","review":"I can't praise Lansdale enough. As well, I can't understand why he hasn't become as popular as he so well deserves. I LOVE these Hap and Leonard novels, with their wise-cracking, hard hitting, politically incorrect protragonists. This is two fisted action without so much as a concerned whim for anyone's feelings - you will find something to make you laugh on nearly every page. Great stuff. If you haven't yet read Lansdale, this is an excellent place to start. The writing is good enough that any reader will find themselves drawn in, if not for plot then dialogue, and if not for dialogue for setting. Somehow Lansdale pulls it all off without ever seeming strained or contrived. High pulp the stands with the best of them - Goodis, thompson, Whittington, Rabe, and now Lansdale. Get it while you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DaViD Pasadena Australia","review":"Roan Group dvd of To The Last Man. The picture quality is clear with reasonable sound. Now for the bad news, watching this dvd is like viewing a movie thru a shower of rain. Seldom have I seen such a scratched copy, plus it is was taken from a splicy print. Such a good film deserves far better treatment, and if this has been \\"digitally remastered from the finest elements\\" you could have fooled me. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cruelly overlooked classic","review":"This wonderful film barely got a release in 1987 thanks to the meddling of the Disney Channel; ironically, it was only through a free preview of the same in late 1993 that I was able to see it for the first time.The Brave Little Toaster is really proto-Pixar: many of the same people were involved behind the scenes, and the film has the same deft combination of excellent design, laughs, and heartfelt emotion. A story about a group of appliances that go looking for their lost master seems silly, but the vibrant animation, lush David Newman score, and excellent performances by the Groundling improv comedy troupe create a truly wonderful result.In short, if you've enjoyed anything Pixar has ever done, give this little movie a chance and watch it with whatever kids you have handy (and zvoid the inferior sequels)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"I remember loving this movie as a child!

This is not like other Disney films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disturbing","review":"This movie was not at all what I thought it would be. It along with BLT Goes to Mars was given to me by my mother as a gift to my children. After previewing the film with my husband we were not impressed. Many scenes, characters, and situations were disturbing even to us! It was creepy and weird. I own most of the other disney classics and normally have no complaints but this series is a whole other story. I even hesitated donating it to the goodwill for fear that it would scare some other child. If you own this movie watch it with the eyes of a child and perhaps you will understand. Some parts are cute and sweet but there are too many questionable things like an angry air conditioner that yells and then blows itself up?!? My advice would be to stick to the basics. You can't go wrong with Cinderella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"One of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Many of the scenes did nothing to enhance the plot, which I couldn't quite swallow anyway. A kid played with a toaster and a vacuum cleaner? Isn't that a little dangerous and wierd?The songs seemed forced, and, again, didn 't really help the story along. The parts shop scene scared my 4 year-old. I've seen PG movies that were less scary.

This movie is BAD FOR KIDS unless you think it is a good idea for your kids to learn arguing, emotional instability, intolerance, name-calling, and dependence.The animation is beyond poor. A grade school art class could knock this production out in an afternoon.Please do your children and yourself a favor and do not buy this poor piece of mental self-gratification and garbage. If you plan on parking them in front of a TV, why not at least give them a shot at being somewhat productive memebers of society by letting them watch anything from LeapFrog - ABC's, Word Factory, etc.This movie is terrible and will harm your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brave Little Toaster","review":"My kids have loved this movie since they were very little.

It's quick-paced, entertaining, and actually has a serious plot, unlike most of the watered-down stuff Disney puts out. It takes sophisticated concepts like materialism, obsolescene, and consumerism and handles them with suprising verve. The idea of giving appliances emotions that are recognizable to young kids helps convey the more mature parts. A fun story for little kids and a brilliant satire on American wastefulness for those older, it is hard to believe that Disney chose to stick with its current variety of sappy, pointless little ditties.

I don't understand why so many people are posting poor reviews of the movie. Given the type of television and movies (and media in general) kids are bombarded with, I think this is a fairly safe choice. This movie teaches kids to deal with real life situations and encourages friendship, loyalty, and understanding rather than showing fight scenes or having cultic undertones.One more thing: If you think the use of household appliances as characters is a lame idea for a cartoon movie plot, you could also point out the stupidity of using the candelabra, clock, and teapot in Beauty and the Beast.

The typical hallway, doorway, stair or entry that this gate would be used in will require that you purchase more than just the extensions in this particular package.

The last three books I read - and I kept reading, in the hope that the next one would get better - have been dire.This one may be marginally better than A Touch of Magic, but as the other reviewer has noted, it's built on a false premise.Clearly Nadine Miller has a lot of fans; well, I'm no longer one of them and won't be reading any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did she bother?

A Touch of Magic was so awful it was embarrassing, even more so when Miller revealed her complete lack of research at the end, not only on the period but on English inheritance law generally.The illegitimate offspring of an aristocrat CANNOT inherit his title, so Miller's premise is sunk before she starts.

It was an older edition borrowed from the library, perhaps the first edition, and the narrator was just awful. He mispronounced many words, and I heard him use incorrect words (if they weren't, the sentences made absolutely no sense, such as saying \\"neuron\\" instead of \\"neutron\\")I also thought the book was disorganized and was trying to be too many things, therefore failing to give proper attention to any one theme.

As it was, I have read or heard all these concepts explained much more concisely from other sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Turtles all the way down\\"","review":"The book begins with a story about a esteemed scientist giving a lecture about astronomy.

It really explains many concepts of modern physics in layman's terms. Often we hear scientific words bantered about on various educational television programming without really understanding the concepts and theories behind them. This book goes into concise detail on quite a few topics and does a rather good job explaining them. I thought the explanation of Einstein's general theory of relativity was well done. The explanation of time differential when matter nears the speed of light was explained quite clearly. It truly is relative from your vantage point. Also the concept of space being curved was well presented. This is really a very interesting book. I truly couldn't put it down when I found it in the library.

One of the most frustrating things he did -mainly in the first few chapters- was explain a theory and then, a few pages later, tell you that it had been disproved. Some things he explains in great detail and others he does not. The illustrations aren't very helpful. I also was a little sick of all his personal interjections - he thinks quite highly of himself.

Hawking quite obviously knows his stuff, but he's a physicist, not a writer. This is apparent in some places. He deals with mind-boggling subjects, and although he tries to explain it at a level the common person could understand, it's not always accomplished.

I've taken a few college classes in astronomy and enjoyed the subject very much, but seriously, i simply finished the second half of the book just to complete it.

Because I know that it is hard to reveal knowledge in a simple way to listeners which are very inferior to you in certain field, I think Hawking's work is incredible.

It is updated from the original text to include the most recent theories of time travel and worm holes.The book was first written in 1988 and in the world of physics - a lot has happened in that time. If you read the original - you may want to brush up by reading this one, too.You don't need more than curiosity to enjoy this book.

Hawking does a pretty good job of speaking intelligently on the nature of the universe and some some pretty advanced particle physics, but manages do to do so while keeping it at a level you do not need to be a rocket scientist, or any other kind of scientist, to follow along. Certainly many of his thoughts are conjecture and subject to further disproval by advancements in science, technology and research, but I dont know that any discoveries will totally invalidate his conclusions, just potentially put a finer tip on some of his fuzzier theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man is brilliant but its way over my head.","review":"Steven Hawking is a genius there is no question about it.

This book is without a doubt proof, as he gracefully is able to bring such massively complex topics into understandable terms for virtually anyone willing to play with the ideas to understand. I expected a voyage through difficult material, but i was pleasantly suprised by the good style of the writing and the appropriate interjections of opinion that accompanied it. Gradually as we move through time with the book the material gets more complicated, but try and understand these concepts anywhere else unless you have a firm foundation in physics. This is a literary monument, and a throughly enjoyable and satisfying trip through modern physics. Refreshing in its approach, enlighting with its delivery of the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that explains it all...","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in figuring out how it all works. Do not be worried that the ideas presented in this book are to complex for anyone less than a physics major to grasp. I found that it was a fairly easy read with only one or two of the concepts in it to too hard for me to grasp, and I have not even taken physics in school yet (I am only a freshman in highschool). Hawkings clearly explains his ideas by using metaphors from everyday life. Trust me: if you want to know how things came to be, and how they might end, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Classic","review":"There are many layman's books on cosmology and modern scientific theories. Somethimes it can be hard to distinguish truth from misrepresentation. However, one can be sure that hearing these theories 'straight from the horse's mouth (as Hawking is responsible for the development of many of them) that one is being told the truth. He consciously presents his ideas in a non-mathematical way to make the book accesible to anyone. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this is a beginner's book only.

Hawking explains the mysteries of the universe like black holes, the beginning and end of the universe, dark matter, time, and over views of how many of our present day theories came about all in plain words and humor.

That Stalin intended that the North Koreans would lose the war, so that he intended to drag in the Chinese and that the US would for their own reasons allow the South Koreans to lose a limited defeat so that they could save them after a long fight once they got the US congress to support the war.Its just too far fetched. A simpler explanation would be that Kim a Korean nationalist decided to unify Korea, and Stalin, Mao and Kim all miscalculated the US response. So losing control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Journey!","review":"Wow... I just started reading this book two days ago and I'm completely engrossed... wished i had started reading it on a weekend, in order to read it faster!!!Having been in China just a couple of months ago, I wish I had read this before my trip.

The author goes on and on in circles without getting to the heart of the matter quickly. For example the first example, is discussed after 50 pages of boring presentation. And yet, the example is not a simple smooth starting point. No, it's a simple game !I really and truly regret the money I wasted on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Fives stars is a rating I've only given to Endless Summer. This book is an extensive volume on J2ME MIDP 2 and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in MIDP 2 development. Less than a fifth of the book focuses exclusively on Symbian but the detailed contextual API info adds significant value over some other books I've reviewed on J2ME that don't cover optional packages or simply 'mention' less-used packages without explaining how they are used. It would only be perfect if it were a bit more thorough covering more packages in greater detail- but that's what Sun's specs are for anyway.

I love to watch the original, classic Sylvester & Tweety cartoon during the Looney Tunes hour on this TV station. I am not a kid, but a grown-up who knows the difference between a good and bad quality of most movies. I was totally lost and confuse when viewing Tweety's High-flying Adventure.

They give the reader a feel for the immense size of Cairo and its vital significance as a metropolis of the Middle East. We see the myriad groups and ideas that populate Cairo. From Islamist fundamentalists to the westernised, secular elite. Two extremes that uneasily co-exist.The book also describes the economy of Cairo. Especially its dependencies on international trade. But tensions are present. The biggest might not be religious, but economic. Cairo is seen as having a vast urban underclass, that struggles daily to merely survive. While there is also a small group of locals who enjoy First World lifestyles. The latter often move in semipublic spaces, like gated communities and fancy shopping malls. To which the majority can only dream about. Does not bode well for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classic New Age books on crystals","review":"Walker's research into the therapeutic uses of crystals is really one of the best methods for approaching the basics. This is a book that I reccomend to all my beginning students, and even to my advanced ones. This one, little book is worth the investment, even if the subject matter doesn't entirely click. Walker's book is a how-to guide for mastering use of the quartz crystal, and it build's a sense of partnership and familiarity with your beloved crystal allies.It also includes some information on atlantis, practical applications of crystal energy, several meditation and divination techniques, dowsing, instructions for making crystal tools, and basic info on other coloured varieties of quartz.Give this book a try. It will open your eyes to the onset of the \\"crystal craze\\" that began in the mid/late eighties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Idea. Simple Design. Should cost a lot less.

One word of caution, depending upon your door, the instructions may be in the opposite (ie, upside down) so check before drilling the hole. Otherwise, this is effective but should probably cost a fraction of the selling price...it's dubious as to the long term durability. However, since there aren't any other solutions on the market, it gets four stars for doing what it is intended to do which is open the door without having to hassle with the slider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept A+, Execution D-","review":"Great idea, but needs to be tweaked. First off, the shaft that goes through the rubber grommet should be square as should the hole in the grommet so that the handle will stay in the horizontal flat position. With everyone and their dog using this, the handle will get pointed sideways and every which way. Second, there should be a pin on the back side, so that the handle cannot be pulled, which will make it miss the handle on the screen door completely or worse, popping off the cap on the opposite side, to be lost forever in the lawn. I would not purchase this item in its present design again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works as advertised.","review":"The Camco 43953 RV Screen Door Opener works as advertised.

If this was the first stereolab CD I ever heard, I never would have bought another. This album stinks! Just listened to it again and I like it less the second round. I rather enjoyed the last several releases, but this album is just annoying to listen to; very electronic; fake percussion that went out in the 80s, and a freaky stereo effect that is fatiguing. What has happened to my favorite band? It's sad to see a great band in decline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Euro-Trash, Stereolab-style","review":"Unfocused music has no parlay on pretensions drab hooks and pseudo-groove fakeness. Stereolab's 'Margerine Eclipse' is a Francophile stab at Euro-Hip hop with no winning results. Andy Ramsay, Simon Johns, and Tim Gane disappoint in almost every track of this beat heavy and rhythmically dead CD.The convoluted CD mixes, and which ironically starts optimistically, and ends with a thud and a dud. Stereolab's disappointing release contains 3 Francophone songs that do nothing to raise the Anglophonic songs that loiter on \`Margerine Eclipse'. Laetitia Sadler is a beautifully voiced chanteuse with clear aspirations of playing beyond Stereolab. Her notes reach highs and lows that show Stereolab's limits early within \`Vonal Decision', \`Need to Be', and \`Margerine-Melodie'. Clearly, Stereolab's days are numbered...Skip this tedious bit.

Sound-Dust was clearly one of their most accomplished albums. This one is right there with it. I am glad the band kept on. It's hard to describe the sound of this record truth be told. Organic and laid-back and vintage are what come to mind. More than their first couple of albums the last two have been really cohesive and down to earth and I really love them for that. It's probably not going to matter if I went track by track. I think if you are new to Stereolab you might, MIGHT, want to start elsewhere but I can tell you this is one damn fine and truly listenable album. Press play and jump in a warm bath with candles, lemonade, and some greenery. Thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Bon!","review":"I disagree with one reviewer who deemed this album \\"less trippy and ambient.\\" An example to the contrary is Track 8 - Margerine Melody. Perhaps the reviewer wasn't wearing headphones. This 6+ minute track is a phenomenal example of how Stereolab utilizes stereo in a sublime way. Trippy and ambient indeed, but also much more. All of this gushing and I've only spoken about one track.Track 3 - Sudden Stars - is also a gem. I was glad to see they put this on the album, as I had purchased the Instant O EP and Sudden Stars became an instant favorite.While I prefer the trippier, longer, stereo-intensive tracks, the shorter tracks on this album don't fall short on the pleasure scale. The entire album is an exciting blend of old and new Stereolab and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh...Wow, let's give one word that describes this umm...SAD","review":"No not literally sad, I mean what kind of a sick person made this.

THIS VERSION OF RETURN OF THE KING SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE! The story is NOT a children's tale! It's just NOT! Too much of the manuscript needed to be changed and toned down in order to make it so. The entire screen adaptation is worthless. The only memorable scene is before the Black Gate with the Mouth of Sauron (which was decently done despite the rest of the 'movie'). There is one reason, and one reason alone to buy this foul, pitiful excuse for a DVD; you already have the The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings animated movies, and you want to have the full tale.GARBAGE!

If it had been made by the same peopel that did the Lord of the Rings anime-type style movie, it would have been a bit better. This movie had bad animation, songs and all that. Orcs don't look like big fat pig creatures and this movie was about following only 15% of the original storyline. These people did a nice job on The Hobbit, but failed completely on this one. It was hard to even watch a little of this. It swayed away from the real plot so much, it disgusts me. For small children who can't read the books quite yet (they were made for adults, but I started reading them when I was 12).

This film pickes up about where the lord of the rings movie by ralph bakshi ended. It tells the rest of the story of ring. This movie was done in the style of the older Rankin Bass carton the hobbit. Using the much simpler animation of the earlier movie makes this one a bit less distracting then the lord of the rings. The complex story of J.r.r. Tolkien was one that was exceptionally difficult for any artist to bring to the screen and it resulted in a fragmented tale this movie \\"the return of the king\\" attempted to finish the tale and tie up the story. if you are a tolkien fan whether you love this movie or hate it, I would recommend it just to finish the tale. If you just relax and enjoy the movie its a pretty good tale.

Most people who see it seem to like it. Unless, of course, they've read the books, and realize that Hobbits don't speak in some stilted old fashioned language w/ thee's and thou's, Aragorn respects and understands Gandalf's advice, Sam does NOT find the Ring lying on the ground outside the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Orcs don't sing, Gandalf knows more than the viewers about what is going on and is an awful choice for narrator, etc, etc... So, they rewrote the story and changed the characters. This is NOT Tolkien's Return of the King. It is an interesting movie for kids though, and I'm sure many kids enjoy watching it. In their defence, Eowyn is ok, and Frodo and Sam's trip thru Mordor is ok, barring the beginning and end. I think they did a much better job on the Hobbit and should have stopped there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I watched this movie with a growing sense of disbelief and horror.

Wow. Just wow. It's really bad, I don't remember it being this bad as a kid but if you can stomach the singing you can be treated to certain plot lines and elements missing from the far far superior Jackson film including the ending that Tolkien had in his book with Gollum dancing off the cliff.If you saw this as a child I encourage you to watch it again.

Reviewers are spitting in its face, claiming the animated fellows don't properly portray the book characters. I would like to rebut: Frodo is excellently done, a handsome noble hobbit, instead of foolish & young as portrayed by other cartoons. Sam Gamgee is also well-drawn, and comes across more brave and dedicative towards Frodo than some other movies like to make him. The songs are fun, and although they may come up a little too much in the movie, are catchy and creative. Gandalf's voice is wonderful to listen to.

That movie is a must-see for any Tolkien fan. The problem is tha the movie ends before the story is over. I think a sequel was anticipated but never happened. So, needing some closure, I picked up the Return of the King to end th estory. The characters aren't even comparable toBakshi's. Roddy MacDowell (an amazing actor) was terrible as Samwise, he was trying to turn the lovable bumkin into Hamlet. The Orcs and Ring Wraiths aren't frightening. Gandalf's character hasn't changed since The Hobbit and every three minutes tehy break into a mindless song (How many times can we hear Frodo of the nine fingers?). This movie is good for a true Tolkien fan but everyone else should just read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy Story","review":"With unimpressive animation and poor voice acting already a hindrance, the Swiss-cheese plot pretty well doomed this movie. Of course, it would be difficult for anyone to show, much less summarize, the whole of The Hobbit and The Return of the King in just over 90 minutes. Still, the choices Romeo Muller made in adapting the screenplay are questionable at best.The John-Denveresque soundtrack is absolutely horrid, save for \\"Where There's a Whip, There's a Way.\\" Someone should've used that whip on those involved with this film, so it would have been more than just a poor representation of Tolkien's masterpiecce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite As Good As The Hobbit","review":"Bought this movie for my wife so that she could complete her collection of the Orson Bean animated Lord of the Rings Trilogy.PROS: Return to true animation from that ridiculous mess that wasThe Lord of the Rings (1978 Animated Movie) (Remastered Deluxe Edition).

The King isn't really in this movie, Aragorn's in it for maybe 60-70 seconds at most. My favorite part is when Sam decides to abandon Frodo and destroy the ring himself. After 10 minutes and 2 musical numbers he comes to his senses and goes back. My other favorite part is when Theoden is killed by dark clouds when his horse goes crazy.

Fans of Bakshi's abruptly ended \\"Lord of the Rings\\" will find this to be a capable sequel, well animated and mature enough for adults. A must see for animation fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchery","review":"I can honestly say that this movie absolutely butchered a classic tale. If the goal was to create a sugar-coated children's version of Return of the King, then Rankin and Bass take the cake. If that's what you're looking for, then go right ahead and buy ths movie. What the creators of this movie didn't realize, is that Lord of the Rings was not intended only for children. It was mainly intended for people of teen to adult years. And children would find it interesting even if it weren't sugar-coated.You wouldn't make a jolly children's version of Grapes of Wrath or Mody Dick that was totally inacurate, so why do it with this? That is exactly what you will get if you buy this movie. It is the butchering of a classic. And you will be wasting your money if you buy it because it is the only version available. Read the books, then wait around until Christmas of this year. Peter Jackson has made Lord of the Rings what it was intended to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not as bad as all that","review":"While I can't say it's as true to the story as I'd have like to seen, I can say it was true to the trilogy as made on film. It continues and finishes the story as started by Lord of the Rings, and it returns the filming to Rankin and Bass who made the first Hobbit movie. I found the animation top-line considering it was made some twenty years ago in 1980. I do wish that either this or the previous movie had finished scripting from the Tolkin book \\"The Two Towers\\", which would have filled in the plot holes, but for the time would have been hard to translate into film. I found the soundtrack really rounded out the story and made for some very moving scenes. All in all, a very fine film indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Tolkien adaptation ever","review":"Trash.

Rankin/Bass did a decent job with \\"The Hobbit\\", but this is practically unwatchable for adults. Glen Yarborough's warbly singing with all of the flashbacks is terrible. The characters are too cartoonish, especially Merry and Pippin - they've made them look like morons. Sure they couldn't have done it as well as Bakshi did LOTR, but they could have given it a little more respect. Skip this one and just watch \\"The Hobbit\\" and LOTR over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good animation, but disappointing nonetheless!","review":"If you're expecting to really experience Tolkien on film, this isn't it! For some reason, the producers of this version of Book 3 in the LOTR trilogy decided to make major changes in the book. Why? I don't know! For example, King Theoden of Rohan was attacked by the Lord of the Nazguls, right? Not in this version! Here, he just falls from his horse for NO REASON and dies! And Sam & Frodo reached Mount Doom just about the time the battle before the gates of the Morrannon were opened, right? Not here --- in this version, they spent several days wandering inside Mount Doom! Why did they make these silly plot changes?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return of the King is a let-down","review":"I remember watching the Hobbit for the first time on video, and I absolutely loved it. When I saw the Lord of the Rings as an 8 year old, I loved the animation, and the gore, which was amazing to me. Even now, I still love both movies, but I can't say the same for Return of the King. The Hobbit works fine as a musical adventure, since it is intended for kids. The Lord of the Rings series of books is a much more darker tale, and it is horrible in the movie when they keep pausing for songs. In the Hobbit, where you can get away with kitty-action, in the Return of the King, it takes away from the story, because it is based around a war. All and all, very lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Ranger as Angmar? Yogi Bear? Shaggy? Scooby Doo?","review":"TRUST ME, fans of Tolkien, this production is AWFUL. Poor animation, poor quality, you name it.

DON'T GET THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't give it zero stars","review":"The brash idiocy that this movie embodies sickens me to no end. The very idea that Tolkiens work would be crushed into this awful piece of trash bewilders the mind. The music is simply awful, the storyline hopelessly marred and even then pityiful, and the animation is unsuitable for the serious subjects that are considered. I sinscerely hope that anyone who deciedes to watch this video will be doing so either to entertain a very small child or to relentlessly make fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy whisk","review":"As mentioned in ATK review of this whisk, it does have a large handle.

However, what made Blue Highways a wonderful read was not the highway or even the van - but the people he encountered on his way. When you travel across America on a boat you don't interact with very many interesting people. The result - a lot of water, shoreline and pretension. I don't which was worse; the author's struggle to complete the journey or my struggle to complete the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very diasappointing","review":"Least-Heat Moon's earlier books, Blue Highways and Prairy Erth, were terrific. This one is painful. It is self-indulgent, as were his earlier works in parts -- but without the wonderfully clean and accurate observations on humankind that make the other two must-reads. This is a book that seems to have been written to say \\"look at me, look at how witty and urbane I am.\\" Unfortunately, he falls flat, and comes across as merely pompous. Save your money -- give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Subject Matter, Poor Writing Style","review":"Having very much enjoyed listening to Barrett Whitener read P Nichols's Sea Change: Alone Across the Atlantic in a Wooden Boat, I was looking forward to listening to his reading of River-Horse. Unfortunately, the style of William Least Heat-Moon is long-winded and trite. His humor (or is it attempted wit?)is forced--especially in the failed witticisms with which he inevitably ends each chapter. Some of his iconographs are interesting, and the historical background he provides can even be gripping. However, listening to him describe his own life and experiences in his pretentious and overblown prose (did he write the whole thing with the thesaurus open in front of him?) made me shut off the tape recorder more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cries out for some editing","review":"Being a big fan of \\"Blue Highways\\", I was disappointed with the author's river version of this journey. The concept was nice and the writing good at times, but overall the book dragged and could have done with some editing to slice a 100 pages or so from the text.I also thought the device of creating a first mate from the many visitors did not work well. I would have enjoyed some sea tales and stories about the cast of people who joined him along the way.Overall, disappointing.But that is what you get when you set the bar so high with your first travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat-Moon Water Deep","review":"Having read Blue Highways and PrairyErth, I was anxious to read this new work by one of the profound writers we have with us on this planet. This book was well worth the wait. In comparison to his other books, this is closer to Blue Highways in that it is a travel scenario; more of what he sees as he travels, less of what he thinks. And it seems he's thinking about being in a hurry most of this trip. Heat-Moon is detailed observer throughout, and the points he makes about our environment should be taken very seriously. My only complaints are: 1.Too many nautical terms for us land-lubbers. 2.Not a leisurely pace, merrily, merrily down the stream. It's pretty frantic most of the time, as I'm sure boat travel would be. But overall, this is a great read; a great travel and environmental book which will take you across this nation on our forgotton blue highways: rivers. This too is another of Heat-Moon's 'deep maps'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring boat trip across America","review":"The late Spiro Agnew (\\"nattering nabobs of negativism\\") would have loved this book's language, even though he would have hated its sentiments. W. L. H-M offers the basic environmentalist's screed, and even though I personally agree with much of it, his is a novel approach: he will try to win your agreement through interminable boredom. If you like pedantry, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea, sunk by water-logged prose","review":"The idea behind this book is fascinating: is it possible to go coast-to-coast by water? What do you find along the way? How has riverside America changed in the interstate highway world?Alas, this book is almost unreadable. The writing is pretentious, stilted and overwrought; unnecessary literary devices (most notably the \\"Pilotis\\" schtick other reviewers have complained about) bog down the narrative, and the boat is barely onto the Erie Canal when you vaguely hope it will sink. I'm rooting for Bill Bryson or (better yet) Calvin Trillin or (even better) Ian Frazier to take this voyage sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveler's Treat","review":"The author is the Master of the Metaphors;Captain of the \\"Least\\" traveled America where the gristle, guts, and grit evolved.

However the author kept sticking in political views that showed he was entirely lacking in knowledge of the how and why politically. I know that his information about the rivers was correct, but his political views, since they were without scholarly foundation, should have been left out. However that is his opinion, but it detracted from the factual story of his trip, and was totally unrelated. He doesn't seem to understand that this country has been under control of the Democrats 90% of the time since 1929. They effectively ran against Hoover until Nixon came along,then continued their Tax and spend tactics until 1994. Clinton continued to fight for runaway spending until the Republicans stopped him. Now he takes credit for the surplus. He should stick to what he knows, boating, until he studies political history with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Awful Awful","review":"This is one of the worst books I ever read.

I only made it through 30 pages of this book. The author must have read too many ancient texts translated by 19th century academics. This one failed to keep me awake. Perhaps if Pilotis (the anonymous first mate for this voyage) published his diary I would be more interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"River Horse","review":"What a disappointment after reading Blue Highways -- which this certainly is not! Had Heat-Moon given in a Prologue the tale of him giving up his marriage in order to do this boat trip I certainly wouldn't have read the book. It seemed, as I read it, that I was tempted numerous times to put it down and never pick it up again. There is so much negativism and cynicism with jabs at religion, politics and being an activist for much of the trip. I like to read enjoyable books. So, I say, if you feel you have to read it, check it out of a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Heat, Most Hot Air","review":"Would someone please introduce Heat Moon to Stephen King's book, \\"On Writing\\"? The man who introduced me to the correlation between the number of calendars and cafe eats (which is 100% accurate even today)has forgotten what it was that made him a readable author. Somewhere along the line, this proud reborn native Amerian began to confuse his roots with a Monty Python version of Shakespearean prose, with the resulting unreadable drivel reeking of pithy arrogance and snobbery. Hey Bill, you are writing about America here - keep it simple, straight and direct and maybe you will catch the atmosphere and mood which is the heart of a story such as this. You've done it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikawa's Travels","review":"William Least Heat-Moon is not your Average Joe. He's not even your average Not-Average-Joe. Heat-Moon's epic 500-page recounting of his journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific (more than 5,000 miles) over the inland rivers and canals of the United States in a small boat called Nikawa, or \\"River Horse\\" in the Osage language, is his story of a brave undertaking. Heat-Moon, whose previous works have included a 400-page in-depth microcosmic study of a single Kansas county and a journey by car across rural America, is a legend among those who live life off the beaten trail. In River Horse, the author moves downriver from town to town across the Hudson, Ohio, Mississippi, Missouri and other waterways and meets and greets countless locals along the way. This portrait of the interior of America that lies beside its water highways is deservedly classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I found this book to be engaging and informative.

Far too many meandering \\"rivulets\\" of thought. I jumped ship a quarter way through and then kept skipping ahead to see if I was judging the book wrongly. The author seemed to be prooving himself as an Important American Writer with his flowery language... Quote:\\"As unruly, illogical, shifty, and willful as the Missouri is - here's one more river traveler's gambit - it nevertheless gives recompense, and in that country of long reaches and mild bends it returned to us some of the finest riverine landscapes we'd seen...\\"One final thing it would be helpful if the book visually charted the voyage better for people not familiar with the many backroads and rivers of this country. Very little visual reference was provided and it could have made the trip more exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy & Dull","review":"Overall the book is pretty dull. In order to liven up sections Heat=Moon tries to get us worried about whether or not he'll hit his timeline or even sink the boat. After a few of these exagerrated concerns are told the remaining ones are not at all believable.Every few pages he also likes to remind us how bad Americans are at keeping our environment spotless and wild. This coming from a man cruising the rivers in a twin engine boat, and on shallower parts even puts a motor on his canoe. This, also coming from a man who would not have gotten past New York if it wasn't for the Erie Canal. Preaching, during a book like this, is normal and expected. He just takes it over the top and by the end of the book I was rooting for another dam to be built.Finally, there are too many stories about himself and how he was feeling and not enough anecdotes about people he met along the way. It's those colorful stories that usually make travel books likes these interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw me a life-jacket","review":"Nearly drowned! In a river of foamy blather, that is.The intent is certainly there and I can not imagine such a colossal undertaking as boating across America on its river systems. The attention and determination would be considerable.The shortcomings are the overblown wording and self diversions. Something just does not float here. This could have been an exceptional read in the right hands.The 100 plus day adventure begins in New York City.Up the Hudson River to the Erie Canal, across Lake Erie to the Allegheny, down the Ohio, turning north on the Mississippi, then to the nearly forever Missouri River.Portaging over the Continental Divide and continuing onto the Salmon, Snake and Columbia River, Heat-Moon covers over 5,000 river miles. From the Atlantic to the Pacific all by river.There is much to be learned from the author's expedition but with the awkward writing slant, 500 pages becomes a tedious and demanding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the rocks!","review":"I loved Blue Highways and PrairyErth but to be honest, I found this book a bit of a slog. The author still has a wonderful eye but too much of the book is taken up by passages where he takes his boat up rivers that are just too shallow. As a result, we're treated to innumerable paragraphs about how they have to kept looking out for rocks, have to keep checking the depth finder and how tiring it is. Blah blah blah. And what's more - we find out early on that no, you can't go all the way across America by boat. There are some spots in New York State where they have to haul the boat from lake to lake, so really, what's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Least-Moon Does It Again","review":"Does it again, outstanding book by the author of Blue Highways, excellent wordsmith, takes a rather dull trip and makes it interesting. Could have been a little more technical for us boat people and his refferences to the Lewis-Clark journals were a little out of sync.

His story captured my imagination then and I have crossed his trail on many occasions since. Most recently, I read River Horse as a part of my exploration of the Missouri River, down which I will soon be kayaking. While the entirety of the trip from Coast to Coast by water is well described, the description seems to fade in the last pages as if the act of writing was becoming as wearying as the journey itself.

What I like about Plaidy's novel is that it is written in first person as a kind of memoir while Anne is imprisoned in the Tower of London, and tells her story from her own point of view. This creates a sympathetic portrait and helps in humanizing a historical figure who was greatly hated and villified in her own day.A very great and interesting read. I am so happy that many of Plaidy's other novels are being re-released for a new generation of readers to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite amazing, but pretty good","review":"I've read most of Plaidys' books along with her other pen names: Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr and I can honestly say that this was a really great read. I like how Anne was portrayed as an ambitious, but intelligent victim subject to the whims of her vicious and philandering husband. Plaidy creates a truthful and tasteful novel although it lacks the lust present in Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl which I admittedly found rather intriguing and consider a guilty pleasure. I would recommend this book any day if you want a true picture of what happened to Anne and her story, but I just couldn't give it a five because I felt it lacked the storytelling that Gregory's novel had (even though Gregory's novel was almost completely untrue). Even though I ultimately feel that Plaidy's tale is better literature I personally liked Gregory's story better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I love reading fiction based on the Tudor period, so I bought this without thinking.

I read the one entitled, \\"Rumpole of the Younger Generation.\\" I felt like I was wasting my time, because all I was reading was a synopsis of a former triumph of this man. The case might have been exciting, but the author did not play fair, and the guilty party was obvious. I did not like this story very much, and can only hope that the rest of them are better than this one was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bayou","review":"Bayou Backwaters takes us on a trip through the unspoiled home of the alligator and the snakebird, the raccoon and the skunk, the armadillo and the water moccasin.

However, once I got halfway through it, I was annoyed with Sabine's dependency on Josh. If she can't be honest with him, then she shouldn't be with him. I feel that the author has dragged out the Sabine, Josh, Dominic love triangle for too long, so I'm not even planning on finishing the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a beginner book","review":"I was disappointed in the CD as it doesn't contain many tunes - only five of them.

I let amazon know about the problem but they have not changed the product description (it still says made in Germany - LIES!). The product itself is not horrible, but certainly not worth $20. I should have purchased the OXO bottle opener for $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful doll BUT mattel could of done better","review":"The doll is beautiful but the price is overrated. Her outfit is done well. Her face is just generation girl Lara's face painted over brown with a change in makeup. And two pigtails. Come on Mattel.

I would get her on sale if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Handed peeler","review":"We ended up getting a right handed peeler instead of a left handed one. My husband liked it so well we did not send it back. It is sleek, sharp and lovely but am still not happy I have to peel towards myself as I didn't get what I ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peeler!!","review":"After being disappointed with \\"chunky handle\\" peelers, this was a pleasant surprise. I had high expectations for a $25 peeler and this one is definitely worth it. The handle feels balanced and natural, the blade is sharp and pivots nicely. I'm right handed and peel towards myself so this is perfect. No issues with the coring point as others have reported. Dishwasher safe and replaceable blades - what more do you need? While Rosle is still a German company, some of their production is now in China. I don't have an issue with that as long as the quality is there. This one had a \\"Made in China\\" sticker on the handle that was removed easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent peeler - but really for lefties?","review":"I absolutely love this peeler. It is sturdy and well-constructed with a guard to protect against accidental cuts when used by children. I was brought up to peel away from myself (downward) as a safety precaution. I first bought the right-handed version of this peeler and found that I could only peel in this direction by holding the peeler in my left hand, which was quite awkward. But I loved it so much I went back and bought the left-handed version which works fine for this right-handed Mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"a minority opinion","review":"Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he \\"wound his arm around her waist\\"). Less than halfway through this story, its central \\"mystery\\" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places.On the positive side, Macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of Alzheimer's. Perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would never end","review":"This book was a very long, boring, lamenting woman who goes on and on and on, over and over and over, about the life that could have been. Her daughter was just as bad as her only more immature. I liked the mom, but her story was sad to read through much of it. I usually like Debbie Macomber, but this one was pretty depressing until chapter 41, and there were only 44 chapters; it is hard to read 41 chapters of depressing. It took forever to finish it, and quite frankly I don't know why I was compelled to do so. I'll keep reading Debbie, but I don't recommend this book. Another thing, if you are looking for this book to be a part of Blossom street, don't! It is mentioned in the last chapter, but none of the characters from the previous books are re-visited in Savannah's Garden. In fact Savannah is only in Seattle briefly at the beginning of the book. The rest of the book is spent in the town of Colville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great book by Debbie!!","review":"I really liked this book and it ties into the Blossom Street books. Debbie is truly a gifted writer and I really enjoy her books. Can't wait to get my hands on the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as it brought me back to someone with a link to Blossom Street. I feel as though I know all the people from the yarn shop on Blossom Street and maybe being a knitter myself may have something to do with this. I am hoping that Debbie Macomber will write another series or book involving all these characters, it was such comforting reading and books you could certainly curl up with.Sincerely,Barbara Montague-Myrick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner for Debbie Macomber","review":"Being a fan of Debbie Macomber did not prepare me for this powerful book. How does she think of such unexpected twists in her plots?? For those who have elderly parents, this may be \\"a good read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"It is raining here in the Northeast, and this book, plus a cup of tea, makes a perfect companion. Ms. Macomber has written an extraordinary book which deals with unresolved parent/child relations, the caring of an older parent, the difficulties of raising children, and demonstrates why sometimes we must go against our own beliefs in the name of love. She always has believable characters who are challenged by what they want, and the responsibility that they have toward others. I have enjoyed all of her novels, and she makes me want to pack up and enjoy the Pacific Northwest (it cannot be raining any harder there!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"I enjoy Debbie Macomber's Blossom Street stories. They provide a refreshing counterpoint to some of the other types of books I typically read. And I love their attractive cover illustrations. So when I picked up this book I looked forward to another pleasant read. But I have found myself by turns irritated at the simplistic characters, annoyed by the silly dialog, and disgusted with the trivial storyline. A fifty-year-old woman who is still hung up on her high school sweetheart is a ridiculous figure. The tortured passion of Carolyn and Dave is so Romance Novel-ish that it is laughable. And the bratty daughter is a selfish little twit.I'm sorry I spent money on this paperback. Ms. Macomber did not even half-try to write a decent book. She owes more to her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but predictable","review":"Not a terrible book, but the ending is pretty predictable, though they try to make it seem like some big shock. And the more the book went on, the less I liked Susannah - she purposely puts her marriage at risk for some dumb boy she dated in high school? Then she keeps a bunch of secrets from her husband, handles her daughter Chrissie's issues badly, then suddenly everything is wrapped up, and Susannah gets what she wants-- then randomly decides to open a flower shop to segway into the next book. I do feel that the author did a good job portraying the elderly mom Vivian. But I definitely don't plan to read any more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read...a good one to avoid.","review":"This was a challenging book to finish. I cannot believe that this book was written by a woman author in the 21st century. (It resembled a novel that was written by a man whom wanted to keep women under his thumb. Yuck.) The main character was spineless...she accepted ungracious and rude behavior from her whining, insolent daughter and boring chauvenistic husband. As a 62 year-old woman, I was disappointed to read a porttrayal of such weak, ineffective characters. I can honestly say I will never be inclined to read another of this author's novels, because the development and execution of the women characters was truly embarrassing. Also, just from an aesthetic point of view, the audio version has weird telephone conversation sounds effects. Really a bad imitation of a phone tone. All in all, both print and audio are bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I just started the book, but it already has me leaving my housework for another day! Itis a quick read with not too many characters to keep track of."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"book gift rated","review":"Bought as a gift and the recipient really liked the bookand wanted the large print version for reading ease"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Interesting","review":"I absolutely loved listening to this book on CD. I have so little time to read these days, so it was great, being able to follow along via CD, in my car each day; as I went to and from work.The story itself was great and I could definitely identify with the main character, Susannah. The only thing that turned me off, was the narrator's take on doing male voices. It had a 'scary' tone to it. At times, the voices she used for the different characters would overlap; it was as if she was getting confused as to which character she was supposed to be. Other than that, I would definitely purchase another book on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful style","review":"I haven't finished it yet, but it is an intriguing and very interesting book so far.

If you like Debbie Macomber books you will enjoy this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish either","review":"The writing in this book was almost forced, like something was just put down to get the story out. I admit I couldn't get very far along, but there just wasn't a flow of the words and this made it difficult to stay with the story. The characters and their circmstances were cliches and I felt like I knew what would be said next (as you do with a bad sitcom). Perhaps it improved as it progressed but I just wasn't interested enough to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read, and I was very disappointed. The characters were not at all believeable, and the plot twists were so far fetched, it was almost laughable. Chrissie was the biggest spoiled brat I could ever imagine, and her mother was a dishrag with no backbone and not a lick of common sense. I couldn't believe that she went along with Troy's idea so that he would leave her daughter alone. I did feel sorry for Vivian who never knew that her son was alive. As an earlier reviewer said, it would have been beneficial to have a story about having to put a parent in a assisted living facility that actually would have been a real story, since many people are dealing with that issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I have been an avid fan of Debbie Macomber since she wrote her first book. I am sorry to say I did not get into this one. The characters were not very believable and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The ending was wrapped up a little too quickly and \\"they lived happily ever after\\"...sorry..I wish I would have just checked this out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so lame","review":"This is the only Debbie Macomber book I've ever read, and I wondered what the attraction was. I thought it might be interesting for me because I am facing similar issues with an elderly parent, but this book was painful. The dialogue is ludicrous, situations contrived, and the characters are such twits! Just as an example, anyone who would keep living in a house that they knew was being burglarized by someone who seemed to have ready access is just crazy or stupid. I forced myself to finish the book, giving it full benefit of the doubt, and the ending was even more far-fetched than the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"This is the only book I've read by this author.

He had mysteriously stopped writing her at the age of 17 while she spent a year in France. She is also happily married for 25 years, but getting \\"bored\\" with her husband.

Their parents seem to have taken in a boarder, Gervase, who is a bizarre, tattooed, rockabilly-type who doesn't appeal to any of them.As the story goes on, you follow the lives of each of the sons through their selfish thoughts and reasoning.

The whole story is entertaining, but just a little too cheesy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Friend of the family","review":"The book was interesting enough, and I even liked the characters, but it seemed more like a play on morals, than an actual story. And I didn't really like the friend of the family, his position in the book seemed forced, and it was quite unnecessary if you ask me. I think the story had alot of potential, but it just ended up being very simplistic, and straight forward.

Security Risk: The straps do not tighten enough to keep a restless child secure in the seat. My daughter got out of it easily simply by standing up. Had we taken our eyes off her for even a second, she might have fallen onto the floor.2. Mess Factor: There is a huge gap - four inches or so - between the seat and the table, allowing food to fall onto the floor very easily.This seat is however the only one on the market that fits tables with a wide skirt - which is partly why I bought it. So if you must have one that fits a table with a wide skirt, this might be your only choice. You would have to watch your child very, very carefully.I am returning the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck finding a table this will work on","review":"You're going to need a table with absolutely no protrusions on the bottom to get this to attach to a table. Our dining room table didn't work. The table in a condo in Hawaii didn't work.It's heavy.It's awkward to assemble (which you need to do each time you take it out if its carrying case).But it is well constructed, and if it works on your table and you don't plan to travel with it, I think it's a decent chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Chair- Gets dirty - hard to clean","review":"Too hard to take off canvas chair to clean.

It is sturdy and relatively light/portable.But I have 2 complaints: 1. the front and side of the chair is fabric, so it gets dirty very fast and cannot be wiped. If these parts were vinyl-like material, it would be much easier. 2. The back of the chair could have more padding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good space saving highchair!","review":"I bought this for my son although he is now 2 1/2 to keep him contained while trying to get him to eat dinner :) Well he ended up figuring out how to undo the straps just like everything else we have! This isnt the highchairs fault so I still give it 5 stars. Its very sturdy, hooks onto the table perfectly. My son is 30 lbs and hasnt damaged it at all b/c of his weight. My daughter who is a baby will also sit in it from time to time but she uses a different highchair at the moment b/c of the seat recline. We love both of our highchairs (also have the fisher price rainforest deluxe) so this one will be kept at grandma and grandpa's house soon since my son has already outgrown this! Its great for grandparents as they can put it away easily once baby is no longer around and wont have a large highchair taking up space in their house. We are very happy with our purchase :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Mess","review":"This chair is impossible to keep clean. It says to spot clean, which is impossible, so I went ahead and washed it on my gentle cycle which was fine, except you have to take the whole thing apart and it just gets filthy the very next time you use it. I was embarrassed to even let people see it in my house. As others mentioned, there is also a gap between the chair and the table where everything falls on the floor. It also won't fit on an island. I am selling this and looking for another, easier option."},{"rating":"2","title":"nini's kids","review":"Our grandson has been using it for several months, and it works great.

I am dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"harness problem","review":"we loved this until our daughter started standing up in it. wish it had a 5-point safety harness-with the straps going over the shoulders, but doesn't.

It stays in my trunk always and thanks to it's lay flat ability it doesn't prevent me from loading things onto of it. Admittedly sometimes getting the little buttons to rotate the arms into the flat position is a little trying, but with it's irregular use for our family it's not a show stopper. It latches onto tables easily and more importantly only takes a few seconds to set up and take down. We prefer to bring this high chair into restaurants because we know where it's been and the state of cleanliness. Speaking of cleaning I saw some parents have problems with this feature. We haven't had any issue it's easily to flip inside out and shake out crumbs and when more resisting food gets on it fits in the kitchen sink to be scrubbed out and then latches to the kitchen table to dry. I would recommend this to any mom or mom to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"great for outings, not at home","review":"Did not fit on either of our two dining tables at home.

So far we haven't found a place where the chair couldn't clamp on. Our son has been using it since he was 5 months old and loved being at the table with us. Easy to carry, easy to setup. Can't do without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite product","review":"I thought the idea of this was great...a portable high chair that would fit on nearly any table in restaurants, at the in-laws....Well, the first time we used it at the in-laws, the leg wouldn't release from under the table...we thought we were going to have to saw the table apart to get the chair out from under it! We returned that particular unit, and the replacement one still has a leg that is sticky.The other issue with this chair is that if a restaurant table is lighter, your baby will tip the table. Also, tables with any wood underneath such as a leaf or an extension will not permit this chair.If you are looking for something portable, I would purchase one of those space-saving high chairs and cart that to other people's houses. It is easier and more reliable.We rarely use this Chicco product. We end up toting the space-saving high chair instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it were machine washable","review":"The fabric gets filthy with each feeding and requires a lot of scrubbing. It would be great if you could easily remove it (it's not very easy) and throw it in the washing machine (hand wash only). We're switching to a plastic seat with removable tray that can be wiped down more easily.Other than that, it's sturdy, and functions well for us. It also folds flat and fits in a large suit case for our cross-country visits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child sits too far from counter","review":"I bought this chair so that my daughter could sit at the island counter with her two older brothers. The counter has a 12\\" overhang from the base of the island and when the chair is installed, there is about a 3\\" gap between the chair and the counter. It makes feeding the dog even easier for our daughter but is not what I consider a feature. Other options appear to have a more compact design to attach the chair so I'm going to buy a second. Maybe I can sell the one I have on ebay so I get a little back- at least I had a coupon when I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky to clean","review":"We really like Chicco products and have many of them. This chair is a disappointment, however. It would be so much better if it was made of a wipeable fabric. It does not spot clean well, and trying to disassemble and pull the fabric seat off is a headache and takes too much time. Also, the belt really isn't secure enough and frequently one of the sides will not come undone when you depress the button to get baby out. We're constantly struggling with it. Also, it's really too cumbersome to actually fold up and take somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be a bit more cushioned","review":"Very sturdy, easy to clean, i just wipe all over it with a wet towel after each meal. Baby seems very confortable in it and safe. Im not giving it 5 stars because baby already hit the back of his head twice. Not too hard he didnt get hurt, it has some foam to protect him but why not make it more cushioned to support his head. Other than that price is great and no need to spend the extra bucks for the new design with the hippos and such. This one is easy to take apart and reasemble and very light. It says itDoesnt work on a glass table but mine is workingperfeclty fine. Only con is that it cant rotate and It would definatly be more useful if you could rotate it like the chico one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Disappointing product from Chicco.

This was a waste of money and totally useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to clean, wouldn't recommend","review":"We have a small place and 9 mo twins to boot, so space is at a premium. We were so excited to get these, thinking they'd save space and bring the babies right to us at the table. We started using them at 7 mo, and only 2 months later, we've replaced them with old fashioned high chairs. The problem is that they are IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP CLEAN. They get coated with food at every feeding- the babies spit their food, touch the chairs with food-coated hands and even chew on the sides of the chair. We'd try to wipe them down after every meal, but the porous material traps the food and you have to hand wash them constantly. You'd think you could get the material on and off easily, but you have to disassemble the whole thing to get the fabric off and it takes time. I wish we never got these, wasted time and money, and lots of frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY better than an high chair","review":"We had a big, bulky high chair for our first child and was a pain to clean and was always in the way... so when we had our second child I decided to try this chair ans I LOVE IT! It does not take up space in my kitchen and I am not constantly tripping over it. It is also easy to clean, you just take off the canvase seat cover and wash it... you dont have to clean the tray, seat, legs ect that you do with a high chair. Lastly we love that our son can sit AT the table with us, we callit his bucket :) He is now almost 2 and askes to sit in his \\"bucket\\" for family meal times.Tip: We put a plastic place mat under the arms than fasten onto the table so that he doesn't get sticky foods all over the table, it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I bought this chair for my grandson to use at restaurants because he couldnt sit up properly, at 5 months old, in the wooden high chairs that they have at most restaurants. Well he didnt like this one and it was difficult to take with us because it didnt fold up easily. So I just decided to use it at home. The big flaw in the design is that, when he got older, the seatbelt doesnt hold him in. I couldnt even go out to the kitchen to get something without having to run back to find him trying to stand up in the seat, no matter how tight I tightened the belt he could still stand up in the seat. Also it is not a wipeable material. It is washable, but it is really difficult to take apart to wash. If they put shoulder straps in this seat and made it easier to get apart to wash it would be so much better. As it is I put it away and bought a regular highchair before he could fall out of this one and get hurt. I would not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood is Everything","review":"Of ALL the Christmas albums I have including Elvis, Bing, and Mathus, An Angel's Christmas is the best and I'll tell you why: Only Lori Andrews on the harp can match the mood of a decorated tree, soft lights, and loving family gathered at the holiday.

Do not waste your time with this.I have to seriously question the reviewer that speaks so fondly for his love of zombie features.

And I like to see a young director and cast try to make something special without a lot of cash, but this just looks poor. The makeup for the zombies isn't too bad, until bad camera work shows the end of the makeup about an inch before the hair on the back of their heads. Looks really bad considering the makeup is a blue color, then you see white skin then hair. Thats just for beginners, the camera used for this film was a good idea(grainy 70's look), but please come up with better actors and record the sound better. You can't hear it unless you crank the volume. The people who gave this a good review on the box, should be in jail. I do not recommend this one, unless your last name is Bin Laden. One more thing, there is frontal nudity in this movie and its not the good kind, its a guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"If i could give negative stars i would. This is terrible.

I can't fault them on any of this, it's the quality of the film or digital picture with it's terrible quality, it has blotches on it and defects and is very soft focus. If it had been shot on anything other than a hand camera probably it would have been a three star NO BUDGETER. It is the film that's the problem not the movie. BUt it's hard to get by the hand camera lack of clarity but as a little zombie flick the film is decent. THe makeup is very good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great grindhouse homage, watch it as a homage, and you'll enjoy it","review":"Released to mixed reviews, whether you enjoy Dead Life will really depend on whether you watch it as a movie made for 2004, or as a movie made as a homage to 1970s grindhouse features. Dead Life is dead-on in capturing the exploitation cinema of the 1970s, shot on super 8 and with an eye to grindhouse detail. Maxx and his friends are faced with a zombie apocalypse in their sleepy Ohio town. When the infection that creates the undead masses gets into the town's reservoir, the disease spreads rapidly, leaving them among a handful of survivors. What follows is a loose montage of surreal imagery, twitching, blood-spewing zombies, and plenty of graphic blood and gore, all set to an authentic-sounding punk rock soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Avoid !!","review":"One never likes to really criticize a creative work because it is difficult to create a song, or movie or other creative object.On the other hand it is easy to be a critic.BUT sometimes something is so bad you feel obligated to warn people away.This movie deserves such a warning.It looks like the kind of movies we used to make with our home 8mm film cameras in the 70s just for fun.Terrible film qualityBad lightingBad soundBad scriptBad actingIt is like a group of friends got together one day with no advance planning and said \\"lets just improvise on the spot and make a movie today.

The flap where the glue, (adhesive) is, the sealing strip is about 1/3 the height of other sealing strips. The flap does seem to stay sealed, but a bit more adhesive would be much more secure.

This time I bought from Propackagingsupply and I received completely different polymailers than I was expecting. The size is right but they're really thin--the edge of a small cardboard box ripped a hole right through the mailer as I (gently) packed it up. I had to double up the polymailers so what I was mailing didn't rip through the mailer, effectively meaning I was only able to mail 50 items, not 100, since I used two mailers per package. If you are mailing something soft like clothes these will probably work, but ANYTHING with even a soft edge and I cannot recommend these at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable Poly Mailer","review":"Nice, clean and durable white poly mailer.

I generally use bubble mailers, and in comparison this product is CRAP. The only upside is that it \\"seems\\" (using that word very loosely) like they are waterproof...I guess I get what I pay for out of this product, having only spent about $10 for 100 mailers.

But I've had a few bags tear just from when I was removing the strip from the adhesive. The bags are pretty thin!

Most illustrated stoneware is first covered with white glaze and then with additional diffuse colored glaze usually blue. Some pieces use various solid colored glazes.

Here he relates how to set goals, train for races big and small, and do it all without sacrificing family, work, or perspective. In fact, he actually makes triathlon sound like an adventure in personal growth rather than a daily grind of swim, bike, and run. Highly recommended for anyone who loves the sport and plans to compete for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Amazon -- there are two different films here","review":"For some reason, two completely different films that happen to have the same name(the 2008 Russian film atWolfhoundand the 2002 'horror film' atWolfhound (Unrated Edition)) are getting the same set of reviews posted to both -- some on Amazon, get your site sorted out; this is amateur hour"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, poor execution","review":"The video quality is a bit grainy.

Over the years, I have so depended on this style of potato peeler that I haven't been able to use any other type.

I needed to find a replacement for my old peeler and found this brand. It was highly rated so I decided to give it try. It is a very high quality, solid product. The sharpness of this peeler is excellent - it peels very smoothly and effortlessly. My only gripe (and the reason I only gave this 4 stars) is that the peel sticks to the blade and I have to shake the peeler to get the peel to drop off. I've never had that issue with the cheaper peelers. I can't figure out why this one does it. Otherwise, the peeler works awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preview first","review":"Had hoped to use this with students to stimulate discussion about suicide.

A none too surprising tour of a book & authors convention with workaday characters presumably based on real people (but who cares). The only lively character is Asimov himself, who is portrayed as lecherous, gluttonous and overbearing, tho still lovable. 90% of the interrogation by the amateur sleuth is dull and irrelevant and serves only as parsley to cover up the (miniscule) actual clues. But even here, the clues are introduced as clumsily as in his Lucky Starr on Mars, where out of nowhere a character flashes what turns out to be the murder weapon. Asimov wrote much better mysteries in ^A Whiff of Death^ and especially ^The Caves of Steel^, not to mention some of his superlative science fiction.

Boring!I can't understand why Playskool dumbed it down but I'm very dissapointed. Since I can't return it now (my daughter ripped the box) I will probably give it away to Goodwill.

There's really not a lot here on the SS United States, and it was maddening to keep reading and reading about other ships before I finally reached the small section in the back on it.

The most serious problem would be the poor battery performance. I took a test on this cell phone since I got this cell phone new. It can only last about 3 days w/t any call or camera use, and the call time could only last less than a hour.

I wish I'd seen the negative reviews on Amazon.com before I'd bought it. These signs are all ASL... you can do just as well to look them up in an ASL dictionary. And many of the signs aren't very useful to even try to teach a baby (how can a baby learn the 3 signs in \\"I love you\\"??)The flash cards are not cards for the babies to look at (which is what I had thought they would be), and the book (pamphlet) is a joke. I've not used this thing at all and wish I hadn't gotten it.If you want to get a start in baby sign... get the 4 Baby Sign board books. If your baby likes books, your baby will most undoubtedly love those books. If your baby learns all the signs in those books, pass on this flash card pack, and instead get creative with an ASL dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"As the mother of a four month old, I read everything I can get my hands on about anything baby-related, and have recently been fascinated by the idea of signing with my daughter. I've been planning to research and choose a book to learn more but on a whim saw this little kit and picked it up despite the inflated price, considering it's just a small box with a \\"book\\" and 25 cards. The book is a complete joke, don't be fooled by the description saying it's 16 pages. Minus the one line intro, at least six blank pages for \\"notes\\", etc. there ends up being about 3 pages about signing with your baby and let me tell you you can live without the information.The flashcard idea is a good one, but the words are limited. I'm not sure how they decided what words to include but there's not even one for \\"cry\\". The pictures are difficult to interpret as well. I think my money's better spent on a simple ASL dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Signing Time better","review":"The cards are not useful, limited vocabulary, and uninteresting both for baby and for me.

Someone needs to point this out to Mr. Simpson. Andrew Johnson attempted to do the same type of Reconstruction Lincoln wanted, \\"let'em up easy\\". The Radicals hated Johnson, as Johnson turned out NOT to be their puppet, and he REALLY was a Democrat. Simpson feels the need to bash Johnson, as HIS HERO, GENERAL Grant,[look at his books] was the NEXT President. According to Simpson Grant was in fact one of the BEST Presidents!! (Right!!!LOL) Finally, Simpson pushes all the blame on those Southern people. Get real Mr. Simpson, contrary to your writing, (just because YOU write something, does NOT mean it is fact), the South was not wearing black hats, and the North was not wearing white hats.

I am a UFO fanatic, but recognize only the Michael Schenker era as the \\"real\\" UFO. This Live CD is one of three pre-Schenker CD's, and it is very amateurish. \\"Prince Kajuku/The Coming of Prince Kajuku\\" is the only attempt at anything complicated musically. \\"C'mon Everybody\\" is a decent rocker but a very basic \\"music 101\\" song. The rest of the songs barely even qualify as songs. The sound quality is good for this context. It is live and of old technology, but clean and bluesy. Mogg and the rest of the band blends well, but if I didn't know better, I'd never recognize this band as UFO. I have never had a guitar lesson, and I guarantee that I can play as well as Mick Bolton. If you are limited on dollars and want to experiment with UFO for the first time, buy any one of the first four Schenker era CD's.

I put some molefoam in them and that helped a little(she doesn't scream about them with the molefoam), but her feet still get blisters and indentations in her foot(just not as severe as without the molefoam).

That's what leaves an indentation in her foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts his poor little feet.","review":"My 18 month old son loves wearing his shoes, specifically his Stride Rite tennies.

I have to admit to being a little disappointed in this book, mainly because of the size of the photographs. It is difficult to understand and see the techniques when the photographs are too small. I also do not think applying pressure on some of the areas mentioned in this text are very effective in a real street combat situation. Nevertheless, I do feel this is a valuable basic guide to the many nerve points and vulnerable areas of the body. There is no doubt striking some of these areas (atemi-waza)can be effective in a self-defense situation.In conclusion, I recommend this book to all martial artists seeking a good basic guide to vulnerable areas of the body.Rating: 4 Stars.

Of school, his schoolteacher father, his delicate mother and his rambunctious brother. Of eventful journeys by rail, by foot and by cart from home to their vacation house. Of a joyful time spent exploring a countryside fragrant with wild herbs, full of insects to dissect, birds to hunt and caves to discover. Written in a prose that evokes the simplicity and seriousness of an inquisitive ten year old. And with a bittersweet ending that makes us immediately want to go back to previous pages where we were with him, his family, friends and the hills, tucked safely in summertime warmth and innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of its genre: memoirs of childhood","review":"Pagnol's memoir of growing up in southern France at the beginning of this century is a gem. If you have not read these books, consider yourself lucky to have the pleasure waiting for you. With disarming simplicity and humor, Pagnol narrates his early years in Marseille and the summers he spent with his family in the hills of Provence. Commonplace adventures, like buying used furniture or hunting rabbits in the garrinche with his father, are elevated to amazing heights by the child's imagination and by Pagnol's beautiful prose. Pagnol's memoir is in the same rank with \\"Angela's Ashes\\", although his childhood was not so tragic. Read him in the original French, if you can. It is very accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China , NOT Germany","review":"I assume the item may have been made in Germany at one time. It is now made in China by a German company.

Many members of a family gather in hope of gaining an inheritance. Lisa fancies herself in love with the gorgeous Alastair. Eventually, she sees him as shallow, etc, and falls for the dark, brooding Earl. There is 0 chemistry, boring dialogue and a silly mystery in this story. Also, the ending was too weird with Alastair. Especially in the light that Ms. Hazard now has a story about Alastair. Readers of this book would be hard pressed to see him in a romanctic light, considering the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regency Romance or perhaps a who-dunn-it","review":"This book by Barbara Hazard is a little different, it definitely evolves there are elements of a gothic novel at the start, it seems then to move into a who-dunn-it, complete with twists and red herrings and finishes as a traditional Regency Romance.

More a 3 and a half stars than a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worhty topic, well-written and applicable","review":"Being a nerd of a new parent, I have read through many tomes and this one gets it about right.

In general it's about building up children's self-esteem, but doesn't focus on helping children develop resilience with daily disappointments or problems (bullies, not making a soccer goal, etc.) Self esteem is very different from resilience. Instead, I'd recommend two books: Blessings of the Skinned Knee and Mindset. Blessings is based on practical/current applications from the Torah; I am not Jewish and still found this book to be very helpful/wonderful. The books don't have chapters on \\"resilience\\", but the overall info from both has been very helpful in that area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good if I actually read it.","review":"Bought this and barely cracked it open.

The book is an invaluable resource for parents because not only does it alert readers of obstacles, but offers guide-posts and solutions to even the most difficult of family situations. One of the book's strongest attributes is its optimistic attitude and coherent style. Through wise eyes the authors strike a chord with parents around the world.

Matthew Perry and Chris Farley are hilarious as Leslie Edwards and Bartholomew Hunt. Add to the cast the always enjoyable Eugene Levy as their French guide and the lovely Lisa Barbuscia as the lovely Indian maiden Shaquina and your set for a journey filled with lots of chuckles this oddball party of explorers strive to become more than just \\"a footnote to a footnote\\" in the history of America.Silly, definitely / predictable, at times / enjoyable, absolutely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Almost Heroes (1998) Chris Farley, Matthew Perry, Eugene LevyRated PGThis is a basically good natured comedy. It's a goofy spoof of the Lewis and Clark expedition.Critics disliked it and movie goers bad mouthed it. I assume that's because it was not filled with nudity and profanity and sexual content.The expedition's misfit explorers encounter vicious animals such as untrustworthy squirrels, geriatric but sleepy native Indians, white water rapids, playfully unpredictable and overly sensitive Spanish conquistador explorers, and even a bit of romance with an lovely Indian maiden who wishes to help them in their quest. They also partake in extremely quaint fireside chats, among other misadventures.This happens to be a highly underrated comedy with a lot fewer crude jokes than I had anticipated.A light-hearted fun time movie when your nieces and nephews are over for a slumber party, or you're had your fill of high speed cars and bodies exploding into senseless flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"No plot, Matthew Perry plays a flake, Farley has funny moments, but not enough to warrant finishing movie.

Anyone who looks at my woman, I KILL HIM! The horse sh*t story. Revenge is sweet sir! Do you realize your maiden is made of straw? When they take turns looking through the binocular. This movie definately grows on you. It's definately got some laughs that are definately worth your while if you are a Farly or goofy comedy fan. I hope they make this onto DVD someday!

I recall reading that there were a lot of problems on the set with actors not always being sober or timely, and that might have weakened the movie, but there are some real laughs to be found in this film.On a separate note, I have glanced at the other reviews and cannot believe that people who can't spell or write a proper sentence would be so bold as to write lengthy reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost good","review":"If you like other Chris Farley and Matthew Perry films, then you will probably like this one (i.e., \\"Tommy Boy\\" or \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\"). It is a lot of physical comedy and slapstick sight gags. It does not have much originality to it, except for a few pretty funny surprises. For most of the movie gags, you can see the punchlines coming a mile away. If you don't mind this and still find the same types of things funny no matter how many times you see them, then you will enjoy the film. The film does cater toward the typical sophmoric guy humor for the most part. The jacket even says \\"crude humor\\". The best parts involve Farley and Perry dealing with the crazy leader of wandering conquisadors; their final standoff with them is particularly funny, especially the unusual way they end up overtaking them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Farley...","review":"If you are a Chris Farley fan you will enjoy this film.

I thought the actor performance was great, I mean I couldn't act like that.... and I've been known to do some pretty goofy things. If you can't laugh at this movie, I might suggest that you take movie watching a little too seriously. Don't expect an oscar winner, just kick back and grab a drink(or two) and chill out.

'Tommy Boy' is by far his crowning achievement on film and probably the only film starring Farley worth owning. This film shows Chris bloated and worn out from years of excess and is kind of hard to watch. It's a sad way to cap off a career that gave so many people joy.

In this movie he plays a woodsman that helps Matthew Perry's exploration of the West. The different situations Perry and Farley and their crew get into are very funny. Many of the situations may seem a little weird, but thats what makes this movie funny.

We saw that it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen as the best. My wife and I have been very pleased. Works effortlessly. Cleanly removes the lid with no food mess, no strain whatsoever. I would highly recommend it. The only time it may not be the perfect match is if you open canned tuna and use the cut lid to compress the tuna when draining. The lids when removed don't fit into the can. That hasn't been an issue for us. Great can opener!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwing money away","review":"After a year it not longer works.

After about a year of use, it no longer cuts at all. I won't be spending $40 on one of these again. And it is not made in Germany; it is made in China! I, for one, am really tired of paying for brand names that used to be good and now manufacture everything in China, with sub-standard materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite kitchen toy!","review":"While visiting my best friend in London we went to Fortnum and Mason, which has a kitchen and cookery floor to die for. When I saw this opener I had to have it, it set me back almost 30 quid so it turned out to be my \\"big souvenir purchase\\" while on vacation. That was nearly five years ago and this can opener still works brilliantly. I have arthritis in my hands and this works smoothly and easily, no straining or struggling, and you can put the lid snugly on the can if you don't use all the contents. When I saw a review here about how the handle broke, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of hammer the writer was hitting it with... this thing is solid as a rock. My sister, who is as enthusiastic a cook as I am, was visiting this weekend and when I showed her how it works she said \\"I want one!\\" So after she went to bed I jumped on this site and bought one for her as a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks quickly. Not covered by warranty if purchased through Amazon.","review":"Insamuch as I first liked this can opener, I absolutely do not recommend it because it stopped working after 2 years of light usage. There are many other reviews with the same issue - within first 2.5 years this can opener stops working. There is a lifetime manufacturer warranty in the USA for this product if purchased through their authorized dealer. Call 800-321-2226 and tell them you have a defective can opener. If their manager approves replacement, they will ask for you to mail yours to them for the exchange on a brand new one. Don't rely on this warranty though if you buy this item on Amazon, Amazon is not an authorized dealer with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice while it worked.","review":"I bought this can opener based on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen. While it worked it was superb. Unfortunately, after about 6 months of use it no longer opens cans -- at all. All it does is make a gnarled mess out of the can's seam. I just threw my $31 dollar can un-opener in the trash. Off to shop for a new one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"It was a great can opener while it lasted, but it didn't last very long.

Sometimes the can opener works great, most of the time I have poor results and cannot even break the seal of a can of soup!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn cool","review":"This fancy can opener seemed like a frivolous luxury item... until our toddler got into the recycling and got her hand caught in an empty 8 oz. tomato sauce can with the partially attached lid folded into the can. Fortunately, she didn't get hurt (only upset at having a can for a hand for a few seconds). But, we wasted no time in getting this Fine Cooking magazine top-rated opener. After fumbling to open the first can, it's now second nature to engage this opener on most cans. Although the instructions that came tied to the opener handle are still there so house guests can use it too, this opener is easy to use, requires less effort than our conventional manual can opener, and is the first opener we reach for every time. It works on cans by basically disassembling the lid from the body. Neither the lid nor the mouth of the can are left with sharp edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosle Can Opener","review":"Very easy to use once you get use to it. First time I went around and around .. forgetting that it cuts from the side. It's a little hard to get started .. you have to turn backward so it opens a little and then turn forward. Lid is cut clean with no sharp edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long - Buyers beware","review":"I purchased this product due to the reputation Rosle has and due to they warranty the product for life. Yet when the product failed I cannot seem to figure out how to get it replaced. The gears have stripped out making it impossible to use. My wife cut her hand really bad trying to open a can with it after it failed but she was determined to open the can but this didn't happen. I had to run her to the emergency room and on the way home we stopped and purchased a can open because who knows how long it will take to get Rosle to replace it. I have written emails to the company with no replies yet. As fast as this oriduct failed I believe Rosle will have to either have to correct their design or send me a new can opener annualy on a scheduled basis. When the product works it works well but the product quality is poor if the gears strip out in a years time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 2 years","review":"I really liked this can opener for the first two years that I had it.

At almost $40 for a can opener, I don't expect it to break. It did -- no longer opens cans. I think a can with an extra wide lip caused the can opener to spread out somehow -- normal cans now can't be opened, the opener won't grip them tight enough.Buy another one? At $40, no chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a year","review":"This item seemed great at first, especially the fact there were no sharp edges on the can seam. Then the handle broke and it's worthless. Great design with poor material quality.

It's a pity there is no warranty.I'm very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pet food, lousy for olives","review":"This can opener and I have a love hate relationship. I love it for pet food, as the lid can be put back on the can and the container can be put in the refridgerator. While for olives, the reseal lid makes it difficult to strain out the juice and leave the olives behind. You can do it by deforming the can but its a pain. On the other hand there are no sharp edges left after you open a can, so its safe for kids to use. The reason this works is that it cuts the side of the lid through the lip. Anyway I now have two can openers, this one and one of the old style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This is the worst can opener I have ever purchased. I was tired of the Dollar Store El Cheapos so I went out to buy the most expensive one I could find. Big mistake!

It's easy to get over that, especially since it does it's job so well. It's a very very well made product. I read where someone's broke early on. All I can say is return it for a new one.

Overall, once you got figured out how to seat the opener on the can it worked very well and with little effort. It is trickier to lock it into place on some cans. Also, if a friend or neighbor is over helping prepare food and goes to use it - good luck unless they've used a similar type can opener. Now after about 5 years the unit has worn out and wont open any cans...however, that is longer than most can openers have lasted....then again, it's 2 to 3 times more $$ than the swing aways."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The best can opener ever. I saw a review in a cooking magazine which rated all can opener's against each other - electric and non - and the Rosle came out the best. So easy to use, and it cuts below the can glue line. I thought it was over priced for a non-electic can opener but after trying the Rosle vegetable peeler, and loving it, I thought I'd give the can opener a try. So comfortable to handle & it seems to glide around the can. With a lifetime warranty this gets my 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickel? It rusts. It's not nickel. Nickel does not rust.

Little more than 12 months after fitting to outdoor lanai, with no direct rain, the surface plating is rusting off. Anyone who needs convincing can see our photos.What this product is, is cheap base metal with some kind of 'Nickel' (? maybe?) coating, which last a few months before lifting, to rust underneath.I have an option to return it at our full cost - it took 4 hours to install, and it will take the same to dismantle, so that's not viable.

However, most of the handles have begun cracking at the rivet points. Some are cracked at every rivet and some are very close to coming apart. These knives have never been abused in any way; never been put in a dishwasher; and have always been hand-washed and dried. I've just contacted Cuisinart and am awaiting instructions to return the knives for replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amusing and educational gift","review":"This book turned out to be a quite fun read. The authors filtered into the educational stuff some humoring anecdotes that bring a smile to your face, not too mention the humor involved in the actual questions and answers themselves.

But in most of the answers that they provide, they weren't filling or for the most part funny.

Indeed, halfway through I wanted to find these guys to tell them to stop being so sickeningly full of themselves. They may be doctors, sure, but they can't write worth crap.

I actually thought that this book was going to be more informative. First of all, it was not funny. Second of all, most of the questions on this book are \\"Does this cause this...\\" or \\"Can someone get X disease by this...\\" Meaning that most of the questions are inconclusive. After reading a couple of them, I just realized that it was a couple of people just wanting to make money and released this book. You can get all these questions answered by just searching online. Its not that difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a massive disappointment","review":"This is the kind of book I love. Short and pithy tidbits of arcane and esoteric knowledge.

Smarmy, condescending, dull, irritating, and utterly pointless, the majority of this book left me plodding along in cold silence.

It seems to provide nothing but filler for what would otherwise be a short, slightly funny, magazine article. The fact that Layner is a published author already is even more appalling. He should know better. The medical items are further buried in a (hopefully) fictional story of a party the authors attend. The details of that are too lengthy and both boorish and unneccessary. When I compare this book to truly well-written and informative tomes such as Freakonomics, I wonder (a) how this made the NYT best-seller list, (b) got such great reviews, and (c) how to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I expected this book to be answers to medical questions that we've all pondered from time to time and haven't looked up.

It was only slightly better than reading the product descriptions in the Sky Mall catalog... and just about as informative.

It is full of fluff (including IM messages between the authors and a highly implausible series of segue narratives) that stretches the book beyond its 20 page text.

Interesting questions about the anatomy and oddities of human bodies, answered by a real doctor, put together by a real writer, seemed like a sure bet to entertain me. However, the doctor and the writer seem to bring out the worst in each other, not the best. Their attempts at humor were juvenile and lame. (Is that redundant?) Some of the questions were intriguing, some of the factual answers striking, but overall, this was about a one-hour read, with only a few laughs, and gave no information I could not live without.

Funny, educational, easy reading. It's exactly the sort of book I put next to the toilet.It turns out the book was somewhat funny, not very educational, and too easy of a read.It was very shallow. Its answers to most of the questions had virtually no depth or detail in explanation. More often than not I finished a question highly disappointed; wanting to know more. The authors barely skimmed the real answers, which is what I imagine people would buy the book for in the first place.The party commentary was almost entertaining and served as a fairly decent segue into the chapters. The IM narration, however, was total filler and went beyond useless. There are questions that the authors pose to each other that never actually get answered in the book.This book doesn't deliver. I was highly let down by it.If you're looking for a good book of \\"off-beat\\" questions, check out the Imponderables series by David Feldman."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF - NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE","review":"Stupid, half-baked answers to interesting questions. The authors are more interested in being comedians than answering the many fascinations questions they pose. Their answers are often a pinch of science smothered by a pound of hokey bull. Some questions don't even get serious science answers, just the two authors goofing off. It's as if comic Jackie Mason were they editor. Apparently the authors don't realize all these questions have been given serious answers by a variety of popular authors, including David Feldman, Charles Panati, and Dr. Joe Schwarz, among others. These three authors, in their series of books, have covered the same ground with expertise first, humor second. Leyner and Goldberg seen to think they've discovered white bread...and hope for second careers in comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and informative - a two-hour read.","review":"This book is co-written by a doctor and a screenwriter who are both clearly frustrated comedians. They tackle about 100 questions that you are just dying to ask your doctor but never would, either because of embarrassment or just not wanting to waste their time. The result is an incredibly quick read that is frequently funny and often informative.That said, don't read this book looking for too much hard science, because you'll only find it in about every other answer they give, but you will learn about the truth or fallacy of a lot of old wives' tales and be able to dazzle your friends with your new-found trivial health knowledge.Recommended for anyone looking for a light read, having even a passing interest in medical/biological topics, or who just likes trivia and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello?

Alas, this was not this book. The authors are more interested in their attempts at wit than their attempts at answering their own questions. When they do, they are smug and arrogant (well, I should have been forewarned: they ARE doctors). Most of their answers simply state \\"there have been no studies\\", so either the medical profession doesn't care about these questions or these authors didn't do enough research. In short, this is a VERY disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I honestly haven't read a book like this before","review":"These are the questions that almost everyone secretly would love to ask their doctor because they are questions we've all asked ourselves and talked about with our friends.The answers are factual but made funny to make it all the more interesting. I was laughing throughout most of the book. Who knew learning was this much fun?There are questions about morning breath, sucking poison out of snake bites, pee smelling different after eating asparagus (we've always wanted to know that one) and contact lenses getting lost in your head. They basically answer it all. Have a laugh and learn fun stuff at the same time. I totally recomend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, interesting, entertaining, and \\"helpful\\"!","review":"Somehow any further compliment to this book seems meaningless amongst the sea of positive reviews here.

The authors tried to add humor to their descriptions of various medical symptoms and ailments, but they did so unsuccessfully. The book also contains random pages of dialogue between the two authors which is humorless, pointless, and in some cases extremely vulgar.

Most of the content I could have accumulated by running Google searches, and some of the explanations I felt were not convincing.

There were several sections that had me wondering about the veracity of the information. When I got to the sections on MSG and sugar substitutes, I knew there was reason to question the information in this text. Millions of migraine suffers are proof enough that MSG and sugar subs such as Aspartame cause debilitating migraines. I'd question the knowledge of any M.D. who isn't aware of this well documented information. And BTW....only a male M.D. would say size doesn't count....the vast female population would say otherwise and no man can make this determination since his experience is insufficient to judge. Heaven save us from men who don't have a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing application of an excellent premise","review":"Many of us have, at one time or another,wondered about some of the questions answered in this book, so I was looking forward to finding the answers. Alas, the weak attempts at humor, along with the overly familiar, chatty style and pointless insertions of IM conversations, all come together to undermine what could have been one of my favorite quickie reads.Pick it up for the answers - some of which only come after a lot of beating around the bush - but don't come at it with high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I was so terribly disappointed in this book. As previous reviewers have indicated, it does almost nothing that it claims. It scarcely answers five or six questions and it answers them briefly and without much thought.Most answers are \\"we don't know\\" or \\"it just is\\". If you have an inquisitive mind and an interest in medicine or biology, this book ain't for you. If you like poop chat and boring IM transcripts, run to the bookstore because you will LOVE this book.Bummer! I was really hoping to love it :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of errors and false statements","review":"Some of the statements made by the authors are just absurd. For instance, I seriously doubt cancer has been linked to a healthy diet and exercise, or that smoking is a great way to get rid of tumors. Also, a man's penis isn't meant to be used as a sword.These authors need to grow up and stop taking advantage of the mentally retarded Amazon customers.In short, Dr. Phil and Adam Carolla deserve to burn in hell for this irresponsible piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"but there's a catch...","review":"Why does your mom have a **** would be the more pertinent question dear sir. books like this make me question the future of pop litterature."},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliant title that lacks content","review":"The title of the book is brilliant. The concept of the book has potential. However, the content does not live up to the hype. The authors try to be funny, adding explicitives here and there, with some locker room humor interspersed. For the questions that do have serious answers, they are loaded with medical jargons and names that go into one ear and out the other for the laymen readers. Of the hundreds of questions/answers, there is probably only a handful that are interesting trivia. I recommend just to borrow the book from the library for a very light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to relax.","review":"If you like stupid funny books, this is the one to read.

Maybe it was at one time but that isn't the case any more. The sticker states plainly 18/10 s/s Made in China.I returned this one and purchased theKuhn Rikon 10-Inch Galaxy Spring Whiskinstead.

One of my favorite shows of all time. The personality of House embodies what I wish I would be, such a cool guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Gay and Atempting to Change That","review":"This week's episode involves a gay man about to marry a woman. He gets very ill at the altar and is rushed away by ambulance before getting married. An interesting point to me was that House had to put him through all sorts of medical tests to see if the \\"treatments\\" he'd received to change him from gay to straight caused his present health crisis. If nothing else, just seeing this guy go through those tests would convince you never to medically attempt to reverse your sexual preference! On the usual front, House continues his hijinks through the rest of his life while solving this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same House","review":"To be honest, I am only on disc 3. So far, I do not care for this season of House. I like the hardened, harsh-but-accurate character of House. This new softer version bores me. I did not enjoy the episode revolving around Cuddy. The show is dynamic because of House with his wise-cracking, not whether or not Cuddy has a boyfriend or a sick baby. And, why on earth was there such a sweet wedding between Chase and Cameron at the end of Season 5 only to have the marriage break up so soon? (On a frivolous note, I also dislike the new hairstyle of Dr. Chase.)No, I am not generally an all-around-negative person. (I know you're thinking that I am.) I loved all of the other seasons prior to this one and own all of the DVDs. I will definitely finish watching Season 6. Hope House returns to his former self soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"House: The Complete Sixth Season","review":"The sixth season of House starts off good and ends on an interesting note, but past that, the injection of new blood appears to show the patient not fully accepting the diagnosis. Laurie still brings his \\"A\\" game and the cast wants to match the effort, but they're still hampered by the way the episodes lay themselves out on screen. Worth watching for the opening and closing episodes but past that, newbies should start with an earlier season to get oriented."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting side trip...","review":"House takes a side trip this season, and it works for me.

The magnificent psychiatric hospital episode, \\"Broken\\" it's the work of a master! This episode could perfectly compete in the Oscars as a geniune motion picture. The co-starring character of Andre Braugher as House's psychiatrist is inspiring. The character of Franka Potente (Bourne Supremacy, Run Lola Run) it's oustanding. I deeply recommend this season. Inteligent, inspiring, the funniest situations you can imagine! You never get tired of watching this wonderful series. Finally I would like to stand out the nice chapter dedicated to focus on the work and life of Wilson, \\"Wison\\" who takes us into his world as the center of the story, watching House's team work in the periphery. Very interesting chapter. Robert Sean Leonard's performance as Wilson is memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst idea ever, 8 day delay.","review":"I missed House last night and thought I would jump on Amazon and grab the latest show. However, some idiot decided it was a good idea to put them on an 8 day delay. So, I will see next week's show before I see this weeks show or I will be forced to record next weeks show and wait until this week's show is released to watch it.Where do these TV industry people store their brains, because I can't see in what way this helps fans of the show and if it doesn't help the show, it hurts it.

The first two-hour episode, with House in the rehab clinc, was so-so. The best part of that first episode was watching House go toe-to=toe with Andre Braugher's character; House finally met someone he couldn't bamboozle with his lying or his wonderful sarcasm. Mr.Braugher is a fine actor, also, and held his own with Mr. Laurie. The rest of the episodes, to repeat, were up and down for me. My favorite, and the most touching, was the last one, where House had to cut off a woman's leg and she died anyway. House's connnection with that woman,through the honesty and real sadness in his eyes, was very moving for me. Mr.Laurie really should have gotten his Emmy this year; Rip Off!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing else matter","review":"This is great, pre-ordené la sexta temporada y en tan sólo 8 días la recibí. This season for me was exciting, the return of House, la idea de que la 'Thirteen' y Taub se fueran. The bad was the exit of Cameron on the show. Aunque regresó en Lockdown.

Last year my wife sat and watched a whole episode and said she liked it so i bought her a Box set (seasons 1-5) and i watched one episode and was Hooked! He is a Jerk to people but at the same time, cares more about them than the people that are around them. He is funny,a Crackpot,Brilliant,a Jerk all round in one :) The surrounding cast is marvelous. a MUST OWN DVD Box Set!

Tried again through amazon, finally got a reply. Seller was rude and accused me of doing damage to the DVDs. Refused to replace and choose not to stand behind his product.

There is always a certain amount of mystery around the magic done in post production mastering. I don't say this book gets you there magically, but it gives you a real understanding of what is involved and certainly gives you all the information you need to be on your way! Most professional digital recording software contains a lot of useful post production features, but if you don't understand the basics of mastering, they are of limited use.

Second,it is very deep in technical jargon and very thin on learning points.

It may be a little complicated if you don't have background in digital music because all the terms involved, but other than that it's a masterpiece. This book for sure will also be a reference manual for me, not because it's formatted like one, but because it has so many valuable pieces of information. The constant references to further chapters kinda drives you crazy and tempts you to jump to those chapters. All the information is so exciting, I read more than 100 pages non stop...

Any alternative recommendations?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as everyone says","review":"I bought mine on Amazon more than two years ago and I've used it almost every day since then. I eat a lot of garlic. It is absolutely amazing. It presses garlic neatly and efficiently with very little effort, it cleans up easily with nothing but hot water, and two years later it still looks completely brand new. No chips, scratches, or rust. It is literally indistinguishable from a brand new one.This is the only garlic press I've used that will actually crush unpeeled garlic without a problem, as long as you stop to pull the skin out in between cloves.The price is high but if you eat a lot of garlic it's totally worth it.

The common flaw would be that they were either difficult to clean or eventually the handles would break. The Rosle garlic masher has to be the best one that I have ever used or seen. First off this thing is solid and will not have any problems mashing garlic. It's also sturdy and is definitely high quality. The best part about it is the cleaning. It's difficult to describe but the screen that mashes the garlic splits apart and allows direct access to remove garlic pulp. It makes cleaning easy and quick. This caused me to throw away all of my cheap kitchen utensils and switch over to Rosle on almost everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe this is such trash","review":"While i do own several rosle pieces in my kitchen, this is not constructed like anything else that i own. on the first piece of garlic that i tried to press, the unit simply was destroyed. the spot-weld at the fulcrum snapped off, causing everything to misalign and bend beyond repair. if you order this, good luck, as this is a manufacturing problem from the factory and is probably going to happen to you as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"What a disappointment, this was supposed to be the best garlic-press available, yet upon pressing just the second clove of garlic it bent, slightly yes, but now the snap-close feature no longer works so when it is hung on a hook it falls open. If it cost $10-$15 I would probably keep it as it does do a great job of pressing garlic and it is easy to clean but at $35 I expect it to be prefect. So I am returning it. It is truly a shame as if they just made it with slightly thicker steel it probably would be the finest press available. Depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't pinch my fingers with this one","review":"I bought this garlic press some time ago, and have gotten consistently good use out of it.I've heard it said that there's a better one out there by Kuhn Rikon, but from what I've seen of the design, I'm better off with this one, since every other garlic press I've tried with that design managed to pinch my fingers.The design of this one by Rösle makes it almost impossible to pinch your fingers when pressing the garlic through, and it really does a nice job, so I'm content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but worth every penny","review":"Ergonomic, very easy to clean, does not require too much strength - - superb design (purchased on Amazon several months ago)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Grail (but not the Roesle)","review":"Been chopping & grating garlic for 50 years because garlic presses were always a pain but still kept searching. Finally bought yet another one because of its provenance and styling : The Roesle came apart at the weld after a few presses . So much for curb appeal. Then saw the review of the KUN RIKON in Cooks' Magazine and bought it -- a revelation. Superb in handling, output, residual, and cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Garlic Press Ever!","review":"I love this garlic press so much I bought 4 of them!!! We eat a lot of garlic and usually 2 or 3 presses are in the dishwasher. I've owned and tried dozens of presses; including Kuhn Rikon Epicurean, which I find to be a very close second best; but this one beats all. Easy to use, easy to clean, presses garlic very well, sturdy and made to last! I don't ever want to be without this Rosle garlic press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garlic press for a lifetime!","review":"I purchased this for a gift because I already have one.

I was specifically looking that is made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it wrong to love a garlic press?","review":"I just got the Rosle garlic press a few weeks ago and I love it. It's easy to use and easy to clean. It has a nice weight to it. It feels like a tool that will last many years. I had obsessively read all the customer reviews on Amazon for various garlic presses and I decided to spend the extra cash on this model. Completely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designed as though lives depended on it.","review":"This impressive piece of hardware feels like anything but a kitchen tool - more like surgical or scientific equipment.I've owned several cheaper garlic presses and rarely used them. The amount of time saved in the kitchen was lost when trying to clean the gadget.By contract; The Rosle press works flawlessly and cleans easily. This is the only Rosle tool I own - most of the rest seem either over-engineered or impractical.The genius lies in the flip-up press plate that allows you to instantly clear the plate and load another clove.Bottom line: This is a tool that will get used, since it works flawlessly and stays clean easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I had resisted purchasing this item because of what seemed to be an exorbitant price, but now that I have used it I am sorry that I waited so long. After years of dealing with more 'reasonably' priced garlic presses, this press is a revelation. So easy to use! So easy to clean! I love the way the perforated section of the press swings out for easy cleaning. Some of the other premium garlic presses list a cleaning tool; just one more thing to get lost in a busy kitchen. And as well as being intelligently designed, it is sturdily constructed; I doubt that I will bend this tool, as I have with lesser makes. After using this garlic press, I expect I will be tempted into upgrading to other Rosle tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Garlic Press So Far","review":"Everyone in my family (parents, aunts, uncles, siblings) has the Zyliss, and I have one from my college days. They are great presses - efficient mechanism, no parts to misplace (except the cleaning tool), little waste. However, as my husband pointed out, they are rather difficult to clean thoroughly.The Rosle press requires much less physical strength than the Zyliss and is a bit easier to clean (since the grate handily pops up for that task). However, it seems to trap a bit more of the garlic in the grate (more waste, hence four stars). The bottom line is that I find myself using the Rosle over the Zyliss more and more; it just feels better in your hands.A couple tips: peel garlic first if you have many cloves to press and don't want to interrupt pressing to unclog the grate AND hold onto the grate's thumb tab for your first clove so your garlic doesn't go flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lookin' but not for cookin'","review":"This garlic press looks stunning, just like the rest of the Rösle line. I love the shiny finish and the hooks on each tool.However, don't judge this book by its cover. I am very disappointed with how this tool works. It smashes up the garlic and much of it gets stuck inside the press creating a lot of waste. It is also difficult to clean, requiring a lot of rinsing to get all that stuck garlic out.This is the first time I have been disappointed by Rösle. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"I already own the Rosle garlic press, but mine was not made in China and is substantially higher quality and the mechanism is very smooth. I did not read the reviews as your product info stated that the press was made in the USA. I have been disappointed that most stores,even Williams Sonoma, are carrying the press made in China. I just got my order - which was to be a gift for my sister- and the press is NOT made in the USA. You need to change the description on your site ASAP. This is really false advertising and very deceptive. Many people are trying to purchase products made in the USA or at least not made in China. I would not have ordered this garlic press had I known it was made in China. I wish I would have spent more time checking out the other reviews. I can see that this deceptive behavior is not new. Reviews go way back. Not good business."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was fooled by amazon! It's made in CHINA! OTL...","review":"I was fooled by amazon! It's made in CHINA! OTL...

The Rosle is overpriced, holds only a small clove of garlic, is NOT easy to squeeze, and is \\"German design\\" but made in China.The Oxco press that I already owned does a better job and was much less expensiveI sent it back. Bless Amazon for their easy return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 years and going strong!","review":"I have owned this garlic press for almost 7 years (bought right here on Amazon). It has seen continued, regular use over that entire time, and has been washed both by hand and in the dishwasher with the same results! It is perfect and still looks brand new. I love this press! What an investment. The best part is that the price is just about the same today as it was 7 years ago. Buy this press. You will be happy, and the years of use you will get out of it will more than make up for the few extra dollars it costs.

She hasn't changed after twenty years. I had the pleasure and blessing of seeing her live in concert in 2011. It was amazing and by far the best concert I've been to -- and I've been to alot. She's truely one of a kind. Thank you Sade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The goddess of Love","review":"I was fortunate to see the goddess of Love in the City of Brotherly love (Philly). Listening to her music via CD does not compare to hearing Sade live!!! I've been a fan since the age of 10. And during the times when Sade didn't have a recording on the airwaves, I followed her other band mates (Stuart Matthewman), who recorded with other artists and was able to still get that same vibe (maxwell, Amel larrieux, etc) So glad there is a dvd/cd coming out of this tour. My favorite song / performance of the night was \\"Pearls\\". The backdrop of the moon with only Sade on stage and her powerful voice was a moment of transcendence! Can't wait to purchase this DVD/CD and add to my Sade collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever!!","review":"I was a little down because I missed the show in Charlotte NC only to find out she was going to be here in Greensboro. I don't think I will ever witness another concert that will top this one!! We got free upgraded seats which made it even better. I enjoyed John Legend but I was waiting all of my adult life to finally see this band live and it was one of the best nights of my life. Certainly something I checked off of my bucket list. The band is awesome, Sades voice is like smooth warm silk and the visuals were breath taking! I am excited about this release!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade is the best:)","review":"I cannot wait for this dvd so i can relive the concert experience. I saw her in Atlanta and loved it so much i went to see her again in Greensboro. this time i spent more money and got excellent seats because it was worth it. I dont think i have ever spent that much on a concert ticket and would do it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait","review":"Took the wifey to see the Soldier of Love tour in Minneapolis last August and that was one of the best nights of our lives. We saw Lover's Live about 10 years back in Denver so we already had high expectations for this show and we were not let down. Can't wait to give this to my wife for an anniversary gift in June. Sade's live shows have such great audio visual effects and she is one of the best performers of our time. You cannot forget to give her band their props either. We actually a couple of the band members at an after function and they were super cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Show!","review":"Sade doesn't miss a beat; the concert has all her classics.

As someone who sees a lot live concerts, it takes quite a bit for me to 'bow down'. With this show, I couldn't bow down deeply enough. Great song selection, a spectacular but tasteful stage presentation coupled with Sade's obvious appreciation of her audience's long standing loyalty, resulted in one of the best shows I've seen in the last 20 years.The bluray edition of the concert film is immaculately produced and is a perfect record of a perfect show. I can't recommend this disc strongly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a big talent and looker","review":"Sade's fans are quite enthusiastic and loyal and friends saw this concert tour in 2011. Overall quite entertaining and tight. Her hits are fun. there is a bit of sameness to her songs and performance so two hours can get you sleepy. But she is great to watch, over 50 years old I believe. She is one of the good ones. I didn't got to the concert in Charlotte because the ticket prices were sky high Las Vegas style. too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best concert DVD blu-rays. Buy it.","review":"I'm a big Sade fan, but I'm also a connoisseur of quality recordings. This was recorded in hi definition, HD 5.1 Surround and the film was digitally shot as well. The production quality is fantastic...you feel like you're on the fifth row.Now...what can I say about Sade other than she met every expectation I had of her in this concert. I saw it live last July 2011 in Dallas and she was amazing. This DVD captured that evening very well. I'm buying this for several friends who aren't believers...they will be after watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade Live!","review":"Wow!!!!!Finally hooked up my Blu-Ray and the first video I played was Sade's live concert. After reading all the reviews here and listening to the live release, I had to have it to see the visuals. Amazing, the lighting, Sade, the band. This video just makes me wish I was at the actual concert. Yet, seeing it on Blu-ray is probably the best seat in the house. The visuals are almost as amazing as the band itself. The music is so well arranged, you would almost feel like you are listening to her CDs. From the intro to the end, Sade live is great. I hope it doesnt take her another ten years to release another album of new material and tour. This release definitely makes me want to experience it live. I remember hearing of her tour and seeing the ticket prices. After watching this video, I completely understand why the prices were high. GREAT show!!!!!!

I assume the item may have been made in Germany at one time. It is now made in China by a German company. It looked sturdy, but in my experience Chinese Stainless is not as it should be, and will rust (why does there seem to be a different standard of quality?). The item was heavy and seemed like it is usable. Give it a try if you want, but when Amazon states it is German made, I expect it to be that. I have returned this too. Also, Why are three pictured in this photo rather than the one you receive? That is a little deceptive too. It is NOT a set of 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Vacuous Book","review":"This is a waffly book that will not tell you anything useful about web services.

The author tries to get away with vague definitions of terms, one by one. I suspect that the author does not know how to build a simple web service himself.This book is not useful to a beginner.

Like Shogun - and unlike some of the other novels in the series - Whirlwind abounds with compelling characters and engrossing sub-plots. If you are going to read through Clavell's work chronologically (and I do recommend this approach) I suggest you commit to following through to the end or you will miss one of Clavell's finest pieces.Clavell's mastery of historical fiction is incontestable: Whirlwind is one of the finest examples of his talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whirlwind - The brilliant story of revolutionary Iran.","review":"For those of us who are familiar with Clavell's work, it is no surprise to find Whirlwind a dramatic exciting story with captivating twists in plot at every turn. With Whirlwind, we see the continuation of the Noble House, and not surprisingly, more legend and lore of the Struan clan. Set in 1979 Iran, Whirlwind deteals the life and times of several individuals, both Iranian and otherwise, in those turbulent pre-hostage crisis days. Clavell does a masterful job bringing his characters to life. All from the massive Fin, Errikki Yokkonen, to the delicate Sharazad, to the enigmatic and mysterious Robert Armstrong. Since Clavell's death in 93' nothing has been posthumously published, leaving this his last chronological work. To any fan of Clavell's, this work is essential reading, to anyone who wishes merely for a rousing read, Whirlwind will satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Whirlwind here is authors thoughts","review":"My library had the book on the free giveaway shelf.

In fact, it is the only series I've set aside to read again. All books, except Whirlwind were good to fabulous.

The novel itself in good condition - I would recommend the vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh. Just bleh.","review":"You probably came into Clavell's opus late, reading them in chronological order as opposed to published order. You've found Whirlwind tough to find, unlike all the others. There's a reason for that. Whirlwind isn't set in Japan or China, and the characters and families we grew to love (and in some cases, hate), aren't the protagonists here. Hence, it sold nowhere near the number of paperbacks as the previous books. Check eBay, a bazillion HC's that nobody bids on, and no PB's.My advice? Let it go after Noble House. Yes that's disappointing, but nowhere near as disappointing as reading this book. Of course the most disappointing thing of all is that James didn't live long enough to write about the turnover of Hong Kong to Mainland China."},{"rating":"2","title":"funk at its best","review":"this is the funk album.his work with grant greenand james brown are hot too.buy this now.an orgasmic mixof covers and a few originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I have owned many Barrons books over the years, and they have all been excellent.

This definitely is the \\"busy person's guide\\" to low-carb meals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good for VERY low carbers","review":"While the recipes in Ms. Gassenheimer's book look wonderful and the layout and photos are terrific, this is one book that has made it out of my house to the resellers because the carb counts for most of her recipes are too high for those of us with very low carb diets. If you are doing Atkins, most of her recipes will be beyond your scope. One benefit of her book though is that she also focuses on keeping it lowfat while doing low carb. But buyer beware if you are on ultra low carb because the book won't do much for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review helps reviewer!","review":"The online reviews helped me determine if this is the right cookbook for me. There are many variations of a low-carb diet and you have to determine which one is right for you. This book is helpful for those who are not on a totally restricted carb diet while it is of no help to a person who wants to keep their carb intake to a low 10 or 20 grams. For the reviewer that suggested substituting low fat ingredients for some of the recipes \\"he has missed the boat completely\\". This book adds variety - but only for the person who is moderately reducing their carb intake. For the person who is on a \\"very low\\" carb restricted diet such as Atkins or Protein Power, this is not a cookbook for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low carb???","review":"This book claims to fit all the popular low carb diets including Atkins. Half the recipes are way over the carb count for the Atkins diet. If you're looking for REAL low carb recipes, look somewhere else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Low Can You Go? Lower than THIS!","review":"As a Type 2 diabetic who can only maintain any control over my blood sugars and weight through a strict low-carb regime, I had high hopes for this book. I hoped that it would provide me with inspirations for meals that would make low-carb life more palatable, and for meals that I could share with my non-diabetic husband.WHOOPS! These recipes are NOT what I call low-carb. I would gain weight steadily if I ate from the plans in this book. I found one recipe with 46 grams of carbs per serving!Unless you are someone who currently lives mostly on bread, cereals, fruit, soda, and desserts, this book will *not* help you reduce carbs more than a little. Shy away from it and read anything by Atkins.What I recommend if you're a diabetic is Richard Bernstein's wonderful book, *Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution*. I am sure that following the principles he outlines is adding years to my life - not to mention the ten pounds it has, initially, removed from my body!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY","review":"If you're on any kind of low (or lower) carbohydrate program this book is a total waste of your time and money. The average carb count for ONE MEAL is at least 10-15 grams (and that's on her lower carb program.) Multiply that by three, add something for snacks, and you'll be well over your daily target.The recipes are nothing extraordinary. Even if you can't cook, you don't need a cookbook to teach you how to make oatmeal (which shouldn't even BE in a low-carb cookbook) or how to combine cut-up kiwi and berries to make a \\"Kiwi Jumble.\\"There are several other Low-Carb cookbooks out there that are much, much better.

Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird , unappetizing recipes","review":"I ordered this book hoping to expand my low-carb recipe repetoire. Unfortunately, the recipes in this book are too weird for my taste. They call for ingredients that I've never heard of, and doubt are carried at the local grocery store chain. Don't waste your money on this if you are looking for simple and easy recipes for tasty meals the whole family will eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes too complicated for \\"fast\\" meals cookbook","review":"Although the recipes looked appetizing, I was disappointed because they looked too complicated to make on a tight time schedule, and many of the ingredients would need to be purchased at a health food store. Anything that requires the use of a food processor (especially for breakfast) is not a fast recipe in my book. The book did include some faster recipes but they were TOO basic. For example, one recipe called for a) bran cereal and b) milk. The instructions were something like: divide cereal into 2 bowls, add milk. Serves two. That seemed a little too obvious to me to be considered a \\"recipe\\", while the others seemed too complicated. I was hoping for a happy medium. The layout of the book is excellent though. I like the style very much.

Though this may be considered \\"tough sledding\\" in terms of style, it is nonetheless fascinating. The topics of study are: Social Darwinism, the dichotomy of East/West London, Women's organizations, the emergence of a well-read middle class, bourgeois charity towards the poor, liberalism, nationalism, sensationalism in the press, and the collective imagination of contemporary Londoners. Walkowitz's conclusion is both staggering and unexpected, explaining that the legendary Jack the Ripper may be nothing more than the embodiment of tabloid fancies and the overactive imagination of a well-read populace. This is one of my favorite historical monographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous blend of Foucauldian theory and empiricist history","review":"Walkowitz masterfully unravels the mysteries of Foucault's periodization of the proliferation of gender discources.

The content of the book has been discussed at length, but the translator needs to be slammed over and over again, and new one prepared.

When I was in high school, my class was asked to read In Another Country for discussion. It was my first Hemingway short story, and an introduction to the novels we would be reading. I almost cried. His writing is just so gut-wrenchingly honest and raw. No overwrought explanations of emotion. You know how these characters are feeling simply because of how the speak and act. Hemingway is the master of context. The Killers is almost like a mystery story that never gets solved. Why doesn't he run out of town? What's going to happen to the big guy? I love this stuff and can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Papa","review":"This book is admittingly not the best of Hemingway's, but it captures the pinnacle of his writing style and gift for description and leaves the reader feeling as if they were watching the tales on screen or actually experiencing them and makes them realize that this is a must-have for any collection of Hemingway works.

To help the locals? I think not - it was another example of creating another war to promote their own self interests in the global arena! Holbrook does a great job of tryint to persuade the reader that it was humantarian but in the end it was purely enconomical. Would the Holbrook allow a \\"rebel\\" army of 30-40,000 run around America - killing a certain ethnic group - I think not. Yet in Serbia Holbrook encouraged them. Has the situation improved in Kosovo after the intervention? Has the war ended? No, Kosovo remains one of the dangerous places in the world - Holbrook's team have made the situation worse for Kosovo and it's integration into Serbia. He fails to go into the anti-Serbian policies the govt employed and the manipulation of the Western world through its propaganda. Well written, but another \\"wag the tail\\" approach to a conflict that would have been resolved without the US intervention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed but biased","review":"The added value of \\"To end a war\\" is its very detailed description of the Dayton negotiations from one of the main players. However, the book takes a very biased view of the causes of the conflict in the Balkans, what perpetuated them and what brought them to an end. Holbroke presents the simplistic view that he, together with US military force, ended the war.He mentions nothing of previous peace initiatives. Holbroke does not acknowledge the US role in the Croatian government reconquest and subsequent ethnic cleansing of the Krajina region (populated by ethnic Serbs) in Croatia, one of the main factors in the chain of events leading to the Dayton negotiations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did We End a War?","review":"The fighting in Bosnia has stopped.

He is an excllent teacher and a resourceful boat keeper. He is also an outstanding offshore gourmet cook.(That is another story, maybe even a book.) Many of the tips in this book were generated by his experiences on my Alden 50 cutter, Despedida and on her successor, a new Alden 54 cutter.

So what are you going to do when the boat you are on has problems? Note there was no 'if' in the previous sentence.

I could really see Rob Petrie trying to play a character like this, and doing a great job (unlike the time he got a small role, tried to kiss a girl who wasn't Laura, and failed miserably).So with this movie, we had a lot of the physical comedy that made \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\" so wonderful.

I just didn't trust it.Overall, I think it's worth getting the one with the swaddle to try out and see if your newborn likes it, but for us, we just used the sack.Also, the pink color didn't really hold up that well. It seemed to fade a lot, but we did wash it a lot too, so that might be user error."},{"rating":"2","title":"warm and soft","review":"love the sleep sacks by Halo. They keep baby warm enough that you don't have to worry about blankets. Plenty of room for baby to kick his legs and not too bulky on its own. I like the swaddle for colder nights, but the bigger size the sleep sack, the bulkier the swaddle. I used it more on the newborn size than the small. I highly recommend this sleepsack for babies born in the winter and fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This worked out so perfectly. I love this thing. The zipper starts from the top and zips down which makes it so convenient when I need to change his diaper since I don't have to unzip him all the way.

It is already starting to get kind of snug for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great product!","review":"Never forget to fasten the straps to hold the swaddle in place we had it come loose and go over baby's face but that was totally our fault. Its warm but would be good if your keep your home cold in the summer. Our son outgrew his at about 2 months length wise. It might be wise to keep it packaged until you no how long your little one is going to be at birth. Our son was 19 1/4 and it worked well until he was 23 inches and then we had to move up because it was getting hard to get his arms our in the morning. His legs never woke him up. He has slept through the time since one month old. Maybe he started because he was swaddled. I am not sure but in my opinion this is much safer than a separate blanket. We will use them until they don't make them big enough for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swaddle Sack","review":"These make swaddling a breeze!

My daughter actually started out as a co-sleeper and was waking every 3.5-4. I realized when she was about 10 weeks old that she would be getting a better nights sleep in her own bed. The next night, my husband and I attempted to get her to sleep in her crib. Every time she would begin to doze off, she would scare herself and her moro reflex would send her arms up into the air. We had tried swaddling her before but without any success. I had received one of these as a gift from the hospital but tucked into a drawer as a gimmicky gift. That night, I drug it out and we strapped her into it. She slept for 8 hours straight that night. She has been sleeping in it every night since then and for most naps, too. She takes two naps a day for about 2 hours each and is sleeping 12 hours a night. I recommend this to all new moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those who have difficulty swaddling !","review":"Excellent way to securely swaddle your baby and keep him or her warm without blankets in the crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite baby item","review":"i love halo sleep sacks and was so excited when i realized they had a swaddle sleep sack.. its perfect for newborns since they move and twitch in the middle of the night waking them.. when they are swaddled they are less likely to wake up .. which means less wake ups for mommy.. this would be my number one gift to give to new mommys"},{"rating":"1","title":"baby is all sweaty","review":"after two nights sleeping with this swaddle my baby got a rash from sweat. its not hot at our home (70F) but baby was all wet in this swaddle. it is very comfortable,but the fabric-deffinately not baby friendly!!! not gonna use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend","review":"We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old thinking it would be easier to use than a traditional swaddle blanket. He really enjoyed it when we first tried it out. It is nice that you can make it tight and they can't wiggle out of it like the regular blankets. The problem we found the first night of use was that it can slide up. My son sleeps with his head elevated and this blanket just slid right up over his face. Thank goodness he was still sleeping in our room and we caught it quickly because it was wrapped very well around his head. Threw the thing out immediately. Great concept, didn't work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"My husband found this when my daughter was about 2 weeks old. She was just learning to wriggle out of a blanket swaddle and this was ideal.

This fleece version is great for winter to help keep babies warm. Our baby is 9mo and around 18lbs and still fits and loves this thing. If she's fussing when going down, she is able to wiggle her arms free, but it generally does the trick if she goes down tired. Nice feature about this style is the removable swaddle wrap. Once the kid no longer needs to have their arms wrapped, you can graduate them to just the sleepsack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute & Soft","review":"Ordered this for our newborn preemie granddaughter.

Our son slept great in them.My only complaint is the sizing. It should be based on length, not weight, because a child's length is what is going to determine whether or not these fit. Our son is long. He could no longer straighten his legs completely in the newborn sacks when he was around 11 lbs. He is now about 14 1/2 pounds and, at over 27 inches in length, is very near to outgrowing the size small ones we bought him. Even going by normal baby clothing sizes would be more helpful than listing weight ranges. If your child doesn't wear the size corresponding with his/her age (like ours, who is now in 6-9mo at 4mo old because of his length), you still know what size of clothes you're putting on him/her every day.Just keep that in mind if you have a baby who is long in relation to his/her weight. You might want to order a size larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"I really like this sleep sack. we have had two and need another. Our girl sleeps in it every night.

It keeps them so warm and helps them sleep. Just wish they made them for adults too! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"My baby outgrown the Summer Infant swaddles in length by 2mo. This sack works well as long as you keep the swaddle flaps 1-2 inches below the shoulders, or be sure the hands are tucked in so the arms cannot push up the flaps to gather around the neck. The material is soft and washes well. However, a strong baby will likely be able to slide his arms out of the swaddle rather easily. My baby is about 24 to 25 inches long and the sack still has ample room. It works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE!!!","review":"I use to be a big fan of the Halo sleep sack...until I found my baby with the swaddle bundled around his face and neck!!!!

This Item is a Preemie Size. Perhaps I am the only one who miss understood the size XX Small...There are three sizes available: Preemie, Newborn and Small.

First they did not want to give me a refund, they just wanted to send me the same size again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy","review":"Please be aware.

Use this product with extreme caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"I actually liked this swaddle quite a bit. It was working awesome until one day I found the \\"wings\\" of the swaddle bunched up around her neck. It was horrifying! I chucked it immediately. Now we are using the SwaddleMe and I found she can't bunch it up anywhere near her neck. She CAN get it to overlap her chin a little bit with some squirming which may cause her to try and suck on it (rarely happens) but there is no bunching or constriction. I've heard good things about the Woombie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be dangerous","review":"This is a great idea, but like another review said, they can raise their arms up from the bottom of the arm wrap which makes the fabric bunch up around their face. I bought a fleece one and a knit one. The fleece one would be too hot so I used the arm wrap from the knit one with the fleece sack. It's easy to get on but the fleece is bulky and makes it hard to burp them. I'll probably stop using it because I'm afraid of the wrap getting pushed up into her face."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Great quality; was exactly what my fussy daughter needed...the best swaddling product on the market. Well worth the higher price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old version was better","review":"I have a 3 year old and have an older version of this, but I needed a larger size for my 8 week old and I do not like this at all. The one I had before was in two pieces, the sleepsack and the \\"wings\\" or the wrap around. There was velco on the back of the sleepsack and on the \\"wings\\". I could have my baby in the sack and then when it was time for bed I would lay her down on the \\"wing\\" and swaddle her up and put her in bed. I thought it was the same now but it's not. The whole thing is one piece. My kid does not want to be bundled up and swaddled when she's not sleeping so the \\"wing/swaddle\\" part is all tangled up and we can't remove it, it's all one piece. Bottom line this was a great product until they changed and I can't return my b/c my husband already washed it. Bad purchase, change it back, you had a good thing going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep sack in quality and comfort","review":"I got 3 different sleep sacs for my newborn - halo, swaddle me from kiddopotamus, and carters. Out of these, halo is by far the best in quality and comfort. The material is superior and may be comparable to the one from carters (swaddle me is not as good). However, this one beats the other 2 in fit and comfort. My baby loved it. It is a bit pricey comparatively, but it is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loving it","review":"I bought this sleep swaddle because we needed to transition our baby from the cradle in our room to her crib. We also live in a colder climate, so I wanted something that will keep her warm and toasty.She is almost 14 pounds and very long. Halo says size small is for 13-18 pounds. The first night, she worked her arms out several times. The last time scared the garbage out of me because as she worked her arms out, she brought it up over her mouth.We normally wear the miracle blanket, which she can't get out of and doesn't cause me to have heart palpitations. I think we'll go back to that one.Update: We had this same sleeper in a newborn size that she never wore because I thought she was too big for it. So, I tried it on and it seems to fit her better. We will try the smaller size tonight. Maybe it's just sized incorrectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I used the smaller one for the first four month.

Luckily, Nasaw's biography of The Chief brings him down to size. The author's extensive research brings us a fascinating story of a fascinating man: a man filled with so many contradictions, that it is no surprise that he became a legend in his own time.The book takes us from Hearst's father's humble beginnings as a 49er, and takes us through his runs on the governorship of NY, his inability to manage his own finances, his stewardship of yellow tabloid journalism, through is bizarre personal life.I've read other Nasaw books (Children of the City, etc), but this is by far the best.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear-eyed view of a much mythologized man","review":"Very entertaining, well-written and (rare these days) well-edited true story of WR Hearst's life (as opposed to the various stories and personas promulgated by his employees and enemies, not to mention Citizen Kane). I appreciated learning the truth; I held many misconceptions, as it turned out. But in the end, Hearst was four things: Newspaperman, wealthy American, businessman and builder of San Simeon. Nasaw covers the first two topics in depth, but tends to gloss the details of the latter two. I would have preferred more details of how San Simeon was arranged, how large its rooms were, and that sort of thing. And I suspect Hearst's capitalization structure and the details of his finances would have been interesting as well. But Nasaw quotes heavily from Hearst's editorials--he was a very persuasive writer--and describes the man's expensive habits and his courtiers completely.

A robber baron? Not so sure about that, but WRH was a baron (in the monarchial sense) no doubt. He lived like a medieval king - constantly pointing out flaws in others and ruling on those where he could, seemingly ignorant of his own contrary ways.The book can be a battle - Mrs H senior was tiresome and WRH did take a long time to reach his stride, but it is never dull and at the end I realised I had finished the most amazing story, all the more so as it is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of detail","review":"This book is much more than I thought it would be.

There are more than that, however, and it makes it difficult for my daughter to understand where they belong. For now I'm keeping the alphabet puzzle put away."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good game","review":"good my son like good game.

Each plot is rich with good and interesting relationships and lead character who grows into what a real man really should be.

Its review led me to believe I would learn philosophical truths, tricks and tips to enable me to adapt my aging body to continuing riding, and other important and useful information.

Buy a G200 Defender by Outset! with a green handle--those can be heard from far away when you touch the button & shock you afterword. It may be study, but that is all this offers. I guess the batteries fit well, unlike the 3rd brand i tried (if it says ''kills bugs instantly, electronic bug zapper, run for the hills-- don't get it). How 3 brands can all be from China, but only 1 was good says a lot. Don't get this; get the G200 by Outset instead-- it's only maybe a buck more and will put a hurt on them.

I had an issue with basic house flies that were getting in the house from outside. The racket uses 3 layers of screens, but this caused too much \\"wind\\" when trying to swat a fly out of the air. If you happen to hit one, the fly needs to touch two layers of screens at the same time to get zapped.Since the racket is well... a racket-- you can't swat-to-kill when they are sitting on the counter. You just trap the fly and hope it walks on the racket and touchs the two layers... and then ZAP!I bought two, since I knew my son would want to try when he saw me swatting... but they both broke.

Just a mild swing at an elusive fruit fly killed the zapper (and not the fly). It stopped working after a couple of strong swings. A red light that comes on when the button is pressed showed that the batteries weren't a problem. in fact, a fly that got caught in the mesh managed to muscle its way out with little effort, with no pop/zap/spark which i saw the first few times when I used it.

I am reasonably strong and athletic and play racket sports. But, and I suppose this is obvious, even with an electronic bug zapper you need to swing the zapper fast enough to hit the bug. With the 9-volt racket that is way lighter, this is easy. With this racket it is close to impossible unless you can get the bug to hover for you. This product is close to useless, get the other kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure miss","review":"My husband hit the fly with it several times and the swatter did nothing to it.

This device works perfectly but for the poor battery latch mechanism. The battery door doesn't stay in place & keeps sliding out while I hold the device vertically.

I consider that the only drawback in an otherwise good product.By the way, no batteries are included with this product & users will have to get them on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work!!","review":"Bought 3 of these, and all three work well.

Among the many things not allowed are: \\"Hand-held electric devices that are designed to administer an electric shock on contact, other than cattle prods designed exclusively for use with animals.\\"Pretty silly given the device and the obvious intent behind the regulation, but it does fall within the letter of the regulation.I might try a butterfly net instead.

This just goes to show that you get what you pay for. I tried to save a few bucks and now I have the hassle of returning it. Get the Charcoal Companion instead. It's about twice as expensive, but my friend has one and I know it works well (which is why I wanted to get one of these in the first place).

I wanted a way to get the flies in my house without using poison sprays or eyesore traps like sticky tape. This accomplishes both. I find it to be cleaner and faster than those other options. It also provides a certain thrill as a \\"ZAP!\\"or \\"THWACK!\\" sound occasionally comes as a fly ends its annoying life!Pros: Clean, non-poisonous and effective. Fun for those who enjoy watching a bug \\"sparkle.\\" Works well for other bugs like spiders and even teeny-tiny things like fruit flies (after an oops moment of leaving melon out).Cons: It doesn't solve the general difficulty of swatting at a flying fly. This can work, but usually I have to get bugs by cornering them on a window or lamp first. Also, the grate stays charged for a while if it isn't used; this means that one can be accidentally zapped later if touched or grabbed by the round end.

The first I received was broken and they wanted me to pay for shipping it back to them. The second gave out after working for awhile. I found that when it did work, there wasn't much zap to its zapper. I had to zap the flies for awhile before they died. The ones I had in the past were more powerful and hence killed them faster. They also used a 9 volt battery instead of two AA batteries.

However... It's not as spectacular as my last electric swatter. The old one used to fry bugs to a crisp with a loud pop. This one just electrocutes them without any noise. Ok, it will probably last longer this way. It's just so badly designed... the battery cover when closed will torque the battery contacts just enough to make something lose contact inside. The button is dead. When I leave the cover off, it works. :/ It's a good thing the batteries are in there tight...I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! This thing actually works!","review":"This thing is so much better than squashing a bug up against the wall or wherever with a swatter...not to mention more sanitary. I packs a wallup, so don't poke your pinky into it like I did (I couldn't help it; I was curious)! Half of the time, it makes a nice, loud 'zap' noise, letting you know you've made contact with your target. Sometimes, this doesn't kill the insect...but it will disable it so you can scoop it up with a tissue & dispose of it. I see other reviewers mention the build quality...I have NO issues with it whatsoever. For around $10, it's pretty sturdy. Do you guys expect this to be made of iron for $10?? YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SMACK THIS HARD AGAINST YOUR TARGET...IT WILL BREAK! IT'S NOT A FLY SWATTER!! All you need to do is make contact with your target & the zapper will do the dirty work. I'm so pleased with it, I bought another one. I highly recommend this item. Get one before the bugs GET YOU!! :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as single wire sreen","review":"Has center screen (3 total) that needs contact to zap fly.

It incapacitated MOST of the yellowjackets ONLY IF I HELD THEM DOWN WITH IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. If I merely swatted them, it did nothing but tick them off! One actually fell to the floor after a good long zapping, bounced back up, and tried to STING ME! (Thank goodness I was wearing a jacket at the time)! Those that the racket DID kill took a long time to die, and it was a slow, writhing, agonizing death. I could smell roasted yellow jacket for hours afterwards. Ugh. If yellow jackets are your problem, save your money and buy a GOOD bug vacuum instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it compared to others","review":"Firstly one of the buttons sticks which seems to then make it 'live' vs actually having to hold down the two safety buttons. Bat head is smaller than other models we've had before. Was effective to kill bugs but a bit scary to use, again compared to other models have owned. Wouldn't buy this version again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I had used my sister's zapper (different manufacturer) and it was great so I went to buy one myself and only found this one. Thinking it was the same I bought it. It is horribly designed! It has a protective screen on it so that you don't zap yourself which is good, however it also protects the bug from getting zapped as well. Out of the ten times I hit the fly with this zapper, only once did it actually zap it and yes, I was holding the button down...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuclear zapper","review":"This is the best zapper that I bought from Amazon. The first zapper worked great for one season. It had several fixable breakdowns, until finally it just disintegrated. The second zapper, called Charcoal Companion, is very similar to the one that fell apart last year and I don't expect it to last much longer. Besides that, CC requires you to press two buttons instead of one, which is a very strange idea indeed. When you are under a sustained black fly/moskito attack, your finger dexterity is greatly diminished, which results in more wins for the other side.This zapper has none of those problems. It is incomparably better designed, very sturdy, no loose pieces, and the electrified grid is protected by a safety mesh on both sides, so that you accidentally don't zap yourself or your girlfriend. And it costs less! Can't beat that. The reason I call it \\"nuclear\\" is because it has a prominent A over the grid. It is indeed a weapon of choice. Just nuke 'em!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Killing flies and other bugs is not easy. Flies move too quickly and squishing other bugs is just plain gross.This product works great. Push the button on the handle and get the zapper within about 5 mm of the bug, and electricity does the rest.

Works very well for slow flying or crawling insects, like spiders, and bigger insects. The net part is raised because of the thick yellow border so you can't really swat an insect flat but just \\"gently\\" zap them.. But for a fly??? Good luck!! You can't really swat a fly with it because, well, you can damage it by doing so. So we end up swinging it as we see flies in the air.

I love the story of Cinderella, but there are not many new ways to tell it. This story proves that theory absolutely wrong! I agree with the observation that the drawings are very Tim Burtonesque.

Set in a graveyard, Cinderella Skeleton is the classic tale of Cinderella retold with an undead cast of characters. The story is full of wonderful and mildly creepy rhymes and great word choice. An example of the great word choice is, \\"Her build was long and lean and lank; her dankish hair hung down in hanks.\\" The book offers lots of wonderful illustrations and plenty of interesting twists in the story. One such example is when Cinderella is running away from the prince and instead of her shoe falling off, her whole foot just snaps off. All of the illustrations are wonderful and wonderfully creepy, too. In closing any early or starting reader would love Cinderella Skeleton; it also makes a great book to read out loud to your kids or class, too!This reveiw writen by a poor child forced to write this for his reading class...who still liked the book even though he's in 7th grade"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!","review":"This toy is really cool it has a very nice bed I recamend putting in a nice little blanket big enough to fit the bed.It has'nt been breaking on me I had this toy for 3 years andI have'nt heard a weird noise yet or changed the batteries.It comes with great accseories.I really don't like Barbiesso I got that house for my Bratz and it's great (i made theguy sleep downstairs on the floor he likes it there.)Just soyou know only 1 doll can fit in the upstairs bed mabey Barbieshould lose some weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money and time putting on stickers","review":"Just go ahead and find the Barbie play and store dollhouse...it is HUGE, very nice, and very DURABLE...My daughter plays with her my little pony toys in it more than Barbies...but that is her 1st choice of toys....PLEASE do yourself a favor and and purchase the Barbie play and store doll house at TRU.....well worth the money spent...btw, purchase some furniture @KB!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great townhouse...Barbie is so lucky!","review":"My 6 year old received this from Santa and boy did he do a good job!!

In the late 60's Mattel began making Barbie houses out of cardboard covered in a smooth, almost stretchy-type of plastic (but the furniture was thin and brittle). Currently, Barbie houses are constructed out of a brittle-type of plastic and I am through wasting my money on them. Why doesn't Mattel wise up and use the same material for their houses that Barbie dolls are made of? Even better would be to use the type of plastic that Little Tikes uses for its toys.

I have several different types of cheese cutters in my kitchen gadget drawer and find myself reaching for this more often than the others. I like the ability to change the thickness of the slices of cheese by rotating the handle in your palm to be an advantage. I also note that there is an adjustment for the cutting wire tension so that you can keep it tight over time. I will admit that my initial uses of the slicer were clumsy, but when used often this is a really cool tool. Perhaps it's not for everyone, but it's a keeper for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek looks but no performance","review":"The wire broke after about three slices (of soft mozzarella), with no evident way to repair or replace it.

Our custom built house came with options from the builder and a microwave drawer in the island sounded great. I didn't even think to check for a turntable. That seems like a standard item. The idea of a microwave drawer built-in to the island was great. If I were you I'd wait until the next generation when prices come down and features improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"The earlier review got it right - sounds like a great idea and looks very nice, but with no turntable and very low clearance [I have a tall coffee mug that cannot be reheated in this microwave], its not very practical. The food really does cook unevenly and you must stop and turn it several times. We had a bag of microwave popcorn that burned before it was close to completely popping. It looks like the microwave of the future, but works like a microwave from 1985. It also is very loud when it runs.If you really don't use a microwave often and want something that looks great, I wouldn't rule this out. Otherwise wait until they work out the kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued and Priced Higher then New Model","review":"This is a Discontinued Model and has been Replaced by another Model for a while and this is Priced Higher then the New Model.

I have the second edition, and can't imagine how others are making it work. The code sample for the very first project doesn't work. I eliminated typing errors by using the code provided on the CD, and it still doesn't work.There does not appear to be an errata website.Many items seem glossed over without any explanation given as to what they do.Given the price I paid ($65), and the name of the book, I would have expected more breadth, rather than a straight shot at building a FPS game. Running the final version of the end product, it is bad enough that I am now questioning the $150 that I spent on TGE. The physics of the vehicle are so poor, that it frequently gets into oscillation or total rollover on the smallest of obstacles, for example.I can't imagine using this tome to attempt to learn TGE.

It's not a learning tool, most of the chapters focus on following directions with no real explanation why.

The book provides fairly small, two page descriptions of each personality type, briefly detailing the traits. A good deal of information is stored in the two-page synopsis, but there is no functional analysis of the types, so look elsewhere for deeper textbook-style reading. I also found that people tested for the first time reacted well to the short and descriptive type-models, and were interested in learning more after being \\"primed\\" with the information in this book. A good aid for counselors aiming to deepen initial interest and active participation in self-discovery with patients.This book is not a reference for psychologists, but is well worth the small price for its unique and easily digestible type descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive description; fun to read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this review.

The tone , color of the orchestra and the raw emotion and imagination that Chailly evokes from the players is unmatchable. There are however some questionable solos, particularly in the 5th that were sloppy, and the tempos in the 6th were very constrained and needed more movement. But overall Chailly is a master, and he brought the 8th to my attention like no other conductor out there. Please give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This is probably the best cycle available. While the close competitor Bernstein is valuable for his insight and pioneering work reviving Mahler his recordings are inconsistent a bit due to varying orchestras, from top notch to ok. Here Chailly is conducting the Concertgebow, recently (last year?) voted the best orchestra in the world (thats right, VPO)! And it is outstanding and consistent in quality. Remarkable details are coming out.

I find him too fake, and overtly pompous...a man born for the studio. (Similar to Solti's and Rattle's Mahler.)The playing is quite consummate and the sonics are great but the interpretations offer nothing new to me. (Except No. 4, which is actually the best version I've heard in long time.)Invest your money in a classic set, like Kubelik's or Bernstein's Sony cycle, or if you want a modern digital set, go for Neumann's Mahler with the Czech Phil, or the splendid Koln versions with Gary Bertini on EMI."},{"rating":"2","title":"World's best peeler, but made in China","review":"It's really a matter of pride.

The reader is drawn in to her, admittedly warped, perspective and self-awareness (especially if the reader has ANY quirks of his or her own). One can only admire the creativity and variety of her obsessions and her attempts to fulfill and/or override them. A virtue of the recitation is her sympathetic treatment of her family's loving, persistent and exasperated efforts to deal with her and their stubborn refusal to surrender her to her craziness.

This has been perfect for that! It's been 2 months, and I've had many days where I'll take this little thing out, turn on the TV, and just go. When I'm done 30 minutes later, I'll put it away in my closet easily. I've even added some 5 lbs. dumbbells for assistance.I will totally acknowledge that......if you're looking for a vigorous workout, this won't do it....if you're looking for all-inclusive sports equipment, this isn't it....if you're looking for something that'll count your calories or time for you, this won't do it.

In an attempt to get me to start exercising more and to regain some leg strength after several spinal surgeries the past few years, my mother-in-law bought a Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL for me. For the first time in years, I'm now exercising. It's hard not to exercise when my wife puts the machine right in front of the chair that I watch TV in. So much for excuses.For the price, the machine gives a nice workout. The pedaling resistance can be adjusted with the screw on top; I'm using a medium setting. The pedaling is a little jerky, certainly not as smooth as with our much more expensive stationary bike, but it's acceptable, and I got used to it pretty quickly.I'm not using the pedal straps. They can be removed, but I just let the pedals flip over with the straps hanging down.If you're a couch potato like me, and you just can't get into exercising, this machine may be perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This is a very sturdy product.

The pedals need to be made higher off the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"I read the reviews of this stationary bike and bought despite knowing that minor mechanical problems were common, but I'm fairly handy and previous reviewers provided tips on how to fix the small problems. My bike, however, was so badly made that it simply wasn't repairable. The wholes for the bolts were so poorly drilled that two feet were 1/2 inch off the floor. I will not purchase anything else from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for physical therapy after knee surgery","review":"I had repair surgery on a knee that I had replaced and did not have the range of motion because of poor PT and my thoughts went to my past to the memory of this portable cycle that I can go to many times a day to make sure the knee does not tighen up,I pick it and take it with me when I travel.

I should have heeded the concerns as expressed by previous buyers of this product from Amazon. Positives: the Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL is cheap and assembly instructions are clear and easy. Negatives: it produces an unbearably loud squeek when in operation and it won't stay in one place. Regardless of the surface, the vinyl leg caps twisted around and the cycle crept forward as I pedaled. Fortunately Amazon has a no-fuss return policy so I packed it up and returned it the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I purchased one of these and within a week the pedal mechanism had fallen apart. I shipped it back for a replacement, which just had a pedal snap off entirely, with not a lot of high-effort workout involved. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Guy!","review":"I needed something for general low-back & hip joint exercise with some calorie burning, but not so forceful as to irritate a pinched pelvic nerve I was trying to rehab. This little guy is just right for my purpose. It's sturdy and can be used either sitting or semi-reclining. The tension adjustment is limited because of the simple design so if you want a really forceful workout you'll have to move up to one of the more expensive heavy-duty cycles. According to the book \\"Move a Little, Lose a Lot\\", light workouts can be just as effective as heavy ones, you just have to extend the amount of time to get the benefit. Easy to do with this mini-cycle. I was surprised how my hip, knee and ankle joints have really been strengthened in a relatively short time. Can be used for the upper back & arms as well. (Sometimes I secure an exercise rope underneath the base and work my arms as I cycle). Overall Very pleased. Amazon had the best deal on it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, would have rather paid more for higher quality","review":"Pros:- It has 2 pedals, and if you exert force they will turnCons:- Too tall for many desks- Jerky feedback, very inconsistent pressure, sticky even- Does not \\"feel\\" like a bike or elliptical at all...feels gimmicky and cheapSpend more $ and buy a better unit. This one is pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I've recently had surgery on both knees and needed wanted a cycle that I could use at my desk. It does it hot when you cycle fast or for a long time, but that's what I needed. Thirty (30) minutes of cycling and my knees felt better, although I had to stretch afterwards. It gives my knees a decent workout.The one thing I wished it had are better floor grips. The cycle floor grips roll over sometimes when cycling fast or when the tension is increased to its highest level. They should have been built into the cycle instead of grips that can be removed.Overall, it works for what I need and what my doctor recommended (using a cycle for my knees so as to have a no impact solution)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a dangerous item","review":"I purchased this item because I have a permanent back injury from a car accident, and it makes it very hard for me to exercise regularly, so I thought this would be just the thing for me.I used it for only 15 minutes, with the tension turned up, and when I went to pull my foot out of the strap, I was VERY badly burned. The entire inside of my foot has a nasty burn on it, and when I checked the unit, the pedals and the central unit where you adjust the tension were all scalding hot. After more than 45 minutes, they are still hot to the touch.If you are planning to use this item with any tension at all, do not choose this one, this is a VERY DANGEROUS piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Design","review":"If you like to pedal with NO resistance, this works fine. If you try to add resistance the pedals stick. You can force the pedals, but then the unit will become hot, smell bad and squeal. The rubber pads on the bottom will NOT hold the unit in place while you work out.The little gadget on the front? It's a poorly designed timer, that's all. Press quickly to toggle start/stop or hold for FOUR seconds to reset. No worries though: It won't stay attached very long.There is NOTHING good about this product. You'd burn more calories raising your chair up a little and swinging your feet back and forth. This is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for Arm Exercise","review":"This is a good idea, but overall it is difficult to use. You need to prop the cycle against a wall to keep it from sliding (the rubber feet do not hold). Also, you cannot maintain a cycling pattern, as it has a herky-jerky movement from the start; you keep having to stop and start in a futile attempt to get up to a consistent speed. It also overheats within a few minutes (you can burn your hand if you grab it at this point). The only viable use is to place the cycle on a table and use it for arm exercise.

Furthermore, the use for arms was even more unsatisfactory, in my husband's and my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minnesota peddler","review":"This InStride Cycle is very good and both my husband and I use it. The one thing we have trouble with is how it moves as you peddle. I have a rubberized mat under it which helps, but it still moves. However, this exerciser is good for a 90 year old.

This would be no big deal if the stoppers on the end of each pole didn't come off constantly regardless of whether it was against a wall (I have half a mind to hot glue them). Also, the bike doesn't really have any way to increase or decrease the intensity of the pedaling. I think the T-bolt at the top is meant to do that, but it doesn't. Lastly, when you use the cycle for about ten minutes, the metal rods that hold the pedals get scorching hot. There is a warning on it that says (CAUTION - HOT SURFACE) but it seems to me like a major design flaw.

When I say hot, I mean it can burn you.

Sorry, I rarely write negative reviews but this is just a pile of junk.

It's very awkward to use because the pedal straps are hard to slip on right, and if you tighten up the tension control to get a good workout the motion becomes sticky and it doesn't operate smoothly. I found it annoying. There doesn't appear to be any sort of gear mechanism involved so it feels rough and also the base slips easily. Essentially it's a good idea, but it doesn't function well. I found nothing about it that was worth the money. I tossed it aside a few days after getting it and haven't used it in months. Get one of the highly rated mini steppers instead.

This will give you a headache, and I'm not prone to headaches, in just about 15 seconds flat. This made the pair I received absolutely unusable. Obviously, quality control is lacking as there is no way that anyone could have passed these if they had looked through them.The image through each of the sides separately was acceptable, although no better than the much heavier and older (as in WWII old), but still serviceable, binoculars I've had for decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oozing with class and character","review":"I thought about this for a long time and as it turns out it is really very simple.

It is a good story that everyone in the family can watch and enjoy. It is remarkable that it is it was made in an era for movies that is long gone and still very satisfying to watch. It is the story of Bernadette who is a young woman all alone in that she can see the Virgin Mother where as everyone in her family and community cannot, they still can feel her presense and benefit from her miracles yet they still cannot be supportive of the girl and plot to have her committed or jailed along with her family, she is honest and faithful to the lady and she is rewarded at the end.

It made my wife cry with happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Religious Movie","review":"I bought the video of \\"Song of Bernadette\\" about 15 yearsago.

Bernadette Soubirous reportedly saw the vision of MARY in a grotto in Lourdes, France while collecting water in 1858. Never guilty of superficiality, this movie is beautifully lit and the acting is genuinely inspired. The Virgin Mary is seen played by a very young Linda Darnell. Jennifer Jones so impressed the Academy with her performance (her film debut) that she garnered the Oscar; Charles Bickford is excellent in his playing of the Dean and the now nearly forgotten Harry King directed the film with masterly and exquisite expertise; his films are rarely revived today, yet he should be remembered for his masterpiece:\\"To those who do not believe, no explaination is possible,- To those who believe, no explaination is neccesary\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What do you know of suffering?\\"","review":"Simply put -- it is impossible for Hollywood to make a film like this one today.

For being an everlasting waste of time, and not even getting the complete basics right in being a film about a French peasant girl, I can't give this more than 1/10.

The costuming section of the book was quite comprehensive. I can not reccomend this book highly enough, though I finished it wanting so much more.

This meant a great deal in the way of SFX that would not have been possible even a very few years ago. The second disk of the DVD set handles that subject very nicely, but there's also the more traditional part of behind-the-scenes, which is the design, costuming, prop-making, and makeup art of the picture. This volume is a very nice collection of drawings, matte paintings, models, and other art work, from early concepts to final choices.

I was tremendously excited to find this book, as I have long been John Howe's greatest fan of Tolkien art and this faithfully renders many of his conceptions to life (ah...the balrog...*shudder*). In my opinion the movie's greatest strengths lie in its visual cinematics (utilizing New Zealand and the expertise of talented artists like Lee and Howe) but this book allows you to enjoy delving into Tolkien's Middle-Earth without encountering the infidelity to the original text that has emerged in the film.

I was told that I needed smaller breast shield for the nipple size, but this breast shield wasn't even large enough to fit around my breast. I have absolutely no suction with this product. Whoever created the sizes was clearly a man because they corresponded the size of the inner whole for nipple with the size of the shield. The smaller the breast, the smaller the nipple. The larger the breast, the larger the nipple. Not necessarily the case. I bought the small, medium, large, and extra large breastshield and none of them fit correctly.

Unfortunately, the 21mm is only SLIGHTLY smaller than the medium and barely made a difference at all. The only thing that I do notice is less leaking from my right side. My breasts still rub against the side of the shield--wishing Medela made an XS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stand alone product","review":"I completely did not realize that I would not be able to use this product without also buying the connectors. The breastshields that I had were all one piece, so I expected that these would be as well. When they arrived, I realized I could not use them without purchasing another product, so I went ahead and tried the medium sized breast shields that I had. It turned out that they fit just fine, even though the images on the box had suggested otherwise.

They just don't stock them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit to adapter","review":"I think the tunnel diameter is a good fit for my nipple, but the shield is very small (not meant for large breasts, I suppose) and the tunnel LENGHT is ridiculously small. It hardly stays on the adapter. The adapter w/milk receptacle falls off if you don't stay still. I tend to shift positions, or reach for a magazine while pumping. I'm going back to the mediums."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more comfortable!","review":"Pumping with this size breastshield is so much more comfy than using the 24mm that come with the Medela pumps. I have large nursing boobs (size 36 DDD) and I followed the reviews I had read online that the larger breastshields were more comfortable for women with larger breasts. However, the 27mm shields ended up making my nipples very sore and they felt like they pinched when I pumped. I actually started to bleed, but was so novice at the time, I had no idea that pumping could actually be comfortable. Now that I have the small size, I enjoy pumping almost as much as nursing my 5 week old baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are thinking about a smaller size...","review":"Go for it!!!When I bought my Medela PIS advanced it came with the medium size breast shield. Using that size caused a ring around my breast and soreness. Pumping was very painful and milk would leak out of the sides of the shield.So I took a chance and went down a size to the 21 mm shield. It was an great investment! I get more milk now and it doesn't hurt at all. A lactation consultant over the phone told me most women need to go up a size and I probably needed to get the large size too. She was way wrong. The smaller size fits better.If you aren't fitting correctly then try this size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I think it is definitely worth getting the proper size shield if you use the pump often.

Like many people said, I wish there was even a smaller size, but this is still an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"breast shield","review":"Not as pictured. The neck of shield is really short.

I had already been pumping for several months when I purchased these. My lactation consultant had told me to try larger shields, what a mistake.

(I gave it 5 stars for fun because it is listed as a toy, but really just 5 stars overall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try 24mm for awhile before buying these!","review":"I bought the Medela pump and on the first day of use felt pain and discomfort while pumping. I thought I am using the wrong size breastshield and I ordered these the same day. It took almost one week for the product to arrive and by then I kept feeling better everyday with the 24 mm shields. I didnt notice an increase in supply or improved comfort with these 21 mm shields. I just needed to get used to the pump.

Remarque was in the habit of completely rewriting his manuscripts several times over; this is how most of his books evolved. At his death several manuscript versions of \\"Shadows in Paradise\\" existed, but the last one was unfinished, ending halfway in chapter 21. His widow, Paulette Goddard-Remarque and the German publisher Droemer-Knaur tried to make a fast dollar and deliberately chose one of the older manuscript versions for publication.Marc W. Kuester studied the manuscripts from the author's estate and was able to provide evidence that the published version had been discarded by Remarque and that he was rewriting the novel with a new concept when he died.

Plot, violence, tenderness, action, it all seems quite balanced in this one, and the ending is something I never even saw coming, and was a wee bit angry at for a split-second, yet after thinking on it, I really could accept it. Overall, quite enjoyable and involving, my favorite Miike to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Miike Classic!","review":"This film was made by Takashi Miike, one of Japan's newest avant-garde directors (also known for using enormous amounts of violence and gore in his films). This film is one of his tamer offerings, and pays homage to the classic noir and Hong Kong action films. The story is about Mario, a Japanese-Brazilian immigrant and his Chinese girlfriend Kei, who become involved with a heist only end up with a shipment of cocaine instead of cash. The two have to escape the country while evading the Yakuza and Chinese gangs seeking the stolen drugs. The film is rather unique with its perspective of multicultural Japan and Miike's trademark craziness featuring midgets brushing their teeth with cocaine, a hilarious Matrix spoof using cockfighting and death by ping pong."},{"rating":"1","title":"When good directors make bad movies","review":"I caught this movie on cable after seeing \\"Audition\\" (which I liked) in the theatre. That Miike is a gifted director, pipin- full of potential, there can be no doubt. Nice sets, nice camera-work, nice techinical work. But there can also be no doubt that this movie is so full of hookum as to make the ghosts of Japanese screenwriters past weep. As eye candy, the movie does have a certain charm. As anything else, pass. The characters are set pieces with dialogue; the plot has the clairity of pea soup. The only reason I gave it two stars is that any Japanese movie featuring a Brazillian element offers interest, sociologically speaking. I'm curious to see if there will be more entries into the Japanese-Brazillian catagory, given the current state of Japanese immigration.My advice: Go rent (or buy) \\"Tears of the Black Tiger.\\" It's Thai, not Japanese, but that (gory) action movie has the heart that this movie lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"People in this world, we have no place to go...\\"","review":"At the risk of sounding very pretentious, I think that some of the negative reviews miss the point of the film. First of all, I agree that the action sequences are excellent, but there is another dimension here. This is not a conventional action movie; it is about desperate, lonely people looking for a sense of place. They behave so recklessly not because of courage but out of desperation. Even Fushimi, one of the only main characters who is not an expatriate, is tortured by a sense of Japan's waning nationalism. Overall, I think it's an outstanding movie: stylish, smart and not entirely without depth. And the 'play ping-pong?' scene surely deserves a place in the modern cinema pantheon along with the laser scene in 'Goldfinger.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Miike's Best","review":"Don't bother with this piece of trash. At least rent before you buy. I'm a great fan of Director Miike's work, but he makes so many films that some just turn out to be garbage.If you want to see some good Miike films see Ichi the Killer (if you can stomach it), Audition, Dead or Alive, The Happiness of the Katakuris (my favorite heart-warming, zombie, musical comedy!), Visitor Q (very, very odd and perverse), even Fudo ... anything but this one!I'm surprised this movie has recieved so many rave reviews on this site. I mean no offence to other reviewers, but my humble opinion is don't take this movie as an example of Miike's best work. Read a review anywhere else and you'll see what I mean.The Matrix - style cockfight scene is very funny, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"City of Lost Souls","review":"I just picked up this movie today and it took everything that I could muster not to pull it out of the DVD player. I am a big fan of Japanese and Chinese blood operas but this movie is truly horrible. The acting was horrid. The only reason that I gave the movie 2 stars is because the movie had a decent story line. I recomend spending your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violently Expressed Love...","review":"City of Lost Children is a Japanese contemporary version of Bonnie and Clyde. Kei is about to be deported, but her boyfriend Mario steps in between the law and rescues her in order for them to set sail for freedom. In order to reach freedom they need to buy a couple of very expensive tickets through a crook who has specialized in helping criminals leave the country. Thus, Kei and Mario attempt to rob the mafia in order to get the money for the trip. However, somehow they end up with the Yakuza's cocaine instead and they have to run from the law as well as the crime element. City of Lost Souls is a changing story that jumps everywhere and at times does not make sense at all. Nevertheless, the cinematography is magnificent, which adds some spice to the overall experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Ounce of Romance","review":"This is a dated romance novel if ever I read one. I kept reading it just to see how much worse it would get. Bartram Kingman is the 'hero' and Regan, his cousin, is the heroine. What did she do to deserve falling in love with him?When she hears he is going to visit Regan envisions a nerdy fellow (if only that had been the case). Instead she gets a bossy jerk of a cousin. Of course, there is the attraction. But he is a physically abusive man, putting her in her place by--for example, choking her with his bare hands in the middle of an arguement to the point where the room was gaining a red haze for her.Oh yup. I normally get a kick out of the various dated things in these older novels (the smoking, the clothing desrciptions, etc) This was one jaw dropping moment after another. Definately ripe for some feminist literature paper.

Black Sabbath were very uneven in general and in particular during the Ozzy years, so for the less dedicated fan some \\"best of\\" album would be all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The masterminds of heavy metal","review":"This album is my favorite album by black sabbath even though their self titled paranoid and vol 4 are great too i love the instrumentals on this album also tony iommi is a great influence and great guitar player he is a legend and amazing for having the tips of his fingers from his fretting hand cut off also he is the innovater of tuning down to relieve his fingers from bleeding anyways this album is heavy and amazing and i suggest it to anybody that loves heavy metal not just iommi is great but the whole band is great geezer butler is awesome he pounds out bass lines and he knows how to rock i think he is one of the greatest bass players ever bill ward is a great drummer and of course ozzy is great on vocals"},{"rating":"2","title":"The heaviest Sabbath album","review":"This is definitely Sabbath's heaviest album with Ozzy, containing such tracks as \\"Into the Void\\", \\"Lord of This World\\", and that masterpiece \\"After Forever\\". This is definitely one of the best of the 6 magical Sabbath albums. While this one has 2 acoustic interludes, they arent fillers, those 2 tracks are great. This has been called Sabbath's heaviest album, and for good reason. The bass is so loud and heavy on this album that you can almost hear it over Tony's electrifying guitar. The lyrics of this album are among Sabbath's best, \\"After Forever\\" would have to end any speculation of them being satan worshippers. While this album is better than the Self-titled and \\"Paranoid\\", it is still not the best. This album is a mix of \\"Paranoid\\" and the next album \\"Vol.4\\", but it is an extremely great album that is worth listening to, because you will spend hours listening to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece of reality","review":"\\"Children of the Grave\\" is just one reason to love Sabbath.The songwriting improved greatly and the band cranks 'em out and leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"1971 What A Year For Concerts!","review":"I had Master of Reality when it was an Album (also 8-track).

Their 1970 self-titled debut is a classic, and I listen to it every day. This album, however is even better. In fact, it's THE best Sabbath album. The best song here is Children of the Grave. Other great songs include Solitude, Into The Void, and Sweet Leaf. I also beleve this album started Stoner Rock. If you listen to Sweet Leaf, you'll know what I mean. All the songs rock, but the above mentioned are my favorites.Ratings:1. Sweet Leaf 5/52. After Forever 5/53. Embryo [Instrumental] 4/54. Children of the Grave 55/55. Orchid [Instrumental] 4/56.

I own 4 albums of 'Black Sabbath': Master of Reality, Heaven And Hell, Mob Rules and Dehumanizer. I like them all, except for Master of Reality.

On those albums sings my favorite singer called Ronnie James Dio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, wrong title","review":"This album has nothing to do with \\"reality\\" unless you are some psycho that lives in a cemetary.Besides that, the lyrics speak for themselves. You can actually understand the vocals in this album, so be prepared. They are gruesome.The best time to listen is perhaps on a Full Moon, but that doesn't happen too often [about once a month]. No doubt some of it was written then though...The songs are a collection of howling and guitar screams that resemble the madness of this band. This is truely a fall into the depths of madness... This album should be considered as the anthem for the dead....My favorite song is naturally the first one [titled SWEET LEAF].From there we scream and wiggle our way through 6 more, eventually listening to the last [titled aptly-- INTO THE VOID].From there you return to a real reality [and out of that void] into the living world, so cherish it.For now........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered????????","review":"This is my favorite Black Sabbath album, but I am sorely disappointed with this \\"remaster\\".

It continues the magic touch of Paranoid, unlike the other albums. Songs like \\"Into the Void\\" and \\"Children of the Grave\\" are some of Sabbath's greatest numbers. Also there is a lot of experimentation, especially in songs like \\"Solitude\\" and \\"Orchid\\"...which shows Sabbath's creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord and Master","review":"This is the heaviest Christian Rock album I've ever heard-- songs of redemption, perhaps tunes of contrition for the earlier Satanic-laced jams on their first album (their best). Nevertheless, the riffs are heavy and memorable. \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and \\"Children of the Grave\\" are great, drug-induced and free of preaching. By the time of this third album, Sabbath had clearly defined their sound-- psychedelic blues was long-gone; Ozzy's nasal whine & Iommi's top volume riffing had only begun (just wished it lasted longer than a few more albums)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterful continuation of Sabbath's perfection","review":"I feel ashamed to review any Sabbath from the first through Sabotage. How can I comment on perfection? This is just as good as Black Sabbath, though not nearly as good as Paranoid. No more commentary is necessary, except to say if you're a true Sabbath fan who loves heavy meatl--BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Void","review":"This is a great album, it's one that I grew up on as well. Listening to Sweet Leaf did not make me want to smoke pot nor do I love Pot after having tried it a couple of times as a dumb kid. With that being said this is definitely classic Sabbath and maybe a bit more overlooked than Paranoid but in my book better. Why? I have heard Paranoid, War Pigs and Iron Man a million times on the radio and I'm tired of these overplayed songs. Master of Reality doesn't get that kind of attention and it still sounds like great classic Sabbath. Into the Void is my favorite track with some truly cool riffs and for all of you knotheads who think Black Sabbath is some sort of Satanic band, listen to the lyrics of Into the Void, you'll find quite the opposite is true.Classic Sabbath. How can you go wrong by buying this album? 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iconic 70s rockers in great form","review":"Ozzy and company score some major points here, especially on the pro-marijuana anthem \\"Sweet Leaf,\\" and also on \\"Children of the Grave,\\" which sounds like the title of a zombie flick, but seems to be about Sabbath's young, socially disrespected fans. These iconic 70s rockers, without whom grunge, as well as many of today's heaviest rockers, would have been unthinkable, are in great form on this, one of their definitive records."},{"rating":"2","title":"least favourite of the sabbath albums","review":"master of reality was the first black sabbath with ozzy that I heard (on vinyl in the early 80s). i had previously digested black sabbath with dio and really liked it.i loved master of reality from the very start. but over time, i grew to like sbs and sabotage much more. the music here is dull and one-dimensional. the riffs are gloomy and uninspiring (compare it to wheels of confusion on volume 4). i'll get a kick out of sweet leaf from time to time, but children of the grave, lord of this world, etc. are silly, stupid songs. why this is a double platinum seller i will never know.then again, heavy metal bands like metallica sound exactly like the \\"master of reality\\" sound. its just rehashed black sabbath, circa 1971. so the album has tremendous influence, that's why i rate it a four, not three. it is a classic, but i prefer the later sabbath albums (ie. sbs and sabotage, the latter being my favourite)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD~!!!!","review":"This CD rocks!!! When I first put this in I didn't expect it to be to good, but once I heard the first song on the album \\"Sweet Leaf\\" I knew this CD was gonna kick!! This is considered to be Black Sabbath's greatest accomplishment and I can see why. The best songs on here are \\"Sweet Leaf,\\" \\"Children Of The Grave,\\" \\"Lord Of This World,\\" and \\"After Forever.\\" The only things I don't like are this album was way to short only like 34 minutes. I also didn't care for 2 of the 8 tracks being instrumentals. Also \\"Into the Void\\" is a cool track. If your a Sabbath or heavy metal fan, buy this album!! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Life Changer!","review":"This is the album that, without question, completely sold me on Black Sabbath. I'm not sure what did it, but I remember a rush of excitement the first time I heard the crushing riffs and Ozzy's tinny vocals on \\"Sweet Leaf,\\" and my outlook on music hasn't been the same since. For a long time, this was my favorite Sabbath effort, and it remains a genre classic that rarely gets the radio play it so obviously deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album. way overpriced.","review":"Yes, I know this is an import. But, I can't understand why someone thinks that we should pay double the price for a second disc of demos and outtakes. There's a reason this stuff never made the disc in the first place: the quality level is not anywhere near as high. These extra tracks should be thrown in for next to nothing, because they are rarely worth more than that. Such is the case here. This is a superb Sabbath record, but the price is far too high for this \\"deluxe\\" version. Stick with the original single disc, or look for this on Ebay at a much lower price.

The range is ok -- it works in the yard for the most part, and a tiny bit at the neighbors houses. It is a little on the bulky side. After two years, the battery is completely shot, and it just started not working well when plugged in either. You can't turn off the pet sensor from the remote unit, just the one in the baby's room. The motion alarm is very loud and annoying. This is no good for young kids not in cribs who may get out of bed occasionally. The unit now loses its connection and starts beeping loudly frequently throughout the night. In the past it only did that occasionally.

This \\"eye\\" on the transmitter (the one you put near the baby) picks up any movements that happen within a particular area and it sets off an alarm & the light starts flashing on the receiver (the one the adult keeps near them) so you know to check on the baby. This feature alone is better than the Sony (trust me their monitor is not as good as their electronics) or the First Years 2.4ghz monitors (this 900MHz is crystal clear) that really have no other useful features but cost just as much or more.

Unfortunately, it began malfunctioning just after the warranty expired, sounding odd alarms in the middle of the night. What started as a once or twice a night occurrence quickly degenerated into 20 or 30 wakeups a night. Oddly enough, no problems ever during the day. (I eventually found that the electric blanket seemed to be contributing to the problem, but even with that off, we continued to get hourly wakeup calls.) After several frustrating weeks of unplugging every appliance we could think of in turn to prevent interference, we bought another monitor. The sound isn't as clear, but no more nighttime wakeups!

If interested in this monitor, I'd just buy the basic version and save $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Baby Monitor","review":"My husband and I originally wanted a video monitor, but decided to go with this monitor since our son's room was only next door.

I wrote to Evenflo and they said I must have a faulty parent unit. They were vary nice and sent me a new one right away. It malfunctioned the first night!!! The clarity is incredible when you first use it. So much so that we actualy had to turn on a sound machine in our daughter's room so we didn't hear every breath she took, but the alarm (NOT THE PET DETECTION SENSOR, THEY ARE DIFFERENT SOUNDS!) goes off for no reason, sometimes 6 times a night.

The pet detection feature worked very well and also alerted me when one of my six year old twins was near the baby! However, the parent unit would start beeping that it was out of range numerous times every day. We have a small home (1100 sq ft, two story) and tried many locations for both units with the same result. Three days of running downstairs at all times to reset the parent unit was enough! I called Evenflo since the beep was somewhat different than what was described in the manual for the out of range signal (but also different from the pet detection signal and happened with the pet detection feature off as well) and they could not explain it, so this unit went back to the store. The pet detection feature is a great idea, but they need to improve the range on this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor is a huge disappointment","review":"The evenflo Whisper connect Sensa....what a piece of junk.

The translators have taken the liberty to change all references to males and made them gender inclusive. For example \\"brothers\\" is \\"brothers and sisters\\"; \\"mankind\\" is \\"humankind\\". God did not create \\"man\\" in this Bible (Genesis 1.27), He created \\"humankind\\". They do footnote these \\"politically correct\\" changes with the actual original translations, but the text does not follow the original.It's a sad note when even the Holy Bible has to be subjected to this modern censorship by the \\"politically correct\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heretical","review":"This bible as far as the commentary goes should be considered heretical. For instance the commentator of the book of Esther considers the book three seperate tales combined to make historical points but cannot be proved to be historically true. So far this has made me uncomfortable with this Bible being one of my main sources of study. Although this Bible seems to be very scholarly in its content reaserched seemingly thoroghly, giving good information. It seems that the contributors are attempting to undermine divine inspiration of the Bible. This study Bible must be used always with other study Bibles sound in its doctrine."},{"rating":"1","title":"God is a Diety","review":"This is a Bible for people who believe that God is a Diety (He is often referred to in that manner); Jesus?

The translation is acceptable, but questions whether prophecy actually occurred/occurs. It seems to condone homosexual activities as opposed to other sexual immorality. Scientific research of other cultures is quite in-depth, but comments on other sciences are misleading and incorrect or outright fabrication."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment.","review":"I bought this book for my first trip to Amsterdam. The basic info is sound but there were some problems. The most annoying is that key parts of maps end up in the middle (binding) making them difficult to read. The restaurant reviews were in inaccurate and left the reader wondering whether anyone from Frommers had been in the restaurant. In summary the book is OK but there are better ones on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinner","review":"Stephen King's book Thinner was very intriguing. The fact that Stephen King's style of writing is so absorbing helped keep my attention throughout the whole book. This book is about a middle-aged, overweight lawyer who hits a gypsy woman in his car. To get back at him the gypsy woman's father puts a curse on him, which causes him to loose a massive amount of weight in a short period of time. Stephen King's imagery is so amazing, the way he describes his characters and the setting leaves nothing to the imagination.Although, the beginning was a little slow and drawn out the rest of the book more then made up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"When Billy Halleck kills an old woman, he doesn't know what he is in for. Overweight, he suddenly begins to loswe weight. Hey this is great, or so he thinks. When the weight loss continues he suddenly becomes worried. With no medical explanation, what else can it be but a gypsy curse. How ridiculous. This is by far the worst book that I have ever listened to by Richard Bachman. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because we all know that Richard Bachman is a pseudonym for Stephen King.Folks, if your going to read something by this author, safe this one till last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring says it all","review":"This book was boring. Most of it concerned the main character chasing an old gypsy through New England so he could take a curse away. The only interesting character was the mobster. Anyone could predict the ending fifty pages before.I am a big Stephen King fan and 'Richard Bachman' and this has to be his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown.","review":"This book was intresting and suspenseful, for the most part atleast. I thought that the characters in it were intresting (with the exception of Genilli...it's so refreshing when writers stay away from racial stereotypes), that it was fairly well writen, and the story was reasonably compelling. The problem with the book is the ending. The ending was a complete letdown. The problem is, and I don't want to give away anything here, that you can't empathise with the main character's decision in any way. The movie isn't very good either, though I did like that the decision that he made at the end made a bit more sense. Anyways, I say that you read through the book, get to about the end, and make up your own ending. It'll be far more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's Worst","review":"This story by Stephen King is terrible. It's about a fat guy who is cursed to lose weight until he dies because he killed a gypsy. The whole book the guy just tries to blame other people and not take responsibility. In fact, there isn't one likeable character in this book and the only interesting one is a gangster named Ginelli. In conclusion, don't read this book just find any other one by King because they are all better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"1-dimensional","review":"King's own words describe his prose as a literary equivalent of McDonald cheeseburger with French fries and ketchup. Snip: (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Debacle of Debacles...","review":"Your head will spin when you read Thinner...from nausea. Thinner truly degenerated after a few pages into a twisted, sordid, very pathetic \\"tale\\" that seemed to refute the cliche \\"Once you've hit the bottom, there's no place to go but up\\". Well, Thinner seemed to be determined to bore a hole into the bedrock and drill to China. When I thought it could not get any worse, Stephen King proved me wrong.

It was slow and there was really no plot. Did not like it. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This books was so boring.

Save your money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Literature","review":"I read this when I had broken my leg and I must say I was not that impressed. The ending with him leaving the cherry pie where his wife and daughter could get at it was unmotivated. I don't understand why the character wanted his wife to catch his curse. Also, I had just read \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" before this and it made it clear why this is not literature. There was no concentration or density to the writing. It did not look like he broke a sweat to write it. Also, since this was a Richard Bachman book originally, it was trite how he had Backman refer to a \\"Stephen King\\" book. This is a book that should have stayed in the drawer. Also, it was apparent that he didn't research much about the Gypsies. The supposed Romany language was actually another language, I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trite romp through the mind of a tired horror writer.","review":"Thinner seems to be descriptive of more than just the lead character in this book. The plot, and subtext are also afflicted with this gypsy's curse. While King's usual writing style leans heavily on sudden graphic detail, Thinner is based primarily on screenplay melodrama.I believe this book to be much like the filler in a good cigar, all substance and no flavor.Stay away from lame curses, and stick to angry cats and Randall Flagg's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not King's best, but still pretty good.","review":"This was an interesting read. It's a short novel (320 pages), so it's pretty much to the point, with none of the usual Stephen King diarrhea of the mouth thing going on here. No useless details, which made it so much better than most of his novels. There are plenty of interesting characters here, too. For example, the creepy, old, wife-grouping judge Cary Rossington (who also gets cursed by the gypsiies) and Rick Ginelli (aka the \\"whiteman's curse\\"), a brutal mob boss, who gets more than he bargained for when he attacks the gypsies.This is a pretty good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinner","review":"Thinner was a very suspensfull, and thrilling book to read. It kept me at the edge of my seat, and always wanting more. This book is about a man, Billy Halleck, who gets cursed by a gypsy man, for killing the gypsies wife. The gypsy also manages to curse some other main chacters in the town. I would recommend this book to anyone who has liked any mystery story, likes curses, or has enjoyed any of Stephen Kings' other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pretty bad.","review":"I really don't like this book very much because most of the book was spent trying to track down that freakin' gypsy. That guy was trying to do that through the entire book while he almost drove his family insane, and kept losing weight. I think he should have stayed with those research people. This also has a very odd ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst King Book Ever!","review":"I must say that Thinner was the worst Stephen King book ever. It has horrible characters, a dumb story, and does not hold your interest. It was so bad I never even bothered to finish it. This book was bad! For a good read read It, The Stand, or The Shining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still very good.","review":"This is a little different than most of Kings books. There is a lot less character development, it just jumps right into the story. Some people will probably like that, since some of his books take 300 pages for the action to start happening. It's a good book with a great ending. The movie is pretty good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking -- Shocking -- Shocking!","review":"This book is certainly interesting. It's an enjoyable tale about an overweight man who hits an old Gypsy woman while engaging in a sexual act with his wife. Then the woman's father curses him, making him lose weight until he's nearly a human skeleton. Although not one of King's best, this book enthralls the reader. The reader wants to know what will happen. The dialogue is believable and enjoyable (although some sexual dialogue was unnecessary) and the human emotion experienced is true to life. All in all, it is worth it to read this book for the shocking ending. And it truly is extremely surprising. I will not give it away, for that would ruin the joy, but the ending is saddening and mildly disappointing, although extremely satisfying. A recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Boring...","review":"At the beginning when the guy starts losing weight, that's kind of cool.

There is no originality whatsoever to this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic King","review":"This might not be King's best, and it's a fairly short story compared to some of his other works, but if you're a King fan, you should not be disappointed. I actually saw the movie first before reading this book, and it was nice to compare. Overall, compared to King's other works, this might be considered a 'light' read, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.It's interesting to see the reactions of Billy's family to his sudden weight loss, and I also liked the parts with the Gypsies. Part of me says Billy had it coming for what he did to the Gypsy, but part of me also cannot help but feel a bit bas for him. One lesson is clear - don't **** around with the Gypsies. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"great narrator","review":"The story was great (obviously, it's King) but I was blown away by Joe Mantegna's reading. I didn't know what to expect from him, he's a cool actor, but narrating an audiobook is a different sort of art. He nailed it. He did such a good job, I'd want to get something else he narrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Sure Popular Magazines Hate This Novel","review":"The novel, as the title and back flip suggest, is about a man losing weight. And as he loses his weight you can see his sanity and family ties go with it.The book is my favorite Bachman choice so far as it actually has an ending I didn't expect and I can usually pick out an ending a mile away. One thing I will always commend King for is his ability to make stories realistic. The story line is good and he gives his characters different takes on the situation which brings it together as a whole. The book reminds me of a Twilight Zone episode dragged out as the eeriness of a Rod Serling story can be seen on every page. Definitely a must read for Stephen King fans and it still remains a nice novel to pass the time with.4 stars because Bachman never seemed to pack that winning punch that allows me give out that rare 5th star. It and the Stand stand as a few King exceptions. Its a fun way to take some time off."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!!!!!","review":"THINNER IS BORING AND THE MOVIE IS EVEN WORSE, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON KING'S WORST BOOK TO DATE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total, utter debacle...","review":"Normally I applaud King's works, but Thinner was one of the most terrible books I have read in my life.

As such, this novel is more in the style of king than in the more raw style that I found in the other earlier Bachman books.Thinner is a great \\"revenge\\" novel. The story moves quickly and the main character's race against time keeps the pages turning at a fairly rapid pace. The nice thing about this one is that, in true King fashion, nobody is truly safe and almost everyone, in some way, truly deserves what they get in the end.I really did enjoy this one and, though it's not amongst King's very best, it's right there on the second tier. It's a fun book (and the movie follows the novel fairly accurately) that I'll most probably enjoy again someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book By King.","review":"I am a very big King fan, yet \\"Thinner\\" is a disappointment.The book starts off well but quickly goes down hill.

The story tends to repeat itself: looking back, I can't distinguish between the scenes where Billy's friend harrasses the gypsies, nor between the different towns and places Billy himself was chasing them through... The worst part for me though, was having a scene from \\"The Pet Semetary\\" recreated almost word to word: the husband trying to hide something from a wife that's coming slowly up the stairs, and stops at the last one when the husband finally finds the \\"magic words\\" that do the trick..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a reason to support book-burnings . . .","review":"Under normal circumstances, I would hail Stephen King as a great writer, at least within his own genre.

Readers who enjoy books that have empowered female characters, or who simply are not entertained by graphic rape scenes, will want to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off great . . .fizzled out fast","review":"I read the first four chapter on BEAN and thought . . .WOW! got the HB and about chapter six was wondering what had happened. Not nearly enough time is spent building up the characters. There's an abrupt and totally unexplained bit of 'elf soft porn' between Tinker and 'Windwolf', followed quickly by an almost rape by Tinkers friend and almost lover 'Nathen'. And it all happens simply because the author wanted it. NOT, as far as I can tell, out of any internal logic. The entire story seem to be like this, bits and pieces stuck together at random. A bit of fantasy here, some SF jargon there, a dash of soft-porn here, mix quickly with some mystery and half-bake for 340 pages.What a shame. This had the start of a great story. Instead it's a mish-mash of almost this and nearly that but not a complete story in the lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Against the odds","review":"Wen Spencer obviously loves a challenge. In Tinker he starts with an adolescent female protagonist who becomes involved with ELVES, for gosh sake, as Pittsburg shuttles back and forth between earth and \\"Elfhome.\\" Out of this mish-mash he has created a series of characters with enough depth so that I actually cared what happened to them. A deft plot with multiple twists and turns kept surprising me. I found this book to be a page turner. Normally, I read several books at once, but in this case, I read only Tinker until it was gone and then wanted more. If I were to quibble, I would say rent a room in Indianapolis or somewhere--the Pittsburg setting has limits (although that's clearly one of those self-imposed obstacles he overcomes.) If he really wants a challenge, why not start his next book with \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\" Overall, this is one of the better new authors, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I started Tinker and really enjoyed the world-building. But I found the story lagging a bit and the protagonist Tinker to be extremely annoying. Perhaps if Tink were older and more mature I could deal with this character. But a millionaire teenager who owns her own junkyard and whom adults all over go to for advice? It was just too much. Tinker was the ultimate Mary Sue. WAY too perfect. The romance between Tink and Windwolf also skeeved me out. Tink just seemed a little too immature for a serious relationship and Windwolf while a hunky guy to be sure, didn't seem the perfect mate for Tinker.2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, funny and simply very well written","review":"Intelligent, witty, romantic without being soppy and sexy without turning into cheap trash - a delight of a book to read if you like fantasy.

This book was a breath of fresh plot. Well, maybe the human-envies-elves bit has been done, but not like this. Being in a group of families whose kids are ready for college at age 12, I found the young protagonist, Tink, to be a strong female role model. The seduction of Tink by the elf - necessary (according to the story) to transform Tink into an immortal elf - is a bit awkward for younger readers, but overall this book is driven by character development and lots of action.

What else can I say? This was an amazing book. Wen Spencer combined the mundane with the fantastic, added in some science and humor, and created one of the best books I have read in a long time.

She's sarcastic, competant and vulnerable all at once, not an easy combination to either live or write. Wen captures her beautifully, as well as the elf she rescues and the other crazy characters that enter her life.I started \\"Tinker\\" with the idea that I would leisurely read my way through it and take my time.

It will work both ways: to take your blues away or to give you some.....all of my friends suggested a different song as their favourite. Give it a try. Sure worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Dave Mathews!","review":"When I entered 'Dave Mathews' in the Amazon Search Engine, this obscure however interesting title came up. Dave Mathews was on the credits and I though it would be a great gift to a friend who was a big Mathews fan. After waiting about a month for this DVD to arrive I viewed the DVD with my friend and it quickly became apparent that the Dave Mathews on the credits was definately not the more well known Dave Mathews (Dave Mathews Band. The returns policy indicates that since the DVD is out of the wrapping and there was nothing wrong with the DVD (appart from some conviently place 'DAVE MATHEWS' in bold on the front cover) then I would get a reduced refund. Combined with this the fact I live in Australia would mean the eventual refund would be 3/10 of bugger all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!!!!!","review":"I purchased a common ordinary stainless steel napkin holder for 5.99 at Walmart to accomplish this task.

Clearly, this person is seriously ill, deluded and very, very angry - this person is truly frightening. It's from minds like that that events like September 11 occur - evil in it's most evil form - this person hates and hates. I hope to God that this person will find compassion and grace and love.

Because of its failure to warm me or teach me or elevate me, I'd come to a parting of the ways with Christianity...but then I had nothing, no where to turn for answers to the questions which plague us all. Now, with new eyes and a refreshed spirit, I'm once again a spiritual warrior...and I thank Elaine Pagels for the push I needed. I'm deep into the study of Gnosticism now, but as a Gnostic there is no rule I must follow, or belief I must believe. I am free to wander where I will through my own knowing heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Profound","review":"I think most of the reviews are correct in their analysis of this book. I was expecting a lot more. I was very dissapointed that Elaine Pagels didnt deconstruct the Gnostic Gospels at a level on par with other historicist when analyzing the documents. It is absolutely rediculous to lump all of these Gospels together assuming they all form a ubiquitous worldview / belief. This is totally untrue. There is more diversity among these Gospels (say for instance between the Gospel of Thomas and Clement) than there is between modern Christian demominations. Some of these gospels veiw the actions of matter (i.e. sex) as an evil in this world which Pagels fails to condend or explain. Atleast Pagals does openly admit her biases.. and I think she deserves credit for this. Too many academics want to be portayed as 'objective', but I think we can all atest that untrue of everything in reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gnostic Gospels (Vintage)","review":"This is a misrepesentation of the Gospels. It should be noted that this is not a translation of the Gnostic Gospel.

The book discusses the text of the Gnostic Gospels only briefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for those who enjoy the subject","review":"If you enjoy the subject matter in this book then buy it. The book is very well written. The historical references are great and the dinamitic between religion and politics are very well represented. i find it an easy read.

The author focuses on the political and religious issues that divided orthodox christians and gnostics and thereby brings to light some intriguing issues. One doesn't have to agree with all of Pagel's religous standpoints to greatly benefit from her research and insight into gnosticism and the early church. She gives a good summary of the thought contained in the Nag Hammadi texts and exposes the reader to a great deal of various gnostic concepts. This book should be beneficial to any thinking Christian who wants to understand what gnosticism is and how it differs from orthodox thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent primer on the subject","review":"With all of the discussion around Gnosticism in popular culture, if you'd like to know a little bit more about what Gnosticism actually is from a more scholarly point of view, this is the book for you. It's a primer, and only a primer on the subject, and you will need further study to more fully debate the specifics or know the complete history. I would recommend one of the several compendia of Gnostic gospels out there, if you so desire more info. But, Pagels' book is a good starting place. And if all you need is to know what the big deal is, after an hour or two reading this book, you'll have a pretty good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"What a pleasure to read a well written and interesting scholarly book.

Not an easy or enjoyable read. Would not recommend youwaste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elaine Pagels Presents the Gnostic Gospels.","review":"Elaine Pagels does a fine job in presenting the reader with the historical context surrounding the discovery of the Gnostic Gospels, and the \\"intrigue\\" that resulted in the tracking down of some that were sold to collectors, as well as the 30 years it took to publish them in a translated form. She also does a fine job in giving the reader a fine sense of the historical context in which the Gnostic Gospels were written, and why they were \\"hushed\\" up by the Roman Catholic tradition. This is a fascinating book that any Christian should read, as one can get a new sense of who Jesus was, and why Christianity ended up being the way it is now, and how it could benefit more from these early traditions and rites of the early Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Introduction","review":"An added sight into the history of the time. It is sure to be quickly dismissed by the \\"chosen\\" just as it was by the orthodox of the past. Why are those faithful so unwilling to even open their minds to the fact that there is probably more to the story of their saviour. It's about their pride (I've seen that on a list os seven items somewhere *grin*) and not admitting the possible errors of the belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gnostic Gospels","review":"Well written and informative. Good explanation of the political intrigue of the early church."},{"rating":"2","title":"This explains a lot!","review":"I have always thought orthodox views on Christs teachings, while noble, seemed to be missing something. As always there are two sides to every story. Pagels shows us the other side and it makes sense now. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"When I purchased this book I was expecting to see an actual interpretation of the Gnostic Gospels not read a story. When I got The Gospel of Thomas some years ago that's what I got (the gospel in English) so when I saw this I was really excited to be able to read the rest of them. Unfortunately all I got was her giving me a history lesson. Yes she actually does quote the gospels throughout the book but in no way is this a book with the Gnostic gospels in it. I can't say I received nothing - I get something out of children's books when I read them - but what I came for I did not get. Reading Meyer's interpretation of The Gospel of Thomas and having to actually think about what the gospel said gave me much more insight into the real Jesus as well as expanding the inner me. This book in no way expanded my consciousness and that's what I bought it for. This was a huge disappointment. If you are expecting to actually get to read the gospels this is not the place to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Beginining to an Understanding of Early Christianity","review":"If you want a good, lucid, well-written overview of the beginnings of Christianity, this book is what you need. It concerns the early struggle for the \\"correct\\" Christian message, and Pagels does a good job of intertwining the political, social, psychological, and philosophical strands of thre early Christian world together to produce a good picture of the fight over whose message would finally be canonical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that guy serious?","review":"Is that guy from Houston serious?

She explains the gospels view of the life and teachings of Jesus, which differs from that of the New Testament, and deliberates questions raised. Though a well-written book and worth reading, this book does not contain a translation of the Gnostic Gospels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Year in the Life","review":"The title comes from a discussion of \\"grace,\\" the blessing of a meal, at the Thanksgiving table of Rue and Henry Shaw. The dinner guests decide that grace is said before a meal because it is ritual, \\"somehting that is repeated in particular ways at particular times.\\"Rue appreciates ritual and order in her ever-changing, disorderly world as headmaster of a private day school. But the year profiled in this book provides her with little order. Rue moves from death to staff changes to disruptive children to personal and professional dilema.Each chapter of the profile is told in seasoned detail (though the constant point of view shifts are distracting and annoying) but they each seem to be their own story. Like a series of short stories, there doesn't seem to be a climax building. By the end of the book, the feeling is simply, \\"Rue made it throught the year.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"when things fall apart","review":"A heart wrenching depiction of an idyllic lifestyle torn apart by an emotional series of events. This novel is about balancing a career & a personal life in the rawest sense. I was incredibly moved by Gutcheon's tender development of the plot & the main character, Rue Shaw, was easy to sympathise with.This is not a vacuous 'girlie' novel though. Gutcheon makes you understand how people cope with many things & the ending was incredibly poignant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I really enjoyed another of Gutcheon's books, so I thought I might like this one, as well. However, I found the characters to be drawn with very broad strokes, too stereotypical to be believable . Story-lines were started and dropped. Traumatic events happened too late in the story to be properly developed. The book seemed like a series of notes that were not well strung together. The characters and overall feeling of the book was mean-spirited, and the conclusion came about through no direct action of the protagonists. This book was very disappointing and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basis for a good story, but poorly written","review":"Being a teacher, I was able to relate to the situations that Rue and the teachers dealt with day to day. This is what I enjoyed most about the book. I also enjoyed learning about the individual characters, but found myself not getting to know them very well. I don't think Ms. Gutcheon's use of the English language was very effective. The writing was choppy at times, and it contained some flowery words that were used incorrectly and ineffectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"It focuses on shallow people who work at a private school","review":"I felt that the main characters were not explored deeply enough. I never really felt emotionally connected to them, therefore, feeling emphathy toward them was impossible. The focus was on what was happening to them rather than how they felt about their situations. The best part was the little disasters and problems that the characters experienced, such as a female teacher who becomes obsessed with birdfeeding and beats up a male teacher who dismantles the birdfeeder outside her classroom since the birds are pooping on the camilla bushes which will lead to their death!

It also isn't entirely helpful if you want to stay off of the property or judge \\"value\\" of Disney packages and products. That said, I still think it is a necessesity. There are coupons (but they are DATED!), insider information, phone numbers, addresses, descriptions, etc. This book is especially helpful if you are spending your entire vacation at the Disney property...

If you want to know what things are REALLY like at Disney, then go for another book, like the Passporter (which is a great guidebook to help you organize your trip!) or The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World.There you will read reviews of others who have stayed at the hotel you might be considering, they've eaten at the restaurant you are contemplating (and they will tell you whether it's worth it or not!)

Nothing really new happens, only confirming things that were already hinted at in the last book - the US launched the missile, the asteroid belt will be used as asteroid weapons. It's just 500 pages of Turtledove's repetitive style filled with double negatives and tasteless sex scenes. No new wars happen. Wait until the conclusion really happens in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it already","review":"This is a great series, no doubt, but Harry Turtledove is dragging his feet. I'm tired of the Machiavellian sneaking around, I'm tired of the pointless subplots (please retire Auerbach and Sommers as quickly as possible), and most of all, I'm tired of The Race abusing the Human Race over and over and over. It's about time to return to open warfare. I want to see M1 battle tanks driving all over the face of Home and I want to see F-14 fighter jets swatting the Lizard air force like flies.

Just my thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"To state the obvious","review":"Yet another in the trend of pushing out product in quantity rather than quality. The characters in this book are exactly the same as those in the Civil War series, well actually the same as any Turtledove series. And I do mean the SAME. Same characterizations, same figures of speech, etc. If you need something light to blow through on the beach or when your mind is concentrating on something else, this might do.

I scored this book as 2 stars rather than one because I believe it takes considerable stringing-along skill to maintain the deception of progress for such a duration, hence one point for the book and one, with a tip of my hat for such, er, technique.Not only that but the story finishes, if such a word can be used, with more loose ends than a mop. As I was nearing the end of the novel, with maybe 50 pages to go, I was thinking \\"wow, it's going to be exciting to see how this gets wrapped up - any page now, something big is going to happen!\\". Then there were 30 pages left, then 20, then... well, I got this sinking feeling. Which proved to be well founded.Will there be yet another trilogy? Frankly I no longer care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"When Harry Turtledove is good (How Few Remain, Guns of the South, The Misplaced Legions series), he's very good. And when he's bad, he's terrible. And in this book, he's really, really bad. As the third and final book in his series that should have been called the Nothing Happens series, as you might guess, with one exception, pretty much nothing happens. Subplots are built up and never resolved. And things end pretty much were they started at the beginning of the first book, the race controls half the planet, the humans the other half. The entire 1500 pages of this series could have been told in one short 300 pages if Turtledove had omitted the unnecessary gratuitous sex scenes, endless repetitions of the same themes, and boring dialog and subplots that really don't go anywhere.I have no idea why I read all the way through this series. I guess I enjoy pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old.","review":"I wish I could say that my opinion of \\"Aftershocks\\" is substantially improved over my opinion of \\"Down To Earth\\" but it isn't. Furthermore, I see that many of the reviewers of the current book have come around to my point of view. I said much the same things about \\"Down to Earth\\" as many of the reviewers are saying now about \\"Aftershocks\\". Namely that it (they) are repetitive and tedious, have very little in the way of plot advancement and generally reflect either a distracted or uninterested author. This is really a shame since the idea for the series is so compelling and it got off to such a good start in the \\"Worldwar\\" series. However, if Turtledove has really abandoned this universe I will not spend too much time lamenting the loss given the hash he has made of it over the last two books. At least I had sense enough to check a copy out of the library this time instead of wasting my money buying a copy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring!","review":"I really liked the series, but I think Harry has run out of steam (and ideas).

This book was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable","review":"I've had it with Turtledove. One or two of these is more than enough. I originally bought him expecting something as subtle and engrossing as Moorcock's Nomad of the Time Streams, only to discover an endless working of obvious jokes, genre cliches and bad, bad, writing. There's more substance in The Warlord of the Air, the first Nomad book, than in the whole of Turtledove. This is the last one I even look at!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An obvious runup for another set of books in this series.","review":"This series started strongly seven books ago. What a shame that it has been dragged out to these lengths. This novel promised to be the conclusion of the World War/Colonization story. All we really got was a lot of loose ends that will certainly culminate with another padded series of books. As another reviewer said below, when Turtledove's good - he's very good. It's a shame to see him painfully drawing out what should have been an excellent story just to sell more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just filling the rest of the contract","review":"I think Turtledove bit off more than he could chew with this series.

I was surprised to find a book with so many loose ends, bits and pieces that it needed to be two books not one.

My only complaint about the album is the sequencing, which I assume is the original sequencing. For instance, track #2 is the 8 and a half minute comedy monologue by Andy called \\"Jack, The Giant Killer\\", which would work better, IMO, near the end of the CD. I have resequenced my CD-R copy of this disc with the first 6 tracks being: 1. The Andy Griffith Show 2. Ellie's Theme 3. The Man Hunt 4. Flop Eared Mule 5. Mayberry March 6. Aunt Bee.

As indeed I am. But I don't think this book makes a very useful guide into or out of the labyrinth of pain that is the state of black America today. Mr. williams is a personable and able radio and television reporter. But a writer he is not. His book is a screed, a prolix, disorganized, and repetitious rant, that seems to serve the purpose of releasing Williams' frustrations, and little else.

Juan's book, with its attacks on alleged \`black culture' problems could easily have been written by David Duke, whose racist rhetoric uses similar disguise these days. Tiresome and insipid as the \`blame the victim' rhetoric is, it is not as loathsome as the hero worship lauded on the undeserving Cosby, whose own childish outburst would be forgivable but for its repletion. Williams and Cosby have both become spokesman and apologists for the wealthy and the system of exploitation that is in the truth the cause of the very problems they allegedly deplore. But sophisticated analysis is an anathema to these haters. For this perspective, stick to The Dispossessed Majority whose despicable author at least has the courage of his convictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing read","review":"While I respect Juan Williams this book is a very disappointing read. This often angry and overly simplistic tirade is Mr. Williams' response to the response of Cosby's infamous 2004 speech.

Save your money and if you must read this book I suggest you borrow it from your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Shooting Analysis And Solutions","review":"Enough of the emotional manipulation regarding race in this country! It's time for rational thinking, and this book has it. Juan Williams clearly explains the difference between the real heroes of the civil rights movement, and those who have been tearing down their progress over the last 30 years. Using the row caused by Bill Cosby's inditement of today's irresponsible leaders as a backdrop, Williams provides some startling statistics that back-up the entertainer's claims. He concludes with an amazingly simple set of guidelines to success in the black community. What is most significant is that his solutions don't rely on the government, but on individual and community initiative, and he shows how four simple rules can turn the tide from poverty to prosperity. I highly recommend this book, especially for teachers, parents, and community leaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asia is coming to America","review":"Ten years ago two Asians I know gave me some advice.

Well done Juan Williams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presenting the Obvious","review":"Juan Williams has produced a well-written account of exactly what is necessary to begin curing the ills of not only the black underclass, but all those mired in poverty. This is exactly the same straight-forward advice clear thinking parents would provide their children if they want them to succeed in life. The book is well-written and above all balanced. Mr. Williams consistently maintains that racism does exist. By remembering the sacrifices of civil rights leaders of the past, he praises the best in black history and reminds the current crop of leaders where to focus their efforts.There are two reasons I did not give this book a five-star rating. First, the book tends to repeat itself. Second, it comes across as too much of a defense of Bill Cosby. While I am glad that Bill Cosby is being defended, he doesn't have to be defended on every other page of the book. I would encourage Mr. Cosby to write his own book or develop his own TV or DVD series on his important message"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Enough\\" said","review":"An excellent account of the state of the African-American Community.

Definitely a book to pass onto all of any background or culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"As an educator","review":"As an educator in an urban district I found this book to be excellent. A lot of the issues covered in this book are directly related to many of the behaviors, attitudes and difficulties urban teachers face. We do need positive role models for children who take responsibilites for their own actions without blaming others for their consequences. Many students use their race as an excuse for their behavior and I find that many adults treat these children differently and hold them to a different, lower standard because they are poor. Children need role models to help them rise above and make themselves better citizens. They need to value the education that they are given. We are all in this together. Too many children are left behind not because they do not have opportunities but becasue they have given up on themselves. This stems from their home life and the values that their guardians are giving them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Forgotten Gem","review":"When I came across this CD I bought it Instantly for \\"Yolonda and the thief\\". The score is a little weak (which is one of the factors of it's faliure in theaters)but one good song is \\"coffee time\\" a swing-type number that has well written music and is a show stopper. The songs \\"angel\\" and \\"yolonda\\" are okay, but \\"this is a day for love\\" is cheesy and has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. \\"The fleets in\\" is great for any Betty Hutton fan and it has some good upbeat numbers like \\"if you build me a better mousetrap\\" and \\"Arthur Murry taught me a dance in a hurry\\". The quality isn't too good. It sounds like someone held a tape recorder to a TV and taped it off the movie. This is probably why the price it a steal. The only way I can see one would by it is for Betty Hutton or because they are a fan off the offbeat but forgotten movie \\"yolanda and the thief\\" with Fred Astaire(which is my reason)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opera As It Should Be","review":"I had seen this production years ago on PBS and its every bit as fantastic as I remember it. Placido Domingo was still at his vocal best here, which was not the case with his farewell performance in Samson et Dalila with the Metropolitan Opera. Some people see opera purely in terms of the singers. I see opera as a total package, singers, costumes and sets. I feel cheated when I pay good money and get stylized sets..or no sets at all. This production has all of the aforementioned characteristics. I only wished the film crew had pulled back a little further during many of the scenes so one could really enjoy the full effect of the production. If you go for opulent sets and costumes, check out the Metropolitan Opera production of Turandot with Domingo and Marton. I never really cared for that opera until I saw the Met's production and now I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cast & production","review":"I've loved this opera for many years and purchased this on VHS and laser disc. I agree with the other reviewer as to the cast being superb but the chorus and conducting under par and perhaps because it was broadcast on PBS. Those were the days when you could see an opera on PBS! Domingo and Verrett are magnificent and since there aren't alot of productions to choose from, this is certainly worth the price to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definitive Samson et Dalila","review":"I have read with disbelief some of the negative reviews of this opera. I can tell you with honesty that this is one of my favorite videos. Domingo sings fabulously well, and Verrett sings, and looks, like a goddess. (Actually, Domingo looks pretty good, too.) And the baritone, Wolfgang Brendel, has a strong, ringing baritone that can't be beat! I found the chorus to be excellent, and the scenery and costumes wonderful, especially for a house of the size of the San Francisco Opera. Even the subtitles are easy to read. And, of course, the music is very beautiful. This is as close to perfection as you are ever going to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance but there are some problems","review":"There is no dought to tell that this is a great performance with Domingo, Verrett and Brendel at their best condition. Their voices are all powerful and beautiful with full of expression. The stage design is classical with traditional costumes, although I am not very sure that they are historivcally correct, and I was happy to enjoy this performance without funny modernism like Samson in T-shirt + jeans or Dalila in a mini-skirt. Rudel's conduct was also good and the orchestra played very well. Is this so good? YES!But there are two problems. It is impossible to make the subtitles off. They are part of the video and we have to watch them always. Also soon after the end scene a loud extra anouncement starts. This is quite noisy!Anyway I think in this stage this performance is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opera DVD is not only to listen!","review":"Well, I was very cuorious about this DVD but when i finally got it...what a disappointment!The perfomance generally is very dull, the acting is boring and sometimes all lacks of director's work are obvious. They sing...rather good...but that's it. Better not see the video. When one watch the seduction scene it's rather hard to pick up how Dalila succeded to seduce Samson...kind of ridiculous. etcMore to this the sound direction of the opera is not really well-done - the voices are pulled straight very loud while the music is rather quite.2 STARS only - better choose another video of this wonderful opera. For Verrett and Domingo fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"Unlike standard tab books, this book has the tab on one page and the standard notation on the next page, and it's in 12/8 time! It's nearly impossible to determine if the tab notes are triplets or eigth notes or what the actual note duration is. I also saw no mention of a companion CD as another reviewer referred to. The best place to start is the Rev. Gary Davis CD Blues & Ragtime which comes with 5 standard tab notation songs transcribed in the liner notes by Stephan Grossman (several are identical to the songs in this book) but they are much easier to read and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost classic of righteous heavy metal!","review":"Several months ago, I finally acquired this awesome album by one of Sweden's greatest musical exports. I'm a collector, so it was great to get a hold of their earlier stuff. It seems to reflect the British heavy metal here and there, but the sound all in all is theirs. When these guys first came out Christian metal was still largely unexplored territory and bands in the genre were few and far between. They helped pave the way for the countless Christ honoring bands that would come later. Since I also love the Swedish language the bonus tracks from the original demo tape make even more worth while. Like their predecessor Jerusalem, they are bold and shameless about their faith. This is the musical equivalent to a preacher in the town center, up on the soapbox, telling everybody around them 100 reasons why they need Jesus rather they like it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Decade's Of Agression!","review":"I have been a Slayer fan since South Of Heaven was originally released.

I will be honest in saying i did not like Diabolus as a whole album, although \\"In The Name Of God\\" has to be their heavist song ever.God Hates Us All to me seem's like a sequil to Diabolus. The fist time i heard it i wasn't happy. But the second time it sung in. Lyrically it's more meaner that Hell Awaits and Reign put together. Musically i feel it's ripping a new hole in my ear drum's.

They're pretty infantile for a band that has been around for 20 years.Some of the music is okay, but it sounds a lot like many other bands who play this kind of music; that classic Slayer sound can barely be heard. At least the band still sound enthusiatic I suppose, so there's some chance of them producing a decent album in the future, if they take the lyric writing duties out of Kery King's hands.I can suggest any Slayer album instead of this (although Diabolus is no masterpiece either)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few gems amongst a heap","review":"Slayer get the reputation for sticking true to their formula and not compromising their sound but this is a blatant attempt at attracting Slipknot fans. It is not to say there isn't anything to enjoy here. Every fan who has ever attended a Slayer show has grown to love \\"Disciple\\". That track live pushes it into a new level. \\"Here Comes the Pain\\" is a decent track and \\"God Send Death\\" finds Slayer doing their best nu-metal impression. The truth of the matter is that this album does not have very much going for it. It was all just a clever campaign to usurp the nu-metal fans, I would give it one more star had it worked better but they all just went running into the embrace of metalcore after the nu-metal fad ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought Reign in blood sucked.","review":"Wow!!

I'm not saying it's not too intense, I listen toMetallica , Megadeth and Pantera. Those bands acually play thrash metal. Slayer is death metal now. If you want real metal, get Master of puppets and or And justice for all from Metallica, Peace sells and or Rust in peace from Megadeth, And Cowboys from hell and or Vulgar display of power.

Well it [it's not all bad], but it doesn't really get your blood flowing, its just kind of there. Slayer have lost alot in song writing over the years, they can still pull the best live shows ever but its kind of getting old now. Its a little too bad, well known more mainstream metal sources will continue to call every stale new Slayer release THE MOST BRUTAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME while newer far more brutal bands like Anata or Burnt by The Sun will never get noticed or even a one line mention from these rotten [people].Boys, stop listening to Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, go buy some new Sabbat or Krisiun, get back to what you do best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for little girls!","review":"Wow, what a weak album.

God is heavier and better than you ever will be. God created you, you ungrateful roaches!Now lets get to the album itself. It's nothing but Depeche Mode-like synth pop. If you look at the band's picture, then listen to this album, you'll be laughing non-stop! These guys sure do look pretty angry, but their music is just so soft!

Listen to it a few times and you'll notice all the heaviness this album has to offer.It doesn't gt 5 stars cause I would have appreciated a bit of variation in the vocals or even less lyrics.

It is truly amazing. God Hates Us All is the most brutal slayer ever, EVER. I was worried after hearing bloodline off of the dracula soundtrack, the song didn't have that Slayer intensity. But after listening to this album for the first time I was truly blown away. Slayer is back. Some of it's fast some of it's heavy, but it all is great. Paul Bostaph gives one of the best drum performances i've ever heard. I'm a guitar player and yet the drums were what was on my mind. Anyone of these new metal bands that think they're badass have just been taught a lesson. The Slaytanic album of the new millenium is here.I only give it 4 though because i thought they could have had more guitar solo's.

From the creepy opener Darkness of Christ to the crushing closer Payback, this CD sure as hell didn't dissapoint me. Quite a few of the songs I could relate to. Exile is probably the most personal to me. Everyone (at least that I'm aware of), has that one person living under their skin that drives them f**kin mad, and they'll do anything to get rid of them, even slit their throat or blow their head off.

The initial reviews of GHUA were extremely positive, claiming it was a return to form, as brilliant as Divine Intervention or even RiB. When I got around to gbuying it, I was immensely disappointed. This is as, if not more, dull and uninspired than DiM. King & Co have gone from pioneers of thrash and forerunners to the death movement, to copycats. Admittedly , this isn't a mellow piece of post-grunge alterna-crud like Load, or an industrial turd like Risk, but but the aggression here is no more sincere than that of Slipknot or Korn. My other, more minor quip, is that Tom's voice isn't quite what it used to be. If you want to hear a thrash comeback album, get Heathen's Recovered or Exodus' Tempo of the Damned, not this turd. Here's to hoping that with Dave back in the band, they can make a real comeback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...But please hear me out first","review":"Slayer has been on a downward spiral ever since diaboulas in muisa or whatever the hell its called......listen In order for me to buy another slayer album or respect them again they have to 1( stop using distortion vocals for there songs 2( stop downtuning there guitars its annoying 3( make another album now! the last one they made, was like 3 years ago, hurry the hell up stop touring already.....4(no rapping , or stupid album titles like dabulous in muisica or god hates us all Man i hate that title more than anything.......Anyway i hope you wont write not helpful cause you really need to read my review and think about it before you dismiss me immediatly......that is all for now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too inappropriate of a title","review":"I'm gonna start off by saying yes I believe in God and I am a christian, however, that doesnt make me a non metal pussy.

From \\"Seasons\\" onward, they have shown some intelligence in addition to agression and speed. Slayer can do better than this. It's not a bad album by any means, its just one that I don't feel the need to listen to more than once.

Granted, producing one of the best thrash albums ever (\\"Reign\\"..of course), Slayer were at one time a force to be reckoned with. While i'm certain they still are in the live setting, they need to resign themselves to stop recording new albums.They're obviously trying to incorporate \\"nu-metal\\" into the Slayer sound, and it's kind of sad. Listening to the band who created \\"Angel Of Death\\" fretting about marketability is just kind of pitiful. Definitely a worthwhile purchase for 14 year olds who think Slipknot is cool, but for old-school Slayer diehards, just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, affected, commercialized unMetal","review":"\\"God Hates Us All\\" is uncreative and nonaggressive, and reinforces the notion that Slayer no longer are in possession of any smatch of manhood or talent. This album conjures up images of...primates banging half-heartedly, cretinously on trash-cans. The music is reprehensibly SOFT and the lyrics are nothing short of stereotypical, ludicrously superficial pseudo-subversiveness and laughable infantilism. Of course, Slayer have to maintain their gimmickry to seduce all the kiddies and make their living. But this is just beyond spiritlessness and mediocrity... Slayer cannot sink into a lower level of instrumental debility and artistic sterility. I wouldn't classify Slayer as Metal; Slayer don't deserve that; Slayer may be acceptably referred to as \\"...commoditized teenybop half-metal\\", but the label of Metal is indefensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very ARRRGHressive!","review":"I was quite disappointed in the line that Slayer chose after Dave Lombrado left the band. However, this is the only Slayer album with no Lombardo that I love. In fact, I think this is their best since \\"Reign In Blood\\". All the songs are played and sung in a very aggressive way. There's much words and seems that there has not left enough time for solos. However, songs like \\"Bloodline\\" and \\"Here Comes the Pain\\" prove that Slayer is still, the same aggressive band which it was in 80's. The songs may not be as fast as in RIB but they are still fantastic! I have to say that I like each and every song in this album. This is metal - true thrash metal! It's great to notice that they still can be a true metal band although other thrash metal bands like Metallica and Megadeth had slipped away to mainstream metal.Stars: Here Comes the Pain, Disciple, Bloodline"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I got into Slayer back in 97/98, when I first heard Stain of mind.

If you find this too, keep listening. It will slowly grow on you, and you will grow to completely love it. There is nothing better after an absolutely horrible day at work than driving home and listening to Tom Araya scream lyrics such as those in \\"Disciple\\" and \\"Exile,\\" some of the most eloquently angry lyrics I've ever heard, accompanied by the same hard, heavy, melodic, relentless music that we all know and love. This music sucks the anger right out of me. When I listen, it's as if I get to vicariously experience the release of anger and frustration that these guys must feel when bashing the music out onstage and in the studio.

That immediately turned off a lot of the hardcore followers of Slayer, and some of the metal pundits. There were many people who thought this one would bite the dust like Diabolus. However I think Slayer recovered nicely from Diabolus to write music more becoming of themselves. Their job is to write dark speed and thrash. And that's what is delivered in the balance of God Hates us All. The best tracks sounding like old school Slayer were New Faith, Cast Down and Bloodline. There's a nice blistering solo by Kerry King on God Send Death reminicent of Reign in Blood. Paul Bostaph did a great job on drums once again, and keeps Slayer moving at a fast pace. I got to see Bostaph live at Thrash of the Titans, but with Forbidden, and he was all that many said he was.

I have all their cd's with the exception of Diabolus in Musica and Undisputed Attitude, so I can't comment on them, but compared to their other work. I thought the drumming was very good and powerful. Most of the cd is drop D tuning which is something different for them. The cd is loud and at times ear piercing. I couldn't find anything, maybe with the exception of Here Comes The Pain, which is the reason I bought it, that really gives me something interesting to focus in on. With Reign In Blood and the others there was plenty and you could understand the words!I'll just sum it up here. The cd is a bunch of white noise, just a blur.

This is by far the angriest Slayer album and perhaps the angriest album ever made by anyone. In some ways the anger is a bit juvenile with so many F-bombs thrown in, but Tom Araya's vocal delivery is pure, screaming hatred. No vocalist can match the reality of the anger; you know Araya means every word of Kerry King's lyrics. Musically, this is in the Diabolus in Musica style and it is a style that is not my favorite, but has its moments. It's a little less metal and more groove oriented, almost like grunge, with death metal thrown in. Given the timing of its release, this is sure to go down in history as the scariest and most incendiary album ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return To Form","review":"Ironically enough I purchased this CD on Sept 11th 2001.

( my personal fav Slayer record is Seasons in the Abyss) now being that this record is the follow up to DIM, they truly needed to redeem themselves...and to me, they definitely did. the only track i think is weak compared to the rest of the album is \\"threshold\\".

True they do sound different, but that's called evolution, I don't know about the rest of you but I for one was getting a little sick of Slayer making the same album over and over again. The lyrics are the some of the most controversial and atheistic themes Slayer has ever dwelled upon and have even prompted many bible thumpers to speak out against it as seen below.

A lot of the songs lose focus at the end like Disciple and New Faith..I wish Tom would go back to his old vocals like in Reign in Blood and Hell Awaits"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Rotten","review":"I do not like the new Slayer album and I love Slayer. I have been a fan for 15 years now and I must say I am deeply disappointed in this album. To me it sounds like a rehash of everything they have ever done. Don't get me wrong, the music itself is pretty good but listening to Jeff and Kerry play solo's that sound like they were cut and pasted from previous records just plain stinks. And Tom uses the same vocal phrasing he has done on previous recordings as well. Different lyrics with no style. The drumming is damn good however so if you like your drummers then you'll definetly love this album. I think Bloodline is the standout track on this album but that is my opinion. The packaging was definetly cool however. Totally Slayer. I won't say what it is but try to find the unedited version and you'll see what I mean. Hope this helps. Another listen or two and forever it will sit in the \\"S\\" section of my music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"hopefully the last of slayers stinkers.","review":"what the hell happened to slayer ? this is... i have no words.this album is just... slayer know better than this. no words can describe this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer still reigns!","review":"I'm a man of few words... but this record is kick [...]!

It's intense, sacreligious, and at the same time easier to get into than some of their earlier stuff. For the record however, this is nowhere near the best slayer album. That honor belongs to \\"Reign in Blood\\" of course. But, if you're new, get this album. Then get \\"Reign in Blood,\\" \\"Seasons in the Abyss,\\" and \\"South of Heaven\\" in that order. After that, you'll be ready for any and all good metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The angriest cd...EVER!!!!","review":"THIS IS THE ANGRIEST CD OF ALL! Slayer reigns down vengence on the world, religion and the weak. Teenage boys mad an' wanna listen to slipknot and disturbed an' goin thinking thats aggresion need to be placed in a room with 300 other mfs and hear Disciple. They will know true rage.As far as the cd itself goes, this is deadly stuff. The best of their 90's albums and one of the best by far. This one takes the speed of REIGN IN BLOOD and mixes it with the outright heaviness of DIVINE INTERVENTION. IF you are not blown away by track Disciple or by God Send Death, should you make it to the end of the cd, Slayer saved the best for last, Payback. This is the angriest song I have ever heard, and that includes any death metal and everything on RELAPSE REC!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drats.","review":"A few good songs here and there.

I'm a fan of Brazilian cinema, and I'll be adding this one to my list of favorites. It's a touching movie about a young guy caught in the middle of a family feud. His brother has been killed and now the weight of his family's honor and tradition..etc, becomes his burden to carry. The movie is basically about how he chooses to deal with the situation. For anyone studying the portuguese language, the portuguese in this movie isn't very hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This book should be entitled, \\"Dale Carnegie meets NLP\\".

It is evident that Susan Herrmann Loomis spent a great deal of time researching the recipes and culinary history while writing this book. As the Italian Food Host at BellaOnline and an avid cookbook collector of anything related to Italian cuisine, I would highly recommend this book for someone collecting Italian cookbooks. If it were your first Italian cookbook however I would encourage you to do more research. The one glaring negative of this book was that it did not have a single food photo.

The illustrations are terrible but someone had to pick the artist. The layout is uninspired and filled with clutter. The fonts are particularly annoying and seem like a copy of countless other Italian cookbooks. In summary, this book is a total waste of money and the people responsible should be fired forthwith."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last part of a magnificant career","review":"After the fall of Napoleon the British navy has less to do and is significantly decreased in size.

Pirates and slave traders make up his main adversaries, with occasional troubles by revolutionaries. As usual Hornblower's rapier wit and brilliant strategy saves the day.

This last book is a series of short stories similar to Midshipman Hornblower. It was during peacetime, so there was not as much wartime action, but Forester did manage to come up with some interesting problems for Hornblower to solve. I generally enjoyed the book, but would not consider it among the best of the series.I do recommend the series as a good thinking mans action adventure tale. I really liked Hornblower's problems solving skills and he came up with solutions to problems that I didn't think of, but did make sense. His character was complex enough to be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of series, not the worst. Still needs reading","review":"There appeared to be some disconnects in the novel. Most likely due to the issue of several separate stories in one novel. But the disconnects were more from a miltary technical and logic and development of the tale aspect.

Also, our daughter loves anything having to do with drawing and art. However, this is not a good thing for a 6 yr old. I found it was even difficult for me...Unless you are pushing down like crazy on the frame, the inside wheel slips all over the place, which is very frustrating for anyone, but especially if you are 6 and in the middle of creating your \\"masterpieces\\". For now, the howling, screaming and hysterical tears have subsided, but I have a feel they could return at any moment, at the mere slip of a cog. Finally, I noticed there's an age recommendation of 8+ listed here under the product info, but I don't remember seeing one of the book itself, which would have been very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The idea is wonderful and I might have even given it four stars, BUT...... the pens that come with this set did not even last through four designs.

This happened with very light use! I was standing right there guiding my daughter and as she traced a few designs, the pens just fell apart. We are VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this for my daughter thinking it would work like the spirograph we had in the 70's as kids.

The large plastic piece that allows the circular pattern shapes to rotate, can be attached to the side of the book. This holds it in place a bit.

It comes with 3 pens but the wheels can use most pens, even felt pens. There are a few holes that require a deep long pen point to use completely. It reminds me of the fun we had with the original Spirograph. The wheels are actually easier to use than the old Spirograph wheels and I rarely found the pen skipping across the design like other sets that use smaller wheels. Its affordable and sturdy, it should last a good long time. I love the rubber feet on the base so it rarely moves out of place while I draw. The wheels are all see through too which makes viewing your progress easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless junk","review":"I bought this for my children hoping to share with them the magic I had with my spirograph as a child. I am very sad that it turned out to be a huge waste of time and money. It is so poorly designed that my children (ages 6 and 7) just can't use it. I was sure they just needed to get the hang of it so I spent about an hour one night doing it by myself and I got about 5 designs out of it before I gave up. To make it work you have to put a lot of pressure on the entire frame to keep it from moving and even then the disk kept slipping out from under it and messing up the design. Not to mention the fact that the constant pressure was hard for me to keep up so I don't know how a child is supposed to do it. I guess I will just have to find a real spirograph set from the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but elegant...and sturdy","review":"Title says it all.

A veteran pol, clearly intelligent, far more experienced than anyone else in the administration, he nonetheless makes more preposterous -- and often terrifying -- statements than Cheney, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, or even Bush himself. Using Rummy's own statements, all set in context, this little primer let's you decide for yourself whether the Secretary of Defense is clever, power crazy, self-destructive, \\"sexy\\" (as some have claimed), a savior of the Free World, or just plain nuts. It's one of the best briefings on current politics that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumsfeld caught by his own words","review":"This book of Rumsfeld interviews, quotes from Rummy's Rules, and releases from the DoD website is full of terrific quotes from the secretary on WMD, al-Qaeda, \\"elegant intelligence,\\" the perils of catastrophic success, known knowns, unknown knowns, and unknown unknowns--in other words, Rumsfeld caught in the act of gross mistatement and misleading cynicism.

However for those, it presents some good historical information on a limited group of 19th century cartridge manufacturers (Crittenden & Tibbals, Phoenix, and American) that were located in the South Coventry CT area. In fact it's the only book I am aware of that does. There are also pictures of a lot of the early cartridge boxes. Minor turnoffs are the cheap printing job, all B&W pictures, and a lot of page padding in the form of reprints of a large number of patents. Still, it's good information for those who have a serious interest in old cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy to work with pot!","review":"Light, sturdy, easy to move. These pots can be used as attractive cachepots or holes can be drilled easily for drainage and plants may be grown in them directly.

Then I discovered that the publisher is Regal Books which is 'a ministry of Gospel Light, an evangelical Christian publisher dedicated to serving the local church'. Not deterred - a good book is a good book - I read the sample which sounds like a church sermon.

The parts of the movie that show Lovecraft copying stuff from the Necronomicon was mildly amusing- but otherwise this film was abysmal. Check out the movie \\"Dagon\\" (which is actually an adaption of \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\") for a better movie portrayal of the works of Lovecraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the essence of Lovecraft at all...","review":"This movie is useful more as a means of measuring how much (unfortunately) \\"hack\\" horror films have been influenced by HPL than as a tribute to the genius of Lovecraft and his horror stories.Obviously the plots are Lovecraftian as they were plundered from good tales (to which they do no justice) and they give one the sensation of reading new Cthulhu mythos stories, but they miss the point entirely.Lovecraft exploits mankind's innermost fears and his great vulnerability to that which comes from the unknown, as well as the consequences of exploring beyond our reaches. The movie posseses none of that spirit, only vaguely alluding to the batrachian monstrosities that populate HPLs world. If you are a fan, you may have fun with what they have done to Lovecraft's stories, or you may hate it for the same reason. If not, it's strictly a B \\"horror\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poor HPL film","review":"The three separate stories in this film range from forgetable to awful, and really don't come anywhere near the classic stories of HPL. It is very entertaining to see Lovecraft portrayed, though. The casting job for that was right on, although I doubt that this professed materialist was in reality a devoted occultist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Hideous Adaption","review":"This has gotta be THE most pitiable \\"Lovecraft\\" movie I've ever seen. The segments have little to nothing to do with the stories upon which they were based and degenerate into a laughable gorefest guaranteed to make poor Howard roll over at least a few more times in his eldritch sepulchre. The segment based on Cool Air is probably the best of the bunch. It stays somewhat true to the story and strangely enough has a not-so-cheesy love story woven into it. Unfortunately, it too fell apart when the director decided to throw a few chunks of gore in it to \\"spice up\\" the plot. Flat out, this is just a tacky tribute (if you can call it that) to Lovecraft that makes even the Unnamable II look like a brilliant moment in cinematic history. If you want the feel of a Lovecraft story in a movie then you're better off buying Carpenter's The Thing or The Resurrected, which was a pretty neat adaption of Charles Dexter Ward with Jane Sibbet from Herman's Head (hubba! hubba!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"did they even read lovecraft?","review":"o.k. so you are interested in Necronomicon, that's kool, it's one hell of a good gorefest.

Those who made Necronomicon sure didn't. The movie is more than painful to watch. The script is a joke compared to Lovecraft's writing.

Lovecraft, which is evident in the first story in the movie. This first movie is probably the best on here, but its nowhere near the true genius of Lovecraft. The other two movies go from pathetic to blasphemy of the Lovecraft name. The best thing about H.P. Lovecraft's style of writing is that it is very subtle and bizarre. Is the third movie on here either subtle or bizarre? No, and slightly. Lovecraft didn't used buckets of blood and sawed off limbs in his fiction, and he sure didn't spoil it with BAD ACTING, THIN PLOTS, AND GORE-O-RAMA!!!

Her mother gave her Hawaiin blood and her father,Scottish.Many happy things happen in the beginning of the book like how Kaiulani meets Robert Louis Stevenson, the famous author, her lovely strolls in Hawaii and pretty much every little thing.Towards the end her life begins to take a deep tumble. When she lived in England she had many headaches, she had homesickness frequently, and she felt as if she abandoned her own country. This diary tells of Kaiulani's life in England where she had to have schooling, her social life, and her thoughts and emotions that she had during the last years of Hawaii's independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have read several of The Royal Diaries books, and found this one to be the slowest and most uninteresting of all. The child perpetually whines, and there is no grip in the writing. Perhaps this one lacked flavor, being too modern.There are so many better Royal Diaries books, I am sad to have spoilt my view of the series, with this edition.It certainly did not do the graceful princess any justice!Addendum : There is one thing I feel, in all fairness, to add. The Goodbye poem that Mr.Stephenson wrote to the princess was just so beautiful and touching. Very real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaiulani....a real princess","review":"Kaiulani's diary is very good. It is descriptive and has events that take place in an everyday life. Like her visits from someone famous. That could happen to anyone! And her people dying, like people she knows.

Unfortunately, that message is even lost in this ridiculous, non-credible affair.The best part of this album is the joke withing \\"Strictly for The Tardcore\\" where the lead singer says \\"Eminem has to cuss in his rap so sell albums. Well, Me Too, so f*** Will Smith\\". That is the freshest material. The very best song is the incredibly corny, absurd \\"Balls Out\\". First single \\"Foxtrot...\\" isn't bad, it is considerably better than most of the material save for the first two. Otherwise, this album is boring and tired. The dirty jokes don't even appeal to you and you definitely don't connect with the lead singer here. The arrangements are particularly lethargic despite the use of synthesizers and driving guitars. You feel like a majority of the songs are missing something. I recommend you listen to this album before you buy it. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's garbage","review":"Someone else pointed this out already.But you have people giving this thing 4 or 5 stars, but in their reviews they were like \\"It's too short\\", \\"the sounds aren't that good\\", \\"some of it sucks\\". How the heck does that warrant 4 or 5 stars?Or the BHG Grrrl who said \\"Some people are close-minded and cannot deal with the fact that this album is slightly more mature and techno-oriented than their previous music, but can you honestly expect a band to churn out the same album over and over again?\\".How is that 'close-minded', because people rightfully feel the album is terrible? That's not close-minded, it's at least honest.How can a mature sound evolve into techno-oriented. Almost sounds like an unmature thing to do. Those same monotonous beats and insipid lyrics.... yeah, real mature.I have all of their cds, even the stuff before Use Your Fingers. I even force myself to like the most of HFB, but I can't do that with this one. It's short, tired, and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissapointing","review":"The review title pretty much says it all. You don't expect epic albums from a band like this, but this album is really not great by any standards. You don't expect a band not to change either, but I don't agree that this album is more 'mature' musically. To be honest the album sounds like a collection of Demos to me, \\"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\\" being the only one that should have been a keeper. The 2 things that band always had going for them was witty lyrics and catchy music. This album has neither. I am a big Bloodhound Gang fan but I honestly can't even recommend this to die hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Not sure what happened to them since their last album but from what I can tell it didn't help their ability to write music.

Two songs worth listening to and thats pushing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for the most die hard bhg fan...","review":"Unfortunately not what i was expecting from their next album. Actually it's really an ep and not a good one at that. I think it's a contractual obligation and look forward to a new full length album in a few years. The one interesting thing about this album is the lack of a dj and the '80's sounding music. It just doesn't work.

If you want an idea of how poor this album really is just listen to the clip \\"Uh Tiss\\".I still like the Bloodhound Gang, but if this is a hint of where they are heading I'll stick with Use Your Fingers and One Fierce Beercoaster.... and some of HFB.This album makes the work done by Daddy Long Legs and the Wolfpac look like a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF is this??!! This ain't the Bloodhound Gang","review":"For us fans of the Bloodhound Gang, this has been a very long 5 years. And what do we get?? A hot steaming pile of monkey poo. Did aliens abduct this band and give us replacements? Did the record label tell them that this sounded good??? What happed to the samples of songs and turntables? Where did the funny and intellegent smarta**ed lyrics go? I feel we all got bent over and got the hucklebuck from the fat guy on the CD cover and someone forgot the KY (and I don't mean Kentucky).

I really give this CD a big fat ZERO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha ha, now where's the REAL album?","review":"If I wanted to be this disappointed, I could have bought the latest Eminem album. OK, it's not as bad at that, but still disappointing because the Bloodhound Gang has made such amazing stuff until now.Previous Bloodhound Gang albums have very clever musical arrangements combining multiple instruments with lyrics sung in tune and rhythm to create a song with a strong, catchy flow. On top of that the lyrics were funny as heck!This album is bland sounding. Maybe the lyrics are good, but I don't know because I don't want to listen to the songs much.

The Bloodhound Gang tried to appeal to their American audience with the release of \\"Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo,\\" being one of the only true rock songs on the album, but the cheap pop shines through. For real music, get \\"One Fierce Beer Coaster.\\" Two out of the twelve tracks aren't even songs. They're interludes (and retarded ones at that).

Bad as in Bad not Bas as in Good","review":"This album is lifeless. It's funny though, you have some fans defending the BHG by giving the album a good 4 or 5 star review. But then read their review and they are still critical of it. Like that Robert Raper guy, he gives it a 5 out of 5. But tally up the scores he gives to each individual track and you DO NOT get a 5 star album.Or the guy saying \\"if you're a REAL Bloodhound Gang fan you'll like it\\".... whatever. The old \\"No True Scotsman Fallacy\\".This is not a good album.The single was 3 out of 5....This album is not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hefty Crap","review":"This album is bad. I like the single because it has a catchy guitar part and some decent lyrics. There is maybe one other song that is all right.

Their silly three chord songs seized me by the ear ever since I first heard \\"Fire Water Burn\\" and have kept doing so, until...this. Mr. Pop's jokes lost their spunky side, the formerly rocking tunes a la Ramones just stopped entertaining. Just like Blink 182, there's a time of coming and going. The time to go has come.

Very different from the previous Bloodhound Gang releases, and not in a good way.The other highlight of this album was me not having to purchase it. I was able to listen to it in its entirety at Borders, thereby effectively dodging a bullet.When they proclaimed on \\"Pennsylvania\\" that they were Ishtar... they couldn't have been more right.

There are twelve tracks on the CD, only nine of which are songs. None of the three short \\"filler\\" bits is particularly funny. Of the nine songs, one is fairly good, but definitely not up to par (\\"Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo\\"), and one or two others barely qualify as being mediocre. The remaining songs aren't even remotely interesting, funny, or creative.Not only does it seem like Jimmy Pop has lost his ability to write solid, funny lyrics, it also sounds like BHG has forgotten how to write a catchy hook. And that's terribly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"Waiting a few years for the Gang to come out with some new stuff. Only to have a 12 track album with only about 8 true songs. Is kinda disapointing. Since my first listin of the Gang back in 96 with FireWaterBure on the radio I was hooked. Then Hooray comes along and blew my mind away. There first cd Use your fingers is just all over the place, but it was there first album, but its a classic in its own way.

Plus, it's a bit hard to get the pieces on and off of the head. If you don't hold her with one hand and pull the pieces off with another, she will fall over as her feet don't stay on. Also, the flower that is supposed to be worn on her wrist just doesn't fit or stay on. All in all she still really enjoys this toy and for the price, I would buy it again.

Well, if I could relax, I wouldn't need a hypnosis tape!Secondly, the music is awful, more what I'd expect to hear on my way to hell, instead of meeting the angels to get healed!It was so bad, I couldn't even listen to the whole CD.

Well, to summarize, this book wasn't what I expected as I read many books before with same convoluted concepts attempting to explain the meaning of life, the human soul and karma. Unfortunately, none of these books have satisfied my hunger for knowledge as they leave you with more questions and no answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a substitute teacher and I love to have this to carry with me.","review":"I am a substitute teacher and I love to have this to carry with me.

The book is filled with poor grammer and use of an incorrect word. For example, in one sentence she is talking about FILLING when she actually means FEELING.

This book is \\"published\\" through the Holy Fire group which is basically a self-publishing kind of deal, the author chooses a particular package that they'd like and they pay the publisher to print copies. The basic package begins at $399 to get your book published.

Portions of dialogue don't make sense and again, the grammatical and spelling errors were horrendous.I might have enjoyed the story if someone else had written it, but between the stunted dialogue, the poor spelling and grammar and the horrible typesetting (most letters were only half there) I didn't even finish half of this book.

As it stands, the audio book was horrible. Listening to this book was a major chore. The reader sounded like a young Casey Kasem, as if he were announcing the main and secondary characters bios. He sounded like he was reading. Everything was dramatic or overly emotional.Nor did I care for 18 year old Jamal and 15 year old Susie declaring their love for each other. Although there were no intimacies between them, it didn't sit well with me. Nor the fact that Jamal was Black and Susie White. Personally I would prefer to see it the other way around. Instead of it looking like Black men always want White women.Overall I can't recommend this book. Suzanne Brockmann's Navy Seal books are awesome. This one is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"With one or two exceptions, I liked this book alot!","review":"I have never read anything from this author, but this book made me want to go searching for her previous works. There was one thing that bothered me about this book, and it may seem like knitpicking, but the author repeatedly used the phrase 24/7, she even ended the book with 24/7. This phrase is dated and considering the characters ages totally childish. I did enjoy the bantering and the secondary characters, but the premise of the main character having to guard her eventual lover was a bit preposterous. Maybe I should have given it 3 stars after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one -- you will be disappointed","review":"Listened to this on tape. Didn't like the reader's style.

I'm not talking small mistakes here either but serious 'are you kidding me' moments.I bought this book for the solo's and for the harder passages but to my surprise these were left out save one or two.So what use is this book?

Without a lawyer, persons injured by the fault of others simply cannot obtain fair compensation for their harm, since the pursestrings otherwise are kept taut by the corporations, insurance companies, and others who would prefer to have their misdeeds forgotten. Evil still exists in this world, and it is not confined to those who abuse the current legal system.

While she does malign both the Right and Left, she finds more excuses for her beloved Liberal causes, and still wants the Government involved where reasonable people do not.However, she does offer an insightful explanation for the meddlesome ness of the legal culture besides the obvious greed; and that is order. Attorneys simply love order, even when its effect is tyranny. Unfortunately in a free society sometimes chaos must reign. As Americans we must get used to being surprised again if the system is to be cleansed.

From the moment it came out of the box, my son has spent hours playing with it. There is so much to do, lots of silly faces to be made. At first he wasn't so sure about where the eyes and ears, etc. should go, but he had no trouble changing the parts around. Within a few days, he was naming all the parts and putting them in the right places by himself. He sings to him and changes the shoes, eyes, etc, many times before tiring of the toy. And I love the 'suitcase' that the toy comes in; my son now knows we put 'Mr. head-head' to sleep in it every night and he will help put the parts back in (with a little help here and there) and say bye bye when I put him away.It's been about 2 months and he still loves playing with 'Mr. head-head' daily.

If you want to sit down for an easy read on the occult and Hermeticism, this is not the book to do it with. This is the kind of book where you read a page from top to bottom, and then realize that you haven't taken a single piece of information from that whole thing.I turned away from Hermeticism after buying this book.

My foremost problem are the characters are given slight history but mostly glossed over for never ending episodes of action and skirmishes. There's not one character that truly stand out to like or hate. The family problems of the main character, Ian Hardcastle, is poorly developed, especially considering that his son is also using drugs.I sometimes think that this is Dale Brown just wrote this to cash in on the success of Tom Clancy's Clear and Present Danger. The solution of blockading Florida alone is still rather simplistic in my opinion. Certainly it will deal a major blow to South American cartels initially. I'm already thinking the Yakuzas and Triads might take over importing of drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Brown","review":"In his best tale yet, the techno thriller author supreme posits a new supergroup of agents brought together to foil the drug trade.

Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rest Of The Best","review":"This UK compilation has very little overlap with the US-released *Best of Willie Hutch.* Here we can delight in mostly fast-paced and mid-tempo cuts that show how well Mr. Hutch could groove. The two collections provide a good slice of Hutch's recordings from the 70s (plus \\"In & Out,\\" one of two tracks that are on both CDs). These compilations showed me that although Hutch's recordings from 1975 onward became poppier and smoother, they also became more melodically complex and beautiful. He gave up the pastiche of Isaac Hayes/Curtis Mayfield wah wah sounds and focused more on his unique strengths. I'm surprised at how overlooked he was during the 70s-- he offered genuine soulfulness and has a wonderful voice. These are, in my opinion, fine R&B tracks from a talented singer/songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest soul brother","review":"Hutch is the man, his music is timeless. \\"Homeboy\\" Hutch should be thought of in the same breath as Marvin , Stevie, Smokey, in the ranks of the greatest of the Motown/Tamila era."},{"rating":"2","title":"only for the purists","review":"This book is a reproduction of woodblock printed patterns. No instructions, wobbly diagrammes and little information. However, it's the sort of book I love. The pictures are exquisite, and I couldn't wait to get started on some of the lace. The first half of the book is reticella, the second filet. I sit and look at the drawings for hours, amazed at the complexity of one and the efficiency of the other. Again, it isn't a very big book, but for those of you interested in original, historic lace design, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good material","review":"There is a lot of good material here. But as with all books and videos, simply watching and reading won't make you a good player. They don't do the work for you. They tell you what you need to study, but its up to you to do the work of memorizing and practicing. If you REALLY memorize and master the topics in this book, you will be way ahead of 90% of the guitar players out there. The key is to move 1 page at a time. Until you master the content on page 1, don't move on to page 2. This book/dvd is great for people at intermediate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book for 'Beginners'","review":"There are two types of teachers. Those that present information in a way that enlightens the student - pointing out connections that the student would likely not have made on his/her own. The other type, presents a lot of information and tells you to memorize it. This book is of the latter type. For example, in of the earlier chapters, he has a chart of all the scales. He tells you: 'you need to memorize this'. I happen to know all the scales by heart but if I hadn't this book certainly wouldn't have helped me in any way. I believe this book may have been helpful to some of the other reviewers but I would suggest you should be pretty far along in your playing. If you want a better introduction to Jazz guitar, I would recommend Howard Morgen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious but accessible look at Jazz fundamentals","review":"I am not qualified to write a long and significant review, but that is my point. I am a beginner, and was looking for a book to start me out right, address the fundamental questions and get me started on the basics.By the way, by beginner I mean that, while I have played chords and such since junior high school, I just recently started reading music, studying the basics of music theory, and going back to basics generally to learn good habits and techniques and start developing a working knowledge of jazz.Marvelous book, tells me in plain English what I need to learn and what to practice and why. Relates the work to what the professional do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Information","review":"Any aspiring guitarist, jazz or otherwise, would do well to make this book part their study. You build a solid foundation with concepts that apply to all styles of music. Once you are on your way they would make great reference material. Great way to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bunch of theory","review":"This book is about how to read and understand scales, build chords, and understand chord progressions. The \\"playing\\" aspect isn't there, even though there are a few simple songs sprinkled throughout.I really wanted a book that I could open in front of me and sit down with a guitar and a notebook and immerse myself in playing jazz guitar. This isn't that book. This is more of a dry, cold, classroom study on music theory.I don't mean to imply that this information is useless. Actually it's quite valuable. It's just that I want to play the guitar right now, and this book wants me to sit and think about scales and keys and chord progressions before I even touch the instrument. No good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Jazz?","review":"I didn't find this book helpful at all. None of the example in the book sound even remotely like jazz. All this book has you do is play a bunch of boring chord tones and scales. Since so much of it is based on major chords, there is no bluesy sound to the examples. Souless and rote. Just the opposite of jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicole Miller Satin Universal Cell Phone Carry Case w/2 straps","review":"I really enjoy this versatile case. There is one exception or I would have rated it 5 stars. I have a motorola razor phone. Fits perfectly. It's difficult to find a case to fit this phone, but this is perfect!Due to the satin fabric, it kept slipping out of the case; possibly losing my phone. So to remedy this problem, I put a small piece ofvelcro in the middle top of the case and on my phone. It stays perfectly in place now and is easy to take out when it rings!!!!

Was not worth the money of time of purchase. I thought it would be good sense I knew Terrence Howard was in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, here's another film blacks don't know about.","review":"The only way i found out about Spark is i was shopping at Walmart and i looked in the movies section and i saw the movie sitting on the shelf. I didn't wanna buy the movie because i wanted to see if Blockbuster Video had it for rent. So i went to Blockbuster and they didn't have it and i didn't understand why. So since i read what the movie was about and i'm a fan of Terrence Howard, i went ahead and bought the movie from Walmart. There's no excuse why this movie shouldn't be available for rent at Blockbuster so blacks can see it. I'm sure most blacks don't even know this film is out on video. I wonder how come this movie was never released in theatres. I don't like Nicole Ari Parker's hairstyle in the movie. She had her hair the same way in Divas movie with Lisa Nicole Carson, Tammi Townsend, Clifton Powell, Khalil Kain. Anyway this was a good film and i liked Terrence's character. He had a serious temper LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you LOVE Yellowstone, you'll LOVE this book!","review":"I just finished reading this book, and it is a fantastic read!

Jennifer Patrick trembled, alone, inside her tent. Outside she could hear the snorting, grunting and tearing. The thin nylon walls of her only shelter...So I kept reading. It reminded me of an earlier Dean Koontz writing style: immediate, complex (several story arcs moving at once), and very much the page turner. Plus, it's always fun reading a compelling story that also presents a few educational tidbits and makes them interesting. The subject matter is especially topical these days.The \\"trade paperback\\" size, frankly, makes this a more attactive book and easier on the eyes.This is a book you will make time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride","review":"I love Yellowstone, so I just had to read the book.

Talent. Quality music.","review":"This is a lovely collection of Tina's videos. The picture quality varies - the earlier clips look rather grainy compared to the new ones - but the music is superb. Including videos of her French language songs was a nice touch. Given her acclaim in Australia and elsewhere, I'm surprised the record company didn't add a few extra garnishes, like some commentary or interviews. I would also have been overjoyed if the disc included videos from her guilty pleasure of a debut album, Strong as Steel, but at least YouTube can help with that. Overall, this compilation does an excellent job of presenting Tina's talent and artistry during that decade of her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose a different one","review":"I bought this set and am very dissappointed.. I did not get it at Amazon.. It takes 15-20 minutes for the curlers to heat.. the strips that are supposed to make it easy to curl cause problems with putting the clips in to hold the curler if they wind up in the wrong spot.. which happens most of the time. They are very hot to handle. They do produce great results if you can get past all the issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"I like these rollers because they have little teeth on them that holds the hair so that they won't slip out. It does take them a while to heat-up, but I usually plug them in ahead of time, so it doesn't really matter to me. The clips are easy to use and keep the rollers in place. I've tried the rollers covered in that velvet material, but they just didn't hold the hair in place. These have been my favorite so far. My only complaint is that I wish extra rollers and clips were sold in the stores, but you can order them directly from Conair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use","review":"I owned this set for about 2 and a half years before I finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers (I used it about 4-5 times per year). First off, the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place, it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head. Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room. I eventually lost like 6 clips from the \\"springing out\\" thing.The results of these rollers were great, though. I used them on my wedding day and people loved it. Good results, but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have used this Conair hairsetter for 3 months. The rollers take a very long time to heat - allow a half hour. The clips are too big for the rollers at the curved end and the rollers fall out easily - moments after putting them in. I use the clips from an old Clairol set that I had saved. And...though I have shiny curls upon removing the rollers, the curls fall out completely after an hour and my hair looks like it wasn't styled at all! I have wavy hair that's not hard to curl. I've owned ten sets of rollers over 30 years. This is the worst. What's up with this BAD product from Conair who are the granddaddys of hair appliances? I'm throwing them out and won't buy Conair again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Green Day & Pennywise","review":"Not very original! Drums are out of time, singer is terrible! Sounds like a clone of old school punk. Wouldn't recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"They missed the point","review":"In the true Fifties Hollywood spirit, this film seems to miss the point of the original book entirely. The strongest theme throughout the book was how lust for power can corrupt anyone - even the closest of your friends.However, the Hollywood dream weavers wanted to play it easy for the audience, and turned it into an inane sanctimonial hallelujah - and poorly even as that. The acting is stiff, the dialogue just plain corny, and the storytelling bland.The bookwriter Mika Waltari's popularly acknowledged masterpiece deserves a much better film than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but well worth watching","review":"I think it's a mistake to simply dismiss this movie as a \\"ponderous soaper\\" (or whatever Maltin called it). To begin with you have this great ensemble cast, good cinematography and a rich and moving musical score. The plot has some interesting twists and maintains a good balance between drama and humor. Peter Ustinov is particularly good as the conniving but lovable servant. Look for a great (but short) scene with John Carradine as the grave robber. I had no trouble with Bella Darvi's dialogue and she seemed seductive enough to me! True there are some bad hair moments (which you really must temper with the period during which the film was made)but there are also some really great and moving scenes. On the balance I would recommend this one for a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid","review":"I think that pretty much defines this movie. After watching this movie, I do have a hard time coming up with much I like about it. If you are interesting in seeing something good of this type with Jean Simmons in it, see \\"The Robe.\\"The plotline and acting of this movie is consistent with all the movies of this type. The story goes slowly and there are a lot of things that just don't add up.I understand others will have differing opinions, and that is OK, but if you are interested in a solid story with solid acting that's reasonably historically accurate (and in the Biblical genre) then look for \\"The Bible Series\\" videos from TNT/Lux that include great ones like \\"Moses,\\" \\"Solomon,\\" \\"David,\\" and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond words!","review":"An utterly horrendous and fatally miscast movie.

Based on Dr. Clayton's theory, it is well thought out and researched. Experienced martial artists will enjoy this book. While it is doubtful that Dr. Clayton can be 100% correct, he certainly makes very strong arguments that will stimulate thoughts and discussions amongst martial artists interested in the history of their art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"This book is an excellent reference for the study of karate. It takes the study of karate to a higher level. The proposal of the theory in the book and the analysis of the existing proof is easy to follow and gives a new insight to the movements in our karate kata. A \\"must have\\" for any serious karate-ka's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Farce!","review":"Having trained on Okinawa several times throughout the last thirty years I am confident that this book was written without a single visit to the island. Grossly inaccurate, racist, and recklessly missing easily researched information, I can't believe anyone with any experience on the island would find value in this book. The failure to even mention the martial art of the royal family (Udun ti- palace hand) is mind blowing since the royal art is strictly a soft art and this book is trying to justify the development of hard styles. All the author would have to do is walk into a Undun ti dojo and he would have been given all the documentation he needed. Of course, he wouldn't have been able to write this book after that since his theories would have been blown out the window.This is a fairy tale, new \\"legends\\" that some will cling to and pass off as history."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"The is not strictly a shotokan book. There are chapters covering Okinawan history and the karate men of the 1800s. The book offers radical theories on karate's beginnings and the changes made over time. Although I don't agree with many of the author's conclusions, some of which are nothing more than pure speculation,--whether we agree or not, he is entitled-- I still found it an interesting read.Note.Among others, there are several pages on Itosu and Chotoku Kyan.----------------------------------------------A.

For years, I had been taught the patterns. I had been taught how to move. I had been sounding out words.Bruce opened my eyes and my mind. Now, I began to read sentences. Paragraphs. The entire lesson plan.This book began to move my understanding of karate from childhood to adulthood.The book may be a stretch for kyus. Some udancha may find it eye opening. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shotokan's Secret","review":"I have been studying Shotokan for over 20 years. This book was well researched, and has given me much more to think about. Not only has it made me think about Shotokan in a different light, it has made me think about the development of martial arts in general. This is a must-read for anyone who studies the martial arts seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful mythology","review":"This book is a wonderfully written mythological approach to the history of shotokan karate. I had no idea that the old masters had the skills of jedi's and comic book super heroes. Just kidding around. If you want to buy into the myth and legends of unbeatable, nearly superhuman warriors that really originated shotokan karate, then by all means, get this book. But if you are grounded in reality, find something else. The author uses very unreliable and downright ridiculous bunkai, to back up his claims. Old style karate had joints locks, sure. But these poor bunkai can be found for free on youtube. Save your money and find a more legitimate researcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why We Practice Karate","review":"With over 30 years in the martial arts, I found this book thorough, thoughtful and well researched. One may not agree with all the practical applications described; however, any traditionally trained Shotokan Practioner would find resonance with the intentionality and directness of techniques that the book suggests. The hidden truth suggested and supported by analysis will resonate with those that have practiced kata, kihon, ippon kumite and kumite over and over again. If you have, sweat, ached, blistered and bled through hours and years of concentrated and clear techniques, you will find yourself remembering why you love Shotokan. Enjoy and get back into the Dojo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researchered amateur effort","review":"This author of this book admittedly rented or bought a number of videos on Okinawa karate, supposedly watched the videos and then wrote a book based on his limited experience in Shotokan ryu, a Japanese off-shoot of the original Okinawan arts. The author make some fairly outrageous claims that he attempts to pass off as historically correct without one shred of primary research or evidence. It is outrageous that a publishing house would even bother putting this diatribe in print.Readers interested in Shotokan should immerse themselves in Harry Cook's book, The History of Shotokan. For more information on what Shotokan is missing as a martial art, I highly suggest the Gennosuke Higaki book: Hidden Karate, the true bunkai for the Heian Katas and Naihanchi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!!","review":"This book is a must read for ANY martial artist who traces their art back to Karate, Shuri or Naha/Okinawa! Arts like Taekwon-Do, Tangsoodo, Most forms of Karate etc. This is also a great book on a very small section of history related to Okinawa and it's relationship with Japan, China and even Korea etc. Again, a MUST READ!

For example, the author cites that linear Karate finds its origin in the palace defence system in Okinawa whereas linear Chinese boxing was already evident in the Shaolin temple centuries earlier. The Naha styles are described as a mere form of Chinese boxing not worth of further consideration. Chotoku Kyan is given an unworthy treatment and one wonders if this is because he reverts to a non-linear system. Having said all this, this book is a treasure trove of information, particularly the history of kata and the masters of old."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"lots of research to back up it's claims.

I found this book begging for attention from a character that acts wrongly superior to any other characters by her side. I felt her looking down her nose at others and insulting the small-town life that is clearly a part of the authors life. In additon, I found the conversations and descriptions of the days happenings to be over-detailed and more than a little annoying. I mean, really --- is it necessary to describe just how much make-up was applied; listen to Skye debate over what to prepare for Thanksgiving dinner; how the whole dinner played out with men in one room and women in the other --- when she's supposed to be solving a murder?! The polt has a ton of potential and could be a good read if there were a stronger, less superficial main character (and author). This is the first 'Scumble River Mystery' I've read. Maybe the others are better.... but I'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, poorly produced serial","review":"This serial is an outstanding example of why so many of the Universal serials of the 1940-1944 period were inferior to their Republic counterparts. In this case much of the Universal formula for making inferior serials is evident: intensive use of stock-shots, very poor production values, dull writing, continuous use of Mendelssohn's Fingal Cave Overture which is completely unrelated to the action that is going on screen. Universal's good serials in the forties are few and far between.

Well done Timothy Zahn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I really enjoyed Zahn's story. It was set in a believable universe with interesting characters. The best part of the book is that I thought I had it all figured out when he threw in a great twist near the end that took the story to a much better ending than I had guessed. I was really impressed with the book as a whole, but the ending was epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired mystery and adventure","review":"This is my first book by Zahn and I was pretty underwhelmed. I was surprised at the lack of creativity overall, it feels like a TV episode. The main character is cast from the Han Solo mold whose business is smuggling and comes complete with an alien co-pilot . The other characters are even shallower and you find yourself differentiating them by name alone. Although there is a murder onboard a small ship early in the novel, it takes nearly 400 pages to finally reveal the fairly obvious perpetrator and the author does unconvincing backflips to keep the mystery going this long. There really are only a couple of suspects. In the end, I really couldn't have cared less about the Icarus secret (it's a textbook MacGuffin) and I sort of giggled at some of the other revelations. I hope this isn't one of Zahn's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zahn is the master","review":"Timothy Zahn is the greatest sci-fi writer currently. I always anticipate his books knowing I will have a good read and a hard time putting it down. I was not disappointed. Zahn's character and plot building skills keep a person glued to the story. This book keeps the reader guessing as to what is going to happen next and what is actually happening until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but gets boring","review":"This book is absolutely brilliant, but in the middle, it gets a little boring. On the bright side, it does finally end up being a darn good book that I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Space Opera Disappoints","review":"What a disappointing piece of tripe! Zahn provides a vague (and hugely improbable) framework, then tacks on disjointed chapters one after another. Each new chapter pulls rabitts out of the hat that have little or no foundation laid for them. The central mystery can be guessed by a nine year old before you are halfway through the book. When he finally tires of tacking on more unlikely escapades, the denouement is a cross between Agatha Christie style \\"Let's have everyone sit down to dinner with the murderer\\" and the US Cavalry riding over the hill in the nick of time.Unless you have absolutely nothing better to do on an airplane flight, give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps just people from Washington did not like this book or.........I have to agree with Mr. Klausner's review of this book. I was very disappointed. I had the murderer pegged in this \\"mysterious\\" plot with the introduction of Jordan McKell's partner as the new ship mechanic. I found that the spaceport scenes were used over and over with slight variations. In addition to this there seemed to be a never ending contradiction with the main character....one moment he is sly as a fox and the next he is a bumbling idiot. Last but not least, th ending was pure cheesy \\"Here comes the cavalry all at once with 2 minutes planning\\" type of thing which made me want to throw this book across the room.Mr. Zahn - do not get angry.

The characters live in a futuristic world with very advanced star drives, but have no DNA sampling devices, no cameras on the ship, a computer that is comparable to what was commercially available in the 1990s. The word \\"science\\" is just an excuse for a book written to make money. Good English does not make a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed?

It was so slow and uninteresting and cliche to me. Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting work from Zahn","review":"This is an interesting mystery novel from Timothy Zahn set in outer space. The other reviews here give you plenty of details regarding the story so I thought I should only point out a few things I particularly enjoyed:1) The novel is hard to describe according to type or genre. It is a sci-fi novel wrapped around a mystery story with buddy story elements thrown in. Overall, the novel is thoroughly satisfying on all counts when you realize what Zahn is doing.2) Zahn packs a few interesting plot twists that will have you continuously guessing. Nothing will prepare you, however, for the surprises at the end. Sorry, you will be suckered and surprised no matter how smart you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery + SciFi","review":"I'm not sure what edition this is, and why there isn't another review. It says that this edition is out of print and I wanted to make sure the reader understands that there are other editions in print. I have recommended this book to several people who read from a variety of different categories and all of them have been satisfied. I am somewhat new to SciFi (less than 2 dozen) and I have been reading mysteries and detective novels such as Patricia Cornwell, Mary Higgans Clark, Michael Connelly. Etc. The Icarus Hunt is a great mystery novel (that just happens to take place mainly on a space ship) even if you don't normally care for SciFi. Zahn has the ability to write cover to cover action and this is a great example. This book is a must read.I have just finished reading Zahn's \\"Spinneret\\" and feel I must put in a plug for it as well (although it *is* out of print). I am a definite Zahn convert and will be spending more time in the SciFi section in the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Science Fiction","review":"Half detective novel and half science fiction adventure novel. My favorite Timothy Zahn novels were \\"Spinnneret\\" and \\"The Blackcollar\\" series, but this is one of his better novels (all of Zahn's novel are good). The story is fairly common science fiction, but Zahn does a good job of developing his characters and his universe is consistent and interesting. I probably wouldn't reread the novel but I do look forward to a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Icarus Hunt","review":"Timothy Zahn can really take you for a ride & drop you intosome impossible situations! As well as writing good science fiction,he does extremely well at mystery too. In a universe of iron-fisted control of all galactic shipping, renegade Jordan McKell survives by dabbling in interstellar smuggling for the last of the free traders. It was good to read a book again that made me feel like a kid again, with characters I really liked doing things I really liked, in a plot that let me forget about the details & just live in the adventure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct jargon ruins the reading","review":"Mr Zahn draws a plausable plot with reasonable attention to the characters. Unfortunately he seems to feel compelled to lay on a heavy dose of p.c., for example \\"crewmen' becomes \\"crewers\\"-- reminds me of the same people who gave us \\"servepersons\\". What not just tell a tale; is there really such a pressing need to make us all more \\"sensitive\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but ultimately disappointing science fiction.","review":"Timothy Zahn's THE ICARUS HUNT is, for the most part, anentertaining tale aimed at the \\"hard science fiction\\" reader-- but ultimately its ending (complete with a concealed set of facts that left this reader snarling in baffled annoyance) disappoints. Contrary to what some other reviews in this forum suggest, it is *not* like STAR WARS, save for its interweaving of humans and aliens as in the famed \\"Cantina bar.\\" It has plenty of good ideas, and lots of plot twists ... and yet its resolution is at once too neat and profoundly implausible. And those pesky concealed facts make a fraud out of much of the novel's set-up, including much of what gives the book its initial charm and interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"ICARUS HUNT","review":"I happen to enjoy mystery/sci-fi books, and this one really hit the spot! I enjoyed it from begining to end. Mr. Zahn continued teasing throughout the entire story--I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it! I have read many Sci-Fi books, and I had immediately nailed why the Patth were zeroing in on the Icarus in this one. In fact, I knew what the bone of contention was before I bought the book. That did not in any way, shape, or form, detract from my enjoyment of this book. I also was WRONG when I thought I had the \\"secret\\" all completely figured out. Mr. Zahn added/ subtracted just enough to his recipe to keep me addicted! Mr. Zahn, Please Write many more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Timothy Zahn has for a long time been one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors. Ever since his Conquerer's series and, of course, the Star Wars books (which, I would like to add, are the best Star Wars novels to date!) But The Icarus Hunt went as far as to exceed the extremely high expectations I had for any Zahn book. It is a unique twist of imaginative Sci-Fi and intriguing Mystery. And Zahn did a wonderful job delivering. I just could not put the book down until it was finished. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkids loved this book","review":"Whenever my grandchildren sleep over they choose books I have for me to read them.

To boot, it also starred Melanie Griffith and Tom Berenger. It's a classy production, great visuals, dialogue and interesting story. The thriller is about a laywer (Griffith) who is defending a young man accused of raping and killing a young woman. She believes the man is innocent, unlike fellow lawyer, Tom Berenger. Soon a politician's family gets wound up in the murders, and the lawyer must seek out information. Craig Sheffer (A River Runs Through It) also stars as a past client of Griffith's, who is a former raper too. Singer, Huey Lewis also stars in the film as does James Morrison and John Ritter (Bride of Chucky). You have seen all this before in films like \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"The Gingerbread Man\\", but this one suffers because it's just too long, causing you to fall alseep after half way.zzzzzzzzzzzzzz......"},{"rating":"1","title":"A remake of Dumb & Dumber????","review":"Melanie Griffith must've been strapped for money when she agreed to do this film. While she is quite good in it and credible in the role, her character does such stupid things -- not very smart for a supposedly smart lawyer.

The slapstick is original and the premise is also original, and what the cast does to the house in order to route out a mouse is outrageous fun.The only downside to this film is the little side trips into sexual innuendo, which I thought spoiled the movie in spots, but overall....This is a classic movie, and you won't go wrong with viewing it. Some parental guidance is necessary if the kids are watching, but it's something out of Laurel and Hardy movie or Keystone Cops caper.The ending surely sets a new standard, too, for redeeming what appeared to be a totally helpless situation.

They could have made the movie funny without all that other junk being mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"region error!","review":"Won't play keep getting region error message !

It actually works on two different levels. The slapstick and the cute mouse will thrill the young, while the old can enjoy the amazing and slightly dark art direction (Tim Burton flashback!) and some hilarious performances (Christopher Walken is unreal!). The movie does lose it in the end, but by then, the viewer has had so much to laugh about already, that it can be forgiven. Also, the DVD is of exceptional quality, with nice menus and decent extras. Way to go Dreamworks, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, I really enjoyed it !!!","review":"It's the type of movie, you can watchrepeatedly, and enjoy it every time.It's a must have in anyone's dvd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this film","review":"Obviously people either hate or love this movie, but then comedy is an elusive beast.

Watching a coffin fall into a sewer, look at a man throw up a cockroach, and see a sewer system explode in people's faces is not my kind of movie.

I was vry dissappointed. It was about two brothers who own a house that is worth millions. So they spend millions renovating. One problem, there is a mouse that wont go away so they wrek the house trying to get at the mouse. This movie never got to the point, it was very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. When I saw this movie in theaters in 1997, that is what made me hate movies for more than a year after that. It was absolutely disgusting and grotesque (at the sewage pipe part), I had to leave the theater halfway through. It has slapstick action, and it appears that men must be portrayed as idiots in the media to get noticed! A mouse is brilliant compared to two grown men, right? Out of five stars, Mouse Hunt deserves no more than negative three. I still don't like movies all that much, and it's all because of Mouse Hunt. It is the exact opposite of anything good about movies. Looney Tunes is Harvard material compared to this baloney. Avoid it at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What You'd Expect","review":"I was a casual fan of Tom Jones in that I knew the voice, I knew the songs, and I respected the talent, but when I saw him perform this song on Conan O'Brien oh so many years ago, I was totally blown away! First off, the song was written by Diane Warren, who is one of the best sentimental song writers in the business. Add Mike Campbell, of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, to the mix on guitar and Tori Amos on backing vocals and you have a truly unique sounding pop lament to lost love. This song is so unlike what you think of when you think of Tom Jones. He truly works his considerable vocal skills on this tune. I bought the cassette single when it first came out and have been looking for the CD ever since. I honestly wish this song would be added to his greatest hits collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much fun withoyt Frank","review":"While its always great to hear Zappa's music played by great musicians (and these are great players) the whole affair seems lifeless and a bit dull. The band is not rehearsed nearly as well as when Z was alive and touring and it never really breaks loose into good chaotic fun the way the Baby Snakes performances do. I think a necessary component for Z's music played live was Frank himself - a kind of zen ringmaster.I probably won't watch this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?!","review":"I don't know what happened to this product, but whatever it was, it wasn't good.

This new edition is none of those things.First off it does not smell the same, there is no longer the sweetness, the floral tones so important, obviously. Second, it doesn't last, which is now I suppose a good thing.I ended up pitching the whole thing, I wasn't going to wear it, it was just taking up space.

It has brass fittings and roughly finished threads if examined closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dehumidifier hose","review":"We bought this hose for use on a basement dehumidifier. The hose comes with washers which allowed for a leak free hook up and was the perfect length. The reason I deducted a star is due to the stiffness of the hose. I am not sure if it is due to the fact it is a drinking safe hose, but its is extremely stiff compared to a garden hose. We were eventually able to get the hose to straighten out, allowing for easy drainage. As a hose it works well. No leaks have been detected and it was easy to set up. The metal connections seem of higher quality compared to the plastic connections found at our local stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item has a PLASTIC connector, not metal as pictured","review":"I bought this connector to hook up a pet water bowl to an outside standpipe. When it arrived I didn't immediately notice that the connector was made of yellow plastic rather than metal but I sure found out as soon as I hooked it up. It leaked right away. I unhooked it to check that the gasket was making a good seal (it wasn't) and then tried to reconnect it. That's when the plastic thread got shredded and after that it would not go on straight so it's useless. I went to Lowe's and bought a similar one that did have metal connections and that's working fine.To their credit, Amazon gave me a refund with no quibbles."},{"rating":"1","title":"I avoid these","review":"I travel for a living and have been in my 5th wheel for 7 years. I avoid these hoses because they do not hold up. The ends develop leaks very quickly. The hose itself is not bad quality, it is the fittings that are cheap and undependable.

One of my only problems with it is the fact that the tail (which starts out separate from the fighter when packaged) is slightly wobbly, and it often pops out. Also, the firing missile is tedious to find and put back into the fighter, only to be shot back across the room, but I have this problem with all projectile-firing products. The \\"Movie Sound\\" buttons are placed out-of-the-way enough that you can't accidentally trigger an annoying noise, a problem I have had with the Han Solo Blaster Pistol, but conveniently enough that you get it going on your first try, a problem I have had with the \\"Power FX\\" Luke in X-Wing.

One obvious difference is the realism and honesty i notice to be produced by the care shown by Lamsa.

You may find some Old Testament materials in Aramaic, but don't ever expect to find the New in that language.Additional comment posting Nov 20,2012.Here you will find a lecture from Yale University on the original language of the NT.

So silly that if anyone did them to me I would probably burst out laughing at them rather than want to kiss them. For example, wear a badge that says kissing police and arrest your lover for a kiss? Some of them are completely uncreative. She names kisses the E kiss or the L kiss and then names body parts that you could kiss that start with those letters. The dumbest idea was to kiss your lover on a pile of dirty laundry. May I ask why anyone would enjoy this? This is a horrible, uncreative, stupid book.

The story is just squeezed into the director's concept into a totally squalid, depressing, Harlem regardless of the distortions involved. This is the real trash of eurotrash.

It manages to protect the 30GB Zen very well without sacrificing compact size. Closed, it still fits firmly in the palm, and the belt hook is unobtrusive, as well. The leather is soft and supple, and does not feel cheap. The seams look well-sewn. The front flap is nicely rigid, and the double-sided snap is simple and strong. The Zen's buttons push with ease through the case; in fact I would guess the mechanism will last longer thanks to the case's added thickness--less direct pressure. The clear plastic screen may be the case's weak point as it appears readily scratchable and somewhat flimsy, but I am in no way disappointed. The case does what it says, looks stylish, feels classy, and ameliorates the fear of dropping your MP3 player.

I was disappointed to find that it was little more than a story of a couple who invited their neighbor to share a spanking/paddling/caning session with them. If you are looking for erotic literature of this type, this is for you. If you are looking for studies, information and instruction on this type of lifestyle, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest movie of all time!~","review":"This movie shows the epic that was General George S. Patton Jr. He was more then a man, he was a leader of unparralled proportions and could have won the war 2 full years earlier if he had been given free reign!@ Patton should have been Supreme Commander!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I rated five stars because that what Patton should have been","review":"This was a great movie, if you want to see a great World War2 movie, buy this one. Its got all aspects of a great movie. Its got action, drama, and suspense. I have to rate it as a top five on the top five World War2 movies, these include: 1. Patton 2. Flying Tigers 3. Toro Toro Toro 4. Saving Private Ryan 5. Mephis BelleIts great, one of the best movies I have ever seen. If you like the movie and want more check out the movie, The Final Days of Patton. I think thats the title or its somthing to that nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original 1970 version of PATTON","review":"This is the VHS version of the original motion picture starring George C. Scott as General George Patton. An excellent brand new tape still in the original wrapper. The movie is a superb depiction of George Patton's involvement in the European theatre of WWII. Many of Scott's lines are direct (or almost direct) quotes from Patton himself and most of the scenes are historically correct. Patton's views toward the Soviets and his total disdain of them is authentic. The coarse language, which Patton used fluently, was a bit shocking in 1970 when the movie was released. By today's standards it is fairly commonplace. A \\"must see\\" for anyone who wants to know who General Patton was in a nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton","review":"I had seen this movie before and knew it to be a great one. Through a conversation with a friend I realized this was a movie I wanted to own and did not have.While the movie itself probably glorifies Patton, George C Scott is unforgettable as Patton and the whole movie takes on its' own movement and life.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton Classics","review":"I purchased this one because i saw it on tv last year. to add to my library collection.thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information not accurate","review":"I bought this Bluray because of the included spanish subtitles.

The new image looks to be from actual 65mm elements and is far less grainy than the old transfer, which looks to have been from 35mm dupes. However, sometimes colors are a little unstable in new image, with often pinkish hues and reddish flesh tones, but most of the time the picture looks fine. The soundtrack seems the same as the old edition, which was just fine. All of the extras from the previous edition have been retained, and the new commentary by screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic remastering","review":"I personally love this movie. My first purchase of this movie was in Betamax and I still love it. I was amazed at the difference in quality with the Blu-ray version. The colors and detail are fantastic.

I am very pleased to have this new release and strongly recommend it to any lovers of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a professional soldier","review":"Everyone is good at something, music, basketball, nuclear physics, but what about fighting wars?

I can also see why it was only 89 on that list. This movie glorifies General Patton as a war hero, which indeed he is, but he is also a selfish, conceded, unforgiving jerk! He doesn't give a second thought about hitting a frightened soldier across the face. And what is so cowardly about the fear of death? And Patton just doesn't learn. He is the same man at the end of the film as he was in the beginning. An extra star for some fine acting on George's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"First title I can't see on my DVD","review":"Well, was bound to happen, can't view this on my computer.

But I am tired of giving in to these idiot manufactures who keep making these movies in widescreen format. I'm sure there are some people out there that like having their screen reduced down in size but I don't and it just seems like everyone that I talk to feels the same as me. So sadly to say I won't buy this movie until it comes out in regular format. Maybe with a little luck manufactures will read this and get on the ball and listen to the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dad was there!","review":"My Dad was there in the bed beside the famous \\"slapping\\" scene. There is much misunderstanding about Patton's actions. At first glance it seemed harsh and uncaring, but Dad, not a cold hearted man said they should have \\"shot the S.O.B.\\" slapping was too good for him. (Dad was facing amputation of both feet due to frostbite)And just as today the media blew it all out of proportion. My father followed Patton to \\"Hell and Back\\" (Audie Murphy movie)And knowing all he went through, would do it again, and again.

Even though the movie is set during World War 2, you can see how the politicians still managed to muck up what needed to be done for the sake of political correctness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton: Strongly Written!","review":"A few thoughts to consider while viewing this movie:Note that Patton, a firm believer in his own reincarnation as the \\"eternal romantic warrior\\" forgoes inspecting a battlefield in North Africa where is troops have just fought. Instead, how is he eerily (& accurately) compelled to an acient site where Rome fought the legions of Carthage?Note also the last scene of the movie in which he is alone walking towards a windmill. Strong allusions here to Don Quixote, mental malaise around a sense of honour in battle, and again his belief in his historical destiny as the \\"eternal romantic warrior\\".Any lit major will have a field day with this movie if they view it critically."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent in everything","review":"My husband is a vet, and loves these kinds of movie's, he was very happy with it.

The Blu-ray version of this title fully captures the clarity and color range of the 70mm release. This isn't just a good Blu-ray for a 1970's film -- it's a great Blu-ray that ranks as one of the best yet released. Fox produced a number of films in large screen formats that, if they received the kind of treatment that \\"Patton\\" has, would make outstanding Blu-ray releases. These would include: \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"The Bible...In the Beginning\\", \\"Carousel\\", \\"The King and I\\", etc. If \\"Patton\\" is a film that you appreciate then do hesitate to up grade from DVD to Blu-ray on this one. The difference is day and night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if you want to see the 'film'","review":"Fox has turned Patton into a video game by filtering out all grain and fine detail from the picture. Patton never looked like this till this HD transfer. It's completely unauthentic and does not show the film as intended and made by the film makers. Very bad revisionist HD mastering. Thumbs down, way down. I want to see Patton the film, not Patton the waxy, ultrasmooth video game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patton","review":"If you bought this movie to see Patton save your money on the Blue Ray version. It takes 10 minutes before the movie starts. You have to first get through a movie preview and then a talk about the movie by the director. When I buy a movie I want to watch the movie not a bunch of preview garbage. When I finally got to the movie it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton.","review":"Beautiful,Patriotic and well done. George C. Scott did A Great Service. Patton should be viewed by my generation, A Great Movie about a Great General,A Great Man. Most War Movies focus toO much on silly false pretenses and the liberal anti-war message instead of focusing on what is real and sometimes inevitable. Patton is One of If not THE BEST War Movie in my Opinion I have seen.HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As great as the original!","review":"Wow! They really did an awesome job of creating the blu-ray version of this movie. I really like this classic and the blu-ray movie is a must for any Patton fan. The audio and video are excellent. I could not be happier with this blu-ray version. Well worth the money if you really enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI rip-off","review":"The new AFI top 100 film list appeared today and Patton was absent. I will not disparage the films that made the list, but at least 20 of them are lesser films than this masterpiece: oscars for best picture, actor, director, and script. This is a great war film, a great biographical film, a great film. The dialogue is consistently memorable, the set pieces unforgettable. Scott is brilliant; this is his masterwork (in a career consisting of multiple contending efforts). If you have not seen this film see it now. As one of my college teachers once said, \\"If you have not read The Brothers Karamazov go directly to the library and do it. You might die without having read it.\\" The same advice applies to Patton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlights of a true warrior's last war!","review":"I like watching this classic from time to time. My cousin served and died under General Patton in WWII. I have personally visited General Patton's grave in Luxembourg. It was a moving experience enhanced by witnessing Chinese tourists paying their respects to our American hero. The Chinese were transfixed by this movie when it was premiered throughout China. They have come at a rate of about 300,000 per year ever since to visit his grave. Amazing respect! The movie stitches together several well-known example vignettes from Patton's awesome combat record and uses the drama to describe the coalition politics and monumental struggle that was WWII. I cannot imagine not including this film in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"patton","review":"a very good war film one of the best.

Scott is really good, but here's the simple secret to PATTON's greatness: the writer.The screenplay, including that thundering monologue at the open and all the dreamy stuff about ancient Rome and the Carthaginians, was written by Francis Ford Coppola, the genius behind THE GODFATHER, APOCOLYPSE NOW, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton on Blu Ray!!! Essential!!!","review":"This is one of the great all-time classics!!! And it's now on Blu Ray!!! The PQ and sound are incredible!

This is a 2 disc set with the film on Blu Ray on disc one and lots of special features on standard DVD on disc two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton","review":"This movie was an excellent representation of the man the Germans hated, and the Allies despised.

The language also has probably been edited (euphamisms for the F word) which I am fairly sure were in the original.I am extremely diappointed in the manufacturer for doing something like this to the film without informing it's audience and buyers...seems like faud to me.The original movie was great, a cut version is by definition less so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD !!!","review":"I got two patton DVD a while back, it's the same picture as on this DVD. I gave one to a buddy, and both DVD's were bad about half way into the movie. I want to buy another one, but dont want to get my hopes up and be let down again.

The reason I give it 1 star is,is that the quality of the disks,both of them,was so poor that they got hung-up on the very first attempt to play them,on 2 different players! Absolute rubbish. I will never buy a dvd from amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a full version of the DVD-Patton","review":"I purchased the DVD movie, Patton, because it is one of my favorite films. It came as a two-disc set. The first disc was the movie, but not the complete version of the movie. It only showed the first half. The Normandy section and the ending was completely left out, although it did show the credits.The second disc was only the bonus features, which showed a documentary and clips of the movie.I'm am very disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transfer is good, but spooky-smooth","review":"If you expect this movie to have a film look to it, you will be disappointed. It's spooky the way it looks like it was shot last year with HD video cameras instead of 40 years ago in glorious 70mm.The aspect ratio is correct at 2.2:1, the colors look good, if a bit more vibrant than I expected (I may have to check the mode on my LG TV, which sometimes forgets to use my calibrated settings.)Judging by the occasional spot that flickers by, not alot of hand effort went into this master, and I would still prefer to see a better effort.At $10 on a gold box deal, it's totally worth it given that the better remastering that was talked about early last year still hasn't appeared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patton - Blu-ray WOW!","review":"This classic movie has been reviewed enough here so I am just reviewing the Blu-ray edition of Patton. All I can say is WOW!!! It is as if they made the movie yesterday. The sharpness is a wonder to behold. The sound will blow your socks off. I have owned this movie Patton in every version it has come out as this is one of my all time favorite movies. If you love this movie, you'll love it even more in Blu-ray. Being a movie that is 40 years old, I didn't expect much when they put this movie into Blu-ray, but they did a fantastic job.

But what happens is that once you wrangle the top open, the panels collapse and you are forced to cram the hay into a non-rigid assembly, and then somehow get the top to \\"lock\\" back up. This is WAY too much effort to expend a couple of times per day, and the irritation it caused was just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-read\\" for any teenager.","review":"A gripping tale of survival; a man and his children who saved each other. It is clear that this father holds his children in high esteem as he describes the pain and starvation that his family had to endure. The children are remarkably adept, quickly learning and applying survival techniques. For instance, the oldest daughter, by sheer will and determination, lifted her father up a cliff to avoid being swept away by the strong waves. These children worked together to overcome hypothermia, starvation and infection from wounds and frostbite. It is a book that makes you reflect on your own situation and leads you to ask the question, 'Would I be able to survive under those circumstances?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror in the Northland, a fight for survival","review":"This terrifying fight for survival against all odds had me glued to my chair. I couldn't put it down. I just bought 4 copies to give to each of my children for Christmas. We were living in Alaska at the time this happened and I remembered having seen the interview of the family on TV. Even knowing they managed to somehow survive this unbelievable ordeal, I couldn't put the book down. The faith, trust, and love this family had for each other was remarkable and I believe it is what gave them the strength to make it through. I still can't believe they lived through all of that. No food, no warm clothing, no shelter and subfreezing winds in the middle of the coldest part of winter, it's a miracle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Honour","review":"Slow start to this book but a good read once the plot is established!

Having been entirely educated in the American school system - we barely glazed over the US treatment of Japanese during the war. I had no idea until I read this book the extent of the mistreatment and injustice that Japanese immigrants and citizens of Japanese decent were subject to during the war. As a story, this book is fabulous, as a tool for education it is a start. Today's youth will pick this up out of interest and they will learn something new. Of course if they want more accurate facts they will have to try the dryer literary works in the history section!! But, at least they will learn a little more about where our country has been and what we have done to our own citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING!","review":"When I first picked up \`Silent Honor\` I didn't know that the journey the book would take me through would be so full with emotions of every kind possible. So much occurs in the book that it is not humanly possible to write it all down but all I can say is that when you first pick up this book you will read it through every spare minute you have. A masterpiece by any writers standards Danielle Steel's novel of a Japanese girl living through the war in America is one of quality that no other writer can produce. Danielle Steel, will she ever stop?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sack those research assistants Danielle","review":"This novel is so wrong it is actually funny.The cover design alone should be enough of a warning that this book is wide of the mark, it's red and gold, which are popular in the Chinese palette, but not Japan.I bought this book for my Japanese wife and from the very first sentence she started giggling at the ridiculous errors.The first character introduced in the novel has the alleged family name of Takashimaya.Takashimaya is not a family name in Japan, but it is the name of a very well known upscale department store chain.(The suffix ya means shop, btw).Maybe the Japanese translation of this novel has a lead character named Mister Nieman Marcus?I could go on but I am laughing too much to type properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good historical info, but poor in story-line","review":"This book was very informative regarding the Japanese internment.

I couldn't believe that they were so young, and that they are so honest and natural in their sound, which seems to come straight from the heart. Wow!!!! We are seeing the future giants of blues just taking off, all our own, for those who have caught on early!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"Overall, a pretty strong album. I bought this on the strength of a few songs I heard on KPIG (kpig.com, a great radio station) especially \\"The Things We Do\\". This album is about 1/2 of that nice orginal blues based, sort of indie rock sound, combined with some workmanlike Stevie Ray influenced straight blues numbers. Their own sound is much better and \\"The Things We Do\\" is a real ear bug. Overall good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!! Flawless guitar work.","review":"This is the best cd I have bought in quite awhile. I received it on wed and played it fours times in three days. Am ordering their other one right now. Stevie has been reserected and better than ever. Hope to see them live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well -- A waste of money","review":"I ordered this product as well as a set of extra Swissmar stoppers -- it was one of those things that sounds good, but turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, and never lives up to the promise. There's no way to tell for sure if you have a vacuum, unless you bend the release pin on the stopper, but then of course if you had a vacuum, you just released it. And if you do get a good seal, it slowly releases over time.But here's the biggest warning: if you're planning on storing wine bottles or other beverages on their side (like in a wine rack), they will leak thru the stopper. I've tried this a number of times (I store bottles on their side in the fridge), being careful to pump the best vacuum I can, and everytime, they leak, leaving a small puddle of wine below the stopper. If you plan to store bottles like this, don't waste your money. Do a search for \\"leak-proof\\" wine stoppers. You'll find better products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Wine Saver","review":"This item was an exciting find for me, but clumsy to use on some wine bottles and not made of very good quality materials.

Putting on my headphones every time just to watch a video is getting to be extremely annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible according to Dino De Laurentiis","review":"Read the book! Nice cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno, but, read the book! The only good scene is when Stephen Boyd confronts the Tower of Babble. This is the type of film that put good actors like Stephen Boyd, rest his soul, out of work. By the way, I must say that Stephen had nice eye shadow. That is a sad testament for a team of good filmmakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie Version","review":"I found this to be a poetic, faithful version of much of the book of Genesis. Much of the narration and dialog are taken directly from the Scriptures. Some of the casting is superb, especially John Huston as Noah, Stephen Boyd as Nimrod, George C. Scott as Abraham, Ava Gardner as Sarah and Peter O'Toole as the angels who visit Abraham. Other lesser known actors and actresses do well also. At times the movie is slow-moving, but that can be a good thing, and I think that many people would find it rewarding if they watch it through. Some scenes are artfully done and stay with me, such as the Creation, the flight of Cain, the Tower of Babel and Abraham's (Abram's) rescue of Lot in battle. The musical score is beautiful also. At least some of the costuming is accurately based upon archaeological and Scriptural evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Old Testament Movie Out There!","review":"I have watched a lot of Biblical movies and this is the best in my opinion. When anybody retells the story of God and His people it must be done with accuracy and great respect for God's Word. A lot of movies and audio versions often try to make the Bible more exciting by adding extra dialogue or special affects but it only distracts and shows complete disrespect for our Heavenly Father by doing so. This is one of those rare movies that tells His Story in a low key and subtle way but also in a very moving and powerful way. My kids and I love to watch this movie over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Beginning...","review":"This is an old movie. No, it is not perfect, but it is one of the better ones. A must have for your home Bible movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presentation Could Be Better","review":"John Huston's filmization of the first few chapters of the Book of Genesis is good, though not as fine as it certainly could have been, given the material to work with. Much of the second half of the film is rather boring, with a great deal of monotonous conversation between the characters. The first half of the movie is much better, with Huston's humorous characterization of Noah a highlight.Most upsetting of all is the DVD presentation. The box indicates the film is presented in a 2.55:1 ratio, which is a super widescreen image. Instead, the film is shown in what looks like 2.20:1. Interestingly, the widescreen VHS tape presents the film in 2.35:1. Therefore, for some reason, we are being robbed of part of the film image. Why? The film gets 3 stars, but I take one away because of the botched presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible ,,,,, In the Beginning","review":"I first purchased this movie when it was on VHS.

He is always talking about the actors of these ancient films. So he was excited when we were able to find these movies online. We ordered it and when it arrived he was anxious to put it on and watch it. However, we shortly found out that the format of the film is not playable in U.S.A bought DVD players, so it does not work; we tried to play it on several players. But the result was the same, did not play."},{"rating":"2","title":"a valid epic minus the silly serpent in the tree","review":"Sit back and enjoy the artistic vision of the commencement of judeo-christian culture. i like my Bible and history movies to be as accurate as possible and this one did okay. the serpent in the tree was portrayed by an ominous man hidden in the shadows of the branches which was silly. all of the \\"bad\\" characters use lots of dark make-up and jewelry made of bones in order to villify themselves. it's slow, but grand. One wishes it could go on and tell the story of jacob and joseph and moses and joshua, but i guess a movie about the whole bible might be a bit of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible.. In The Beginnig","review":"For $50.00 it was a waste of about $49.99. The quality was iffy at best! The pic quality would go from being horrid to (maybe) O.K.? The prongs that should have held the CD in place are busted off? So the cd flopped around in the box? If my mom didn't want this movie so badly I would have NEVER accepted it! It is the largest waste of money I have ever spent on a movie! I did replace the case. I can deal with that but the quality was a sick joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $, read the book","review":"one of the last of the biblical epics, this was a bomb in its initial release, and deservedly so. the movie doesnt know whether it is de mille or italian realism, and most of the sequences (adam & eve, tower of babel) are either laughable or langorous (george c scott & ava gardner as abraham & sarah). yet stuck in the middle is a fine half hour sequence of the story of noah, with director john huston casting himself in the one strong sequence in the movie: replete with the right mix of humor and awe. that half hour isnt enough to recommend buying or renting the dvd, but if you can catch it on tv some day, its worth a half hour of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, boring","review":"From a scriptural standpoint, it isn't too bad. But the production is rather poor, as others in the reviews mentioned. The use of color in the film makes the scenes feel dull. And the acting is rather average.I think this would be a good movie for young children, though. They aren't as critical as we adults and they will probably get more out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was hoping for more soothing songs with the flute with nature background and got neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique approach","review":"I picked up this book from an occult shop as a sort of curio around 2000, and only got a chance to read it this weekend. While clearly self-published, the information is valuable, and the authors make some effort to answer to scientific concerns, albeit the response is \\"you probably won't like this.\\"I'm wishing that this came out at a time when online networking was common, as I can see this type of work being invaluable. It doesn't matter if the entities are just extensions of the unconscious mind or literal beings - if this form of visualization and release genuinely helps people and can be done without invasive surgery or chemical alteration, it's well worth exploring.

But to be perfectly honest I find that kind of annoying. I don't think people appreciate exactly how brilliant this movie is. I think it should have been at least nominated for best picture that year. The songs are very well written and catchy. The musical arrangements are very organic and seventies. And the comedy is wonderfully deadpan. And in the end the movie doesn't try to teach a lesson or wrap things up in a neat accessible package but rather kind of leaves you in cold. As though to bring you on a strange ride then they leave you in desolation. Genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening, trite junk. don't hate me cause I hate it","review":"It is totally lost on me how this film has a such a cult following. I'm no stranger to the macabre, the bizarre, or a mix of the two. But to what purpose does all of this serve?It's not scary, and not funny. The song lyrics are one-note, juvenile and lame. \\"Damn it, Janet\\" over and over.Har har har.The cult status is almost sickening. Just look at the negative votes on the one-star reviews, no matter how well-written they are. That's right, the fanboys just want to de-grade sensible, well-written reviews. If you like the film, that's fine, I'm glad you took something away from the experience that I didn't.

I've TRIED very hard to see what it is about this film that's so incredibly awesome, but I can't find ANYTHING I like about it! The oft-quoted dialogue is inane, the songs are weak, and the characters are a collection of gothic flakes that only other gothic flakes could identify with. I've been in a theater with a large number of Rocky Horror devotees, and it was a weird experience --- this one guy sitting on the floor near me kept saying \\"jokes\\" throughout the film --- and NOT A SINGLE ONE WAS EVEN THE REMOTEST BIT AMUSING --- not even the other devotees were laughing!

The video re-release, complete with the full version of 'Superheroes' (if you don't know, you'll have to watch it!!), has delighted Rocky fans everywhere, and is well worth a first viewing (and a second, third, fourth, fifth, etc etc). The script as the actors knew it has changed slightly over the years, due to the audience taking it upon themselves to add bits when and where they choose, but this all adds to the fun!!

You should all be ashamed! This movie is so bad that when they released it in movie theaters, people started making jokes at the movie, and started doing \\"slapstick\\" responses to the movie. Eventually, this became the norm, and fans started calling it the \\"rituals\\" that you performed during the movie when you went and seen it. For example, when a certain line in the movie was said, everyone in the theater would run to the back wall and hit it with their hands as fast as they could. These \\"rituals\\" got so out of hand, it eventually became a cult. You had to go through an initiation if it was your first time seeing the movie.

Do you wanna know who really loves this film? People who were Theater Majors in college and now work as greeters at Wallmart, that's who.

So, transvestites are good. However, this movie isn't. Now, Welcome to Spring Break is a good movie, as it features many nice episodes that quite possibly were never even considered as part of this trash. In fact, this movie has no creamy filling. A 25th anniversary edition? Why not just buy Where's Waldo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those people are nuts!","review":"If you think this is such a great film being cult and all, then you are wrong. It's a classic when I was in high school blah, blah, blah. My dad would always talk about how stupid kids in his class would be because they were so addicted to this movie. He thought it was okay at first until it bacame like what pokemon ended up like last year when I was a snot nosed freshman. But then I saw it and it insulted me as a horror movie fan. And now, I look through the reviews of this movie and see what they think about it. Personally, this is what I think about them:Those people are nuts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this before it's gone!","review":"Well, I don't have much to say about THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Either you get it, or you don't, and either you love it, or you hate it; I've never discovered a \\"middle ground\\" of opinion about this film.More importantly for you, the RHPS fan, is that you scoop this title up quick! FOX is quickly putting their special edition DVDs out of print, and already they've begun to replace this excellent 2-disc set with a much less impressive, plain vanilla 1-disc. The special features and documentary features on this disc are quite good, and though I found the menus a little annoying, they're certainly a minor complaint to this otherwise fine release. Get it now, before it's gone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think This Is The Most Must See Movie Ever!","review":"This is the funniest, craziest, most outstanding movie I have ever seen. It is and always will be my favorite! You can not get a better movie soundtrack then this one, which is filled with wonderful songs throughout the movie. You'll probably never get to see Tim Curry or Susan Sarandon in their underwear again which is reason enough for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll shiver with antici... pation.","review":"An excellent movie. Though advertised as having two additional songs, they actually take place after the movie. They're not dubbed in (like they should be) and Brad's solo in Over at the Frankenstien Place is still missing. However, it's still one of the best movies ever made.

I go to see the movie + a live performance almost evey friday night just to sing and dance to all the songs, especially the time warp. And if we cant go see it then we rent it and have a show of our own and act it out. If they ever had a sequal I would be the first person in line to audition.It's inspired me to want to work at the theatre where it plays Friday nigths at midnight just so I can act in it.For any one who has not seen it and loves those fun musical movies RHPS is the one to see it's like a grease were you would run around singiung all the songs or dancing to the dances but better, and this aint no goood goody love story, welll not really anyway!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rocky horror","review":"received the film quickly, it was in excellent condition, all in all a good transaction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated user","review":"I have found this DVD extremely frustrating.

The DVD would not play on one computer. My other would play the DVD if I downloaded egregiously invasive software and registered it with an actual email addy. In other words, I was giving Fox an invitation to spam. When the DVD finally began to play, I was inundated with ads to buy other Fox DVDs. When I tried to expand to full screen, I was given an error message and requestd to download an 'enhancement' to the WIN '95 & '98 package (How modern the folks at Fox are...NOT!). The enhancement felt that my birthdate was vital to the process. No wonder people are pirating movies online.Since I opened the DVD case (How stupid of me to think the movie would simply open and play as all my other DVDs have.) I violated the Amazon policy on DVD returns. I am going back through my open orders and eliminate anything that has the Fox logo."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of video tape","review":"I think the summary pretty well sums it up.

But, that's the magic of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good conversion quality","review":"The blu-ray conversion quality is good and the movie itself...well its Rocky Horror...you either love it or you hate it. The extras are pretty cool and always worth the extra buck, at this price any Rocky Horror fan should grab this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love the Classics","review":"Who doesn't love this old classic funny movie? Tim Curry still makes me laugh yet he's one of the best villians of all time.

Who can resist it?Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rocky Horror Picture Show","review":"I rented this video for Halloween. I's still the campy, funny musical adventure I remember.

I first watched this movie when I was in boarding school and had the shock of my life when my housemaster burst into our TV room. Rather than being reprimanded for watching something a bit risque at a prep school, my housemaster astounded us all by singing along to Toucha Toucha Me!The extra DVD is full of little quirks, behind the scenes, and video sequences guaranteed to satisfy all of us. It also comes with an audience participation sequence for those of us not willing to go out to the theatres without being properly prepared!Let's do the Time Warp again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Horror Picture Show","review":"Fantastic movie!

Worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies of all time!","review":"Though seeing this movie in a theater at midnight with a hundred other fantatics just like you is a downright amazing experience, I never tire of watching this movie over and over. Invite you friends, sing along, say the lines with the characters and you'll find yourself not wanting to ever turn it off or see the movie end. Hilarious and wickedly sexy and twisted. You'll love it from start to finish, and on the dvd, the added features make it all the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIMEWARP","review":"Something different, something wild. Not your typical show. A Cult Classic that keeps on bring them back for more. If you like something not so traditional this is the show for you. Filled with an all star cast that sings and acts, Tim Curry, Meatloaf, Susan Sarandon and more. For those that want to get totally involved promps and behind the scenes looks are all included in the fun. It's diffinitely a timewarp of fun and laughs as men in lingere put on a show. It feel good singalong show of fun. After all what other show do you get to actual do more than sit, waterguns and newspapers, clapping and more. Different is good.

This decadent morsel of cinema is a truly pleasing experience and few metaphors or messages at all can apply to it. It is just fun. o'brien, the author of the musical, has combined the pop culture of the 50's (bad sci-fi, comic books, charles atlas) with the sexual revolution style decadence of the 70's and added music. The result is a wonderful concoction with something for every body.

There's a reason why this motion picture...and I use that term loosely in this case...failed miserably when first released. Because it's God-awful and stupid. It was only after many years of playing as a 'midnight movie' that it finally made any money. Even then, the show was frequented by high school drop-outs, hippie wanna-be types and other losers who had nothing better to do than try to act like the idiot characters on the screen. Jeez....not even 'I Spit On Your Grave' or 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' were this bad.With a sincere apology to Tim Curry, who is an otherwise fine actor, but here, he is just one VERY ugly alien transvestite singing silly songs. And his name...Frank-N-Furter? Ooooh...how original. I wonder how many functioning, non-drug addicted brain cells it took to think that up??If this film is your idea of a great movie, well, all I can say is that you have my sympathies......"},{"rating":"1","title":"All dressed up and nowhere to go...","review":"Maybe it's the camp. Maybe it's the grating music. Or just having to see Tim Curry and Barry Bostwick in drag. This movie is AWFUL, and I certainly don't mean \\"it's so bad it's good\\". It's puerile and self-indulgent, and a sure-fire remedy for boredom. Because faced with the prospect of having to watch this movie would get me motivated to do anything but that.OK, I'm willing to concede that RHPSh as some sort of attempt to make a 70s anthem for gays (or anyone else unaccepted by mainstream society). Find the courage in your alleged \\"freakishness\\" and ta-daa! It's outta the closet and \\"Heeeelloooo world!\\" After all, the \\"straights\\" and their society are the true freakish forces in the universe, and the \\"evil\\" Frank 'n Furter just wanted to create a safe haven for his kind. And besides, EVERYONE has a little hidden freak inside them just clamoring to get out.Still, this movie is beyond unwatchable.

Now that I know where \\"The time warp\\" comes from, I think I could die without hearing that song ever again. There is absolutely NO story line, the characters are NOT relatable and stupid, and the songs all SUCK! What is the big deal about this junk!?

The original is still the best.

Stay with the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, whatever...","review":"Although I do think the songs are very good (please note this, Rocky Horror fans, before you start pelting me with rice, rotten tomatoes, dead fish etc) I think that the movie is just too weird. All the actors were great, really throwing themselves into it, but I think the plot is ridiculous. I mean, look at the ending! Also you can't really feel for any of the characters because Janet and Brad are too dumb and goody-goody and everyone else is too weird. Overall I'd rather watch something with a bit more plot and a bit less sensationalism. It actually got (shock, horror) BORING after a while.

I can hardly imagine this a Saturday matinee for even one week's time.Thank goodness for Greenwich Village's WAVERLY THEATER that started the midnight cult phenomenon that has been legendary for 30 years. This movie was actually partially responsible for making New York City theaters like THE WAVERLY and the 8TH STREET PLAYHOUSE famous.So with a reputation like that, it would seem that ROCKY HORROR is damn near flawless. But as a pure film, without the fun of the audience participation, that's not so. The first half nearly jumps out of its socks with excitement and music. By the time you're into the latter half, it has slowed to an almost comatose level. Even the songs have lost their edge by then.But for its flaws, it's timeless fun to be watched over and over again, even if it's only on your TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie.","review":"To keep this short I just want to say that this is a great movie.For some it may not make sense,but it's their loss.The music is addictive and Tim Curry gives an exellent performance as the sweet transvestite.I recomend this cult classic because its fun and I promise you won't get tired of it so what are you waiting for?Once you you watch it you'll want to be doing the \\"Time Warp again!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very very different than any other movie I have seen","review":"I have never seen this type of movie with so much that makes people want to relate to it.

After you read the reviews you tend to think that this game may have something but NO DICE. The game controls are clunky to say the least. The one player mode is not worth playing and the background story is lame. 2 player is a little better but there are only a few levels you can really sink your teeth into. If you've played 1st person shooting games in the past you will notice right away that it lacks the kind of interactive and expansive gun play that other games can provide. Four words, \\"don't waste your time!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fastest paced game ever - the best action I've ever seen","review":"This game will bewilder you by its speed alone.

This is the best multiplayer First Person Shooter (FPS) game ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the top 3 launch titles","review":"This game actually gets better the more you play it. I recommend it highly. As you progress through the less than amazing storyline, you unlock cool parts of the game (same as Goldeneye). Multiplayer action is faster and fun.

I was totally dissapointed with this game. I was thinking that it would be a great game because it is played on a PS2 console but this game is terrible. The graphics are bland and the story mode is terrible. I got bored of this game in 5 minutes. The music is really annoying. The game is just really boring. If you want a first-person shooter buy Unreal Tournament, don't waste your time with this game. This game was, in my opinion, thrown together too quickly just to make the first day rush. If you were planning to buy this game i would highly not recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queasy","review":"I bought this game right after I recieved my PS2 because it looked fun. I'm into futuristic stuff, and that's what I was getting from the front of it. However, it is not futuristic other than the fact that there are a couple of characters that are from the future. I hated the game. The controls are extremely hard to master (though it can be done, and I'm sure they can be changed), and you have to spin a lot. It sounds stupid, but it can get you extremely \\"motion\\" sick and queasy feeling. I took it to a video game place to trade it in, and the guy ended up only giving me about $25 for a barely used game because so many people had traded theirs in.I definitely wouldn't suggest this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pathetic","review":"This game isn't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1.

This game has many multiplayer modes (capture the bag, deathmatch, co-operative, escort, assasin, knockout, target practice, flag tag, and reverse flag tag). there sre over 50 multiplayer characters, and the game comes w/ a VERY simple map editor for multiplayer. there is also a single player mode w/ 9 levels. there are 9 levels for multiplayer too, but you can make ur own levels w/ the level editor, and u can unlock all the single-player levels to play. it supports multitap for 4 players and its gonna be GRRRRREEEEEEAAAATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The control of this game is awful.

But when i eventually did get round to buying it i managed to complete the story mode 3 hours after purchase. The Story Mode consists of about 6 levels which are all exactly the same with the slight exception of the terrain and the enemys.When ever you complete a level you cen either unlock new enemys which doest make a difference because all their abilitys are the same, you can unlock new challenge modes which are extremly similar to the story mode.The game doesnt even have a story unlike some games. Youve just been put in this world to go around killing a bunch of peole for some odd reason. The game is the same from start to finish a complete bore. I would recommend Unreal Tornament for the PC which alot better and more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but hard to control","review":"This game is different for a First Person Shooter...quite a bit different concept that most games, but is too difficult to control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Played it just in Time","review":"I played this game at my friends house a little while back. I was gonna by this when I first got my PS2 but instead sprung for Unreal Tournament. While I liked Unreal I found Timesplitters to be an almost First Person Shooter Nirvana of sorts. The game was built to be the Mario Party of First Person Shooters [I mean actually fun to play by yourself as well as with friends]. It is designed so that it has easy to learn controls and gameplay. It comes with great multi-player support and an average single player game [for those who have a lot of time to themselves]. But, This game was designed to be a blazing fast multi-player fight-a-thon. It comes with other modes such as, hold the base, capture the flag and grab the bag. These different ways of play will keep you and your friends huddled around your tv and keep many up way past their bedtimes. great shooter overall and fun in most respects. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"TimeSplitters is a non-stop action romp in the PS2 woods","review":"This game is enthralling from the very beginning where u must get an item that's inside a mummy's tomb. From the very beginning, u must dodge bullets and shoot everyone that gets in your way. Nobody can stop the TimeSplitters except u, so give em a shotgun shell to the face.This game is fast, fun, but not a very good game when it comes to depth. So if ur looking for a party game or a game u can play with ur friends- THIS IS THE GAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Goldeneye or Perfect Dark","review":"Although a decent FPS, it fails in comparison to the N64 titles that have dominated the console FPS market, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark.

But the controls plain out .... You HAVE to use both of the analog sticks to move around, you don't even have the option to use the control pad (which I always use). If you're a joystick person, you'll like it, if not, you'll go crazy after playing 5 minutes.If only they had different types of controls like in Goldeneye (where they had 1.1,1.2,1.3, etc.).The small things are great in this game, like the graphics, they glass shattering when you shoot through it, and the explosions are all great.But a game with ... controls is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Control?","review":"I wanted to love this game, but the controls made it impossible to play. I'm shocked at the love fest this has generated, given the awfull control options. A little code to support a USB mouse would have been greatly appreciated here! I spent all my time trying to get my cross hairs aimed at something while getting plugged full holes. I had a few ideas about configuring the control layout to make it playable, but the rigid pre-defined choices wouldn't allow it. Traded it within a few days for something that was actually fun to play. Rent it, and see if you can live with the controls first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fastest FPS for the PS2","review":"Timesplitters is a very fast, customizable and graphically impressive game. Although many of the characters look [strange] they can all run around and shoot but the bad thing is is that there is no jump feature and the music is mediocre. Overall, if you have a PS2, buy this game. Also, dont forget to buy Unreal Tournament- that is also excellent game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fun!","review":"I don't know if I came into this game with low expectations or what, but after reading some of the harsh reviews I'm a little beside myself because next to SSX this is my favorite game on the PS2. This is a title that should have been at the top of everyone's launch day list, yet I bought it on a whim at Christmas and I've gotta say that my friends and I have had nothing but a blast fragging the heck out of each other for the past three months. This game isn't deep when it comes to single player/story mode, but the excitement is definitely there for those who enjoy a ridiculous frag fest alone or with some friends. I'm thoroughly pleased with this purchase and you will be too if you're looking for some crazy, amusing frag fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for 2-4 player action!!","review":"This game is awesome. Although there is no solid plot, it doesn't really matter. The levels are challenging, but the main reason for buying this game is the multiplayer. In this game you can set the difficulty of your opponents, and there is a vast array of unique and powerful weaponry. You can play \\"Deathmatches\\" by yourself, or with 1-3 friends. At first, the controls are difficult to manage, but once you get the hang of it the game is elevated to a whole new level. The game-play is fast paced, and it is the best multiplayer since Goldeneye. This is an awsome game. (A reason for playing the missions is to unlock levels, cheats, characters, and challenges)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the PS2 MUST haves!!!","review":"This game is sick. I've had it for about three months now, and I've played this game at least 3 hours a week.

Otherwise get Unreal Tournament is just as good, but better weapons."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent it first","review":"This game Has ps1 graphics all over it.

It conveniently houses 208 photos in one album.There is one problem. Some of the pockets, which are made for 4 x 6 photographs, are too small. The photographs were cut to the appropriate size. They fit in the pockets that are cut correctly. It is just that some of the pockets are slightly smaller than 4 X 6.I am about to order another in hopes that this problem was an anomaly.

Formed by a History teacher from PIPER High School in the late 80s - Early 90's. the Band was made up of a few former students. but, the line-up changed perpetually. I believe Black Janet recorded 2 albums, (this being the 2nd) , The first was a rather unpolished but charming cassette and more of a demo.(I have this on cassette tape) I attended the release party for Love Thirsty at a club called Squeeze in Ft.Lauderdale,Fl. I would say their sound was dark progressive/goth-pop. I never went to a Cd release for any other local band, which tells you I had high hopes for them.

My high-end German knives have other problems, so I'd say this is a very good deal in a decent knife for everyday use.

Hailey researches his topic well before he begins to write and in this novel he exposes all of the corruption that takes place in the auto industry, like crooked dealerships, crime syndicates within the factories, and executives who twist the books to make a profit.Wheels is a good book if you like novels that are informative because there are tons of info jam packed into this book; but there really isn't a whole lot of action and with the way that Hailey switches from character to character, it is hard to find out who the main character is and what his struggle is. I would read this book if you are interested in the auto industry and want to learn more about it. I wouldn't read it if you are looking for a book with action in it because it will bore you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to Standards","review":"I've read Hotel, Evening News and The Moneychangers so I picked this up based on Hailey's name only. Luckily I only spent a quarter on it at a library sale. I have ten pages left and am still trying to figure out what exactly is the plot. It's not a terrible read (I would have put it down if it was) but it never really gets going. Some of the characters are developed but the one I believe is supposed to the main character (Adam Trenton) is not.

I was expecting a lot more than what this book had to offer. The cell phone and toys were just too weird for my taste and were very unbelievable for me. I love romantic time-travel, but once you have read magical tales of the here and then, it's really hard to beat.

The story was OK and I enjoyed it once I got into it, but there were so many unbelievable things that wouldn't really happen in time travel, like Kathy's phone working in 1542. Kathy appeared a little ditsy in the first part of the book. Loved the way Peter would always use movie quotes throughout the story and Ian's cat was an interesting character. The biggest disappointment to me was the ending...felt like it was a cop-out. It left me hanging on what happened to Ian.

Consequently, a modern audience really needs more of a background about WW2 to appreciate what they are seeing here. Rommel gave tacit approval to the attempt on Hitler's life, and was arranging with other military leaders to take control of the situation after his death, in the hope of holding a firm line. But one of the conspirators does point out the risk that with Hitler, the Allies might not even stop at a truce before invading Germany itself, because of everything else that had already happened under his regime.

Try as they might, no composer (including Rodgers and Hammerstein) has surpassed it.Having said that, I would recommend the 1993 recording of the Original London Cast of the Nicholas Hytner revival of \\"Carousel\\" over this one. While I am a bigger fan of the voices here (especially John Raitt and Jan Clayton), the truncated numbers and out-and-out cuts make listening to this album a tragic experience.I am usually a believer that the original cast recording is the one to buy as it represents what the composer had in mind while putting the show together, but I do not believe that here. The 1993 recording is far better than this. While this 1945 recording does hold an important place in history, the 1993 recording should be considered definitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand the test of time","review":"Yikes. I bought this based on the reviews (and because I prefer the original cast recordings as well). But quite frankly, this album is no fun to listen to. If you like Sound of Music, Cinderella, and that style, you will not like this. It is very dense, and somewhat tortured sounding, as is the story. Robert Russell Bennett is not involved in the orchestration, so that may account for the music. And the wry humor and satirical, yet loving insights that I expect from Hammerstein are missing as well.

If we force young people to serve in another country then we need to protect them from legal system they don't understand. Instead, military justice is imposed. My experience was that this was fair to everyone concerned.If you trust Rush Limbaugh and such to give you all the information that you need... then you will love this guy.

Chalmers Johnson has spent years as a career diplomat in east Asia, and he knows what he's talking about.

For those of us, which is nearly all of us, who at times get caught up in attractions of material possessions, it's painfully too real for comfort. Still, after a number of viewings, I'd label it a classic, possibly the best of its type at what it is dramatizing. As such, it also dramatizes the moral to the story - always seek a win/win situation in all negotiations, especially relationships. There's no such thing as love which is moral, unless it entails quid pro quo. None but God, angels, and dogs, are capable of unconditional love, and God has one condition, which the Roses either rejected, or never bothered to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"video","review":"Excellent Video.

Then, when it was over, I actually thought the whole story had been fabricated by the Danny DiVito character in order for him to get his client to reconcile with his wife.If you can't stand beautiful things being senselessly destroyed and depressing endings, this movie is not for you.

In Big Jake you will get lots of adventure, action, laughter, and Americanism. The whole family gets into the act. The Duke has always stood tall, and Big Jake is no exception. I love seeing one Man make a difference. And The Duke does. In all of his movies. I say John Wayne for President. Any one who likes westerns will like John Wayne in Big Jake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Violent","review":"\\"Big Jake\\" was the worst western John Wayne ever made. There wasway too much violence and the actors that played his sons were not believable.Bruce Cabot was good in the role of an Indian scout but needlessly was killed off right at the end of the movie along with the dog.The dog was probably the best actor in the entire movie but his actions were not beleivable.This was one of John Wayne's Batjac productions and was a total failure just as \\"The Alamo\\" was.Better to watch \\"True Grit\\" or \\"The Cowboys.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does not work","review":"I recently received the movie Big Jake off of amazon and the movie will not play in the DVD player. It says there is no readable disk in the player?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wayne Movie","review":"This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. It features John Wayne's son in it and has many memorable quotes. It's great for anyone who loves westerns or is a John Wayne fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THE DUKE'S BEST, BUT TOUGH TO DISLIKE!","review":"This is the only John Wayne movie I was lucky enough to see in the theater. I sat through this film 3 times that day! It is a fun picture and John Wayne was one of those stars who could make any picture work. Seeing it again now, it brought back a lot of good memories, even if it wasn't as good as I remembered. The DVD transfer looks good on my widescreen collection version, but I see there is a newer release. I don't know if they restored or remastered the print on the newer version. Anyone know if they did?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable John Wayne Flick","review":"Being a John Wayne fan for many years, I wanted to refresh my memory about some of his movies. I searched the Internet to find the movie about Wayne's (Jake's) grandson being kidnapped. I found the title easily and then my task was to locate where I could purchase it. Good old reliable Amazon had the movie available and in stock. I sent for it and in no time it was in my mailbox and I was able to watch and enjoy the movie \\"Big Jake\\". A bit more violence than I like in one scene late in the movie but over all I did enjoy it.Thanks for being so accomodating and efficient, Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great John Wayne, Great Supporting Roles","review":"As usual it is a typical great John Wayne movie. (I'm partial to any of his movies.) A good portrayal of a time when horseless carriages were joining horse and wagon. The supporting roles are well played. His son, Patrick Wayne along with Christopher Mitchum do a very good job of portraying two dissimilar sons that have not seen their dad in a long while. Richard Boone adds to the character of the film and of course Maureen O'Hara is as natural as ever as an actress. Bruce Cabot is a long standing support actor for John Wayne and is just as good!I can't give it 5 stars because of the violence. I don't watch it as much as all of his others because of it. The opening scenses and two other particular scenes, that are not boldly shown but the viewer knows exactly what is happening, some children and sensitive viewers might not be able to handle. I recommend viewing at 13+.Good enough to add to a John Wayne movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacob McCandles Is Still Alive And Kicking..","review":"..kicking butt that is,BIG JAKE is one of the Duke's better roles featuring an all star cast,Maureen McGovern,Richard Boone,Bruce Cabot,Patrick Wayne, and Chris Mitchum. The Duke is Jake McCandles,who's tough,undiserable,and mean, taking no flack from anyone, including his own sons who will accompany Jake on a mission to rescue his grandson from outlaw Richard Boone and his ruthless gang. Loaded with plenty of action,gunplay, some light comedy, adds to all the ingredients of a classic John Wayne western,when you watch a film with \\"the duke\\" you always know what to expect. This Paramount dvd is remastered with superior picture quality,5.1 surround,16x9 widescreen,no special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband Loves","review":"My husband is a huge John Wayne fan and he loves all his movies. It's nice to be able to find them here."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"This movie has it all, family values, action, adventure, shoot it's a action packed movie from start to finish and I believe everyone should see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Jake a Big Disappointment","review":"Great latter day Duke is \\"The Shootist\\". \\"Big Jake\\" has not aged well.I almost snoozed through the dull story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinkbomb alert--take cover","review":"John Wayne was as great as great can be when he was working for the major directors and had a good cast around him. His turkeys were invariably cooked up by his own production company Batjac, and this is one of them. Maybe when he was paying the bills he lost his sense of proportion or movie instincts, it's hard to tell. He certainly should have examined the script more closely: \\"Big Jake\\" doesn't have a single convincing scene or line of dialogue throughout. Wayne was 62 when it was filmed and as an action hero cuts a preposterous figure, lumbering through stunts he was a dozen years too old to do. At least earlier in \\"True Grit\\" and later in \\"The Shootist\\" this infirmity was written into the story; here it's ignored. The supporting cast except for Richard Boone is beneath contempt and even Boone is given some howlers to declaim. He looks positively grateful to be dead in the last scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crooks get theirs in the grand old style","review":"While the rest of Hollywood was turning out \\"anti-Westerns\\" like \\"Little Big Man\\" and \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\\" John Wayne kept showing how to do Westerns right. No \\"cute crooks\\" in this picture, no smart-aleck parts for Newman and Redford. Just a good, satisfying, robust good-guy-bad-guy showdown in which the bad guys get theirs, and how.The lobby cards and posters for \\"Big Jake\\" were really great. On the left was head kidnapper Richard Boone with all his gang lined up behind him. On the right was the Duke with his sons and friends backing him up. Everyone had their guns out, firing away. The slogan? Under Boone's mug, it said, \\"They wanted gold.\\" Under Wayne's: \\"They gave them lead.\\"Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Wayne Western","review":"Purchased this for my wife who is a big John Wayne and western fan. I like this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Jake, the man who put the bad guys in their place!","review":"Big Jake has always been a family favorite. Whenever it aired on TV, we watched it. If it were played 3-4 times a year, we watched it. You just can't beat the all-star cast. John Wayne, Bruce Cabot(very famous in the 1930'3 and 1940's) Richard Boone, as the lead bad guy, was a great choice. PAtrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum were both excellent choices to be his sons. Maureen O'Hara, as the ex-wife, she is still as beautiful as ever. All-in-all, a great action-packed western that holds up to the best. Big Jake, a real treat for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Swords and Sandals!","review":"This epic does, as a critic once said, go on and on. But I like it to go on and on for the most part. Besides the spare-no-expense spectacle, the best part of the movie are some of the excellent supporting cast. Rex Harrison, Marting Landau, Roddy McDowell and others do a great job of keeping the movie interesting. The weakest is Richard Burton. He played Antony as a drunk, which may have been true in his later years but it makes for a boring, sloppy, unlikeable character. Its a great movie in its own unique way, but be prepared for a long night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Sand","review":"The real tragedy of Cleopatra seems to be that she is doomed to be associated with this incredibly long, exceptionally tedious film, which attempts to compensate for lack of script, weak performances, and clearly studio-shot scenes with occasional bursts of irrelevant spectacle. With little to recommend it beyond the idea of Elizabeth Taylor as the famous queen-- a role which she plays rather poorly-- the film remains one of the single most boring motion pictures ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe I Saw the Whole Thing!","review":"The only part of the 3-DVD set (Cleopatra-Five Star Edition) worth watching is the two-hour documentary, \\"Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood.\\" Seeing the documentary on AMC is what led me to the regrettable decision to purchase the DVD set. Maybe it was watching \\"Julius Caesar\\" with James Mason, John Gielgud, and Marlon Brando the night before and \\"Citizen Kane\\" the night before that, but by comparison, the Taylor-Harrison-Burton \\"Cleopatra\\" is so bad that it's almost (but not quite) camp like the original TV \\"Batman\\" series. The script is pompous and incoherent, the sets are patently phony, the action scenes are pathetically inept and unbelievable, and resolution quality of the DVD release is quite inferior. If you must see this monstrosity, rent it because one viewing will be more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra - Five Star Collection?","review":"I am a big fan of all Elizabeth Taylor works, especially Cleopatra. But with all of the extras on the DVD, where is Liz? The lack of Liz in the DVD extras really disappointed me. Otherwise, I am very glad to own this DVD - I watched it all right away. The color and sound is a big improvement over my VHS copy and I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette. I was a little miffed that I had to change discs at intermission, but I suppose it was always a good place for a break. For the all it's minor disappointments, Cleopatra is still the most bang for the buck that I've seen to date on DVD. If you include all the extras, it breaks down to about $3USD/per hour of top notch Hollywood golden-era entertainment. If you're on the fence, don't hesitate - get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"edited","review":"It is to be hoped that when this epic finally makes it to Blu Ray/3d Blu Ray we will see the full restored Tod-AO 70mm 320 minute USA Directors Cut version and not this 192 minute cut version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is in German Language NOT English","review":"Order fulfillment was just fine as well as shipping times. Only complaint I have is that the movie is in German! Maybe it is something I missed when ordering although I have since re-read the order and saw nothing about it being in German - only that it shipped from Germany. It is useless to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic beauty","review":"I think Elizabeth Taylor was fabulous in this film. While the story does not hold entirely true to history, it is still a great epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Liz","review":"Always loved this move because always loved Elizabeth Taylor and of course, Richard Burton. This movie shows off Elizabeth's wonderful violet eyes and her most beautiful face in the world. Love every minute of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a classic","review":"The pagentry and beauty of this movie never fail to entertain. I love looking at the chemistry between Elizabeth Taylor and the two men in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredably beautiful movie","review":"Another classic movie with several great classic movie stars. This is one of the most beautiful movies of it's time. The chemistry between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton is electric. It's a long movie but well worth the time it takes to watch it so grab a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the sofa and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave it to Hollywood","review":"There's something about Hollywood always leaving gaps in films that deal with history.\\"Cleopatra\\" did have great dialogue and one can't deny the great cast: Liz Taylor, Rex Harrison, Richard Burton. However, more lavish were the costume changes and the sets, it added color to such a historic and epic story.Some of the story ofcourse is changed to fit it into Hollywood standards. I enjoyed the film particularly that it offered a visual into the lives of history's most controversial figures.There's nothing to truly argue about but the whole issue of Hollywood re-writing history in a film does bug me as most of the time they will change the whole story around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merri's Words","review":"The movie, Cleaopatra, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, is worth seeing, but, if possible, you should buy it second hand. That may sound like a half-hearted recommendation, and that is exactly what it is.It is worth it to see the sets and costumes and Miss Taylor is stunningly beautiful. However, the dialogue and pace of the movie will put most audiences to sleep!I also suspect that any resemblance to reality is purely accidental. Seeing Carol O'Connor (aka Archie Bunker) as a Roman soldier, for example, is quite jarring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesomely Bad","review":"Despite the lavish sets and really good acting from Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Martin Landau (was he ever so young????), and many others, this is a wretched film.Its wretchedness stems entirely from Liz Taylor.She manages an astonishing feat. She simultaneously overacts and is wooden.I don't know how she achieves such opposite things. She is breathtakingly bad, thrillingly terrible, awesomely awful.Apparently she was raised on a different planet, and then plunked down on the set. She has no idea what a human acts like, or what a real emotion is.This explains Michael Jackson's fascination with her: birds (?) of a feather.In a grotesque way, she is fun to watch, if you like watching bloody and terrible car wrecks over and over.Just ghastly. She would have to improve (A LOT) to suck.There aren't adjectives enough in the thesaurus to say how vomitrocious her performance (?) is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!","review":"I was severely disappointed by this movie. Expecting better of such a \\"classic\\" film, with so many big name actors, I really couldn't believe how bad it was. The script was awful, and the acting even worse. Rex Harrison was horrible as Caesar, reciting his lines in a most disconcertingly bizarre manner. Elizabeth Taylor was beautiful as Cleopatra but wooden, lacking any personality or sex appeal whatsoever. Richard Burton was somewhat better, but was hardly a charismatic figure. He was certainly a bloodless shadow in comparison to James Purefoy's Marc Antony in HBO's \\"Rome\\" series. The best that could be said is that the sets were lavish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"The DVD did not work after the first few chapters.

DVD Rescues This One","review":"I was never a major fan of this movie but I couldn't resist seeing it again. This is the type of film that works best on DVD - not only for the great picture and sound - but for the extras! The extras alone are worth the price of this package. And if you never saw the film before, prepare yourself for a real pleasure - this was never a truly great movie, but it remains a pleasure.The best part for me was the recovered footage from the aborted 1959 shoot with Peter Finch and Stephen Boyd. If you're a true movie nut - this stuff is must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"cleopatra f in german need usa","review":"will not play on my dvd it is in german it\\"s not what i woanted cleopatra would like to swap"},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived in Italian","review":"Really?

Wait to you see this and lovely Elizabeth in the actual thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!","review":"I Studied Cleopatra for my history class and i recently saw this Movie. While it was pretty accurate historically, i thought that it completly failed to bring Cleopatra to life. Rex harrison was pretty good as Caesar, and Burton was ok as Antony, but Taylor was terrible as Cleopatra! Also, the movie should have been called Caesar and Mark Antony and how Cleopatra affected them. Also, Cleopatra was ugly, why can't people accept this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Epic Movie That Launched A Thousand Cinematic Moments","review":"There's no other movie as lavish and rich as Cleopatra. And despite its controversial \\"run-away\\" budget.... its cast being plagued by eerie illnesses.... and its major stars' diva attitude--this epic romance made cinematic history in terms of style, content and appeal. All of these can be described visually at best in its grandest scene when Cleopatra entered Rome. In the tradition of Be-Hur, this is a must have for any collector! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time American Movie Classic","review":"An exceptionally entertaining if not always accurate portrayal of Cleopatras life and times. One of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. With the support of a superb cast Elizabeth Taylor is captivating as Cleopatra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liz Taylor IS Cleopatra!","review":"An amazing epic about the life & loves of Cleopatra. However, the romance is really real...during this film's making Liz Taylor & Richard Burton started their affair with each other even thoug Taylor was married to Eddie Fisher. A lavish story with excellent pageantry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz Taylor is NO Oscar winner for this film!","review":"Liz Taylor did not win an Oscsar for this film - she won for Butterfield 8 and Virginia Wolfe. If it were not for Rex Harrison, I would not have made it through the first half. Bad and Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sad Tale of a Great Film","review":"'Clopeatra' has always suffered from its theatrical release failure in 1962, and has never been recognised as the classic it is. This DVD release has done this incredible film justice. To demonstrate the awesome scale of the film, I'll use this example: there is a sea battle in the film. One has to remember that, in the early 1960's, computer effects didn't exist. What you see in 'Cleopatra' is real, not fake, real!But, as we discover in the documentary 'Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood', there is two hours of footage of this superb film missing. Who knows what story lies in this lost footage. There is a worldwide search to find it, but no such luck has been made. For the time being, we can marvel at this fantastic four-hour DVD set. It certainly makes your appreciation for the film grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for those of short of attention","review":"It's Cleopatra. What else can you say. I think more people are most taken by the chemistry between Richard and Liz and they miss the sheer magnitude of its pageantry. The work which went into its making and the story it tells takes you to another level of historical reality (as altered by Hollywood). It is a very immersive movie and no detail is insignificant in the telling of this story. Played back on my system, I really enjoyed the vibrancy of the colors and settings. The audio also contributed to its realism and dramatic interaction. I can't think of anyone else who could have carried this movie as well as the principles. Their dignity did not cheapen this classic. I highly recommend this movie and for newbies, this is not for someone of short attention span."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable Classic","review":"The first time I saw Cleopatra, I was not looking forward to sitting through a 4 hour movie. When I first saw it, I was mezmorized and entranced by ancient Egypt and Rome. It wasn't until later in life after reading more past novels about the period did I truly appreciate its artistic accuracy. Elizabeth Taylor was an amazing actress who made this movie what it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra","review":"The movie reflects real historical events. The ancient reality is represented a veracious manner and the play of the actors is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best italian modern books.","review":"The book, that is not complete, is about a misterious murder in a middle-class house in Rome just after the rise of fascism. The style of the author is immaginific, resembling baroque. Unfortunately, I think that is very difficult to preserve in an english version the richness of different words in regional italian slang. So, please, read it in italian!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but not really satisfactory","review":"I read the book in a new and good Dutch translation, that tries to render Gadda's use of dialects. The book has an interesting beginning and seems to be a detective work, but then Gadda looses himself in endless descriptions and the crimes are not solved at all. In the end the reader is left with a unsatisfactory feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction","review":"Great things about this book:1. It assumes only very basic guitar and Bluegrass knowledge.2. Standard musical notation and tablature.3. Teaches you not only the basics (the guitar run, the boom-chicka effect) but also a variety of guitar solos that gradually build up your skills.4. Great instructional CD.5. Gives you a good basic repertoire of classic Bluegrass / folk / gospel songs.If you want to learn the basics before you go to a Bluegrass festival, take this book to the woodshed. Even if you aren't interested in Bluegrass per se, this book is a good introduction to flatpicking generally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"The CD seems to be an after thought and doesn't really match the book all that well.

As an owner of Reidel stemware, I found these glasses, though of somewhat lesser quality, to have an excellent shape, feel, balance and ring. They hold a generous serving of wine, and the shape enhances the bouquet of the winenicely. They also double as nice white wine glasses in a pinch. I prefer thin rim stemware, and these fit the bill beautifully for the price. They are also sturdy enough for cleaning in the dishwasher. Overall, a good value at $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stemware packaged well and arrived unbroken","review":"I ordered these as a gift for family members that live out of state. The glasses arrived from Amazon at their home double boxed, with adequate packing material between the two boxes. Not one glass in two boxes was broken. They were delighted. For novices, the glasses come with complete instructions on how to drink wine for the most enjoyment. (They are not novice wine drinkers, but they were novices to the method described.) The wine glasses are more beautiful than pictured. The glass is thin and feels elegant in your hand. They stated that wine tastes better when drunk from these glasses. What a great price on these wonderful wine glasses. Although Amazon charges for gift wrapping, they didn't charge anything to include a gift note. Woo Hoo!
