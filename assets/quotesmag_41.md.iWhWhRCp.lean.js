Being steel, they are very sturdy and I have found the spring/jaw tension to be excellent. Though I don't use them all the time, at times I find myself with a clamping need that only these clamps can satisfy. The only reason that I am not giving these five stars is because over time the rubbery-plastic tips on the jaws (that protect your work) tend to work loose and slide off. This can be a bit annoying. Other than that one minor complaint, these are good clamps that I have had a lot of success using. If anything, these 3\\" clamps are an even better value than the 4\\" version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could","review":"These arrived today fulfilled and shipped by Grady.

There was nothing in the listing to indicate this issue, which I consider to be misleading and even false advertising. Grady (the seller through Amazon) said they would give me a refund but that I have to pay shipping both ways and that would cost MORE than the price of the clamps.

The reasons we purchased the 400 Turbo were 1) QuickBooks integration and 2) speed of printing.I took the printer out of the box at 8:30am and had it integrated with QuickBooks and printing our logo and return address on every label in under 45 minutes. The printer itself was working faster than that.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware reliability of power supply (based on earlier model 330)","review":"I have been a big fan of these printers. I own one vintage unit from when they were CoStar LabelWriters, and 2 LabelWriter 330 units. I still love the functionality, BUT ... now both of my 330s (one at home, one in the office) have suffered power supply failures. Dymo's solution is to send them back for a $75 repair (each). That's a large fraction of the purchase price. The power supplies lived through the warranty period, but not much longer ... so the calculation you must make is whether a unit that lives just about that long is worth the purchase price.It is possible, of course, that current models are more reliable. Or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronic Software Problems for Dymo","review":"I'm on my third Dymo LabelWriter (at least). Have been an early user. Currently use a 400 model. Mechanically, it's pretty good (although it occasionally spits out several blank labels, while printing one good one). But the big problem is with the software -- it is TERRIBLE. The label-design software is totally non-standard, non-intuitive and impossible to figure out. What's worse, it hasn't gotten any better with successive generations of printers. (I've hoped for improvements each cycle, but nope, Dymo has consistently disappointed.) This is clearly a company that places no value whatsoever on the overall user experience or quality of their software. Next step for me is to go with another brand, or try to get independent software to run the Dymo device. (I'm running Mac Mountain Lion, which it supposedly supports, but really doesn't.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it so far","review":"So far so good. Very fast printing with excellent text quality. The software is very easy to use. I just hope it lasts longer than my Dymo LabelWriter 300 which died after 3 years of normal use. This printer uses an external power supply which is an improvement over the model 300 which used an internal supply that failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love it. It is so quick and clean. Have had no problems with it at all. A bonus to be able to print stamps from it as well. If I was to buy another, Id by the duo, so I wouldn't have to keep switching the tapes from labels to stamps, but otherwise a terrific little gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great once you get it working...","review":"I spent a long time figuring out why it wasn't working right. If you have problems with it not working at all, use the customer support at Dymo and search for USB or however you connected. It will then give instructions on how to reload the drivers which worked great. Also, make sure your label roll is TIGHT on the spool. Mine was a little loose and that really fouled it up. Now that I have it set up right it is great. You can add graphics and such to your labels. The labels also come in other colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useless, unreliable piece of junk","review":"This worked OK for about a month then started double ffeding labels (and sometimes more). It had to have a power reset between printings. Then the labels started jamming under the roller. All in all a complete piece of junk and not worth one penny. The website help is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with other labels","review":"We have been very disapointed with this printer. If you plan to use your own labels with it, forget it! This printer requires that the labels have a small hole between them, so that the printer's sensor recognizes the end of each label. Unfortunately, our labels don't have a hole between them. When we called Dymo, they told us we could only use Dymo labels, they apologized and said that they didn't know why this wasn't advertised with the product.Warren Buffett said: \\"You cannot do good business with bad people\\"Dymo hid this information from their customers hoping to monopolize on the label market. I would not recommend buying from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk from China","review":"Back in the day, I had 8 Costar LabelWriter Turbos, they were incredible. Dymo can't seem to get the USB interface right. On EVERY computer I hook one up to, I get garbled printing and can't every seem to get a label to print reliably. I think they've sold out, started manufacturing in China and what was once a terrific product is a complete piece of junk. 55 labels per minute, yes 55 WASTED labels per minute. I would be please with just ONE good label per minute. Strangely, I have this problem with all Dymo USB LabelWriters on all computers I hook them up to, yet there is no reference to it on their pathetic knowlege (or lack there of) base. Stamps.com, gimme a break. Another way to suck bucks out of your wallet. Is it really that hard to put a stamp on an envelope? I would rather get what I paid for, a label printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware if you ship packages","review":"The Dymo LabelWriter 400 Turbo works great. What doesn't work well is the \\"No-Monthly-Fee DYMO Stamps(tm) postage labels.\\" Everything works great until you want to purchase postage for your package you are shipping. With the free software provided you can print a wide range of pre-selected postage amounts, but you cannot print a specific dollar amount. To ship your Priority Mail package with the correct amount of postage, you will still have to go to the Post Office or purchase a $9.95 monthly service plan. Of course, this is not explained to you until after you purchase the unit and set up your account. In my opinion the \\"No-Monthly-Fee DYMO Stamps(tm) postage labels\\" is clearly bait and switch. If you ship a few packages a month, the monthly service charge is not worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Saves time & space!","review":"I have been using Stamps.com for my online business for about 2 years. Up till now I have been printing postage using a standard laser printer. Using this method I had to load individual sheets to print just 1 label, and often had paper jams, which sometimes resulted in lost postage funds. Not anymore! This dymo 400 turbo works flawlessly with stamps.com and prints individual postage labels in seconds. No more messing around with label sheets and loading trays. Best of all it doesn't use any toner, it uses thermal label rolls. (Laser toner is expensive) The 3-part postage label rolls are quite inexpensive, and the print quality is excellent. This baby should be paying for itself within 6 months. Cut my packing & shipping time almost to half.

While I know there are fans who devour everything she does I find that her \\"at least one release a year\\" schedule leaves me still trying to appreciate an album of hers when I realise I'm already two albums behind. It's only when I catch her live that her songs really escape from the confines of her albums and start to make a real impact. \\"Living in clip\\" lifts tracks from her earlier releases and not only makes a more than satisfying listening whole but makes all her earlier efforts shine that much brighter. Even with the skipworthy version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" this is a great album for the die hard Ani fan and the casual listener who is intimidated by the fact that she can release a new album in the time it takes you to get her latest CD from the shelf to the checkout counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it!!","review":"Ani is one of the best live artists around, and you will see why on this album.There are some amazingly beautiful reworkings of some of her songs here so get out there and get this album.NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ani is so ------' rad!","review":"my friend had this cd and i loved it. so i bought my own and after having this cd for about a week i ended up going out and buying most of her older cds. she is so real and i think that is what alot of her fans love about her. i can find meaning in every one of her songs, and they all touch me in a way no other music has. ani is my role model. i want to be just like her, so stong, independent and joyful."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can close your eyes and pretend she's in the room...","review":"I have been a longtime fan of Ani's, and bought this CD just to see if it could really capture the bubbly personality she is in concert. It comes about as close as a live album can to bringing the feeling of being at one of her concerts, complete with mistakes, and stories, and that unique laugh of hers. The philharmonic introduction of \\"Both Hands\\" (basically her anthem) blew me away - it's incredible to hear the string section playing the melody, and build to an impressive crescendo. This album really showcases Ani's talent as a performer, along with her ability to write songs that speak to so many people. Since her concerts tend to fill large auditoriums now rather than the intimate clubs she used to play, it might even be better just to listen to her on this album and pretend you're there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms.Difranco...","review":"I believe that this is Ani's best album...the songs sound better live then just plain recorded.I went to see Ani at the university of new hampshire ....it rocked....Her feelings are raw and you can tell that she has been there,not like some of the other whiny bands.Not the next Joan Jett, but I believe she is pretty damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"If you're not an Ani fan, this album will make you be one. This was the first CD of hers that I purchased, and it is still my favorite. Her guitar work is amazing--she picks the hell out of her acoustic, and her voice is soaring. She adds colorful anecdotes throughout the CD which made me appreciate her even more.

She's so good at picking the world around her apart, but what solutions does she offer? What poetic intuition beyond her own self obsession? This fatal conceit reaches heights dizzying enough to enduce vomiting when she starts her corney jokes. Suposedly a spokeswoman for the DIY ethos, Ani is no more then the co-opting of subculture to exploit a sellable image and hollow political posturing. If this is considered the poetry it's marketed as let me move to the Maine woods with a labrador and an inkwell. The album that turned your sweet thirteen year old sister bi in 95 and got her to dye and peirce something at the mall in the name of \\"difference\\"... you too can buy into it.

The vocal quality, lyrics, percussion, bass are all top quality. I've never been to one of ani's shows (yet), but this album sure has whet my appetite.

If you've enjoyed ANY Ani song from earlier in her career, this is an essential album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most songs better live!","review":"This album is amazing. Most of the songs on this album are better than the studio versions. A particular example of this is \\"Both Hands,\\" which is in a much more musical format than on it's original cd. Some songs can only be found on this cd, like \\"Whatever\\" and \\"Hide and Seek,\\" two of my favorites. Also fun to listen to are her spoken rambles, particularly the hilarious one hidden at the end of \\"Overlap.\\" Go forward on the track to 7:00 . . . it's worth the price of the cd in itself. Other great songs include \\"Every State Line\\", with instruments instead of just Ani's voice, and \\"The Slant/The Diner.\\" The best song is \\"Amazing Grace\\", however. Before I listened to this song, I thought the best version of this song was the version from the Dilate cd, but this one is so much better. My only problem with this cd is that I wish it had Hell Yeah and Dilate on it. Otherwise, it's fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete fabrication","review":"Bought 3 of these. 1 came with a 'bumpy' red handle and worked properly. 2 came with conical red handles and were not fabricated properly.

The basic story centers on a symphony conductor who, in an attempt to reawaken his lust for life, is having an ill-advised affair with a girl one-third his age. As you might expect, the disasters this creates in his life are quite entertaining. The narrator, an upper-crust music critic, speaks of the rapid disintegration of the conductor's family and his own love life with such detached snobbery, that even mundane events come alive with vivid humor. Especially funny is his description of a date that includes attending a wrestling event. One warning: Amis offers no clean-cut solutions, but turns expectations upside-down.

The enormous dedication and personal involvement of the author and everyone who was involved in the case is remarkable and very touching. The transcripts from the 1974 Grand Jury hearing and the trial in 1979 are indisputable and very powerful. MacDonald has never been able to explain the contradictions between his story and the evidence itself. Instead he resorts to name calling and sarcasm.It seems MacDonald will always have his groupies willing to defend him. As the 30th year of this tragedy approaches, I wonder if Colette, Kimmy, Kristy and their unborn son will ever be able to rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man in the surgical mask","review":"Dr Jeffrey MacDonald presented to the world the face of a charming, sensitive healer, but behind this mask was an arrogant individual who, from the time the murders were committed in 1970 until his final appeal was rejected in 1985, tried his utmost to avoid punishment for the horrific act he perpetrated. This story stands as a monument to the laudable persistence of MacDonald's parents-in-law, who refused to give up their crusade for justice until MacDonald was convicted, and the souls of his wife and children were finally at peace. It is also a tribute to the experts who by sheer talent and technology have advanced the field of forensic science to the degree where it is now viewed as indisputable evidence. This is by far McGinniss's best book, as his in depth analysis of the case also compels the reader to reach a guilty verdict.

A revelation into a strange, obsessive personality that even Dr. McDonald can not and has not admitted.Yet one minute you think he is innocent but the next you know he really did it. This vacillating continues from start to finish as the evidence is masterfully dissected. It makes you keep reading more.

Interestingly enough when I read it many years ago I still didn't see that it proved the father/husband/doctor guilty, but after finding out the main points were fiction and pure fiction, it made me realize how cruel a deception this author played on this man. Guilty, not guilty, I for one will most likely never know. But I can sleep at night knowing my drive for profit did not help convict a man and keep him in jail, for crimes even I am not sure he committed. (google quotes by author who admits this on several occassions) Shame on you Mr. McGinnis and I hope the money has served your soul well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful book","review":"Read the book sometime ago and saw the movie, made from the book. Yes, I believe that he committed the murders and killed his family so he could have the life he wanted away from them.The book puts you there at the murder scene and you feel like you are involved in it. You can see what the family went through. The deaths, trials and everything.It's a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HUGE MISTAKE BY THIS AUTHOR AND PROSECUTION","review":"and now the prosecution case is falling apart, with evidence they threatened one female witness who told them she was part of a cult who was there and killed the wife and kids--she was threatened to not tell that to the jury, and many other issues that show this man is innocent. I wonder how the author of this book feels now! He was totally wrong about this man!

RIP Colette, Kimberly, and Kristen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatal Vision murders","review":"Fatal Vision pretty much tells it like it is. The guy did it and there's no question about it. the crime simply could not have happened the way MacDoanld said it did. If this crime happened today he would've been locked up right away. Very simply put the blood and fiber evidence pretty much tells what happened in the tiny apartment that night. Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Vision is a fiction book.","review":"Joe McGinness should be ashamed of himself. I don't know how he sleeps at night. He is a liar. Jeffrey MacDonald is innocent and it will be proven soon with the DNA testing. The real story of the MacDonald murders can be found in the book Fatal Justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fraud, but not perhaps a deliberate one.","review":"Sorry, kiddies and students, but McGinniss really is a distasteful, publicity-grubbing worm. The more I look into this case, including personal interviews, the more I realize just how unethical McGinniss really was, and still is. The forensic case doesn't add up, and never, ever did.By the way, anyone who would ever take a polygraph test under any circumstances is definitely a fool. BUT NOT NECESSARILY A MURDERER. I would never take one under any circumstance, no matter what.Then again, unlike many who apparently get their information from Montel Williams and Maury Povich, I've actually done my research about the technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous read","review":"Joe McGinniss has done a masterful job of breaking down a complex and confusing crime scene and walking the reader through it in a style that is simultaneously horrifying and can't-make-yourself-look-away compelling.Conversely, in his portrayal of Jeffrey McDonald, McGinnis has stepped to the side a bit and allowed McDonald to present himself as he truly is, a narcissist totally unaware of and blind to his own psychosis. I found this portrait particularly fascinating as it accurately reflected the attitudes and behaviors of one of my own family members who is serving a 231-year prison term for a series of violent crimes, which he swears he didn't commit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Not factual at all","review":"If I could have given this book a -5 star rating I would have.

The story and writing is 5 star for the original product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Riveting!","review":"Through access to and extensive quoting from primary documents, McGinniss takes the reader on a journey through the judicial process: the flaws and complexities ultimately lead to justice. The nature of the crime, the murder of a pregnant woman and her two young daughters, is highly disturbing and bearable only because so much time has transpired since the deaths (1970). Knowing that the parents of the woman are no longer alive to suffer their loss provides solace as the reader cannot help but identify with their loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear , though sensational, vision","review":"a compelling, stirring account of a megalomaniac gone awry. And I mean the subject - not the author. The author comes across as very believable in that he started out an avid supporter of the defendant and then, after a methodical review of the case and the subject's bizarre behavior, forms the intelligent opinion that MacDonald was the maniacal, homicidal one who did in fact kill his family.I know the author is sensational and has aroused much controversy with several of his books; but I think he got this one dead right!Follow up with your own independent reviews of other sources and I think you, too, shall be convinced that this was one doctor not to be trusted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book","review":"This book is so well written no matter how many times I read it I always find some thing new.

McDonald's overwhelming narcissism becomes thoroughly disgusting as you work through the book, as well as the constant assertions of his \\"masculinity\\" and the extensive details about his sex life, but McGinniss bit by bit provides supporting evidence proving that much of what McDonald recalls is pure fabrication (stories about his mother-in-law, he and Colette's supposed vacation to Aruba, his trip to Russia with the boxing team, his view of his \\"happy\\" marriage with Colette, despite all the cheating and lies, etc.). And once the myth of the golden, All-American boy is destroyed, and all the evidence is laid out, McDonald is revealed to be a psychopath and cold-blooded murderer. One of the best true-crime books I have ever read. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatal Vision","review":"Found the book informative. Althought I did read it in the paperback format years ago.

It was so engrossing. This is Book 1 of a series of 5. Can't wait to read the rest.The tale of King Arthur and Merlin, rewritten. Merlin's daughter Alywren plays a major part in the success of Arthur. The two are friends when children. Then find a taboo love with each other as adults. There are many characters in the story which aren't likable. But that only bring Wren, Merlin & Arthur so much closer to perfection. You can overlook their slight sins compared to all the happenings around them.Lancelot's rule wasn't very big but was important. I loved the magical aspect (the fairies, witches, gods & goddesses)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaply moving, fabulous writing -- EXCELLENT BOOK!!","review":"I have never before read an Irene Radford book -- oh what I've been missing! Ms. Radford's writing is so fabulous, that you can actually feel the ground beneath your feet when she describe's Wren's contact with nature.This not just a retelling of the Arthur story, so much more! It goes deeply into the heart of the main character, Merlin's daughter Wren. You learn to care about what happens to her and how she feels -- truly the mark of good writing!I highly recommend this book to anyone -- fantasy reader as well as all those who enjoy good fiction.

Slick and over produced pop music pretending to be blues.Having been a blues fan for years now I am very frustrated with albums like this, you are always left felling let down. One does not find a direct and honest form of expression, as one finds with the music of say Lightnin' Hopkins, Son House and other blues greats, but rather music that is set to show-off a person and heavily padded to give that \\"full sound\\".Having seen Mr Lang live I can only say there are far better Blues singers and players out there.I would suggest that you look at the many great bluesman Amazon has to offer like, Muddy Waters, Robert Pete Williams, Fred Mcdowell eta. and see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATNG HISTORY OF ENGLAND'S ELIZABETH'S COURT &THE GRAIL","review":"It appears 1988 is the first time this info is available by the Francis Bacon Research Trust.

Francis and his brother were apparently part of her \\"secret service\\" spies, and this explains a lot about the \\"mystery\\" of who Shakespeare might have really been.!

But, Watching This Flick With Its Original Title Is Only The Start Of A Magnificent Masterpiece. Lo Lieh Is Pure Sensation, And Carter Really Put Down A Stunning Performance. My Only Negative About This Film Is In The Formatting...! It Was Not Properly Formatted To Fit A TV Screen.

I don't remember the other name(s) of this movie is but it is sad that they always stupidly rename these.Basically the plot is about a young girl who is the princess and is on the run after her father(the emperor) kills himself. She loses an arm but that doesn't stop her, well, at all from what I could tell. It is an extremely boring film all the way and after Lo Lieh's cameo as a wandering swordsman, Carter Wong FINALLY shows back up and helps the retarded sister of the princess. Carter puts on a GREAT acting performance and the final fight with the ridiculous looking baddie is just not good enough, but certainly better than the rest of the film.The film print from Tai Seng is very bad at the start but cleans up and you are able to see the fights pretty well, at least the few fights that there are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A late purchase in my Ani collection","review":"This was one of the later Ani albums I bought, starting with Out of Range, jumping to Little Plastic Castle (which was brand new at the time)and jumping around from there.After her recent change of style (from 6up on) I was looking for more of that familiar \\"out of range\\" sound.... THIS WAS IT! Not quite as razor-edged as Dilate, not as simple as her self-titled debut, this album was like digging into the memories of that first year back in High school I spent absorbing all things Ani.A few hits, a few minor misses, and as always, her prophetic, insightful lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this Album","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite Ani albums. The lyrics and melodies are catchy and the album is short (only about 30 minutes) so it's perfect for driving in the car or while tooling around the house. Her lyrics and poetry are as personally and politically relevant as always but there's also a really playful side (Blood in the Boardroom, Pick Yer Nose) that Ani doesn't showcase too often in her later albums. A more \\"human\\" Ani is appparent in this album than in any she's produced since. Definitely buy Puddle Dive."},{"rating":"2","title":"*again ani surpasses my expectations...*","review":"it's too bad i cant submit a six-star review because in my eyes, she definately deserves it. in this album, ani's music is more folky than pop but with the energy her contemporaries only wish they could possess. it's a definate must have for any fan who prefers ani's old style... because as far as i can tell, ani was doing just fine with herself and her lil guitar. song after song ani proves that she doesnt need an entire orchestra to get her beauty across. my personal favorites from this album would have to be god's country, pick yer nose, and fourth of july. i'm shocked at how few customer reviews of this album have been posted thus far in comparison to those for her other cds. i know many die-hard ani fans and i would have to agree with the majority of them when they declare puddle dive as the next best thing to ani's live performances. a must have for any fan... or any soon to be fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her 2nd worst album A.K.A Kah-kah","review":"This is almost the worst thing she has done. There isn't a single song that grabs and holds you. Only Blood in the Boardroom is even close to catchy. With that song, if you're not a girl, you can't relate. So, I suggest you run from this album. Run as fast you you can. In fact, run to the store and by \\"Little Plastic Castles\\". My personal favorite album of ALL TIME. But don't waste you time, even looking at this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"5-stars says it all","review":"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. It's original, it's fresh, it's very smart and it has all the charm Ani can bring to it, with - besides her strong, convincing vocals - great guitar playing and a lot of guts.

I was looking for an alternative to my yoga towel because I sweat more than the average bear. I was excited about the Hugger Mugger Cotton Yoga Rug based on the description. It was marketed as the perfect product for those who sweat during their yoga practice. Yes, this sucks up sweat. However; the product is extremely uncomfortable. It feels like an oudoor rug. I wouldn't even sit on it, let alone practice yoga on it. The rug is so rough that it actually chafes my palms, stomach, knees, tops of feet; basically anything that comes into contact with it. Most yoga towels provide better traction once they become moist. With this yoga rug, it is slippery when dry, moist, and wet.

I went to one class on the rug, the smell was too strong I couldn't concentrate. Also, the rug came with many cotton threads starting to unravel within the pattern.

This rug did the trick! No more visible sweat drips. I use it in conjunction with my travel sticky mat for a little extra cushioning. The \\"grip factor\\" is pretty good for Downward Dog, once you mist it with water and work up a decent sweat. Not relying on a sticky mat to hold me in place has also helped improve my alignment and posture. The Caribbean color is absolutely beautiful.One thing I did not like about this mat is that after I threw it in the washing machine, it SHRANK in width by 3 INCHES! I didn't even machine dry it.

Mallinson is no O'Brian, that's for sure. Rather improbable plot with very little action that engage the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized","review":"This book is almost as bad as the manual that came with my synthesizer. It is extremely poorly organized, and the author's writing style is verbose and unnecessarily technical. For example, the author's explanation of Keyboard Tracking in the Filters chapter is written backwards, with the most basic information presented last.Throughout the book, the author references a concept or term explained in a future chapter, but then continues as if that concept is understood. It's maddening!This book does not lay a foundation, is not laid out in a logical fashion, and is full references to what synths of the past could and could not do. In all, I've found it to be very difficult and boring to read.I'm sure the author is very knowledgeable about his topic, but all of this information could be MUCH better presented, in a much more logical fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SUPPORT FOR AUDIO CD","review":"I wish there was a way to rate this book less than one star and not because it is a bad book.I think Jim Aikin does an excellent job presenting information on the usage of synthesizers in generalMy issue is with the publishers (BackBeat) for selling this book as a kindle e-book without providing a means to download theaudio files which is vital to understanding the concepts. I have also voiced my concerns to Amazon for not filtering E-books from publishers that dont include an alternative for kindle readers to obtain audio files of some sort that are included on media with the original bookIf you can get the paper back version of the book im sure it will be a great read but if you are ordering it to read on a kindle or other electronic device please check with the publisher first to make sure you can obtain the audio files that come on the CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but lacks depth.","review":"This book would be really great for a beginner at synth programming, but I found it to be fairly basic.

From theoretical/technical point of view, the book starts at a very basic level. For instance phase cancellation and definition of decibels. I did not find anything that was really explained in depth. As far as I can understand, the book is not intended for technicians or engineers dealing with design and analysis of electronic music systems.On the other hand, musicians with no technical background that will mainly buy and use a synthesizer can probably find some useful information about common technical terms and buzzwords. However, from my point of view, I am not convinced this book really is The Ultimate Reference for Sound Design."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start and finish","review":"This book shows you what you need to know to start programing your synth.

Boy was I WRONG. This album is horrible. After I listened to All That I Can Say, I was speechless. I tried to figure out what exactly Mary was trying to say and I still haven't been able to figure it out.I fast forwarded through each track trying to find at least one track that could be considered this album's savior..but there wasn't one. Even Mary's rendition of Let No Man Put Asunder left a whole lot to be desired. This album is not of the same caliber as Mary's freshman and sophmore efforts What's the 411? and My Life. I don't know, maybe she matured a little too much but if that's the case she needs to regress some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary...","review":"I think the album is reflecting a totally different Mary. The best tracks from the album are : #1,3,7 and 11. This CD is for someone who has been hurt and has lived to SING about it. You can hear that when Mary sings the duet with K-Ci. I dont know what he did to her but they should never sing together unless that they forgiven each other. The woman sounds pissed off. The album was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of SOUL","review":"This album is truly the best I've heard in a long long time...

It is simply the best album I have heard in a long time. This CD set conatins amazing songs that only Mary J. Blige can give us. Her voice sounds better than ever. If you haven't got this CD yet, YOU NEED TO GET IT! It is a classic album for r&b lovers as well as hip-hop fans..... By the way, when I listened to the whole CD from beginning to end, after it was over I let out a big \\"GOD-DAMN! \\" because this CD was so good. SO GO BUY IT!

Blige is a weak and pathetic use of CD space. I only like the first single and I feel as though I should've bought the single instead of the CD. This CD is the perfect example of being overhyped. The songs are not of the quality that she tends to have. When I bought this CD I was expecting it to be good. This CD is a waste of her beautiful voice and the recourd company's money. Needless to say, it was not as good as I expected it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fierce!","review":"Just when I thought it could not get any better than My Life, Mary brings us simply \\"Mary.\\" Mary is a masterpiece. From the beginning joint \\"All That I Can Say\\" to the finale, \\"Let No Man Put Asunder\\" this is soul music at its finest. When Mary sings you hear the conviction and honesty in what she is singing about. On \\"The Love I Never Had\\" Mary blows it up and gives us some jazz improvisation reminiscent of Dinah and Ella. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced the hell out of this joint. Other stellar tracks are \\"Im In Love\\" where Mary sings in a low timbre and \\"No Happy Holiday\\" where Mary bobs and weaves about a lover who abandones her on holidays. I had the pleasure of seeing The Mary Show in St. Louis where our mayor gave Ms. Blige the keys to our city and declared Aug. 4, in St. Louis Mary J. Blige Day.

She is always changing her style and that is good. I think that whether she is singing slow jams, or hip-hop music, she does it better than anyone else. She sings straight from the heart, and that's what counts. For those people who judge Mary J Blige based on certain types of songs she chose to sing on, well they are missing the whole point.

It doesn't have the pizzaz that the others do. There is nothing special about this album. Anyone could have made this album. It doesn't rock you with hit after hit. The more that I listen to it the more I find things that I don't like. The song wth K-Ci is totally out of place! I think that Mary needs to go back to the \\"essence\\" and rediscover the Mary that made \\"I can love you\\", \\"Seven Days\\", \\"Love No Limit\\", \\" I Never Want to Live without You\\", \\"Don't Go\\", and the like.The 40-somethings may be more appreciative of this album but this 20-something is NOT feeling it.

This album comes from a mature Mary, you can tell she has matured from Real Loveto Mary. I spent my last $13.00 on this CD for my collection and it was well spent when I first listened it was O.K but this is a album that has to grow on you to feel the lyrics and music. \\"Time\\" is my favorite track. I love Mary's music, there is a pert of my Life in all her albums so I can feel her alot it's music to kick-it, break-up, come alive again and chill. Mary is one of my mentors and one day if I blow up I hope to meet and thank her for all the inspiring albums. I can do without the Mahalia Jackson type CD cover other than that pick-it up, play it, and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"HER BEST YET","review":"She did it again ya'll. Mary is truely at her best. This CD is a must have if you don't already have it I suggest that you run not walk to get it. You will truely be blessed. MJB's music has always hit home with many women including myself. All her songs seem to reflect my own personal relationships and this disc is no different. MJB sings from the soul she feels everything that she sings. Today many singers just sing the words and have no feeling behind them. MJB takes us back to they way music once was. My favorite songs are \\"Memories\\", \\"\\"Give me you\\", and \\"The Love I Never Had\\". Mary you really did it this time. Thanks for all the music the past 7 years every song has been a part of my own personal relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!!!","review":"This is another classic album by Mary J. Blige. It sounds like Grammy material?!!! hmm!? Yes I thinks it does. Anyway, her voice sounds better than ever on this album, especially on Deep Inside. I also like No Happy Holidays a lot. Actually the whole album is off the hook. And compared to all those other R&B female artists who want men to \\"pay their bills\\", Mary rises to the top of the game. Yes, she is the Queen of Hip Hop Soul, and I am a loyal subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"All That I Can Say Is.....Mary, Mary, Mary.","review":"I have all of Mary J. Blige's CDs and i listen to them all reagularly but this one is special. Ever since I got it I haven't been able to stop listneing to it. It has scratched the surface of my soul and left a mark that no other CD has and Mary J. Blige has left an imprint in my mind that no other artist has. From the opening song \\"All That I Can Say\\"...which makes me think of the first time i was in love...to the song \\"The Love I Never Had\\"...which made me realize that I could never lose anybody I never really had to myself to begin with. Anyone that hasn't bought it yet I strongly suggest that you do. It will definitely become one of your favorite CDs if no your favorite. It has songs that everyone can relate to. Smooth lyrics and a stong voice make this Mary J. Blige's best album yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"very board-room sounding","review":"the first cut was tight with the stevie wonder influence.L-boogie gave up the goods on that one.but the rest of the album crashes badly after that track.i still love her first two the best.she needs more up-tempo cuts cuz this current style is too predictable and the mary i remember was anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and disappointing","review":"I wanted so badly to love this album, because I've loved the stuff Mary's done up to now. But to tell you the truth, I haven't listened past the 7th cut because it puts me to sleep. All the songs seem to be in the same tempo (slow) and the lyrics ramble on and on and on. No good \\"hooks,\\" nothing to stand out and make you want to hear a song again and again. The used-CD store will defintely be taking this one off my hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest yet","review":"I must admit when I first gave it a listen, I was wondering where the hip/hop Mary went. But after listening a second time, it was the bomb. I had to stop comparing her past albums to this one. I felt the words in every song. \\"All that I can say\\", \\"Give Me You\\", and the one with Aretha were the bomb. All of her albums are still the bomb. Vocally, she had surpassed her other albums. I got hooked on Mary when she came out in '92 (I was 12 then) and eight years later at the age of twenty, Mary has still got me hooked. I am a die hard fan. Mary you have put the icing on the cake. God bless and keep you. Girl, you shine above the rest. Keep doing your thing....much love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile forlorn melancholy","review":"All I have too say is that Mary has come a long way since 'What's the 411'. Like many soul singers you could feel her angst on her sleeve. The music was very nice but the lyrical content really makes this a nice albumn to have and listen too. If you listen carefully to the lyrics she is speaking to former lovers and false friends and anyone else making pretentions about her. She speaks volumns in the song 'Deep Inside' and it continues on with the duet with K-Ci Hailey. Very nice musical trip through her life up to now. I hope it is cathartic for her as she put her foot and more into this one. I have always dismissed her since I saw her first live muscical offering on Saturday Night Live after release of her first albumn. She really has come a long way and can supplant her 'hip-hop soul' moniker with releases such as this. Go ahead & I can't wait for Mary II."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!!!","review":"This album is phat!!!! My favorite songs are Your Child, The Love I Never Had and I'm Not Lookin.

I have heard her previous albums and I find it's just okay. Her latest is different from her previous works. It's more soulful, the songs are great with the exception of Deep Inside, which I find a bit monotonous if not for the help from Elton John's piano. With her raw and soulful voice, this album is just great.

SHE REALLY TOUCHED MY HEART WHEN I HEARD THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect soul album","review":"In this age of synthetic soul, Mary J. Blige slices through all the fakes and posers and delivers this great CD. From the opening track to the last, it is terrific. Mature, passionate, soulful singing from one of the most unique voices to come around in the past few years. It may not be the hip-hop classic of \\"My Life\\" but the new direction doesn't make her any less brilliant. She is a naturally raw and instinctive singer who never fails to convey the honesty of the song. Best tracks: \\"All That I Can Say\\", \\"Deep Inside\\", \\"Beautiful Ones\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Your Child\\" and \\"The Love I Never Had\\" and the import only included duet with George Michael on the Stevie Wonder classic \\"As.\\" \\"Mary\\" is a classic that sets the standard, rather than follow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling the truth about black males in the society.","review":"Nikki has always been a fan of Mary J.

When I got home I found a more jazz influenced Mary that had a lot more soul than her prior releases which was good. This cd was different thought she took you there more on this cd with tracks like I'm not lookin ,Your Child, I'm In Love and The Beautiful Ones. This cd is hot and perfect for evenings around the house or Kickin it.

Never again!","review":"I decided to buy Mary's album after hearing just two of her singles that were released. After listening to the first 4 or 5 songs, I went so sleep.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"her best album!","review":"to me this is her best album, no fillers at all,classic! a very emotional Mary on this one. at the time it came out it blew away any other r&b album (except mamas gun by Erykah Badu) it'll be hard to top this one, i still listen to it! to many good songs on here to start naming but all that i can say and beautiful one are my favorites on here. if u dont have go get it it's a must to any real music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Mary C.D!","review":"This has to be probably my favorite Mary c.d. The Lauryn Hill penned \\"All that I can say\\" is simply gorgeous, and a great way to open the c.d. My favorties include \\"No happy holidays\\", \\"Beautiful Ones\\",and \\"Let No Man put asunder\\" (has a nice 70's groove to it). \\"The love I never had\\" is phenomenal, and the groove session feel of the song, just make you feel good. \\"I'm in love\\" is another stand-out track, and \\"Give me you\\" is very inspirational. This is around the time Mary started getting herself on the right track, and it shows. Also duets with K-Ci and Aretha Franklin are both dynamic, definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary in disguise... not really","review":"Mary J. Blige's fourth proper studio album easily remains one of her very best efforts. It was not commercially very successful, but Mary's fans well know this is not what matters most with her. Instead, it captures the diva's essence so profoundly as few other albums did. Similarly to \\"My Life\\", it did not need to send out many radio hits to be great. However, the list of collaborators shows how respected the singer is -- Lauryn Hill, Elton John, Aretha Franklin, George Michael (duet \\"As\\", penned by Stevie Wonder\\" was omitted from the US edition) Eric Clapton, Babyface, Diane Warren, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis... need I say more? Listen to this. Released in the last millennium (1999), it remains as fresh as ever. Deep, moving, groovy and old-school, this is r&b at its most radiant. Highlights include \\"All That I Can Say\\", \\"Beautiful Ones\\", \\"As\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Memories\\", \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary, Mary, Mary! Damn!!!","review":"All hail the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul! She does it again with gut-wrenching vocals that you just can't help but be moved by.

For instance, why in the world was Blair Witch so lauded? That was also the case with Sexy Beast, which I wanted to love but later just wanted to get through. A lot of people spoke well of Ben Kingsley's intense performance and it was intense, but that doesn't make up for lack of plot or story.Ok, now that all the Sexy Beast partisans hate me, I will say that the cinematography was top notch and the commentary track was worthwhile. There were great moments of tension in the movie between Kingsley and anyone, and later between the mob boss and our hero, Ray Winstone. I just wish all that tension was building up for something more than the decided payoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"review and spoilers - so read carefully","review":"Spoilers below, but it tells why I give this movie 2 stars tops.The movie is 90 minutes and (spoiler next line)the first hour is just the mafia guy showing up, sticking around and trying to get the guy to go do the heist job. An HOUR just on that ? I started fast forwarding through some bits because I started to think the whole movie was like that. The heist itself takes up 5-10min of the whole movie.

Kinsley is a very good actor but failed to deliver as a believable ganster only with loud mouth full of the [profane] words again and again. Kinda tiresome. The whole movie looked pretty dragged from the very beginning and I very doubt that the director and all the other members who shot this movie might fell asleep during the shooting. Very contrite and uninterested scenario even the the swimming pool drilling to get into the bank vault did not look so exciting.

That's where I'm coming from.Sexy Beast is a fantastic movie, and I'm shocked by how many of the folks in the Amazon reviews used \\"shallow,\\" \\"predictable,\\" and \\"standard\\" in their negative reviews. These people are NOT GETTING IT. The movie is a carefully structured, impressionistic character study, focusing on the vulnerabilities and strengths we gain when we love another person. I was blown away when I saw it. I've watched it ten times since I got the DVD, several times with the very funny, very smart commentary by Sir Ben Kinglsey and the movie's producer. Buy it. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is the best British (or co-British) crime movie since The Long Good Friday 20 years earlier.Ray Winston is perfectly cast as ex-con who's trying to retire in Spain. Ben Kingsley is sent over to get him to take on one more job. Kingsley is a revelation. I knew he was a good actor from Schindlers List and Ghandi but this is something completely different. Its one of the best portrayals of a hard-man you'll ever see. The other surprise for me was the performance of Ian McShane who is utterly convincing as the crime boss behind the scenes. Almost as terrifying as Kingsley's performance.The title is really misleading - the main concern here for people buying the film is the language. It is very very strong, and if you have a problem with people swearing a lot this is not a film for you.A brilliant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Noel Coward indeed! Scary.","review":"This is a wonderfully constructed caper movie that will creep you out.Did Ocean's 11 creep you out? Did Ocean's 12? Or The Italian Job? Caper movies are not scary: plan the heist, get the jewels, escape from the police, party.This movie will frighten you because Ben Kingsley plays a demonic sicko. (Really I want to use stronger language.) And he does it brilliantly. He says in the commentary that one of the young sassy actors was very respectful to him -- and to no one else in the cast. But Ben, you have BECOME a world-class blood-thirsty psycho. Kingsley was so convincing, he convinced other actors.This movie has it all: a tropical paradise, romance, a twisted plot, a big heist, a nutjob thief. What more could ask of a caper picture?It's just plan terrific and Americans won't need a Cockney-American dictionary to understand it as if it were a Guy Ritchie flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"beast... not so sexy","review":"The fuss about this film, in my opinion, was largely hype. I don't see much redeeming about this film apart from Ben Kingsley's performance. His brutality is stunning to watch, and although the film was entertaining, it was no classic. As a matter of fact, it has been some time since I watched this film, and I had built it up in my head so much, having read reviews and so on, and when I finally did see it, it was just unappealing and partly unintelligible, apart from a scene with Ben Kingsley in an airplane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The critics did it this time. This was decent film on the note that it contained all of the different aspects needed to create a great film, but it lacked continuous flow. Before I saw Sexy Beast I read the critics reviews on how this movie was compared to some of Guy Richie's films such as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and two smoking barrels. This film doesn't come close to the imaginative mind of Guy Richie. Sexy Beast isn't even on the same wave length. That was fault number one. Since I was over hyped and expecting a lot more from this, all I can give Sexy Beast is 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody shoot this guy already...","review":"I gave this movie 2 stars only for the fact that I could see it might have been better if Ben Kingsley's character wasn't in the movie. For 45 minutes I watched a pathetic excuse of a gangster go on a tyrade of verbal and physical abuse with everyone around him until I could bare no more. I had to turn it off before I fell asleep....this movie was amazingly boring and very unbelievable...no one could endure Kingsley's character as long as the characters in this movie...I know I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and dull","review":"Slow. So, so slow and quiet and boring. I would rather watch Apocalypse Now 3 times in a row than sit through the nothingness that is this movie's 1st half. The 2nd half isn't anything better, either. There is some blood, and Kingsley freaks out, but the inevitable heist was monotonous and whatever symbolism the rabbit guy stood for was completely useless and uninviting.A waste of my 1 1/2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated,over drawn,over and out!","review":"unsure why this got so much hype(then again,im still miffed by the kudos the abysmal training day received!).here we have what amounts to a jealous tough guy(ben kingsley)who forcefully recruits a long time business associate.seems like theres ONE MORE JOB to pull of.and hes not taking no for an answer.this so called bad guy is so under developed its sickening.for the most part,its him asking/telling and his would be recruit to take this job,and then having recruit say no.this volleys back and forth until even the director/writer got sick of it and sent ben to airport.this is where the jealousy enters.without giving everything away,i found this to be pretty dull.theres some nice yelling and a couple of quirky moments but they quickly fade and give way to alot of nothing.i do not suggest anyone waste their time/money on this.instead,get mean streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly funny British crime thriller, great performances","review":"\`Sexy Beast' shares the same plot premise as David Mamet's \\"Heist\\", also released in 2001 - a retired thief is lured into doing one more job. This British film, though, is a different animal. Both dark and comic, director Jonathan Glazer's first movie is highly energetic and has both style and substance.Gal [Ray Winstone], along with his ex-porn star wife, Deedee [Amanda Redman] has happily retired to a villa above the glorious Costa del Sol in Spain. Back in dreary old London, gangster Teddy [Ian McShane] needs his services for a bizarre robbery plan sends Don Logan [Ben Kingsley] to convince him. Completely mad and with all the warmth of a pit bull, he's a hard man to refuse. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Gal plays along. Or does he?Kingsley is brilliant, and it's hard to believe this is the same gentle guy who played Gandhi. He's deservedly been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Highly recommended for fans of film noir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink,stank,stunk","review":"My goodness the British can't make movies. They can write, they can act, they make great music but cinema isn't their speciality. They've been trying to make a Terentino(?) film for the past decade (see Guy Richie) and have failed miserably every bloody time. They got Lean and Hitchcock, though Hitchcock didn't become great until he came to the states, outside of these two it's a pretty sad affair. I gave it 2 stars instead of one out of respect for Ben Kingsley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"I managed to see Sexy Beast in England this February. Being a fan of Ben Kingsley I didn't have much expectations other than seeing him on the screen. But the movie was worth watching.The plot is as follows: Gal (Ray Winstone) is retired from villainy, living the lazy life in a villa in Spain with his ex-porn star wife, Deedee (Amanda Redman), when Logan (Ben Kingsley) turns up to recruit him for a bank job in London. He has every intention of refusing, except that Logan is not a man to cross, being pathologically unhinged.The film has a very interesting and good opening scene. I'm not gonna spoil it for you but I'll say that it's between a man and a boulder.The acting is superb. Especially Ben Kingsley is nothing short of amazing. When looked overall, the movie has its flaws but it's worth giving a try.Note: If there was an option I would give it 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Everything I Heard","review":"I felt misled by the many reviews when I watched this movie. I give it 2 stars strictly based on Ben Kingsley's performance, which was excellent. Without his performance as the no-nonesense gangster this movie would have failed miserably. I felt the movie quirky and mostly dull.Most of the movie revolves around a few retired gangsters that are trying to avoid being pulled back in by the dominating character that Kingsley portrays. While there are a few moments of interest overall it fails. I would recommend \\"The Suicide Kings\\" before this movie if you are looking at off beat movies about gangsters and friends.In the end it left me dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the fainthearted","review":"IF you don't like foul language and graphic violence stop right here. If you can cope with that then take the oppurtunity to see this remarkable movie. Ben Kingsley is remarkable in his role as a criminal psychotic who puts the fear of god into retired criminal Gal and his retired porn star wife.The surprise of the movie to me though, was the way Gal began the movie as a somewhat unsympathetic character but in contrast to Kingsley became the character we most felt connected to. I found the love affair between Gal and his wife poignant and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsley Makes it","review":"First off, people have stated plot holes and of course if they paid attention and thought for themselves instead of wanting it layed out for them they'd see there are none:-Don goes to recruit Gal because Gal is in the same area as Jackie, a girl that Don has the hots for, NOT because he actually wants to recruit Gal. There are better thieves than Gal but Don wants Gal because it gives him an excuse to see Jackie (I thought that was painfully obvious)-Gal has no choice but to do the heist because of what he has done (trying not giving away anything here). If he doesn't do it then he figures he will be in A LOT of trouble with the top menThe film itself is not perfect. It's plot is rather simplistic but it is Kingsley's performance that makes this movie escalate beyond that (and yes Winstone is good as well). Kingsley is absolutely frightening and genuinely psychotic in the film. He turns a film that would have probably been just \\"alright\\" to something gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely psychotic","review":"A thriller that is so absurd that it becomes funny. One retired gangster is forced into a hold up of a very special type, not by the special agent coming from the boss, but by his own wife who kills the agent. The break-in works but the boss knows what must have happened to his agent, a boss who is definitely bizarre due to the killing he does after the break-in and the fact that he lets our hero go though he is not secure any more. It's the type of thriller that is concentrating on the completely psychotic psychology modern gangsters have who live against the law and yet live by a law that is even stricter than the one they break. But, all in all, that's slightly easy and I just wonder if the main interest of the film is not the four letter words the agent uses in abundance.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Université Paris Dauphine, Université Paris I Panthéon Sorbonne"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Kingsley was great in his role, but I couldn't understand anything that was said. Thank goodness for DVD subtitle option! That helped. But all in all, I was disappointed. At the end, I said \\"IS THAT IT!?!\\" I was truly surprised. I didn't feel like I had watched a movie. It wasn't terrible or anything, just disappointing. Guess it just depends on your taste. Maybe if there was more character development? Honestly, it seemed more an exercise for Kingsley as an actor, or perhaps a one-dimensional display of a crazed, violent personality. This film missed something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Kingsley's Best Role","review":"This movie makes up for the all forgettable stuff he's doing lately.

Winstone plays Gal, a retired hood padding through hot, bleary and alcoholic days with his wife (Amanda Redman) in sun-baked Spain. The opening scenes show the heat and the torpor of their lives, when suddenly, back comes Trouble in the person of Don Logan, played by Ben Kingsley, a pyschopathic mob boss from London, with a command to Gal, that he must do One Last Job.As good as Winstone is, however, Kingsley steals the show. His performance radiates a profrane, brutal and relentless intensity that literally creates a force field of fear all around him. Amanda Redman, as Gal's wife, also does turns in a subtle but very effective performance.How Gal deals with Don Logan, and then the job, make for a highly entertaining hood film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep","review":"Boring.

The only downfall as noted by the other buyers is the lack of \\"protection\\" used during shipping. These clamps looked like they were packaged by a six year old, and even the UPS guy filled out a damage report for them before they even got to me due to the poor condition of the packaging. If you call Amazon they will ship you out more for free, but expect the plastic heads to be bashed around and cracked. On the good side, the cracked plastic is just a wood friendly non-marring piece and is wrapped over a nice solid aluminum head. Order these items over the phone and tell Amazon to get their butts in gear on the shipping! They are still the best priced clamps, and the best quality clamps that you can buy. Oh well, so many good deals on Amazon I can deal with a few hickups.

Great product, but I would hesitate before buying anything that is shipped from Noble Direct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clamp","review":"Good clamp. Good: Faces stay square. Heavy bar which won't deflect. Fast and easy to tighten. Square backs allow them to stay straight up on a bench. Bad: Clamps are heavier than you might think which can make them cumbersome... especially if you want to clamp a 12\\" board with a 50\\" clamp. the face of the clamp only tightens about 1-1/4\\" before you hit the end of the screw.

You need multiples of all sizes. The Jorgensen along with the Pony pipe clamps are my favorites. They are easy to set up and use, they hold the piece tight and with the rubber pads they don't mar the wood. They also make a 24\\" and above with a ratcheting system (very nice). You can't go wrong with Jorgensen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","review":"I generally do a lot of research and digging before I make a tool purchase.

Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woodworking essential","review":"I have four of these clamps and I need about eight more. When it comes to achieving a strong solid glue joint, good clamping is absolutely essential. These clamps are easy to use with the sliding clamp head and can apply a strong pressure to the piece you're gluing. You can put a wood shim under the jaws to avoid marring the wood surface. The bar will rust if not oiled or waxed but a little steel wool will clean it up. The 36\\" will handle most clamping needs and the price is low enough to allow buying enough for uniform clamping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy a larger clamp.","review":"This is a great tool, and it does the job that it was designed to do.I would just recommend that if you are considering buying this to consider the 12, 24 or 36 inch versions instead.

Kubrick's movie was written, directed and acted with the knowledge that S. King needs to be edited, A LOT, before he stuff is ready for the camera. This movie, like The Stand, fails because the producers didn't have the sense to slice, pare, and whittle King's work down to a managable form that works. Books are a great medium for authors like King because you can wind, meander, and stroll through concepts at your leisure and the fluff is not so obvious. In a movie, you've got to cut out all the ancillary-related stuff and get to the point. This movie fails to do just that.

In particular, the scenes are overlit. In addition, like most King production on which he's a part, the scenes jump to much. The film lack continuity. Just when it builds up, it quickly cuts to another scene.The only redeeming quaility is Rebecca De Mornay, although it's hard to imagine how such a lovely wife would stick with such a loser husband.Kubric might not have adapted King's book acurately, but it was a brilliant film nonetheless. Stephen Kind should have just accepted it and forgone this movie, for it's truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare argument against the author's involvement","review":"Apparently Stephen King didn't like the original Shining because it didn't stick to his book so much. He then wrote this teleplay to ensure faithfulness to the source material. Now, I have seen both Shinings as well as read the book. This version suffers from both late-career-lameness on King's part and tv-version-watered-downness. FWIW, every King TV-adaptation has been 100% non-scary. This fits that bill.

The answer in this case, is no. I mean, how can Steven Weber's Jack Torrance compare to Jack Nicholson's amazingly over the top performance in the original? And how can those [fake] looking hedge animals compare with the hedge maze from the original, which worked wonders for the first film, being the setting for the climatic chase and the demise of the lead. How much faster can an axe chop down a door than a damned croquet mallet?? If you want Steven King's The Shining, then go and read the book, but if you want a film version, then I would say that Kubrick's version is the only way to go. Steven King isn't that great at getting involved with the film versions of his novels (remember Maximum Overdrive?).Yes, Kubrick's version may not be faithful, but it's better than this made for TV [stuff]."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the &*@%??!!","review":"Is it possible to rate 0 statrs?

The ABC Mini Series version does a far better job of capturing King's original story. Overall the acting is great, the atmosphere is creepy and there are a few nice shocks thrown in for good measure.

It compensates well what Kubrik film missed. Steven King is for sure the king of the horror but he writes some excellent human dramas as well. From his Four Season novel 2 great human drama movies were made, most notable of which is STAND BY ME. Kubrik version is scary and hopeless.

The only thing this had to do with The Shinning was Stephen King's name. The characters have the same name but the story is totally off the wall. First they tried to take an hour long movie and turn it into a mini-series. It doesn't work. Second the cast is second rate compared to the first, not to say they can't act becuase they are all fine actors, they just didn't fit the roles. They replace Jack's axe with a crocket mallet and in the end he dies saving the lives he once threatened.

I will say that this version followed the book more closely, but the casting was horrible. Stephen Weber, and Rebecca De Mornay have been excellent in other roles, but in this movie, they suck. Pour direction most likely.The hardest thing to endure about this version is the absolutly pathetic preformance (if you could call it that) from the child who was cast to play Danny. If the film had a buget over a buck twenty five they should have went with Haley Joel Osment, now there is a kid who can act!! Buy or rent at your own risk, but what ever you do, don't expect a whole lot. This movie is made for people who watch Glitter, Scream, and Ghosts of Mars.

As a tv-show in three episodes it nearly is a masterpiece. The locations, the hotel itself, the actors (and characters) -highly entertaining, and quality horror. \\"The lady in the bathtub\\"-scene is perhaps one of the most scariest things I have ever seen on tv. I mean it!If you liked Stanley Kubricks' version of the book (that King obviously did not?) you might find this closer-to-the-book-version by the author himself interesting.

This is perhaps even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll take the original please...","review":"Rebecca De Morany is better looking than Shelley Duvall. Definitely. However, that's about the only way this version of \\"THE SHINING\\" is better than the original.Perhaps one of the biggest reasons why is that the original falls under a category of ...oh, something like SCARY!!! Jack Nicholson's maniac performance is brilliant but it is also terrifying. The bathtub scene is unparalleled in its nastiness. And the maze? What happened to the maze? I realize that it wasn't in the original King novel, but they could have left that magnificent sequence in. (Anything was better than those \\"very, very scary, very, very real-looking\\" lion-shaped shrubs that came alive!)The illustrious Stanley Kubrick is rolling in his grave. It makes me quite sad that he lived to see this mockery of his original 1980 masterpiece. (Maybe - with any luck - he missed it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Good as the Original if not Better!","review":"I like both versions a whole lot. Steven Weber really surprised me with his performance here and Rebecca D. was much better than that annoying Shelley Duvall from Kubrick's version. I like how Jack Torrance slowly became obsessed and crazy due to the hotel, whereas, Nicholson was going crazy from almost the start. This version also follows the book nearly perfectly, by having the ghosts more interested in Danny and his powers than just making his father a murderous psycho. I own both versions on DVD, and while the 1980 version is a horror classic, this is the version I prefer to watch to get the meaty story that Kubrick left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Times Change","review":"It's amazing. When Kubrick's version hit theaters twenty odd years ago, it was universally panned by critics, fans and King himself. Very little positive was said about it, from Jack's overblown performance, to Shelley Duvall's non-performance, to Kubrick's butchering of the story.Yet, today, it's hailed as a hallmark of horror cinema and a Film Master's under-appreciated masterpiece.How times do change...Which brings me to the mini-series. Perfect? Of course not. Horrible? Not at all. Well made, well cast and well written (by King himself no less...so I have to laugh at stabs on the writing), it offers a tour through the Overlook fans were denied in 1980. Some moments work, others don't.But all in all, still a fun ride through the haunted house.Sort of like Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" when it first came out.Let's see what people have to say about this one in twenty years."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This version of The Shining is fantastic!!!

Rebecca De Mornay's Wendy is more like a post-feminist 90s female crusader than a teacher's wife, a scripting decision patently done 'by the board'. Webber, an actor who I like, is inadequate for the Jack Torrance role - he simply hasn't got the depth.A sugary confection best-avoided and by no means a definitive version of the excellent book.That said the dead woman in the bath is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen rendered on screen, and knocks even Kubrick's creepy version of the scene into a cocked hat. Neither is faithful to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's Shining","review":"We had just spent a couple nights at The Stanley in Estes Park, CO, so wanted to see the version of Stephen King's movie that he made -- inspired by and filmed at The Stanley.

No longer did I dismiss the film as just another bad Kubrick film (and let's face it, he made quite a few); I now saw it as an abomination. This mini-series, however, does a much better job of adapting Stephen King's classic tale.

The original is a classic and this one is very well done, but not as well done as the original. If you are a Stephen King fan, you should at least give it a try. Just do not expect something as great as Stanley Kubrick's legendary version of The Shining. I would call this being close to being a semi-great movie. Still, this is a very good movie that is definately worth viewings. However, this is the only good remake of a Stephen King adaptation, for the remakes of The Dead Zone, Carrie, and Salem's Lot sucked horribly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie... actually a mini-series","review":"I had visited the Stanley Hotel and wanted to see the version of the Shining that was actually filmed at the Stanley. This version is similar and then again very different from the movie version with Jack Nicholson. I understand that Stephen King was very instrumental in the planning and filming of this mini-series. It has substantially more detail and it is a little easier to follow each character. Don't try to watch it all in one sitting! I do recommend this mini-series and would buy it again. The Stanley is a wonderful hotel in a wonderful town, Estes Park, Colorado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"I enjoyed this version of The Shinning.

And the characters made a little more sense and casting was great also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staying faithful doesn't save it!","review":"Whether this 1997 ABC television movie version was entirely faithful to Stephen King's original novel is almost irrelevant. The film is doomed from the start for two reasons; the minor being that when you have the now-classic 1980 Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson version (faithful or not!) looming in the shadows like a parasite, you can't possibly expect to come close. The major reason being, simply put, it wasn't scary; not even a little bit.If you're making a Stephen King TV movie out of a Stephen King book that's supposed to be scary, and it ISN'T, then it's project over! Not that it can't be done on TV, though. IT and THE STAND were effectively frightening in all the right places. And if you can remember the original SALEM'S LOT on CBS back in 1979; Hell, that was so scary, it could have passed for a theatrical horror film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deron, you are wrong.","review":"This version very closely follows King's intent and storyline. In the novel, Jack Torrance DID NOT freeze to death in the maze like the Kubrick/Nicholson version but DID die when the boiler-room blew up, which is exactly what this newer version shows, correctly. Plus, Jack Torrance DID carry around a croquet mallet towards the end, not an axe, like the Kubrick version falsely showed. Finally, Jack Torrance DID NOT say \\"Here's Johnny\\", no matter how good Nicholson did it in the Kubrick version.Whenever one tries to make a movie or mini-series out of a novel, they should keep as close to the original storyline, and thus, the author's intent, as possible. Therefore, I'll take this 4 hour Stephen King certified version over the 2 hour 20 min Kubrick version any day. I own both versions and this version is the one that I refer as the novel's companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original","review":"I remember years ago when I saw the theater version of The Shining. I was so impressed I wanted to see if king made it more frightening in the book. I found out that Kubick basically took the premis from the book, but made enough changes that it was indeed a different version altogether. That's not to say there was anything wrong with that version, but just different. I think in the 80's it would have been so expensive to stay closer to the original story without CG that Kubic had to make adjustments. This version made for TV was able to stick to the original story much better. Kubic's is the masterpiece, but this is a really good version too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining-Steven Webber","review":"As a born and raised Mainer,I have been a King fan for Many years !

I've done cabinets without this tool and I just did one with this tool. There is no comparison! This tool makes hanging cabinets a BREEZE! You can get the cabinet faces lined up very nicely, drill and counter-sink your screws, pull the cabinet claws and you're done. This tool makes this job SOOOOOOO easy! As some reviews have said -- you're a bit \\"blind\\" when you drill the holes because you can't really see into the drill holes/guides. However, as long as your drill is straight and you take the time to mark your drill bit you wont have to worry about the big coming out of the face of the cabinet or thru the other side.Can you hang cabinets without this tool -- yes. But why would you.... for around $50 your cabinets will be perfect...One thing I would suggest --- I wrapped electrical tape around the tool to protect the cabinet surface from marring.... Not sure if it would have, but why take the chance...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice thought, poor implementation","review":"The Cabinet Claw's are a great idea. Problem is they didn't think about someone doing custom cabinets where the finished joined face frame is 1 1/2\\" (the same size as the rest of the face frame). It assumes you are joining 2 - 1 1/2\\" frames rather than 2 - 3/4\\" frames totaling 1 1/2\\".

My only critisism is the pin (a rolled piece os steel that holds the two pieces of the clamp together at the screw) repeatedly came out of the hole and allows the clamp to separate. This has happened to both clamps and has been remedied by opening the cylinder with a nail set and redriving it back into the hole.

The sound on this album marks the next level in Ani DiFranco's ever- evolving sound. She is a bit more experimental, veering away from the strict acoustic style of some of her earlier recordings, and playing with some more electronic sounds.

The problem is, if that was supposed to create dramatic tension, it didn't.Ambitious? Sure. Did it succeed? No. There was unquestionably a story here, but telling the story mainly through the eyes of a private detective wasn't the right way to go about it. This is a problem, sometimes, with writers.

On paper, this project probably looked amazing. Just reading the synopsis, it sounds great! How could it go wrong? Unfortunately, the sum of all those would-be-awesome parts turned into little more than a disappointing let down.The dialog feels off. The actors don't seem to have enough to work with or maybe it's the wrong chemistry. Nothing is thoroughly explained - even for a mystery. Motivations are either hazy or non-existent. There are many \\"dead spots\\" where the film just kind of drags or loses focus. I don't know what happened, but Lord of Illusions sucks. Just saw it again for the 2nd time. My original viewing was about 10 years ago.

Leslie Klinger, who pulled off the miracle of Christmas 2004, does it again for 2005. This time the Holmes scholar provides illustrations (some came with the original novels) and astute footnotes and more to the four Holmes novels (SEE A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF FOUR, THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, and THE VALLEY OF FEAR). As with the shorts, besides having the novels (this reviewer read the last one for the first time recently) the tome contains anecdotes and definitions to Victorian era terms and lively Holmesian debates and treatise on related subjects.

Klinger has managed to distill a century of this wit and wisdom into one compendium.

It is an overview of all topics in Colorado history, and provides recommended readings in the back if you are interested in further research.A couple of previous reviewers had complaints which are without merit (at least for this edition, I haven't read the previous four editions.) One complains about the writing. While the authors won't win any Pulitzers for their prose, it is a competently written, clear book without any academic jargon.As for the criticism of the pre-Columbian coverage, they summarize what is known from the archaeological record. They don't engage in speculative flights of fancy, as some recent authors do, about all the details of those societies. The Pueblo civilizations in particular are difficult, as they abandoned their homes in Colorado well before the Europeans came into the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorado history designed for reading rather than reference","review":"\\"Political and economic developments from the prehistoric Indians to the establishment of modern missile bases, designed for reading, rather than reference.\\" Colorado history buffs should not miss this scarce copy title.

It is full of typos and the authors' personal opinions and speculations, presented as facts. You would think that they would have the kinks worked out by the ninth edition, but one wonders why they bothered putting out a new one at all. The book is disorganized and fails to explain terms whose definitions are clearly needed by the reader. Also the entire preface was a glorifying ode to the authors, detailing how awesomely clever they are for having written it. I have seen better historical writing in Cracked articles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccessible Text makes for Agonizing Reading","review":"\\"A Colorado History\\" [9th ed.] by Ubbelohde/Benson/Smith is burdened by a reader-unfriendly text as inaccessible as an anchor sunk in sand at the bottom of an ocean. The book's subject may be interesting; its scope may be admirably comprehensive; its facts and figures may be derived from the most thorough research; but the authors' presentation of the material is pedantic, plodding, unduly fastidious, and dull, dull, dull. The authors' writing style is worse than merely wooden--it's petrified wooden. Try hacking through 490 pages of that stiff &@#*! Not even the sharpest axe is worth wasting on the effort.My heartiest recommendation: put every copy (including yours, if applicable) in a box, tie it with a ribbon, and throw it in the ever-lovin' deep blue sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting read","review":"This book is excellent and really delves into the topic of mixing better than any other reference I've found. The author's 3d plots are a really useful tool for visualization. I had a basic working knowledge of mixing before reading this book and feel that I have a much better grasp of the subject material afterwards. Mixing is of course something that you can only master through actual practice -- you can't just read about it. However, this book will make it much easier to get your mixes up and running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures but nearly content free","review":"This book presents a highly simplistic view of what it takes to mix a quality recording.

There are a couple of good points, but they're buried and not obvious. As a musician and home-studio engineer I found this book mostly useless. It might help someone just starting out, but if you know what a mixer, compressor and effects unit are, read Bobby Owinsky's \\"The Mixing Engineer's Handbook\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it at the store, as advised.

On the other hand, it did have some useful info on equalization settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"...What I will say is that the advice given in this book is, in no way, worth the price if the book. The information is far too basic and is presented over and over again until the reader is completely turned-off by the whole concept. In short, we are asked to visually represent a mix in terms of volume, panning, and frequency. This is done with a basic X-Y-Z axis and a series of colored spheres representing the different instruments. That covers about 5 pages. Throughout the rest of the book , we are hit with what seems like hundreeds of these same graphs, each representing examples of different mixes. The problem is, they do not teach us anything other than \\"every mix is different\\". To me, that's just not enough.In short, the basic theory is good, but it is more geared toward a magazine article than to an entire book. By making the concept into a book, we are presented with a lot of over-priced fluff which, in reality, detracts from the fact that the basic theory makes sense..."},{"rating":"1","title":"nearly useless","review":"gibson's book is kind of a one trick pony. you instantly get what he's going for and, to be fair, it's a neat idea to visualize music this way. but, if you're serious at all about mixing or even listening to music, you immediately realize that you knew all of this already. my advice would be read this in a bookstore for about 3 minutes and then get Bobby Owsinski's book Mixing Engineers Handbook for some truly useful info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for what it is.","review":"This is bs, so expensive for what it is.

There were too many sub-plots that demanded more attention than Smith could give in a light mystery novel.

Read the earlier books in the Langdon series to get a better example of Smith's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not among her best","review":"I have read all of Julie Smith's novels and will continue to do so because of the atmoshpere of New Orleans that they exude.

Let's hope the next in the series will be a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie Smith needs to learn how to write","review":"I happened upon this novel, and I use the word very loosely, because as a writer myself I am always reading into different genres and authors. This novel is just bad. I have not read any other of Mrs Smith's novels, so I won't make a blanket analysis of her work in general, but this particular book leaves a lot to be desired. Characterization is dismal, trite and a little pompous. Some of the stereotypes were so blatent I wondered if the author was or was not racially biased. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but it is impossible to ignore the constant and unrelenting dialogue that panders to the lowest common denominator. I struggled through this book, and to be fair, it did get better near the end. I would not recommend it however, and hope that this novel is not a baseline for Julie Smith's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but we have to give up on this series.","review":"My husband and I have bought all the Skip Langdon novels because we love to reminisce about New Orleans. However, with this book, Smith's negative stereotyping of African Americans has gone too far. Smith's African American characters are caricatures. Their deepest relationships are shallow, grossly sexual, and clownish. In this book, Smith informs the reader that macho Italian men do not date African American women. My husband is Italian, and I am an African American woman. I've known at least six African American women who agreed to become involved with at least one of the Italian men who pursued them. Too bad Smith does not stick to writing about Euro-American (white) emotional and criminal interactions, which she seems more willing to develop beyond stereotyping. It's a disappointing end to a promising series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great traveling book","review":"This book would probably be best for someone above 7 years old, as some of the mazes and puzzles would be frustrating for a younger person.

I connected to \\"32 Flavors\\" from the first time I heard it. I love \\"Shy,\\" \\"Hour Follows Hour,\\" and \\"Cradle and All,\\" but one of the finest tracks I've heard in a long time is \\"The Million You Never Made.\\" She sorta turns into Wendy O.

It is raw and emotional, and I feel that she spends a lot of time apologizing and, at the same time, refusing to apologizing for what she's done and who she is.This album is an anthem for feminists everywhere. One song that always grounds me is \\"Cradle and All.\\" I love her adaptation of \\"Rock-a-bye baby\\" and how her words make me feel calm throughout the stress that blinds me throughout the day.\\"I'm not a pretty girl\\" reminds me to be an individual regardless of the chauvinistic society we live in. To be the woman that I am and to ignore the beliefs that crowd my femininity.Whenever I'm feeling pissed off or bitter, I listen to this album to remind me that I'm not the only one who's angry, and that sometimes, I have a right to be.

She is such an incredible artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"once you listen, there is no turning back","review":"I have always shied away from artisits with huge cult followings. such die-hard fans that LIVE for someone's music are really annoying, but once you listen to ANi, there truly is no turning back. Her prose is so honest, so self-revealing: she often reveals her listeners to themselves. you feel her frustation with the conformity of main-stream music because she opens your eyes to what music can be, and what is through her. enough gushing, just do yourself a favor and buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introuduction to a unique musician...","review":"This album was my intro to Ani DiFranco about three years ago.

This album is a great way to familiarize yourself with an artist who will surely become a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrrrr!","review":"My first and to date only Di Franco album ,and what a shock. A girl who can mix hip hop vibes and cutting lyrics and do it on an acoustic guitar? Surely not. If you don't think those wooden boxes can rock, listen to Ani, she does something different to anyone else. And she really has some things to say, not to mention a forceful way of saying them! So, she's not saying anything you've heard before, and she sure doesn't sound like anyone you've heard before. Try her, I don't guarantee you'll like her, but you won't forget her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A talented girl","review":"This is and probably will always be my favorite of Ani DiFranco's albums. It is the first one I bought, so a large part of it is probably nostalgia, but regardless it is an Ani classic. One of things I love so much about Ani is that she puts every single part of herself into her music: love, hate, fear, angst, and famously, views on every social and political issue you could think of. She doesn't have a line she won't cross, she truly puts herself out there in a way that artists rarely do today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"Ani Difranco is amazing on this CD.

The whole album is so perfect. Its a joy from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ani is a fantastic artist who can really express herself.","review":"Since this CD is one of her older records, Ani stays with her older style of singing. Which would be her funky, yet hypnotizing fluctuations and notes, which I have always enjoy. Over all this Cd is one that I would listen to straight through and want to listen again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Everyone","review":"So the songs are pretty good, covers of other people's music are always rather sketchy, but I do like what I hear a lot. The songs are worthy of being stuck in your head for long periods of time, leaving you to do whatever you can to expell them- dance, sing, mutter curses under your breath. The fact is the songs walk the tightrope between good, and annoying. I find that they all land in the former. Some songs, mostly bringing to mind Are Friends Electric?, are quirky and enjoyable, but skim the surface of being potentially irritating- so this isn't something I will usually recommend to my friends.Wanna try something not-so-new? Go for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTF?","review":"This album shreds! Who gives a crap if they're covers? The opening track has been stuck in my head for at least a month now, and is far better than the original (which I still love mind you; but like a previous reviewer stated: Tool kicked ass on No Quarter, so why can't these guys kick ass?). The guitar effects are very remniscent of Orgy..... only good. The synthasizer really adds an effect to say the least. This isn't a cover band, this is a band in itself, and though Paul D'Amour is overshadowed by his previous band Tool, he is a great musician and has a great voice as heard on the last track which is a Pink Floyd cover. Also check out his band Lusk. This album is good, and if nothing else should be given a listen at least once.(oh; and for all you die-hard posterboy Maynard freaks; he's on here too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raphie and La Selecta's best from 1978-83.","review":"Raphie Leavitt's Orquesta La Selecta is one of the longest-running Puerto Rican salsa bands.

The mat appears heavy enough to stay in place, but I rather be safe then sorry.

I believe that when I am 90 years old I will be listening to \\"both hands\\" in my rocker, with my eyes closed and still seeing, as if in reality, the open stretch of road before me, the blue sky above me, and feel the wind in my hair, the sun warm on my face and most importantly...a peace and rest in my heart. Her music takes me to honest places in myself and says some of the most important things that most people can't find the words to express. I have thanked my friend for the gift of this CD so often that she went out and bought me Ani's double live CDs...maybe I should thank her again:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ani DiFranco's most soulful work","review":"Ever since I heard a copy of my friend's \\"Not a Pretty Girl\\" CD a few years back I have had a love-hate relationship with Ani's music. I really loved her lyrical poetry but found some of the songs very hard-core compared to the words. I have since held off buying other CDs wondering if I would have the same feeling. I just bought this CD and listened to it across the Golden Gate Bridge on a recent trip to SF. I was very impressed with the acustic style and wonderful words. Ani has a very soulful style on this album that I felt opened up to me a lot more than Not a Pretty Girl. I listen to this CD a lot now and each time I hear something new in the songs. This is definitely not background music, folks.

They bought 3 of her CD's for me. This just happens to be my favorite. So raw and natural. She was only 19 I guess when she produced this CD and she was already so insightful. I remain impressed with Ani even though I no longer listen to her on a regular basis. She doesn't have much to say to me anymore, BUT, whenever I listen to this CD, I remember where I've come from and how far I've traveled since then. The two tracks I mentioned previously are the best on the CD. Her poem, \\"The Slant\\" is also excellent. How could she know all this at such an age?

DaFoe's other books are great too, and you should try getting them too, and they aren't hard to find now, since two just recently were reprinted.

The story concerns Catherine Holly and the strange story she has to tell about her cousin Sebastian. Her tale wreaks havoc within her family, particularly with her Aunt Violet, who places the girl in an asylum and wants her subjected to a lobotomy. However, the action of the play is negligible; where Williams places the chills are in the various stories told by all the characters, filling in a portrait of the bizarre, sinister Sebastian Venable.

I wait for my trips. I am not intimidated with the snooty waiters, as I did my \\"homework.\\" I'm prepared to ask questions about loaves and wine and anything else. The set-up of the chapters was easy reading, too. I trusted the writers. I discovered more secrets in Paris via their investigations and risky ventures. I didn't have to suffer the frustrations of getting lost on the metro nor the pains of tusseling with those Parisian cabbies. I especially enjoyed the trips to the new and modern Paris as described by Paul Goldberger. Do you want to loaf with a loaf, drink a bottle away from the bottlenecks? Read this book. Also, I will read other books in the Modern Library Food series based on my enjoyment of Ruth Reichl choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: This was recorded in EP mode!","review":"I just bought this tape and found that all 57 or so minutes of it are crammed onto a few feet of tape because it was duplicated in EP mode instead of SP.

May not be feasible at the daily workbench, but if you need to move around - home, then work, job site, then they are all there. Use with hand ratchet or impact. Unless I need a thin wall socket for clearance, I usually don't bother to grab my Snap-on's anymore. Have had these for about 2 years I think it is now. Case has held up well so far.

He takes no responsibility for his actions, even the troubles that landed him in jail. He clearly was involved in some serious stuff.

Their first CD was based on the gimmick that they were the worst band in the world, and for what it was worth, was very humorous (\\"House me Teenage Rave\\" still cracks me up and \\"Obey the Cowgod\\" had a most excellent hook.) But with this CD, it seems like they were just way too full of themselves. There's just not a whole lot of laughs and quite a few of the songs are incomprehensible or just plain lame. (Super Elastic, Fight, Orange Krunch, Anthem, Jump). The only highlights are \\"Carnage Rules\\", \\"Jerk\\" and \\"Fixation\\". If they were going to do this album better, I'd say get over yourselves and put at least twice as many songs into it, to balance out the crap factor (like a certain grindcore band I might name, but can't because I'd be censored!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Fairly good album.

After only 2 weeks of having it, we were ready to buy a replacement like the Bright Starts Comfort & Harmony Cozy Cart Cover, Calypso Blue cover we already had. It usually took 2 of us to get his feet in/out. He's 22 months, so maybe this works better for younger kiddos.

He can sit up, but with the constant movement and developing muscles I think a pillow surrounding him in the seat would help give more comfort.

This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye. Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced.

Until now, I've always used Polar, but the price of this watch made me want to give it a try. What a mistake.

This watch is great because the digital readout it large enough where I don't have to stop to look at it, I can see it while still moving. To date, the watch is very accurate and does nearly everything I need it to do, plus the price and shipping time were extremely wonderful!

I wanted to start with something inexpensive so I can determine how effective these are for training. The item worked well for about 5 mos then it started to give false (low bpm) readings. I replaced the batteries, but it did not solve the problem. I just think its a very poor quality and hence the low price. The inability to download is also a negative on this product. My suggestions is to pay a little more and go with a more reputable brand in this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap works, watch doesn't","review":"The strap never synced with the watch.

It isn't particularly stylish, but it shows your heart rate on a large display and you don't have to/can't mess much with buttons during your workout. The metrics it remembers aren't that useful (average heart rate, peak heart rate and time monitoring), but it doesn't really matter - it performs the basic function very well. It works MUCH better than a Timex heart rate monitor I bought 8 years ago in that the strap immediately picked up my pulse without needing to build up a sweat first or wetting down the monitor strap. Wetting the strap with tap water does help with erratic readings when you begin your workout, so it does help some. I bought 2 of them, one is perfect - the other has a sticky button on top (which has gotten better with use). Hopefully it will retain it's water resistance since I wash these things under the faucet to clean them. If it breaks, I would definitely replace it with the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This product does not work.

This is a low end HRM without a lot of features but it was all I really needed.Recently, it has started to quit working during some workouts. During some runs when my heart rate is high (above 175) it just quits. Other days it seems to work fine. It is very annoying when it quits in the middle of a workout so you lose your time as well as the heart rate information. If it keeps acting up, I will probably return it to Timex. They charge a $7.00 postage and handling fee to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd love to tell you how this item works, but...","review":"It was sent to me with a dying battery. The digital screen on the watch would fade in and out, the indigo didn't work, every button had to be pressed a hundred times to register that anything had happened on the watch face. Also, the chest strap didn't work. It gave me three readings - a resting rate of 200+, a resting rate of 61, and a resting rate of 90. It took me about 20 tries to get even these inaccurate readings. It was suggested that I change the batteries in both of the NEW products I just recieved two days ago and only removed from packaging last night. So, for the $34.99 that the watch cost, plus around $15 to change the watch battery, plus $2.50 for a new chest strap battery... That's over $50.00. If I wanted to spend over 50, I would've bought a monitor with more features! And even if I buy the batteries and get everything changed, I'll be out even more money if it still doesn't work and I have to send it back. Not cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"I've had this HRM for about a year now and I love it. It works well. I've never had a problem with it.

It's the only heart rate monitor I've ever had that would work while biking into a wind (I'm sure those who have used heart rate monitors are familiar with this phenomenon). Now, after several battery changes in the watch and the chest strap, the monitor is apparently not receiving the signal. The watch works fine as a watch, but not as a monitor.Also, you're advised by Timex to send the watch back to the factory to have the battery replaced. So, you'd better be prepared to be without a heart rate monitor for a couple of weeks in order to do this. What I did was replace the battery myself which entailed shorting out the battery within it's cradle (no bid deal).I'd give it 5 stars if the thing was still working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has never worked","review":"My Timex Easy Trainer Heart Rate Monitor has never worked - save your money.This is not my first heart rate monitor and I have tried and tried to get the Timex to work.

This should give you a clue about how hard it is to use. I gave this to my daughter as a gift and came very close to returning it Christmas morning.

This seems like a lot of trouble to me but she decided to try it a bit longer before sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well enough!","review":"For the price, this works well enough. You really need to wet the strap in order to get a good read on your monitor. The buttons on the monitor are fairly user-friendly. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is that I'm not so sure that the reading is accurate. It seems to read very, very high as compared to other devices I have used in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it is supposed to do.","review":"I was reluctant to pay so little for a heart rate monitor. \\"You get what you pay for\\" always seems to ring true with my purchases. This HRM was discounted pretty nicely with a Prime membership. I run 3 to 7 miles, use an elliptical trainer, and do circuit training that sometimes involves a lot of jumping around. This HRM is comfortable and continues to display my heart rate throughout my daily workout. I haven't taken it on a long run yet, but I will update this review if I have any issues. Oh by the way, the Max Heart Rate formula in the booklet that comes with it did not even come close. After 20 years active duty military, I'm pretty sure my MHR is not 150. The online calculators work fine and are close enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good HRM for the price","review":"I bought this Heart Rate Monitor for P90X. After going through the first few workouts, I realized that I didn't really need a HRM for P90X, but that doesn't take away from this one. For the money, it's very good. It's only got basic features, but I put the chest band on and immediately started seeing my heart rate on the watch. It seems to be accurate, and the chest-band becomes comfortable very quickly. You can even jump around and run w/out worrying about it falling off. Overall, very impressive product considering it's about the cheapest HRM out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped sensing after 6 months","review":"This monitor worked great - occasional use for 6 months - then stopped sensing the pulse.

Easy for me to read on the go. But the stop watch works only when the heart rate monitor is picking up a heart beat which is very unstable, inaccurate, and intermittent . no lap function, no memory, no seconds on watch or even on the stop watch over one hour. All data is erased when stop watch/hrm is started. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"timex hear monitor","review":"This device works as stated, once you figure out how to wear it. The instructions are a bit inadequate but, basically, you just have to strap it on below your boobs, centered on your chest. Sometimes it takes awhile to get it to link to the watch but after that it works well. It agrees with the heart rate measurement given by an elliptical at my gym. It did tell me that I need to pedal harder to get my heart rate over 100 when I am pedaling my bike and it does tell time. Not too complicated but I still haven't figure out the total workout evaluation option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing in the Shower!","review":"I am not pleased with this product at all.

This heart rate monitor is just that, a heart rate monitor. It is not fancy with complicated functions that you would need to take a class to learn how to use. It is simple. It's a watch or a heart rate monitor. To switch back in forth, only one large button needs to be pushed. It will also record your workout time, average heart rate, and peak heart rate. I love the simplicity of it. And I have had great success with it quickly picking up my heart rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"just doesn't work","review":"I have tried two of these devices. The first one worked erratically for a short time then quit working altogether. I returned it and tried a second one. It failed to work at all and was returned.

It's more expensive but at least it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed Frequent Repair","review":"I was happy with this product for the first 6 months or so (within warranty period). Then the chest strap stopped working. I changed the battery, but that didn't help and had to send to Timex for repair at a cost of $8. About six months later the chest strap stopped working again, but now the unit was out of the warranty period. I e-mailed Timex twice explaining the reoccuring problem, but received a standard reply both times. It would now cost $25 to return for repair. It's a reasonably-priced monitor, but if it doesn't work for more than a year and a half and cost almost as much to repair as the original purchase price, it's not worth it. I'm mostly disappointed in Timex for their stock replies and lack of customer service. I will not purchase another Timex heart monitor and would advise others the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great for a while","review":"After I had the product for a month, I thought it was great. Now I have had it 3 months and it no longer works properly. Gives very strange readings; I can be working really hard and according to this my heart rate is going down into the 50's. Right. Forget this; try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit dithering, just buy it!","review":"As an out of shape senior citizen I had to be careful about pushing my heart rate too high. Strenuous exercise would easily kick it over 200 beats a minute. I bought a wrist type monitor, then treadmill with pulse handgrips and in both cases my rate would be all over the scale.I finally decided to try one with a chest band. I bought one for my wife and myself and we have been using them for about a month. This does everything I have wanted...Accurately monitor my heart rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do much","review":"The band takes quite a bit of adjusting on my body to get it to register. I also have to hold the watch close to the band to make it register. I wish it counted calories. If it does it is to hard to figure out.The one thing that I do like about this product is that it wirelessly links up with most of the cardio machines at the gym. I can not get an accurate reading on the machines when I hold the handles. This product links up with the machine and displays my heart rate constantly.I do not think it was worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Issues","review":"I only got to use it 2-3 times before the battery died.

But that excitement turned into frustration fast. First the watch kept turning on and off, so I figured that the contact on the battery was loose. It must have spent me a hour just to replace the battery with its poor design.

Once walking if you don't raise your wrist it dosen't work as well.I haven't changed the batteries yet but they are supposed to be easy to change, both the watch and the chest band take the same size battery and that is important because the chest band is a transmitter and should go through a battery every 24hrs of use. I run for about 30 min so the battery on the chest band should last for about 48 runs.My next heart rate monitor watch will cost about x10 times as much as it will have GPS and will give me my speed, distance as well as my heart rate.

Sometimes it wakes up and reads sensibly but sometimes it stays in its weird mode for the rest of the ride. It's no longer usable.2.

When my pulse is actually taken it's usually around 60-65 at rest. At present it is on my left arm and showing 33. On my right arm is a blood pressure monitor and it is showing a 65 hbr.

Finally, it is like trying to pull a neoprene scuba suit off over your head. What a stupid design. Also, it is extremely uncomfortable on and it chafed my skin. The watch monitor is bulky and difficult to set. It is also very difficult to figure out how to return the product. No shipping manifest was in the box. When I printed out my purchase the date didn't print either so it was very hard to figure out where to look for the returns information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does't work","review":"I have used a few different monitors over the years, mostly Polar. I was just looking for a basic monitor and thought I would give this a try. Problem is that it doesn't work. I even changed batteries on the transmitter in hoping that it was just a quality control problem. It's been moistened, massaged and rebooted. It will work periodically but the watch registers about half the heart rate that the exercise equipment monitor will register. Pretty worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"set it up as per instructions and it does not work. shows only one steady number (110) and does not work. tried several times with same result. very frustrating"},{"rating":"1","title":"HRM was DOA","review":"The clock part worked but the HRM would not show any connection with the sensor. After owning many Timex watches for well over twenty five years this one looked cheap and of very poor quality.

A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"I bought this product from Dick's Sporting Goods. It only lasted a few months before it started struggling to read my heart rate.

I bought it to track my HR during the P90X program. It worked great for a few months giving me the basic features I needed; time, avg HR and Peak HR. I took a few months off of P90X and used it only a few times over the next few months. I recently started the P90X program again and a couple weeks into the program with daily use, the transmitter just stopped working. I replaced the battery, but still nothing. Fortunately I bought a 1 year warranty, so I was able to get a full refund. I will not buy this product or brand again. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Heart Rate Monitor","review":"This is the best heart rate monitor I have ever owned. It has features that the more expensive monitors don't offer for the price. You can replace the batteries on both the Timex wrist watch and the chest band, something you can't do on the more expensive brands (on the expensive brands, when the battery dies on the chest strap, you throw it out and purchase a complete new set)Better yet, the Timex chest band works with the wrist watch of the expense brands (I'm not sure why you would want this because the Timex wrist watch has more features).From now on, I'll buy only Timex Heart Rate Monitors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get any reading","review":"Could not get this one to work.

Namely the average heart rate for the session and the max heart rate I hit. The unit is a snap to use and the display is fine.Strap on the monitor, wet it a little with some water and off I went. The watch paired with the sensor almost immediately.It worked well for nearly two months.Unfortunately like so many others here the unit has stopped working properly. I get a HR for the first few minutes, after a very long pairing time and then the rate just keeps on dropping during the session. Very disappointing.I am doing nothing different. I tried changing the battery to the sensor but same result.Not sure what my next move is but I can not recommend this unit base on this two month trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely could have been designed better!","review":"Just got it in the mail and wanted to try it out. Watch seems great and was really easy to set up. No problems with that. It's the chest strap that could use improvements.

As a female, this really is a pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value ( for warm weather use)","review":"I use this heart rate monitor on my mountain bike. I have had the monitor for a month and I ride at least every other day. It has performed flawlessly. I attach the watch to my handlebar, dampen the chest pads with plain water and off I go. The monitor gives me a constant, uninterrupted, accurate reading of my heart rate which is easy to read. For an inexpensive heart rate monitor that works well this product gets a big \\"thumbs up\\" from me.Review update: I have now used the heart monitor in cold weather which means under several layers of clothes as I ride my bike. Under a nylon t-shirt, light fleece, and wind breaker the monitor does not work. The readings are inaccurate and inconsistent. In warm weather under one shirt on my bike ride it works beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I got the Timex monitor at a nice price and it works fine.

I cannot rate how accurate nor well this worked so my rating is simply on \\"right out of the box\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Heart Rate Watch--works well","review":"This watch is basic, but completes its function accurately and easily. This great for doing high intensity interval training to see that my heart rate is in the right range and avoid slacking off unintentionally.

Since then, I cannot get \\"info\\" to come up, and it only gives me the low heart rate.

Starting back, I got this, and always wear it to the gym. It not only lets me know when I'm about to over do it, but I can see if there is any arrhythmia, a sign I am already overdoing. It has taken a little practice for me to learn what is the right amount of exercise for my body, but it has been very helpful! It's great not to have to stop working to take one's pulse.It isn't possible for my husband to use, however, as he has had rickets, and the chest monitor won't pick up the impulses.

I've used other monitors and this is so inferior, I am amazed that it is even on the market.- you have to apply ' moisture' to get the sensor pads working.

You have to wrestle with it for it to stay on.Truly a pathetic product. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy your oldies in mono!","review":"I honestly cannot recommend this cd for the following reasons- all selections with exception of I'll Hold Out My Hand are in flat and what sounds like totally unprocessed mono. Many of the songs have a lot of hiss also.I have the cd copy of the Clique lp and it sounds really good in full digital stereo. Ihonestly bought this because I was looking for a clean cd copy of Friends by Feather. The copy here sounds like they pressed it too \\"loud\\". It really doesn't sound much better than my original promo 45 copy!. The bottom line is why not remix what they could in true stereo and at least do some reprocessing to enhance the selections that were in mono. I think they just threw it together and really didn't care about the sound quality. What a shame with some real obscure gems here too. Better luck next time White Whale Records.

Anyway, if you liked the Original Celldweller cd then you'll love this 2-disc set with almost 30 songs and several remixes and instrumental versions of songs from their debut cd(2003). However, the best feature of this album is the song \\"Switchback (Detroit 2000)\\". If you were a fan of the original Switchback, then you'll think this is a million times better.. they sacrifice a lil bit of the techno to make this version ALOT heavier.

The title track (Dilate) is one of those songs that totally grabs you from the first note.

Maybe needs some sort of adjustment. Performance of the stove though is quite good, but I have little faith in the igniter.Update:Mine had the same issue and it had nothing to do with fuel. With the piezo you can see the spark jump and on mine it works 1 out of 20 times even after some bending adjustments. The other issue is the stove seems to lose pressure when running for a couple of minutes. This is even on a new cannister of fuel. To be fair I am using MSR canisters but I am not sure why that would make a difference. So If I had to make the purchase again I would go with the MSR equivalent that doesn't have the igniter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading product listing - beware!","review":"Amazon has several listings for the Brunton Raptor camping stove. The product description for the one from Apex Supplier says: \\"Brunton Raptor Stove w/Butane 4 oz, One Size by Brunton\\" yet the stove comes from Apex without the 4 oz Butane canister, also shown in the photo. The same product from another company, listed on the same Amazon page, is priced approx $5 less. I purchased the more expensive Apex version only because it specifically indicates by the words ...\\" w/Butane 4 oz...\\" that the canister was included. I questioned Apex and they said that somewhere in the data it says the canister is not included. Naturally I would have ordered from the less expensive source, had this been evident.

However, naturally I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of cheaters","review":"The Stove comes with no canister!!!

Ten years ago I purchased a long African Blackwood chanter, and after wasting $60 on \\"brand name\\" reeds, I went out on a limb and tried one of my old Pakistan reeds, and it worked like a charm! I still use it today. I recently purchased a couple more just so that I won't ever be without them. The price is very good and it's just a reed, afterall. This is something Pakistani craftsmen actually do well. Bagpipes are a different story, and I would agree with everyone else here that they should be avoided.

The Green River Killer who has killed 30 - 40 women and it took 20 years for hime to get caught. Or the Scott Peterson case, Or the murder of the little blond girl, etc...if she is a real psychic then why doesn't she or others make a quick phone call to the police and provide them with a vision.I saw this show on how much psychics really help solve crimes and it's only about 10% of the time? That show convinced me that psychics just don't exits. The police said, if there were real psychics then we wouldn't need police. Good Point.

Lighten Up Already!This is a book meant to be read with an open and critical mind.

Don't look for earth shattering truths from any psychic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book about our future","review":"For me this book was a real page turner. It held my interest and I finished this book within a few hours. Sylvia's predictions in this book can be very plausible and others are way out there. A few of her predictions will be happening within the next few years so we can see how right or wrong she is. I believe Miss Browne is a true prophet, and like she said in her book no one is 100% accurate.

Her voice is going backwards, she moans and moans, and can't pronounce english words. She should've taken a decent brake, I mean this is her 7th CD in five years!!! Do I need to say more? Seriously all the reviews that you see giving her 5 stars are from her morbin fans that can't get enough of this talentless so called singer.

She should use her \\"new\\" resources and take singing lessons. Mariah at least had a voice before she drifted into trashinnes. So, Thalia, there's still hope for you.

Francis Dolarhyde is the most realistic serial killer ever, and the journey into his mind and his childhood, revealing his gradual development as a murderer is a chilling experience. Nothing can match \\"Red Dragon\\". No fiction, and not even the best true-crime work, such as Robert Ressler's and John Douglas's books (speaking of Bob and John - while reading the book remember that they are the basis for Jack Crawford, while Francis Dolarhyde is based on a never-captured murderer called \\"Search and Destroyer\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dragon","review":"Thomas Harris does an excellent job of bringing the character of Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter to life in this non-stop, suspenseful novel.

(who didn't, right?) I saw the makings of an interesting story begin to materialize, but the wait was in vain, for reading this book is the equivalent of a rained-out ball game: you know something cool was about to happen, but you end up going home disappointed. The plot goes in endless circles, the characters are derivative from earlier, better works, and the ending belongs in \\"I know what you did last summer\\", throwing reason out the window in favor of a cheap thrill. Go read \\"silence\\", you'll thank yourself for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Interesting","review":"While I pursued this book to have read the full trilogy that involves Hannibal Lecter, I was seriously disappointed. While a partially interesting story, it is nothing outstanding. The thing that makes me angry is that this book has been marketed in the last two months as a \\"must read\\" so that you'll meet Hannibal Lecter the first time he was introduced. Lecter is marginal to this story and takes up a miniscule portion of the book. I believe it is unfair to be less that truthful to readers in preparing the marketing campaign for Hannibal (June 1999 publication.)

The monster in this book is just that, A FREAKING monster and his murders are VERY gruesome!

Also, I was hoping that this book would explore the character of Hannibal Lector in more depth, like the book jacket suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched. Extremely overrated","review":"Well, at least it reads fast. This extrememly underwhelming serial killer yarn has some interesting plot elements, but far too many have been done before and done better.

I couldn't get scared of him because I never could believe such a figure existed. He's nothing like real serial killers, who are so much more typical of people around us: that's scary. He's such an anomaly that the chances of running into him are minimal: so why should I be scared? I find the writing in this book to be embarrisingly overwrought as well. When I've shown fans some of the worst passages, they say, \\"well, I skip over most of that stuff.\\" So their idea of a great book is one you skip writing in?? This book does offer thrills, no question, but it doesn't show the talent of dozens of over crime writers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever. Much better than SOTL.","review":"I read this book several years ago, and it still haunts me. It features the best villan ever in Francis Dolarhyde, a brief intro to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and a detective who is not so much different from these serial killers. I did not realize I could feel sympathy for a serial killer or how much pleasure reading could provide. This book is a wild ride into the mind of a killer and impossible to put down.

This book is almost as good as the later one. The opinion loses \\"one star\\" because of the detective's sometimes boring reserse. The best part is the second half of the book, when the killer sad destiny comes up as we get to know the story of his life and you get some symphony of him. If you like \\"Black Sunday\\" and \\"The silence of the lamb\\" you like this one! I promiss!

Let's not forget that it was not Will Graham who entered the mind of a psychopath, but Harris himself -the man is an absolute genius right down to the last detail of his characterizations of life's outsiders, of both the garden variety and the......undefinable, truly truly scary ones. Mr Harris, thank you for inspiring me to take home security SERIOUSLY; approaching it from the eyes of an intelligent, determined homicidal psychopath intent on getting IN. Right down to steel doors guarding safe rooms, double deadbolts, electronic security, lexan windows, an ab-10 assault pistol and .44 Special in secured push-button pistol safes in strategic areas; the works.

Overall, Red Dragon was very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly creepy tale!","review":"Harris delves into a terrifying story with a horrendous villain who will give you the creeps for many days after reading.

Interesting weaving of Hannibal Lecter into this case and downright scary. Not for the squemish. The book picks up it's pace toward the end and while the ending is surprising it is also somewhat predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not yet a let down!","review":"Although Thomas Harris takes a great period of years to complete his novels, he had yet to dissappoint me. He has only published three novels since '75, but the suspense and explosive plot structure is well worth the wait. I could never figure out why Harris did not write a novel involving the manhunt between Dr. Lecter and Will Graham? That alone would make an outstanding plot for a Harris book. But, alas, we have yet to meet Dr. Lecter set apart from the confines of his maximum security facility (Psycho ward!). I am ashamed that I was never introduced to Dr. Lecter during his violent reign of terror. Oh, well, one can only hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Novel Transcends Its Genre","review":"Thomas Harris' first 'Lecter' novel is far and away the best. HANNIBAL was a well-intentioned yet ridiculous exercise, while SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was by far the worst, telling an uninvolving, unconvincing tale with a pallid, uninteresting character like Clarice Starling leading the way. With RED DRAGON, a bizzarely complex, textured, nuanced piece of psychological tension, Thomas Harris created a masterpiece that few novels (David Wiltse's A PRAYER FOR THE DYING being one of the few exceptions) can even come close to matching its brilliance. And Will Graham and Francis Dolarhyde are simply wonderful creations, each possessing infinite layers of complex behaviorlism that make them fascinating narrators.(It was a shame that we lost Graham to the likes of Clarice Starling, who has no rough edges for the reader to key off of; she simply comes off as a depressed young woman who can't get over her rough childhood. Deep.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"This book was recommended for me by readers of my favourite author - Dean Koontz. Saying it was as close to \\"Intensity\\" (the most suspenseful book I've ever read) as you can get. It took me about 2/3 through this book before it got my attention, and found it rather anti-climactic. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dragon","review":"If you are a fan of fan of The Silence of the Lambs will probably really like this book, because we get to meet everyone sfavorite cannibal, Hannibal Lector. And you have to enjoy it. While Hannibal does not help as much this time around, he his a vital part. As with Lambs, we also get introduced to the killer long before Graham does. The only dissapointment is the lack of explanation of the killer's rituals at the end. However, this book has its shares of scares, not as much as Lambs, but it's an extremely enjoyable novel. This book is much like the sequel to it, The Silence of the Lambs which I had read first. It is based around Will Graham attempting to find a serial killer. Eventually, like Clarice in The Silence of the Lambs, he approaches Hannibal, who seems to be able to help everyone in their pursuits of the day's latest madmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Thriller","review":"Though this book is nearly 30 years old, it has stood the test of time. Very action-packed psycho-thriller with some of the more complex villians you will find in a horror/suspense genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Thomas Harris does a marvelous job in writing Red Dragon. From the start, he catches your attention and makes you want to keep reading for whats coming next.Book is about FBI agents trying to catch a man who murdered two families in two different cities. One of the agents (Will Graham) turns to Hannibal Lecter for advice on how to catch this murderer. The book gives the reader an insight into why this man (Francis Dolarhyde) committs his crimes and shows what a horrible childhood he had.A lot of mystery, a lot of forensics, and Thomas Harris knows exactly how to put them all together.A definite must read for people who like forensic mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"I loved Silence of the Lambs (movie) and therefore thought that I would enjoy this book. I found the characters largely uninteresting, and the plot bland. The writing itself particularly struck me as amateurish (I will admit that I read this book after reading classic literature). Overall, I was mostly disappointed because I find it hard to think about Silence of the Lambs without remembering how bad this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"After reading Hannibal, I should have known better than to actually spend money on anything by Thomas Harris. However, I had heard that Red Dragon was a descent book, so I decided to give it a shot. This was a stupid decision. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The element of suspense just isn't there. If you are looking for a frightening read, search elsewhere. The only good thing I have to say about this book is, at least agent Will Graham doesn't fall in love with the Red Dragon at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared the wits out of Me!","review":"Just the way he picked his victims is enough to make your skin crawl. As usual Harris takes you into the mind of the killer whether you like it or not....you can't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Silence","review":"I read Silence of the Lambs before reading Red Dragon, and I started Dragon with great anticipation. I hoped the book would be as thrilling as Silence of the Lambs, but I was dissapointed. The book mentions Hannibal Lechter very little, and the ending of the book is far fetched and too quick. In short, the book was an okay read, although I prefer Silence of The Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it up until the ending.","review":"I found this nearly impossible to put down. However, the lame, quickie ending filled me with such disgust that I flung the book across the room and vowed never to read Silence or Hannibal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"While this is a good book and does offer a few thrills I never really felt drawn in. I read it over a period of three months - putting it down and then picking it back up, etc. - and never really felt the urge to keep reading it on into the night (the calling card of a good book). If you're a fan of Harris' you will probably like it (but avoid Hannibal at all costs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR AND A HALF STARS!","review":"I'M a Thomas Harris fan, so I enjoyed this book. It wasn't as good as THE RED DRAGON and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it was good enough to keep me up all night. The ending could have been better. *** There's a new author out there named A.T. Nicholas that wrote a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD. He's signing the first three thousand sold through Amazon. It's a great supernatural thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Harris really made it with this book, and it's not hard to see why. He has an unbelievably good authorial eye,capturing the essential details of a scene brilliantly. He handles the inner dialogue and thought processes of his villains so well that you feel almost voyeuristic about their twisted, bent world.This book spawned the incredible Silence of the Lambs, and it shares many of the same elements. Eery, dark, foreboding scenes. Chilling evil barely hidden behind the banality of everyday life. Courageous investigators who are not \\"superhumans\\" but mortals, with whom the reader can identify.\\"Red Dragon\\" is captivating, a real page-turner of a book. Four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Not So Happy With Ending","review":"I enjoyed seeing how Hannibal Lecter came into being, yet was surprised at how little he had to do with the story. I guess I was used to his overwhelming presence in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". I would like a \\"prequel\\" to really get into the Hannibal storyline more! But this is another example of Thomas Harris scaring the bejeezus out of you & you coming back for more!The story is plausible, realy & frightening, but I think at the end, it got a bit \\"Stephen King\\" & wasn't as realistic as I would have liked. I turned the page, waiting to see who was going to make a mistake first, Francis or Will Graham. I'm still kind of waiting to find out!I recommend reading this series of books in order and you'll see the progress of evil in Hannibal Lecter & the criminals he helps to catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of its Class","review":"This is, hands-down, the best novel about a serial killer ever written. It was the first, and remains the best, novel in which you see the psychological development of the killer. People aren't born serial killers. They are created. So few stories address how. This one gives you glimpses into how. Food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"What I liked about this novel was that it dove into the psychosis of the killer. By the end of the book, you understood WHY he was psychotic. Most crime novels ignore this treament and chooses to piant the killer as a one dimensional character. Hannibal is barely in this novel and quite honestlY could've been left out. To me his character in the book was used as filler chapters and was at times boring. I found the character development of the FBI profiler and The RED Dragon way more interesting. I really feel I could read anything with WILL Grahms character in it and wish Mr. Harris had included him in the Silence of the Lambs as well.I do feel that people who watch the movies (Manhunter or Red Dragon) first may be dissappointed by the novel only because the movies' interpetations were done so well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort by Harris","review":"It is not his best work which is Silence of the Lambs in my opinion. However, he does a great job showing us the character of Francis Dolorhyde and what makes him kill people. I also liked Lector's character in the story. He has a very powerful pressence which makes you cringe and be excited at the same time. Will Gram is cool as well. I like the way that Harris makes him a thinker, and has him use his brain to catch the killer. Very cool showdown between Francis and Will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Avid Fan","review":"I didn't even realize this book existed until I started reading a few customer comments on the upcoming release of Hannibal. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie Silence Of The Lambs and felt that Red Dragon would be a worthwhile read. I was right! What a fantastic thriller. There's not much more I can add to the other positive comments already posted, except that if you plan on reading Hannibal and have not yet read Red Dragon, run out and get it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting thriller that falls short half-way through","review":"I read \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and thought it was a very good book (although I thought the movie gave the suspense and the story a better showing). When I read \\"Red Dragon\\", I was disapointed with the story and the ending. I thing Harris was on the right track but his villian was too odd and bizzare for him to be scary. Another thing is that Hannibal is hardly in the book and it almost doesn't make sense why he's in it at all. I'm glad Harris wrote this book first because \\"Silence...\\" follows a similiar plot and the character of Hannibal was explored and developed wonderfully. \\"Red Dragon\\" just doesn't seem well thought out and the ending is just plain stupid... it just seemed that Harris couldn't figure out what he wanted to happen and it shows. Skip this book and read \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"This book did nothing for me. I am not impressed. I have read many books that kept my attention and made me hunger for more, but not this one, and there wasn't much reference to Hannibal Lecter as one might think by reading the cover and foreword. I was totally unimpressed. It was very boring and I found myself skipping ahead to find the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent novel by an excellent author","review":"Thomas Harris is probably one of the most engaging writers in America today.This book proves that.This terrifying masterpiece is set 7 years before the OTHER masterpiece which would follow,I'm talking of course about SOTL.This is an awesome read,much better than the movie,although that was a good try and did manage to capture the spirit of Mr.Harris' novel in some scenes-particularly those involving Lecter.There is more to be found here than blood and guts,which is just a cheap gimmick anyway.There is text and subtext.In the words you'll discover another world-one inhabited by such nightmarish figures as Francis Dolarhyde and his insanely tyranical grandmother.This is not some place you wanna be,yet you can't help but reading on,page after page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Silence","review":"I read this book some time ago as it is the first of the Hannibal Lecter series.

I've read so many great books by the most well known horror/suspense authors, and I wanted to read someone different for a change....I was very stupid!! The beginning of Red Dragon was very entertaining and held my interest for about the first 60 pages, then the plot and over all terror declined rapidly!! I was expecting Hannibal Lector to play a larger part in this book, but he was only spoken of a few times. The long drawn out parts of \\"Grandmother\\" should have been left out, they didn't have anything to do with the main story!! If Mr. Harris would have stuck more to the crime scenes and to finding the killer instead of going through the killer's BORING life the book would have been very, very good!! The ending was so-so, it wasn't predictable, and it was pretty suspenseful! But, if you're looking for a good horror/suspense book read Stephen King or Dean Koontz!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly overrated","review":"Just as Hannibal is severely underrated by its critics, so is Red Dragon overrated. I reread this novel in preparaton for Hannibal's release and was amazed at how it is grimly locked into its formula. It follows the traditional serial killer novel right down to the predictable ending. The villian isn't very interesting and Will Graham is an unlikable and pretty boring protagonist. It does, however, manage to hold your attention all the way through. It is well-written but nothing out of the ordinary. After the transcendant experience of reading Hannibal, this book is heading to the used bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"After reading \\"Hannibal', 'Red Dragon' just couldn't compare. I suffered through 'Red Dragon' because so many of the negative comments about 'Hannibal' seemed to mention how wonderful 'Red Dragon' was in comparison.Sorry. My equation has worked out differently. 'Red Dragon' is a genre novel, locked within the given parameters; it never travels beyond. The cop is only slightly interesting. The serial killer isn't interesting at all.In 'Hannibal', genre is transcended. The reader has no idea where the journey will end, and once at its end the reader has no idea how to feel. Is the end good or bad, or simply banal? Well, I found the ending of 'Hannibal' profoundly disturbing and so much more intriguing than the ending of 'Red Dragon'.For those of you who like typical books with typical endings, this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the Hannibal series.","review":"Out of all the books in Thomas Harris's Hannibal series, this has to be the best of them all. \\"Silence\\" was great, and \\"Hannibal\\" was a great look into the mind of the greatest serial killer of all time (at least in the literary world, anyway). This book is one of my favorite books of all time. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be amazed","review":"Note the date of publication. Harris is the best at putting the detective into the mind of the murderer (tip of the hat to John D. and Truman Capote). Will Graham is a more interesting creation than Clarice.

You will not forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"In awe until the end...","review":"Instead of giving a synopsis of the story, which has been done well by amazon, I will give you some of my thoughts and reactions to the book.From the 2nd chapter to about the 50th I was very interested in the story. The plot was fast moving and I could not put the book down, wanting to know more about the killer and what he was thinking. However, like another reviewer explains, the ending is cliché. Evenmore, the ending is a bit, rushed to say the least.Nevertheless, this book is a good read and I feel that any fan of the genre should read it. But don't be upset if you are dissapointed by the ending, I told you so. But if you liked it, then fine, good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suspense novel","review":"The prequel to Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, is a very suspensful read.

I find it to be quite disappointing. The reader appears to make little effort to use character voices, instead simply reading the book almost in a neutral tone.

The book on it's own, however, is highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Liked Silence of the Lambs...","review":"You'll also enjoy \\"The Red Dragon.\\" More of the same although, chronologically, 'Dragon' came first. Clarice Starling, the proponent of 'Lambs', didn't appear in this novel, but the book possesses the same intensity and attention to detail as 'Lambs'. The all male cast is interesting, with well-developed characters, and the 'bad guy' is focused not on large women, as in Lambs, but on urban, middle-class families.

Emily Parker is ready to head back to Manhattan after spending another summer vacation at Cape Cod. Before leaving though, Emily wants to restock her mom's groceries. Leaving her three children in her mom's care, she takes off on a quick trip to the Stop & Shop. What starts out as an ordinary trip to the grocery store soon turns into anything but ordinary!This book is fast paced and filled with twists and turns that will keep you riveted. Kate Pepper has done an excellent job in this chilling tale! I couldn't believe this was her first suspense novel. LOOK OUT Anne Frasier, Mariah Stewart, and Mary Higgins Clark...Kate Pepper is going to be strong competition in the suspense genre! I can't wait till July 2005 ... SEVEN MINUTES TO NOON ...

Many questionable passages in the book were of interest to me, but alas I could not research the background or validity of those passages. Furthermore, from time to time, the authors' writings seemed ideological and one-sided; certain sentances burried throughout the text had no apparent purpose but to denigrade USSR. There are better and more objective books than this one - Hosking's Russia and the Russians, for example. Better yet, try to learn history from the original sources as much as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Slipper","review":"A real cute Cinderella story.

The characters and plot didn't mesh well with the other books Feehan's published. It seems that when she writes about the brothers her books suck. Dark Secret was also one of her worse written books.

A war between the Carpathians and the evil vampires have been brewing for sometime.Now, with so many of the Carpathian families together in one place, the vampires devise a way to wipe out the entire race!If you were expecting a sweet and romantic reunion book, well, there's some of that. But, this is as action-filled as any of Mrs. Feehan's books, with twists and turns and heart-wrenching, heart-stopping scenes that keep you turning the page well past your bedtime!If you like it hot, Feehan delivers there as well. Most of the popular couples from past books are here for the reunion and believe me, the passion's still there!This was fun, emotional, exciting and best of all...satisfying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"terriffic","review":"As with all of feehan's books this is a keeper.

I liked how she went around to several of the couples and had them experiencing their own little bits of stories. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because after all the individual stories I felt the ending was rushed and not given as much detail as the individual stories. It was almost like reading a collection of shorts on the different couples, which I loved, but again when it came to the ending it all of a sudden felt like she limited herself to only so many pages and could have fleshed it out just a bit more. There was so much build up to Gregori being Santa and then that part seemed rushed and deflated a bit. Otherwise I am a big fan of her Carpathians and anxiously await Demetri & Skylars story in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice interweaving of characters","review":"I would say it was not my favorite Christine Feehan novel.

It was the rest of the story. I actually thought this book should have been paperback and not hardcover. Especially, as a big part of the book was recipes. And, as I'm currently dieting, desserts just don't appeal to me.I felt kind of cheated. Unless you're a die-hard Christine Feehan fan, the book is really not worth the $23.95 purchase price. Get it at the library, or just wait until the paperback comes out.Try, Lover Awakened by J.R. Ward. A much better read for a fraction of the price of Christine's overpriced novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This was a huge disappointment to me.I can sum it up in one word - filler.This is nothing but many of her stories told over again with a small sub story and filler filler filler.Unless you buy her books to make sure you have the entire collection, you can leave this one off of your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sure this is a treat to long-time \\"Dark\\" series fans","review":"I had only read Dark Symphony before reading this book, so I found it difficult to keep track of all the characters. Byron and his lifemate Antonietta, featured in Dark Symphony, had a relatively minor role in this book. But reading Dark Celebration made me want to learn more about this fascinating Carpathian world that Christine Feehan created. I'm now \\"hooked\\" and plan to read many more from the Dark Series. Since reading Dark Celebration I devoured Dark Destiny and Dark Demon, and now everything in Dark Celebration is much clearer to me and I plan to re-read this book to enjoy it from this more clued-in perspective. I am also looking forward to future books to feature the two developing romances begun in Dark Celebration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!!","review":"I enjoyed this book alot. I thought it brought all the characters together so nicely from all Christine Feehan's other Dark Series books. This book is a must read!!!!

Certianly not a Dark Series book you should pass up reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, another Feehan Triumph!!","review":"The book was wonderful, I have read and own all Feehan's Dark Series books and this, IMO, is the best of all the Dark Books she has ever written. I loved the lighter feel to the book, as well as the undertones of dark as we have come to expect from a Feehan Dark novel. I love the fact that she chose Jaques and Shea to have their baby in this novel, as Shea has been so instrumental in helping the continuation of the Carpathian race.

Maybe if we saw it a a different way we would have thought different for Milo, her mom, or anyone else. Ionly gave it one star because I feel that is all that it is worth. Very well written but not enough was going on. The author took it one thing at a time at a medium pace. Not to exciting.

While the techniques have been updated, the people haven't really changed. This book shows what life was/is like for a diver. Divers often work in extremely nasty environments with little to no visibility. Add to this the psychological effects of being among different things that you must identify by feel and you get a small glimpse of what it is like.This type of diving is completely different from civilian SCUBA and this illustrates the type of mentality required.This book will show you what it is like to really be a working diver.All present and former divers owe a tremendous debt to gentlemen like Mr Raymer. They were truly pioneers whose accomplishments often went unreported and unrecognized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aftermath of Pearl Harbor Attack","review":"This is not a book for the squeemish with some pretty graphic details of the conditions of bodies of the sailors killed on the attack of Pearl Harbor, but for those interested in WWII history, it is a well-written book detailing the attempt to recover bodies and help with the salvage of the ships sunk in the December 7th attack.

The truth of the matter is that Walt Disney had MANY short, entertaing & fun movies that often had a hidden moral in them (friendship, compassion, understanding, different opinions,etc). This DVD has the terrific \\"Reluctant Dragon\\" as well as Ferdinand the Bull\\", Johnny Appleseed\\", & \\"Goliath\\" (the VERY tiny elephant)! All of which can show values that are as pertinent today as they were when these \\"shorts\\" were made. My only regret was that the original VHS had \\"Morris, the Midget Moose\\" on it & that was ommitted on this DVD.Maybe they felt that Goliath made the point re: size but I still wish Morris had been included as well. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to all parents who have children (from 2 years up)!

It was just too grainy and hard to look at. What are they thinking? Disney did a wonderful job creating the film. Why make such a poor DVD of it? I don't understand it. So, there it sits, unwatched. Very sad. I rated this 2 stars because I loved the movie. But the quality shouldn't get any stars at all. Shame on you, Disney. Your loyal customers deserve better.

Very entertaining, and makes a great Halloween gift, but the only problem is that Mr. wilson, despite his great intellect and writing skills, seems to fall for about every humdrum and humbug rumor about his subject without subjecting it to serious, objective evaluation. Myriad cases are described throughout this excellent and entertaining book, but perhaps the best is the Flying, Levitating St. Joseph, in which the author simply accepts all supposed witnesses from nearly 400 years ago with not a shred of skepticism. Other similar cases abound. So read this book with at least a minimal sense of rational doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When Time Stood Still","review":"'Sincerely' was a marvellous counterpoint to so much other pretentious music emanating from the early 70s. Its fusion of Byrds/Turtles layering was an antidote to the slick sound that became The Eagles/America; more innocent days, perhaps, but a bouyancy that can elevate the days, now or then.'Tulsa' makes me feel Twilley hasn't missed a beat, happy to celebrate his mastery of a particular form of Rock as though nothing had happened since the 60s in the shifting social sands. I doubt he is even aware of quotes from Bobby Vee, or whoever, so sublimely and subtly have their influences been ingested by the Tulsa kid. Gene Pitney was stuck 24 hours from the place.

Overwrought, overly dramatic (even if, as the author states, it is truthful), and agonizingly lengthy are some likely reasons why Ms. Maxey couldn't find a publisher. The message seemed to be about how special she was in having her visions and kundalini-like phenomena. I do think her intent was to indicate that \\"ascension\\", or merging with Christ Consciousness, is available to all, but because of the writing style and too detailed and overly emphasized descriptions of the author's ecstatic states, the message was garbled.

It's a nice change from the trance that Global Underground has put out with the likes of Sasha, Digweed, and Warren. Don't get me wrong though, I got into the Global Underground series solely because of how great the trance was! However, the move to more of a house feel is a nice change of atmosphere.

Birznieks attempts to quicken the book's pace by jetting characters from the US to Germany to Austria. Yet, the disjuncted underlying theme of the book is the portrayal of pre-World War Latvia, an independent Baltic State several hundred miles to the north of Germany, as a utopia.While the book is rife with blemishes, there are two major flaws: (1.) the characters are flat and uninteresting and (2.) the premise for the book seems artificial. There is no compelling reason to side with the protagonist, Larry Walters, other than one's disdain for the antagonist, Jill Walters. And, there is little connection between the characters and their fondness of Latvia.This book seems more like a string of malformed ideas for short stories than a cohesive novel. This is one you can leave on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a boat on a trailer... you need this","review":"Even a lightweight aluminum fishing boat can be difficult to push about by itself, especially over uneven ground.

Now it's more like sleeping on a normal foam mattress, with the challenge not to roll in the \\"hole with the lost memory\\". The return policy is a kind of catch 22. You can return the product, but if you do the math you figure out that it is better to keep it, as the shipping fee is horrendous and it is almost impossible to find a company willing to ship it. Remember, once you open the package, the mattress kind of inflates, so there is no way to ship it in the same way you received it, unless you have a big vacuum machine. And finally there is the restocking fee.

The smell is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars, but it sounds like it will go away eventually. Otherwise it's extremely comfortable, we don't wake up with nearly as many aches and pains as we used to. I just couldn't bring myself to spend $2000 on a Tempurpedic, so this is a really good value, especially since there's no tax and shipping is free and speedy.

I have owned mine for over 2 months now, and i am very satisfied with it. The mattress actually arrived a day earlier than expected, which was a plus. It was pretty heavy(over one hundred pounds) so I had to have my husband help move it into the house and up the stairs. This mattress is best paired with a flat, solid, one piece foundation, and you must have the mattress in place where you want it to actually lay because once opened, the vacuum seal immediately releases and the bed unfolds rapidly. The mattress is firm, yet soft, and very comfortable to both my husband and I; which is great because he likes firm while I like it a little bit softer. We were actually going to get the Tempurpedic, but I just didnt want to spend so much on a mattress, so this is a great alternative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be...","review":"Reviews state this is Sensus foam, but Sensus foam is 5lb, not 5.3lb as described in product title.

I was able to get over the fact that it doesnt fit my whole queen size bed, i figured ok it will just cool my core area down. I was able to get over that its like sleeping on a hard surface. But, I wasn't able to deal with waking up to the furnace of heat this thing puts off later in the night.It's amazing, it starts off ice cool and then u wake up feeling like your sleeping on top of an electric blanket. Worse then just not having it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My wife and I purchased this mattress in April of 2010. In late 2011 we noticed that each night we would roll into a 'hole'. Unlike some couples on a queen bed, we like to sleep very close together. Now, each night we roll into our 'nest' and contemplate our next mattress purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy..you get what you pay","review":"I am putting the review about the product after using it for more than 2 years. It was great and firm in the begining but after 2 years it's really gone bad. I could not even sit on the mattress anymore they just swollow me and I am not a big person (165 lbs). I also own tempurpedic for my own bedroom and have had it for more than 4 years. It's still the same as it was day 1. This I bought for the guest room but am very disappointed that it did not even last for 6-7 years. It wasn't very cheap either, so be careful before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy shipping, disgusting smell last a long time!","review":"No tracking for shipping! You can do nothing but wait a couple of weeks. If you need a bed in a short time, look for something else.Very bad smell, has to be exposed in open air more than two weeks to let the odor go! You just can not sleep on this chemical board!My brother got one from SleepWarehouse, that one cost about one hundred bucks more but but also much more comfortable!Got it at the $420 this April, just curious why they have raised the price so fast to $500? Think before you buy this staff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mattress, fantastic price","review":"I was a little hesitant to purchase this mattress without being able to see or sleep on it first. But, I got the mattress and it turned out to be what the reviews suggested it would be. It is a nice, firm, mattress that has alleviated my back pain and cost about 1/4th the price of a Tempurpedic. It was also about $100 cheaper than the equivalent mattress sold by Costco and I got free shipping (which they gave me a DHL tracking number for, so at least in some cases you will definitely be able to track and schedule delivery). It does initially have a chemical smell as some people mentioned, but I think it is now gone (2 weeks after getting the mattress). It is not as soft as the equivalent Swedish memory mattress that one might buy at Brookstone, but again, it is about 1/4th the price and I'd say over 3/4th's as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"This mattress is very very hard. I have tried many memory foam mattresses in the retail shops and expected something similar. It is not. I slept on it for 13 days until I gave up. They charge a 20% restocking fee and the shipping is outrageous so returning it is out of the question. It comes vacuumed packed from the factory. How are we supposed to return it when no one will ship it after it is opened?? It now lies (sleeping peacefully) in my daughter's abandoned bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I picked this one up thinking it might be an interesting insight as to what Vulcan children go through in their learning to suppress emotions.

Absolutely adorable, and love his dancing abilities in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interviews are Great","review":"I bought this movie hoping for a great romantic comedy featuring Hugh Laurie. Okay, so this wasn't it--plus it was a copy from a VHS tape and the quality was not high. It's worth borrowing from a library or renting but not buying. I enjoyed watching Laurie and Nunes (pleasant personalities and both very attractive) and the samba was great fun. But all in all very \\"lite.\\" The two engaging interviews with the leads tells you what a super film this might have been with a stronger script. Even romantic comedy needs to take it's story seriously enough to make you really care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre, bad dancing","review":"This is an over-the-top romantic comedy - not a great script, but not terrible. There was enough there that the movie might have been good except for one fatal weakness: the dancing was awful. As Hugh Laurie says in his cast interview, the Raymond character is supposed to come alive when he dances, transform from drab to electrically sexy. Laurie just wasn't able to pull this off. I love Hugh Laurie - I'm a huge fan of House - but he was badly miscast. He has no physical grace, and can't dance at all. Nunes' dancing was a little better, but still not great. Why did they not use real dancers in a film where dancing is so central? Neither Laurie nor Nunes had ever danced before the film. Also, there was oddly little chemistry between them. Nunes is gorgeous, though - perfect body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl From Rio","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.The only good thing about it was Vanessa Nunes. (Beautiful woman!)Otherwise, awful acting, awful composition, awful directing and so on.Just plain embarassing.With good direction, it could have had potential.Try \\"Woman On Top\\" with Penelope Cruz. Not that it was a \\"great movie\\"but it was sensual, loaded with great Bossa Nova music(no Bossa Nova in \\"Girl from Rio\\") and lots of beautiful Penelope. Kinda strangebut compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sleeper!","review":"Not sure if this movie opened in the US, but due to Hugh Laurie's role in the show, \\"House\\" the DVD is now available. Very cute story, cute girl, and a nice mix of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low in sequels","review":"I loved the first, felt ripped off by the second. It looks like the owners decided to go super-cheap in this production and just cash in on the reputation of the first movie.None of the original cast is here except Edvard (Luke Mably), and apart from Mably, the casting here is atrocious. Our perky, smart, independent Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) who really deserved to marry a King has become an almost ditzy blonde who gets by mostly on her looks and doesn't deserve even to be in med school. The acting (apart from Luke Mably) is amateurish. The story line is predictable, boring and trite.The interesting question raised by the ending of the first about how it could work for Paige to fulfill her dreams *and* be queen is just totally glossed over. The new air-head Paige doesn't even see the problem.Don't waste good money and time on even renting this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"From cute and enjoyable to really LOW budget and painful","review":"No chemistry, poorly written and clearly low budget. There are many errors in the movie which begs \\"was there an editor\\"? Not worth the time and clearly not worth the money to buy. Rent it if you must but you won't want it around. Luke Mably tries to pull it off but has such a poor script that there is nowhere to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's almost funny","review":"I saw the first Prince and Me movie and loved it, so I decided to give this one a try. Julia Stiles did not return, so they got this girl who looks a little like her, but they want you to think it is her. They also use lame special effects; there is one scene where Paige walks in a room full of computerized butterflies and you can really tell they are fake. This movie was a waste of time, even if you are the biggest Prince and Me fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even filmed in Denmark","review":"Firstly, being a dane - I would have hoped that at least 1/4 of the scenes actually were filmed in Denmark - but no!Secondly, the \\"supposed\\" Danish they are speaking is SO bad, that they shouldn't even have tried - it's just painful to watch.I have to agree with some of the other reviewers as well - the theatricals at the end are too much and really does nothing to bring this movie up to par with the first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pathetic Sequel","review":"I must agree with the rest of the reviews on this page. I had no idea they were even considering a sequel. I saw it in the local video store and thought what the heck. I noticed a new actress replacing Julia Stiles role, but thought she looked the part. Wrong...the actress that replaced the role was all wrong for the part and what's worse so were most of the other actors that replaced the rest of the cast. Luke Malby is a fine actor, but the scrpit didn't help him. It was a poor plot and it seemed as if they changed the personalities of many of the characters. And I was sad to see no sister for Edvard and now his father is fine and healthy. It would have been better if the plotline was more original and the majority of the cast came back. However, after watching this movie I understand why the cast has not come back...what was Luke thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Horrible - What were they thinking? Paige was a total flop - and what was up with that hair? This was not the same Paige from the first movie (and I don't mean the actress). This Paige was not independent and strong. And what happened to Eddie? He was not sweet and charming but rough and mean. What happened to his cute little sister? What happened to Paige's parents? They were huge in the second release. And where were her brothers? They would definately had been at the wedding. Poor Soren was just laughable. Nothing like the first one. The plot would have been okay had the original cast been in the movie and some of the sweetness returned.I loved the first movie - it was fabulous. This movie was not even worth the rental. It was so disappointed and it made me depressed. I wish that I had never watched it because it ruined the whole lovable concept of the first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"It's hard to like a second movie like this one... Only 1 actor returned out of the big characters in the 1st movie. That is what really disappointed me. Julia really made the character in the 1st movie, and would have really made a huge difference in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is that bad.","review":"I finally watched this movie on the Disney channel the other night. Well really I can only say I watched half of the movie. I just couldn't take it anymore. If you liked the first one, DO NOT WATCH THIS! The actress that took over for Julia is much more better suited for the evil Norwegian princess role than Paige Morgan. Luke Mably is the only redeeming actor in the movie and even he feels like he is just there for the paycheck. It's a real turd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but sweet","review":"I wish Julia Stiles had continued her role in this sequel, but the story is sweet, even though it's predictable as many romantic movies are. It's worth watching. If Julia Stiles had been in it, I would give it 5 stars for sure. Definitely not bad for a sequel, as most don't quite cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie","review":"This movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very good. I \\"rented\\" the movie from the library and was so glad that I didn't waste any money on this. This movie has a different director and a low budget feel about it. Luke Mably was the only good thing about this. And because of his contract, he was forced to make this sequel. Trust me, you can tell that he's none to happy to be in this. Kam Heskin who now plays Paige Morgan, can't hold a candle to Julia Stiles, honestly Kam isn't very good.I was disappointed because the original Paige, was determine and strong willed who believed in her following her dreams. I understand compromise has to be made in any relationship but this sequel turned Paige into a wimp. Don't get me wrong there are some funny moments in this but even those can't save this poorly made movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"I thought - wrongly - that this would be as good as the first, which I enjoyed.As everyone else has said the only origonal actor was Luke, but not even he could carry this cast of misfits.I really wanted to cut Paiges curly hair, it was that annoying.I cannot believe I just watched all of it thinking it was going to improve..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Vic","review":"I could never understand why a series of pictures are planned and then you change the cast. With all respect to Kam Heskin she does just not cut it as Paige Morgan. The actors presenting Edvard and Paige's parents are totally out of sinc with the characters as portraide in the Prince and Me. O, and then Jonathan Firth as Zorin, please give me a break, where did you find this guy. Please guys you have messed this up. Acting on the most part was amateuristic. Disappointing after the Prince and Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This movie really disappointed me. I thought it was a waste of time and money mostly on Luke (who didnt even really want to do this flim) Everything about this movie was severely lacking, the cast, the plot, the interaction everything.

I just this movie was half effortless and that is why I loathe this movie and never should of been done in the first place"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another movie that doesnt fit the first movie","review":"It's sad to say that the movie is a waste of talent, Although I was a big fan of Eddie and Paige in the orginal movie Eddie's role was extremely boring and not as charming.

The plot of the movie was boring.... very disappointing to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"what is with these producers!? when you produce an excellent movie such as The Prince and Me, and then do a sequel with different actors/actress' it totally SUCKS. i am so sick and tired of this crap! for example fast and the furious, the prince and me, XXX...people need to reconsider whether or not to make a sequel with different actors/actress'. as far as i am concerned, from now on i am going to check each sequel i watch and if it doesn't have the same. well guess what producers, you just lost a sell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"she's no Julia Stiles","review":"This movie has to be one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. I am a big fan of The Prince and Me, but as soon as I started watching this one, I knew it could never stand up to the original. Prince Edvard (Luke Mably) is the only returning character, some characters are missing completely, and most of who was cast...has little to no ability in portraying their character. Did they even watch/study the original movie? Terrible acting. Soren (Jonathan Firth) was decent. Paige (Kam Heskin) was ok, but definitely no Julia Stiles. Very disappointed, but glad I only rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF 'Kam' could act...","review":"I will just say that I saw Kam Heskin in another movie, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and I'm afraid she just can't act. But, I had seen \\"The Prince and Me\\" and was anxious to see the sequel. Luke Mably is always good to watch, but not with a noose around his neck. I am sorry, for him, that this was such an awful movie. It could have worked with a convincing, capable co-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge letdown","review":"After watching Julia Stiles bring an exciting chemistry with Luke Mably on phase one of this story, it is unconscionable that the producers allowed all the \\"subs\\" to be part of this second act. There was no meshing of Eddie and Paige in this version, and leaving out the original parents of both was a HUGE mistake. Part of the charm of the first version was the interaction of Eddie with Paige's family. There was much to explore in the sequel for Paige to do the same with Eddie's parents. And, Arrabella was left out completely. This was a slapstick attempt at comedy and romance and this movie failed on both counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even consider!","review":"Absolutely horrible! With the exception of the Prince, all the other characters are played by different actors from the first movie. I don't know how Luke Mably accepted to do this movie again as the Prince. The actress playing Paige Morgan would be better off in a shalow role of a high school movie. The other actors aren't convincing as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prince & Me 2 - The Roy Wedding","review":"A fine, light romance movie, have enjoyed watching it several times. The only thing that would have made this movie better would have been to have the original cast members from \\"The Prince and Me\\" movie. But still a very fine movie and beautiful scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"I didn't buy this DVD thinking I was going to be intellectually stimulated. I bought it because I liked the first movie and enjoy a good love story. I was disappointed that Julia Stiles and other cast members did not return for this film. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect because I didn't even know they had made a sequel. However, I still enjoyed the movie. It was a nice, clean, love story. There were funny parts. The tone of this movie was different from that of the first and it held some plot/character gaps from the previous film, but all in all, I'm not sorry I bought it and I'll watch it again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did They Bother To Make It???","review":"The only original cast member present is the Prince (Luke Mably) and while he is enjoyable to watch, the chemistry isn't there with this \\"Kam\\" person. Julia Stiles brought a down to earth quality to the role, which was what it was meant to be. This new girl is a terrible actress and on top of that, she has this prissy looking curly do throughout the film. Paige is supposed to be a down to earth, no nonsense girl, who is a med student and would never wear such a prissy hairstyle. The Prince's sister is completely absent in the family. The mother doesn't have the same regalness about her as the original actress and the father is looking in top shape when supposedly he stepped down due to health reasons, so Edvard could take the throne. This is just awful. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, Don't Walk Away From this One","review":"You just saw the Prince and Me, and with magic in your eyes you want more, well, you are not going to find it here in this straight to video horror.The scene where the Prince's future wife walks into a room of the worst computer animated butterflies should have been hint enough but there is more...First you wonder where the rest of the cast has gone, not even the minor, minor characters have returned for a reprise (except the poor Prince).The plot is not worthy of a movie of the week.

At first I was excieted because I am a self proclaimed royalty acholic and I enjoy finding any film or show royalty related. This however was the biggest disappointment since the last Princess Diaries book came out. It was more like a satire of the first film than a sequal, resorting to slap stick acting and totally unrealistic scenario's. Worst of all, the wedding dress and tiara, they looked like she ran to the local mall and picked them out. Last time I checked Denmark had a nice jewelry collection, they weren't going to let the future queen wear something at least real? There are some Danish fashion houses I'm sure who would have made that poor girl an original dress so she wasn't stuck with one right off the rack. Utterly disappointing at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"if there was a zero... this film wouldve got it!","review":"i cant believe this. i loved the first one but what was this!? the new girl was just dumb, her parents were a complete joke. they looked absolutely NOTHING like the first one. oh and i thougth edvard's dad was dying? all a sudden in the second movie he not only was in perfect health... but grew his hair back! and soran was the only half decent character... besides edvard... who was also a big flop. he didnt have the same personality AT ALL.....

First of all, they only had like one repeat actor and all the new replacments were NOT as good. The plot wasn't that bad, but they played it out all for comedic effect and it was not enjoyable. I fast forwarded through many parts. There were lots of slap-stick comedy moments and none of them were really worth it. This movie could have been good...the plot wasn't that bad, but the actors were not up the movie, the script was trite and they went for every bad joke and pun. So I definitely recommend skipping this movie. I should have known it was bad when I hadn't seen anything about it before seeing it in the video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, disappointing and did I mention boring?","review":"Loved the first movie, hated the second one! No charisma, no charm, no chemistry, just a lot of badly cast actors going through the motions with little to no interest in their jobs, mouthing bland, predictable dialogue guaranteed to put you to sleep.Hard to blame them, though, when the writers didn't even seem to know what they were doing. The Prince is now the King, yet his father (who died in the first movie) is right there next to his mother in several scenes, the kid sister seems to have disappeared, etc.The 1 rating is only because of the eye candy...the castle interior scenes were at least visually interesting. Other than that, this movie is a complete bust. It adds NOTHING to the first movie but a waste of your time.

If you're not using the same actors and actresses, don't make it! The movie starts out real slow and about midway picks up some.

They are in love and getting married but they act more like strangers to one another. Yes, you can see where Prince Edvard has matured and is acting more as a King but there certainly is no chemistry between the two of them. The ending of this movie was a big joke.

Although the sound quality is great, the audio doesn't match the video when you're using a digital input, like digital HDTV. So, the lips don't match the words on any digital stations. It made it impossible to watch any HDTV programming, which essentially was why I bought it.After 3 months of dealing with Samsung's poor technical support, including shipping the product back to Samsung, I learned from Samsung that they can't fix the problem, and they don't have a replacement product that would work better. The only thing more frustrating than the audio sync problem was Samsung's awful technical support. The staff was poorly educated about their own products, they never returned calls or e-mail like they promised, and seemed to have no concern for their customers. Don't waste your money--in fact, Samsung treated me so poorly, I can't recommend buying any Samsung products."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, not good either","review":"strong points - the klipsch speakers are great. the subwoofer is outstanding.weakpoints - progressive scanning is choppy. the picture coming out from the component video out shows a lot of video noise when connected to my HDTV. also does not have audio output (forget digital audio, it does not have an audio out at all).personally, i just bought this product for the speakers, i used it to connect to my harman kardon 435 (you have to buy a separate subwoofer amp since the sub amp is passive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"Digital input often produces loud static when you go from HDTV to normal TV.

We got a replacement because it was under warranty. The second unit had the front panel break off. Still worked okay for a few weeks, but then the DVD started skipping and freezing. The audio and video were not in sync. The DVD tray would no longer open. Sent it in to the mfr at my expense and was told it could not be fixed.

It will make you laugh and enhance euphoria in your brain especially when also getting a head massage from a close friend/lover. Full of positivity, making your heart beat go in time with the music, effecting your mood. But I always seem to fall asleep during around the 7th song. All other music is just music/sound.

This is one of the most refreshing releases of the year. You either hate it or love it.

That's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album.","review":"I heard this the first time in a car with someone very close to me. It has stuck with me ever since. The way Cornelius synthesizes and creates his music is beautiful. Also, I think his voice is very soothing and fitting for the way he makes his music, and just by the way he looks. He's married to Takako Minekawa, and their music is similar in style. He's a synthesizer and an electronica artist, but it doesn't stand out as blatant like some other artists. His work is very soothing and very well created. This album is beautifully and skillfully rendered, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes a bit off-beat style (not saying he's not rhythmic), and wants to hear what music can bring to oneself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like listening to someone changing channels on the radio","review":"horribly annoying.

Passport To Romance includes some fun songs..Little Bells and Big Bells...The Portuguese Washerwoman for example. Some are just beautifully haunting, like Merry Go Round or The Little Lost Dog. You may not recognize all of the songs,but they will certainly become favorites if you love instrumentals by a huge orchestra. The second half of the CD is Mucho Gusto! This was Percy's second album of Mexican Music and the accent is on favorite latin tunes like Besame Mucho, Maria Elena,and Cielto Lindo.

All through the film we want to smack Jake and feel sorry for Gitl, but in the end Gitl finds a way to become victor instead of victim. Carol Kane shines in this jewel of a role that she pours her heart and soul into.

The immigrant wife, so \\"green\\" and inexperienced, reveals a quiet strength and determination that at first is unsuspected. She will not be taken advantage of and one suspects that, although she asks for her new husband's advice at the end of the film, she will listen politely and then do exactly as she thinks is best: and will probably become a sucessful proprietor of their store. She has a lot of guts and intelligence that could only come to fruition in America. Carol Kane's character is a woman to be admired. The other characters deftly portray other immigrant types: some with ambition, those who want to be assimilated as soon as possible, those who cling to their old-world traditions.

As other reviews have said, it's the same grunge tricks that were done in the early 90's by greats like AIC and Soundgarden. So to make this simple, and to repeat myself for the 3rd time, if you liked AIC and Soundgarden, you'd probably like UPO. Not every song is memorable, but most of the songs on here are very good, like \\"Godless\\", \\"The Hurt\\", and \\"Feel Alive\\". The singer is good, and the songs are well-written; but it's all been done before. So if you like grunge, and wish AIC was still around, pick this up.

The music is simple and a little unoriginal but the singer has one of the most reconizable voices in modern-rock. How could you not know his voice when you here it.

The explanations are not bad, but much better ones do exist (e.g., Core Servlets and JSP...although this book does not cover EJB). My biggest problem with this book is that it contains many typos.

For example, to explain the BMP entity bean, the author used a ProductBEan example, in the ejbLoad() call, the product ID member field was used. But does the author understand the ID field must be set somehow? This is done in the ejbActivate() call in SUN's online tutorial, but in the book the ejbActive() is empty.

The update does speed things up a little, but it didn't matter for me because the whole thing just stopped working.

With our birds the covers don't last too long with all the bird poop being cleaned off and all the nibbling by the two parakeets.

Also, there were several points where pain job was really bad and color had an offset from the place where it should be applied. Right boot was not glued properly - it had 2 millimeters distance from the leg, so I had to pull it out by force and reapply glue.

I love Science Fiction literature and thought that I might enjoy this subdivision of SF. I have already enjoy SF novels with military settings like Ender's Game and Starship Troopers.I am sorry to report that I did not enjoy this novel. I didn't feel like I was reading SF. I felt like I was reading some old dusty military novel set in past. The characters and situations seemed to have come straight out of a soap opera. I don't understand why these characters were place in a future setting. You could have told the same exact story more believable by setting it in the past.This novel also didn't contain any of the sense of wonder and discovery that good SF novels contain. I think real SF fans are looking for stories with new ideas.I guess this Military Science Fiction stuff is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good highchair","review":"overall good purchase.

It's attractive, easy to clean, and a good value for the low cost. It folds up nice and thin for storage between uses, though I have a little trouble pushing in the buttons to collapse it. I was surprised that the undertray doesn't lift open (so you have to slide the baby in and under), but the large tray is easy to remove, clean, and reattach. The 5-pt harness is easy to use, and keeps the baby in securely. The locks on the rollers are a nice safety feature and work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice!","review":"We bought this without doing any research....we really wanted a 2nd one of the Evenflo Expressions that we love,but the store ran out, so this was the next affordable choice.

The large tray comes off and you have a little tray acroos the front. But if you need the big tray as I do...do not buy. baby needs the big tray. Also the baby is always reclined back. There is no adjustment to sit baby correctly up straight.I actually went and brought a new high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Extra Plastic Tray that cant be removed","review":"This chair has this plastic tray that cant be removed. There is the tray that snaps on that you would put food and other items on and that tray has a removable part to make clean up easy. All that is fine. The odd part is that when the main try that you expect your highchair to have is removed there is anothe small plastic tray that can't be removed that makes it so that when the chair is on the lowest level your child can not get themself in and out of the chair. My 21 month old loves to climb in and out of her chair when it is on the low setting. She thinks she is helping. With this odd part there is no way she can do that with this chair and it makes it hard to get her in and out because she has long legs. I would not keep this chair if I had known this before my husband set it up and started using it and got rid of the box. The hard tray also scrapes her legs. I hate this chair"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Complain...","review":"We are very happy with this highchair, with only a few minor complaints.I like the seat pad's pattern and fabric, plus it's easy to clean. The abilitiy to adjust the height of the seat is very nice (occasionally we'll eat dinner on the couch while watching a movie and it's nice to roll her over and lower her down to couch-level). The mini-tray is a unique feature, although not one that I've put to much use.The fabric is slightly absorbant on upper seat back (NOT the main part of the back, the green top portion), and messy fingers leave noticable residue that has to be scrubbed pretty well to get rid of. Also, I'm a little worried that as my daughter gets a little bigger (she's 10 mos and small), it will be tough to lift her out of the chair without scraping her legs on the non-removable mini-tray. It does have a pretty large \\"footprint\\" space-wise, so if you're considering this chair you'll want to be sure you have at least a three foot (front to back) space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for Hurling Objects","review":"Watch out for hurling objects with this one. The tray insert is too easily removed and tossed by the baby so there is no benefit in using it. Even the main tray is easily removed by the baby. This is the big concern.It is as simple as the baby reaching underneath and pushing up with the palm of their hands and the tray is off and flying. It is the buttons underneath used to put the tray onto the chair that are the issue. There is very little resistance to push the buttons and from the baby's position they have very good leverage to push them with no trouble at all. Very poor design. This is my first but now that I understand how babies operate I could have pointed this out as a poor design.Our baby is 1-year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 18 month old can take off the tray by himself","review":"My title should speak for itself.

My wife and I really like the simplicity of the chair. The chair has many adjustments for the back and heigh. There is plenty of room for our 26lb daughter. I noticed some other high chairs have less room in the seat. The chair feels solid with steel legs. One thing I do not like is the wheels that come with the chair. You will not be able to keep the chair balanced when folding the chair. Luckly the wheel are easily able to be pulled off once put on. You will be pleasantly surprised how well the chair stands up once the wheels are remove and how little space it takes up.

Ted Savas does a superb job of editng the book and recruited note Battle of the Atlantic historians to write the fact filled and well written chapters makes for a great read.

For example the inclusion of chthonic deities/mother earth deities being early myths of Minoan influences, the patriarchal - sky-god myths relating to Achaeans and their influence by migration on the Greek mainland.

Being an introductory work, I find it sad that it lacks mention of basic traits of economy and social life in the Egyptian world, as well as a clearer treatment of the state of sources (very common in the most recent general works). Also, the Intermediate Periods are squeezed at the end of the chapters, whose titles end up hinting at a continuity between the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms - the chapter on the Late Period seems even a bit rushed (btw, it accepts uncritically the very old and outdated theory of the \\"Sea Peoples\\" being a single factor of destruction in 1200BC).

Because not only did she have the original Young Sad & Blue on it but they had like a remix of it also. Plus she had little snippets of her other songs on the album on the single also. It would be so funny because we would be all into the songs and then right at the best part it would cut of, because of course they were snippets. But, we vowed that when her album came out we would all go buy it. It's a good relationship CD for a girl, because it seemed like she knew how you felt and used the exact words that you felt.

These aluminum bar clamps are wonderfully lightweight and can effectivly be used in a variety of applications. However, I would not consider these to be a mainstay in any clamp collection.These clamps are great for both price & performance, but because the bar is aluminum they do bend as pressure is applied which renders them useless in certain circumstances such as glueing up frame and panel doors or flat panels. For these operations nothing will ever replace super heavy duty steel 'I' beam or box beam clamps for reliability and long service life... but building up a collection of these takes a great deal of money.If your buying clamps forget pipe clamps (although we all start out with them because of price) and consider buying a few of these instead.

But they are extremely heavy when fitted with black pipe (which has a tendency to stain wood) and the clamps have an annoying habit of turning at the most inconvenient moment.

My husband tried it for a few hours and he had to go see a chiropractor the next day. The foam doesn't let you move and you are just sleeping in a hole and even the pillow sinks. The smell is another story. After reading the reviews we decided to let it air out for a whole week but even after doing that it still smells awful. Finally we want it to return it and found out that there is a 20% restocking fee and we should assume the shipping back to California.

Mattress is not as soft as I had hoped but I sleep well every night. Except for the smell. I aired it out for several days and now after having it for almost a month I'm still pulling the cover and sheets off and opening my windows during the day - looking forward to the night I don't smell the off-gasing or whatever anymore. And needless to say, good luck ever returning it without the machine they used to roll it up in the factory. But overall it's a nice bed- or will be when it stops stinking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattress sagging","review":"I bought this mattress in Feb 2011 and within six months, it began to sag and go soft. Initially, it was great. But there is a waffle/convoluted layer between the hard foundation foam and memory foam on top. It is not a solid piece. I've slept on a variety of mattresses, including tempur-pedic, comfortaire and latex. My advice: go straight to Tempur-pedic. This foam will not hold up over time and your money will be wasted. You can only return this if you can photograph a 1.5\\" impression in the mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like this... zzzzzzzzmmmmmmzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"My wife and I put this mattress into service about six months ago and want to say yipeeeeeee it still works great.

I have a lot of pain and our former mattress - a sealy beautyrest - had seen its better days so we tried foam. It has been the one of our best purchases.No more pressure points. No more pain. I can even sleep on my bad hip and the foam cradles us perfectly forming aroung our shapes.My fear is that the foam won't retain its resiliance. As of these first six months though, things are fine. No sign of fatigued foam.

Too bad because perhaps it could have saved me a couple of bucks. \\"One Louder Solex\\" and \\"Solex all Licketysplit\\" are good tunes, but it'd be a stretch to even say this is an acquired taste.

The web site contact emailed him twice with help using some sort of \\"patch\\". A \\"patch\\"? Are you kidding? Why don't you just fix the software so that it works out of the box? The first application of the patch didn't work. The second application DID work, but now I am looking at the software more critically. The tutorial is relatively good, and the avatars are nice and will appeal to children. The activities on the 2nd CD are AWFUL -- very primitive!

I almost couldn't stand to watch it even then. The acting is terrible and the situations between the women are even worse. I don't know why any of these characters would be considered attractive to anyone. If this is what is being used to represent lesbian culture, we're in worse shape than ever. Don't buy this.

Then one says to the other, \\"Well actually I don't always love you in fact sometimes I don't even like you.\\" When finally my film going companion had enough and yelled out, \\"Well, I hate you both!\\" bringing the house down in a roar of laughter. She pretty much summed up my feeling. I hate this film. If you like bad movies and like to laugh at how stupid everyone can be then definitely watch this.

I guess if you were a Lesbian and just wanted to see Lesbians communicate, well then, maybe these flicks might just be for you. I refuse to by another \\"R-rated\\" movie. The \\"R\\" just tells me that the makers of these films were more concerned about Box Office receipts than actually making a provocative movie. From now on it's NC-17 baby.

This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot went slower than a slug on valium. Watching it was so painful it made me want to bang my head against a wall till I passed out. The characters were uninteresting and definitely unrealistic. Butch women tend to look butch, not like femmes with slightly less make up. The acting was terrible, the directing was terrible, and the screenplay must have been written by a drugged mime.

It is light and funny, not burdensome as some other films about gay women have tended to be lately. In all, it truly deserves the title \\"romantic comedy\\". And the fact that there are virtually no male characters does not detract from the film at all. This movie seeks to depict gay women in a realistic vain. While there is a lot of relationship drama- there is almost no cosmic philosophy found in many of those lesbian melodrama films. I found this very refreshing. In short, if you want to have a life changing, philosophical experience, rent an art film.

Taking a look at this other books, its no secret that Ibn Warraq is not in search of anything other than having people come to his side.Since ibn warraq has an \\"inconsistent handling of Arabic materials,\\" how can we accept this book as sound, seeing how the Quran is in Arabic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Critique of 'What the Koran Really Says'","review":"Tedious, academic, rarely really says what the Koran really says, just history of translation difficulties allowing much room for 'alternate' interpretation cop-out.

Ibn Warraq seems to have picked essays for inclusion based simply on how hostile they are to Islam. Most of the materials of the book are outdated, the rest are definitely not 'mainstream.' The only reason I can think of to even look at this book is if you are studying islamiphobia or hate literature, if you are looking to learn about Islam from a 'western' author, I would recommend Esposito or Armstrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"weakly constructed arguments","review":"I am not impressed... I was looking for something that was comprehensive in its argument and found this to be rather malicious and agenda-driven. If his arguments are indeed true in regards to Islam, intolerance, and jihad, then historically we must have lived in another world because applying these principles, as stated by the author, by the Muslims when they ruled the civilized world for 100s of years would have resulted in a much different world, not one where the European enlightenment got its spark and source of knowledge from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A retail genius, a true entrepreneur","review":"This book is a fascinating window on the life and character of Earle Charlton, the quintessential entrepreneur. Winston Churchil, said that \\"we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.\\" Earle Charlton's life and legacy is a remarkably American story. From the meager lifestyle of a blacksmith's son to the phenomenal financial success, wealth happiness, cultivation of family and finally to the full expression of his charitable impulses; he embodies every business person's dreams. This book helps to convey the humanity and sensitivity of a man driven to succeed personally while not losing sight of the trials and sufferings of others less fortunate. This is a great account of an entrepreneurial dream capstoned with a legacy of humane philanthropy. Everyone should read the story of the life of Earle P. Charlton for inspiration, focus, civic mindedness and family values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga and the Kung Fu Girl","review":"The first review I gave on this DVD was removed because I told the absolute truth concerning this dreadful kung fu flick. This DVD should be burned totally. Do not waste your time in purchasing this. You'll only end up angry and out of money. It's not worth the disc it was copied to. It should have remained in the archives. This flick is utter garbage. The acting was horrible, the overdubs sucked, and the plot was utterly stupid! It personally deserves less than one star. If you get this one, don't say you were not warned. I don't want to see anyone else become a victim!I totally agree with the previous viewer. I should have read the review before purchasing this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"#3 in the Sister Fidelma series","review":"All I can say is ... in order to get the most out of this remarkable series, you need to read them in order.

This series has grown to become one where I want to read more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Mystery!","review":"These Sister Fidelma mysteries are wonderfully crafted. It may be a bit difficult to read and pronounce some of the ancient Irish names and places, but don't let that hang you up. \\"Suffer Little Children\\" author Peter Tremayne weaves an intricate plot and those who enjoy a good \\"whodunit\\" will take pleasure in the twists and turns of his story of this brilliant nun. The characters are well rounded and he uses vivid imagery to describe the various locations in ancient Ireland. His \\"courtroom\\" scene at the end the book brings all of the suspects together beautifully, before Sister Fidelma reveals the motives and the murderer. Those who have read Ellis Peters series on Brother Cafael will be thoroughly transported to another historical era of mystery enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have For The Cash Fan","review":"If your a Johnny Cash fan 20 bucks for this 7 inch figure is a no brainer. It easily recognizable as the man in black. It has a very good paint job and is designed with everything down to the squint of Johnny Cash's eyes in mind. It comes with a railroad base and a removable plastic guitar. I have mine sitting up high and it has been knocked to the floor a couple times and is still in perfect condition therefore it is a durable figure.The only downside that could be found is that is not very posable. The only joints it has are at the shoulders which only allow for front to back movement but that is a very tiny issue to me.It goes without saying this is not a toy you would want to buy with the intention of playing with. It is a nice display figure any Johnny Cash fan will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash Action Figure","review":"I purchased two of the Johnny Cash Action Figures,One for my sister and one for me.We both collect Johnny Cash.This figure is of great quality and looks just like Johnny ,created from a classic picture taken of him in his younger days.The service was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GRANDMA'S DREAM GIFT","review":"My young grandsons LOVE the songs and love singing along.

Megadeth has been far more consistant than Metallica, even including Megadeth's experimental CD's......at least they are still metal. Good old school return for Megadeth, even if some of the riffs are a bit familiar. Dave really deserves more credit than he gets for influencing young bands. Even bands like Machinehead and Skinlab owe alot to the mighty Megadeth's early influences.

Some great \\"Dave-isms\\" too in the lyrics. Solid rocking CD, my only songs I'm not really into are Burnt Ice and the rereleased A Toute Le Monde.

I turned it on, then turned it off. Its STUPID! I would be embarrassed if someone heard this playing from my car. Its so baaaaaaaaaad!

This latest offering was painful, embarrassing and tiresome.All the tracks were hashed together and showed none of the old Megadeth creativity. Probably since Mustaine has alienated himself from so many good idea sources leaving him struggling to resurrect the old Deth. Sorry Dave, Megadeth was never just Dave Mustaine.It's always amusing to see a band crash and burn when they come out and claim to have found (g)od. They try to pump out the same old anti-government lyrics but they no longer have meaning. Weightless ramblings of a bitter man.Megadeth were once in the big four, now they're not even worth a review in Kerrang.Don't waste your money on this shiny coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen","review":"Up until this album I was a Huge Megadeth fan. I've seen them live twice. But this album just shoves too much of Dave's beliefs in your face, which it is great to speak your mind, but he talks down to everyone.He knows everything, plus his incomprehsible lyrics of his screwed up political views that are beyond democratic or republican, just insane. But I got the point. I dont like it. The solos are boring. No memorable guitar riffs. 10 of the songs sound like he didnt even try. The remake of toute a le monde sounds so stupid, he completely messed it up.

Rust in Peace, Peace Sells..., and Countdown to Extinction recieved heavy rotation throughout my CD player for a long, long time. So, it pains me to say that Megadeth have finally sold out. Yes, I should have seen it coming when they wrote Gears of War for that terrible, over-rated cheese fest of a game, but I calmly ignored it. Then, I heard A Tout Le Monde with Christina Scabbia in it. I again ignored the signals. But then, I bought it, and to my dismay, I was horrified.Kind of funny considering how Dave thrived on the fact that Megadeth never sold out like $elloutica did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous!

I can't believe that 32 of the 33 reviews posted to date have been positive ! Well time to add a rare negative review...WIthout going into details, this is the worst album Megadeth have ever put out. It seems like it is just being \\"heavy' for heavy's sake, with the songwriting and melody tossed out the window. Also, the ranting/political stuff is annyoing. It's almost like Dave isn't even singing, he's ranting over the tired riffs.whatever happened to the epic songs, amazingly heavy (yet melodic) riffs, and expert songwriting? Seems like it's all gone.I would reccomend any Megadeth except this one if you are looking to find something worthwhile from them.Or, better yet, discover a band still in the \\"hungry\\" stage of their career trajectory (Becoming the Archetype comes to mind)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST AROUND!","review":"NOBODY DOES IT LIKE MEGADETH!!!

The people that are giving this cd bad reveiws are just the morons who can't bear to see a cd exposing the UN for what it is. And don't think I just like it because of my political veiws, there are hard core solos and powerful riffs in there that are rarely seen in this day and age with the stupid punk rock bands that are out there and don't know anything besides power chords.

Now that I own this and Black Rain I have to say I enjoy this CD more every song is good not just three or four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable...","review":"...well maybe not that bad, but close enough. The album has a somewhat promising start in \\"Sleepwalker\\", which contains some excellent riffs but is unfortunately marred by awkward, clumsy vocals. Not much else of note happens on the remainder of the album, except for possibly the title track which is OK, but the ham-fisted political commentary detracts significantly from the song.\\"Gears of War\\" deserves mention as a decent song. It's more of a melodic heavy metal rocker (a la Judas Priest or Iron Maiden) than a traditional Megadeth thrash piece - just an observation, not a complaint.And the rest? Not worth mentioning.Other than the one-off song here and there, Megadeth hasn't put together a good album since 1990's Rust in Peace..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 'Deth-release since Rust In Peace!","review":"Listen to \\"Sleepwalker\\", \\"Play For Blood\\", \\"Never Walk Alone..A Call To Arms\\" and \\"Gears of War\\" and you know what I'm talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Since RiP","review":"United Abominations, Megadeth's 11th album, is by far the best since the Rust in Piece days. Incorporating the pure metal of Rust in Piece with the technique of 15 years more experience, United Abominations is Megadeth at its purest. Opening with \\"Sleepwalker\\", a thrash masterpiece that screams \\"return to form\\", and ending with the fast and heavy \\"Burnt Ice\\", filled with amazing solos reminiscent of Hangar 18, this album will be remembered as one of Megadeth's greatest. The only criticism that most find, and that I agree with, is that the duet of A Tout Le Monde is misplaced on the album, and detracts from the flow of tracks. Aside from that United Abominations is an extremely solid album, marking a return to form for Megadeth, and should be picked up by any metal fan looking for a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 3 for sure!","review":"Thank God for Megadeth! I thought that thrash metal was dying. This album is a breath of fresh air in a slower, tamer rock world. I particularly loved \\"Amerikhastan\\", where Dave throws in a little bit about his views on the war with some serious shred behind it. \\"Sleepwalker\\" has some of the best guitar that's come out in a while. \\"Gears of War\\" was SICK! It's about time that I bought an album that I can listen to all the way through. I won't commit sacrilidge and say that this is the BEST album, but I put it up there with \\"Countdown\\" and \\"Rust\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave is still true to himself and his fans.","review":"2nd disc since Dave Ellefson left the band and Mr. Mustaine seems to want to back in time musically and blend it with it with bits of the present. And I like it!! I also like Dave E's F5 project although it sounds a lot like Sevendust but that's OK cause I like them too. It cracks me up to read the hater reviews. If you're a true Megadeth fan you roll with the changes in their music. At least their not turning their hat sideways and screaming Yo , Yo , Yo , Look At Me! Instead they're still giving you rocking tunes with scorching solos. Do you get that from Lympsync Bizketstreet Boys or Puddle Of Poop?

Although there are a couple good songs on this CD, Dave forces his messed up political views to a point where it is forced. So much, that you feel silly listening along. Although he has always had political views in his music (which makes Dave great), he just rambles in this one.Once again there are a couple good songs, but this is definitely a forgettable CD.

Lame.","review":"Couldn't finish it. Boring and awkwardly written. The omnipresent sexual themes are very poorly integrated into the rest of the story. The characters are sexual stereotypes.

In one of his songs he said i'm a gigolo.when i went to the dictionary, it said a gigolo is \\"someone who has a continuing sexual relationship with and receives financial support from a woman\\". Why say that in a gosple album? Plus, he said stay saved.No one can become unsaved after being saved because the person will have everlasting life.Plus he said the Holy Spirit rolls wit anyone hurting.The Holy Spirit only rolls with christians and christians hurting.But overall....the beats and flows are iight.So it can maybe be good....BUT MAKE SURE YOU TAKE THESE WORDS INTO CONSIDERATION !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is a great album that constantly reminds christians that you can be big and boastful in God yet in a humble and meek way.

Very good songs, Canton Jones touches upon things that very Gospel artists touch upon. But I worry about the motivation for doing his music and how much of \\"the world\\" inspires his writing. His first words of the album, I believe are \\"We about to throw 30 grand on the crowd\\" and clearly the first song \\"Doin' it Big\\" is all about him, I wonder if his purpose is to make Christ seem appealing to the world or make the world seem appealing to Christ. To each his own though. May God bless him and all of us as we strive for Heaven"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop For The Gospel","review":"This is a wonderful C.D. Canton Jones knows and understands hip-hop and he uses it beautifully for the gospel of Christ.

At one time or another we all want to quit the battle and get on a hog and head out. The Modern Outlaws takes us on such a trip--AND SUCH A TRIP IT IS! This raucus and wonderfully irreverent tale draws you in from the first page, puts a hog between your legs, and then you're on the road with a wild bunch of middle-class, middle-aged guys who (yes, you guessed it) shed their responsibilities (just like you always wanted to do) for a week or so every year and head out, searching for thrills. Wow! I never knew those guys had so much fun! Or that anyone's even permitted to have so much fun. I was gonna write more about this fantastic book, but I can't--I gotta go--the Harley store's opening in a few minutes and I wanna be first in line. Live a little! Buy this book!

It has generated minor but voluble complaint based on subjective violence to a tattoo artist and on its profile of a bornagain Christian. These complaints are also subjective. As an open road riding experience, The Modern Outlaws offers insight to a modern phenomenon and ventillation for those who hate the destruction of wilderness that now prevails, but feel helpless to respond. Moreover, it's a page turner.

The author continually breaks from topic to self analysis and rhetoric that demonstrates his attempt to master the literary vocabulary while forcing the reader to wonder \\"where are we going with this?\\"The book wasn't excrutiatingly painfull until the last 25 pages, but I just couldn't get through the epilog, for fear my eyes would bleed.With a little less psycobable, this could have been a terrific read!!Nearly, but not quite a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Komachi 4-Piece Knife Set","review":"When I first got these knives I thought they were great, for about 2 weeks. After that they became so dull that I rarely use them any longer. It was a very disappointing purchase. I expected them to be much better. I've seen them advertized as staying sharp forever and never having to be sharpened. In fact you are not supposed to sharpen them because of the non-stick surface on the knives. These \\"sharp forever\\" claims are simply not true if you use them on a daily basis, like you would use any other good kitchen knife. We cook in our house every day and having good kitchen knives is essential. What a let down!! They are certainly not worth the money we paid for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is a great guide for the beginning ICU nurse. As a new grad, I found it very helpful.

Some sections do provide good strait forward information especially for new graduates starting in an ICU such as myself. Other sections are terrible such as the med chapter where almost every other medication the author states something along the lines of \\"I don't know much about this one\\"...how is that helpful at all? Also this book was last updated in 2007. A lot can change in 5 years especially in the medical field so I never know if I'm reading correct information or not.

I wish I were dead every time I read this.","review":"To be fair, there is some good info here for almost anyone doing any type of patient care; there are some things everyone should know.The crux is that the pathetically stupid jokes constantly interrupt what little continuity there is and make the thing almost unreadable. Combined with the stupid and annoying lacks of info disguised as questions it gets old quickly. If I wanted to go look up info I'd buy a book. Oh, wait, I bought this one. Why isn't it edited to include stuff instead of asking me to fill in the blanks? The next version needs to replace all the in-passage questions with solid information and lose the lame old-woman humor. It's embarrassing.In hindsight, if you can get this for twenty bucks or less buy it, a penny more and you'd have to be an idiot.

How many times in a blues fan's life will we see B.B.King, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy and Robert Cray performing live on the same stage?

Stevie Ray must have been having fun, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Look at SRV's Music","review":"\\"A Tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan\\" is probably not what you would expect; it's less of a documentary and more of a farewell concert. The artists chosen to play each of SRV's songs tend to lose the feeling of his music in translation over the course of the show, but on the same token it's interesting to see how each artist would have played the song if it was them who wrote it.

The book discussed how client kings works, how cities were managed and all that.

Not so with this one, it's very weak in this regard. This might be fine for landscape photography, but in many applications a very strong elimination of reflections is desired.

With good polarizers, this works great. When the filters are at 90 degrees to each other, no light is transmitted at all. But with these Tiffens, very little light was blocked when crossing them at 90 degrees. Bottom line: the polarization ratio of these filters is very weak, meaning that these polarize light only a little bit. See similar comments about the 77 mm Tiffens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for a variable neutral density filter","review":"I bought this to construct a variable neutral density filter in combination with a circular polarizer. It turns out that the polarization ratio of this filter is only about 20:1, which is significantly less than the cheap CPL I was going to pair it with. While this is OK for uses against clouds and reflections, it means the for a neutral density filter you can only get down about 4 stops.In terms of build quality it is fine. It would be nice if the ring were a bit narrower, as it vignettes slightly at 18mm on an APS-C camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better","review":"I purchased the 46mm linear polarizer for my Panasonic FZ28.

These 'death metal' covers have little (sometimes none whatsoever) resemblance to their rockin' originals. The 'musicianship' on this album (to use the term loosely) does NOT have to be heard to be believed.

It is a book for people who think \\"Friends\\" is a reality show about life in New York. Who has ever heard of a waitress getting a terrific glamour job at a major conglomerate (for which she has no qualifications) because a customer likes her? The subplot about a former abusive boyfriend seems to be a throw-in to \\"humanize\\" the Cinderella protagonist. The ending is a cash-in on post 9/11 sentiment.

I have rarely hated anything I've chosen to read, but I hated The Autobiography of Vivian from the font (wasn't it annoying?) to the character herself. Who cares about Vivian, and, more importantly, why in the WORLD do they keep printing this series? Are you honestly telling me that people so adored the first book that they want to put themselves through the torture of reading another two?The best thing about this book is that it gives all writer hopefuls the hope that they will be published, because their book has GOT to be better than the drek that is The Autobiography of Vivian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed....","review":"I LOVED The Autobiograpy of Vivian and think that I gave it ***** stars.

First of all, the author DESPERATELY needs a spell checker. I'm a sucker for grammar and even in the beginning of the book there are so many errors.

First off, I'm glad I bought it used, but I really wished I had checked it out of the library. I know that this book wasn't meant to be deep or anything like that. I like fluffy reads as much as the next chick, but even fluff should be entertaining and whisk you out of your own reality. When I read this, I felt that I was being given more of a synopsis of a book and not that real story itself. The author just rushes the reader along from scene to disjointed scene like Officer Barbrady in South Park (\\"Move along, nothing to see here\\"). While an informal narrative is nice, this book was just too chatty for me, and the inclusion of the abusive boyfriend just felt more like an afterthought than a real part of Vivian's character. The author really should have taken the time to write a second draft, because Vivian's character and the story really had the potential to be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, not-even-fun fluff","review":"It seems like the author felt an annoying need to insert as many pop culture references as humanly possible in order to save this sad, silly drivel.

Filled with grammatical errors and \\"cute\\" spelling, this \\"book\\" is merely a weblog taken way too far. The so-called casual style is grating to say the least, and for those who do not subscribe to such format, it is hard to read.Vivianlives.com is a marketing tool that worked very well - and I see this book as an extention of that branding platform.

This one had me laughing throughout, and for that reason alone it is well worth the read. And no, I don't think you'd have to be a guy to enjoy this one.Keillor's writing, besides being very funny, is very literate and clever. Many of the stories come across in much the same way his radio skits and monologues do. But - I wouldn't say that he's quite mastered the written short story genre just yet. Quite a few of the stories have endings that read like Keillor just decided that the story had gone on long enough, so let's see if we can wrap it up in the next 20 words or so. They kind of leave you hanging.However, stylistic demerits aside, this is one very funny book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"15 year old's dream...","review":"On the one hand, these stories are clever and witty. On the other hand, they do a better job of emasculation than the ever present antagonists, women. It feels like a 15 year old's wet dreams come to life though written by an old bitter,albeit hilarious, man. Having listened to Keillor for years, I'm not entirely surprised at his hopes that men would be wild, bold and essentially irresponsible escapists (and therefore manly somehow), and that women should be silent, compliant sex toys. I am however disappointed that such a clever, learned fellow would try to pass off as misogyny as 'tongue in cheek'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from a really big fan of Garrison Keillor!","review":"Bought the audio of \\"Guy Stories\\" thinking it would be like most of the audio tapes I have from this very talented story teller.I guess I expected more humor in this tape/book but instead all we found were some rather weird stories that really did not seem to be the kind of stuff we are used to hearing from this man.

The stories were boring and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Man is Somewhat Confused","review":"Garrison Keillor tells stories that have an impact. These stories have more depth than usual, more bite and no clean endings or morals. Men are different than women. Men were in some ways better off in the old days of an unconscious two class society. Some of the \\"manly\\" stereotypes do have appeal to most men from time to time. We still don't understand women very well. We're taking some time to find a new equilibrium of acceptable behaviors (to ourselves and to others). This is not a collection of side-splitting humor. Rather, it's like a fine wine or whiskey that has a long tail which twists and fades. Ultimately satisfying, but partially hidden, suggestive and mysterious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be funny?","review":"My husband and I did not enjoy this book. WE bought it on audio so we could enjoy it on a trip we were taking. We were grossed out by the \\"nubile\\" descriptions. The stories ambled with no points.

This book would make a great episode. The whole story is about how Voyager gets drafted in to an alien fleet to fight their war. As far as chacters go there is little development in that area. Most of the chacters are a little boring and could have been developed more. The way they get voyager to fight this war is by kidnapping Chakotay and some other crew members. I really dought that if this was the tv show that the captain would fight an alien war even for Chakotay. This is just totally against the captains ethics. Overall it was good with the ever present small errors about voyager and the crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby!","review":"I thought this book was okay.

Smiling through their injuries & gritting their teeth, they manage to pull everything off well & help the right side win.

I enjoyed the book very much & look forward to the next by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, thanks.","review":"I'm only reading this book because I'm a completist. Frankly, none of the characters are depicted in character (although it seems that the show can't really seem to decide what's \\"in character\\" and \\"out of character\\" either), and the only likeable characters get maybe two or three lines of dialogue.

Not exactly what I was hoping to teach him. Perhaps he is just at that age where he really doesn't know what he is feeling and just likes to say things for effect - I was just hoping for a better message in the book, not that his plans for running away after being \\"so mad\\" were foiled because he wanted to go play with his friends.

Wow, yeah now that's some good advice to read to a young mind.My almost 5 year old (oldest child) doesn't even know what running away is. Why would I want to introduce that concept to him at the age of 4-5 (as recomended by the manufacturer's age)? He can get all that nonsense when he's in school, no need to rush it at home during reading time!

Then when the character's friends came to play he figured he could just run away another day.

RUN AWAY FROM HOME! Yes, that's exactly the idea I want to put in my child's head. While as an adult I can separate the fiction and maybe see a little humor, my child certainly can NOT.

She managed to get her lip stuck in the gap of the ring that you use to hang Tucker to carseats or what have you. Needless to say, she was not a happy camper. I had not even considered her getting a body part pinched in between there and I do not always have an item to hang tucker from.

It became her constant companion- on car trips (perfect lap toy), at church, in the store, you name it. She loved the bright colors and different textures. When she began to teethe she chewed on the rings on his tail, and when she became interested in mirrors she looked at the one on his belly. He was renamed \\"Myrtle T. Crinklefoot Turtle\\" and is still one of her treasures at 13 months, although she doesn't play with him anymore, just picks him up and makes loving noises to him before moving on to the next toy. When she loses interest completely we'll be washing him well (just throw in the machine!

Nevertheless, I highly recommend buying the mp3 of this track for playing through speakers for yoga. It would sit very comfortably on a collection called \\"Yoga All-Time Greatest Hits\\"!

The style of Robert Lipsytes Writing makes you feel like you are actually there in the story and interacting with the characters. You can visualize the Robbery at the Epsteins' store. You can smell the musty air in Donatelli's gym. I would reccomend this book to teenagers. I don't think that adults would enjoy it as much, because I don't think that it would be as easy for them to relate to what the main character, Alfred Brooks, is feeling. Under the age of 11 or 12 probally wouldn't understand the meaning of the book, or maybe they would but wouldn't be able to get the full experience of the reading because they can't feel what Robert Lipsyte was expressing.

Furthermore, I would probably rate this book a two on a scale of one to five. The Contender did not interest me, but I'm not particularly fond of boxing either.

I found myself waiting for what was to happen next. Lipsyte's description of Harlem was fantastic. His book told of the rich and the poor, the good and the bad and the struggles in Harlem.

I had to read it for school and I wasn't very excited about it. The subject matter (boxing) does not appeal to me. Besides that fact Robert Lipsyte did a very good job on this book. The Contender is the story of a young man named Alfred Brooks who is going through a very hard time in his life. He had dropped out of high school and, Alfred and his best friend are growing apart. Alfred also has to deal with living in a bad place and all the bad people around him. When there is no where else to turn Alfred decides to give boxing a try.

Great and Magnificent Review","review":"My feelings on this book can be summed up into one word; disappointing. Throughout the story the excitement builds and builds for something great to happen, but towards the end the book the story takes a enormously horrendus fall. I feel that the ending is an inslt to the story. I was very into the story till about the 3/4's mark, then I had to force myself to read the rest. I'm dissapointed that I had. So I suggest you go buy the book read 3/4's of it, rate it, read the rest, and rate it again. More than likely, I'll bet you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Contendor","review":"This book was all about history. It is also about a very fun sport, boxing. The author of this book was not a very creative writer, he made this book pretty dull. Alfred was a very good boxer though. he won two matches, tied one and lost one.

It is very exciting and the author describes everything in great detail. I rated this book 5 stars because it got my attention right off the bat. It also was interesting so I never got tired of reading it. The Contender has a good plot and is always on topic. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't hate boxing. The character Alfred was very strong and never gave up. He had a good attitude toward everything and stood up for himself. I feel sorry that his best friend James started taking drugs. Alfred was very brave to help his friend James when he cut himself badly from breaking into Epstiens. Major was also a could character for the part he played in. He was always mean to Alfred up until Alfred started training and boxing. All the characters matched the role in the story and I think that Robert Lipsyte is a very good author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship and to never give up","review":"I felt that the story was great. I think it could have been even better if they ended the story differently. They might have put in what happened to Alfred: did he ever stay with boxing? They should have told us what happened to James: did he come over his drug problem? I think that anybody that likes a story with real problems with every day life will like this novel.The book takes place in Harlem, New York. The book's main character Alfred Brooks is faced with many challenges and how he came over them. His friend,James, has a drug problem but they never say what happens to him at the end. The book is about Alfred trying to overcome obstacles in his life and the changes boxing has on his life. For me the peek of the story was when Alfred has to box Elston Hubbard and before the match begins he is told that it will be his last fight.Yes, I believe that the book is believable. The book was pretty fast paced. The book is for about 3 year olds and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Contender","review":"I would not recomend this book to any young readers. It is full of racist comments and slang. Also it portrays Harlem as a extreamly bad city where murdering and robbing stores is a daily affair. Also African Americans are not all druggies, murderers and bums and or thugs. Harlem is not a top notch place to grow up but, the author didn't need to make it sound like an evil 666 place were daily Black Nationalists are held. To make the story better is to have Alfred have two brothers one of which would live and another to die... and his best friend is a talkin bluebarry pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Contender","review":"The Contender was an astonishing novel that takes you to the harsh streets of Harlem.

At first I thought it was going to be really boring, but after I read more, I really got into it! I liked how Alfred never guit at being a contender. I also thought it was really cool to have Henry helping him the whole time and how Mr. Donitelli helped too. I think most people can relate to everything that Alfred does, like the struggles he has to overcome and how it teaches us about using drugs and trying to be the best you can be at anything you do!

It has a moral and gives good examples of street life and ghetto towns. It helped me understand how tough life really is, and inspired me to stay in school. If you are dropped out of school and feel lonely or trapped, you should read this book. If you do read this book, you will have a new perspective of some things. It also helps you understand life as a boxer better and understand that you have to be very devoted and strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia's Contender Review","review":"This book was absolutely phenomenal. I really enjoyed how it dealt with many different topics. It had a little bit for anybody. The details of Robert Lipsyte really make you feel like a part of the book. The characters were very well planned and thought out. I liked how Robert put in some funny characters to make the story not seem so dramatic. I think the ending was excellent, although I personally wish that it would have gone on longer. I really got into this book after a couple of chapters and when it ended, I was very upset. I hoped that it woudn't have kept you guessing as to what happened to the characters. I give this book for out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better School-read book","review":"I was assigned this book as a class read book. Most of the books I've read in my school years are boring or the teachers (not you Miss Ham) make them boring through over-analyzing the content. This book wasn't like that. It went very quickly and we didn't spend very much time analyzing it. I really enjoyed it. The only large thing I didn't like was how short it was. I'd probably put it at 4 1/2, but they only gave me whole numbers (drat!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Contender","review":"The Contender is and okay book. Alfred has to make lots of decisions. He doesn't always make the best decision. He also has to deal with troublesome people like Major and his friends. Mr. Lipsyte creates a vivid description the entire book. I felt like I was with Albert the entire time. The beginning is boring at first, and the ending leaves you kind of hanging. The overall story is pretty good, however. I got so hooked on it, I couldn't stop reading until the end. This book is why I gave it a four."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"In the beginning of The Contender, I was not amazed. I wanted to read a book about slavery and hard times so that I could learn about my ancestors. Boxing is not something I really like and don't usually hear about. I really like basketball, baseball, kickball and other sports that people my age play. But as we got more and more into the book, I noticed that the book was about making the right choices in your life and hanging out with the right crowd. THe only part that was not good to me was when Alfred's friend gets on drugs. And when he takes money from ALfred to get a fix. If Alfred was ever jumped again by Major, Alfred would probably kill Major!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one runs with the best","review":"This book is a great read for anyone mature enough to handle it. Alfred's struggle to understand the world around him delights the reader. With his best friend in jail, and running from the town bully, Alfred searches for his place in the dark, segregated times in Harlem in the 1960's. Somehow Alfred winds up in a new territory in the ring. Boxing leads Alfred away from the troubles of Harlem and into the world of pain and suffering under new circumstances. The book shows how Alfred strives to be a contender, something everyone should take away from this book. This book is truly a masterpiece that should be enjoyed by adolescent and adult alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contender Review","review":"Alred is a grungy boy with no life.

You may think diffrent because your a diffrent person but if your like me then you wont!They kept seeming to mention the black people are all ghetto and thats not true. Yea, some black people may be ghetto but they have no right to say that all black people are.

But I would not request this book to anyone because there are only a few good parts, and the ending really stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"being a contender","review":"For one reason I liked this book was because the boy was apart of some sort of gang and then decides to try out boxing. The people at the gym say if he wants to be a good boxer then he has to eat little but no too little also he has to run every day in the morning and also go to bed at a reasonable time. And then the man said that if you want to be a champion then you first have to be a contender. A contender is a person that does not think he will win that should be a good life lesson for him. And then after that he starts to fight and then you will have to see for your self about what happens. So I think if you like books about fighting then this is a book for you. I personally didn't like this book because I don't like boxing at all and or fighting so this was not a good book for me. But it did have some good life lessons in this book. So if you like books about life lessons"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Contender","review":"This book was boring. It hardly had any boxing until the end of the book. The book was not about boxing.

It looked very boring and complicated. However, once I got started reading, I found it a pleasure to read. The book was very well written and easy to understand. I was able to read it comfortably without finding myself asking questions. Even though I don't like boxing, I think the story was great. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Contender","review":"The book I read was \\"The Contender\\" by Roger Lipsyte. It was ok. It was a good book in the way that it showed the hardships of some African-Americans living in the ghetto. But, it was kind of hard to follow who all of the characters are. My favorite part of the book was when Alfred had his very first fight. It would have had to have been very hard going through all of that training and practicing, just to be a boxer. They had to go through a very hard schedule to get in shape and to become athletic. If you want to read a book about boxing, I would suggest this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a book about a boy doing things to be a Contender.","review":"The Contender is a good book by Robert Lipsyte .Did you ever want to achieve a goal?

The first half of the book was really boring and it only stated to get good at the end. My favorite charactor was Jelly Belly, he was interesting and and a sense of humor.

If you dont like sports than you probably won't like this book. I think that the author had no idea what the Projects are like. Overall the book was okay. If you like a book about somebody striving To make themselves better than there is a chance that you might like this book. To me you're wasting your time if your reading this book. Normally I like most of the books that I read but THE CONTENDER IS TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brave Contender","review":"I like The Contender because it shows how Alfred found his own way.

After Alfred Brooks, a high school drop-out, is jumped in his Harlem neighborhood, he goes to a gym and the trainer makes him commit to \\"never quit.\\" He then becomes a \\"contender.\\" Eventually, he becomes a real boxer and starts to fight. He wins a couple of matches and the bullies stop picking on him. Everything looks great until it happens ...Alfred is a good kid who didn't see a need for school, so he got a job at a local grocery store. His \\"friend\\" was one of the bullies picking on him. Even when everything was terrible, Alfred kept on fighting and didn't quit.We would recommend this book to anyone who likes excitement and suspense. This wonderful story is full of colorful language and sensory images. At first, it is a bit difficult to get into, but READ ON ... trust us, it is definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CONTENDER/ Boxing Out Of Trouble","review":"The book THE CONTENDER Robert Lipsyte is a book about a hard working teenager that goes through many problems in life.

I felt that it diserved four out of five stars. In the beginning, the book was slow for me and it was hard to get into. Luckily for me, it started getting better by chapter two. By chapter three, I thought it was great! That was when I really started to like it. I began reading all day. It was extremely fun. I was sad when it was all over. I didn't like the end that much because I wished that it wouldn't ever end. I wished that it would go on forever. In the end, I was glad that I read it. I hope, even though it is unlikely, that there would be a secuel. If there is I would definatly read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Contender","review":"The Contender was slow-paced at the beginning but became more interesting later on. If you don't understand the boxing terms, it can be conusing. I didn't like the part when he was still drunk. It was confusing and dull, as he were half asleep. I liked the ending, though. Basically, the Contender is about believing yourself, reaching goals, and helping firends in times of need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"book\\" of champions","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. It's about a african-american teen who lives in the bronx during the 1960's. He takes up boxing to prove himself and trains hard and works daily. He strugles to prove himself inside and outside the ring. Will Alfred be the next Contender or will he be the next chump."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Contender","review":"The Contender is a pretty good book. It talks about a person in his late teens who takes up boxing. This book takes place in Harlem, New York in the 1960s and it is very realistic in the atmosphere of Harlem. The 17 year old, Alfred lives with his aunt in a rough neighborhood with many drug addicts and rough people, and has to deal with racism. However, Alfred becomes a boxer and that is what the story talks about, his training and experiences. The book shows how hard it is to become a contender.

As an overall, the book had a unique theme and was fast-moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Review to the Contender","review":"I think this book was OK, but the ending was trashy and it needed more help. I think that if it had more action, the book would be great. Mostly,I liked this book. I think there should have had some more to it though.

Well, I haven't drank or felt the desire to drink any coffee since my first cup of yerba mate this morning. It also suppressed my appetite; I was not running to the vending machines for my usual 3 PM pick me up. Definitely give it a try, it is very good, and not bitter at all, some teas if I steep them too long, they become bitter, making me gag, not this tea, the bag sits in the cup all till the last drop.I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like an ashtray, tastes like one too!","review":"I have no idea why anyone likes this tea. It literally tastes and smells like an ashtray. When they say \\"smokey\\" flavor, they aren't kidding. I bought this box of tea from a local grocer and I could barely finish the package.

But some studies have shown that there is a connection between regular mate use and several types of cancers. Another study found that mate has high concentrations of molecules associated with smoke that are known carcinogens. Inference: it's most likely the smoking process that causes mate to be carcinogenic. I know the smoked version takes better, but the unsmoked version ain't bad at all if you like the mate taste. So do yourself a favor and find an unsmoked mate (I don't want to advertise --they're easy enough to find). After a couple of pounds of unsmoked mate, you won't miss it. But to be more safe, alternate mate with strong green tea like I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the smoky flavor","review":"I tried mate in South America and it was something that held my curiosity when I got home. So I found Guayaki and several other brands as bags to try. Wasn't up for the whole gourd set up. This is my favorite straight Mate by far. I don't like it as a first cup of the day too smoky but as the second cup it is perfect and late at night it is reminiscent of a nice single malt. Definitely a sophisticated taste. First cup of the Day I like the Pixie Green Tea mate.Moira"},{"rating":"2","title":"As clear and concise a population biology text can be!","review":"At last a population biologist who can communicate ideas to the everyday student biologist.

The acting is mostly horrid, the plot is pretty lame, and the ending is pathetic. Yet...it does have a certain charm about it, it's almost so bad that it's kinda good. It's at times more of a comedy than a horror movie, just listen to some of the lines and sound effects. It reminded me a lot at times of the comedy/horror spoof movie \\"Student Bodies\\". I like the early electronica music that runs throughout the film, it's repetitive but effective, I would compare it as very similar to the music from the first \\"Slumber Party Massacre\\" film.I think if the killings would have been a little more realistic and unique, and that if the ending would have been a lot better and explained things this could have been a more highly regarded film. It would have also helped if the movie was about 10 minutes longer in length, 75 minutes did seem quite short watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"minirus tapes are worthless","review":"the books come with four tapes.

I purchased it because I suspected that I was experiencing abuse so I needed knowledge to confirm this and wisdom on how to deal with it. Bishop George Bloomer was very candid about his personal experiences which gave credence to the content of this book. It also touched on the Jezebel spirit which I found to be quite helpful. This book initiated my search to acquire information to assist me personally and professionally to deal with leaders who abuse their authority and encouraged me to ensure that I do not become abusive. It also stressed that we must stay in position because only God can break the power of an abuser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!! Excellent!!!! Excellent!!!!","review":"This is a very good book to read. It provides insight on authority abuse in a very basic format that anyone can understand.

They're not the absolute best of the 20 Kolchak episodes produced in 1974-75, but they're definitely in the top 10. The Night Stalker is a series that combines horror and comedy - reporter Carl Kolchak is a bit of a bumbler, and is as likely to run in terror from the approaching monster than confront it.

Well, with Mr. Murray incarcerated, Jive Records had to do something to cash in off of the man's talent. As a whole, this album does hit all of Keith's high points and hot singles. The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is that the banger off of his second album \\"Enigma\\" isn't on here, that's right,\\"Manifique\\"! Also, since Jive took the liberty of borrowing tracks from other albums, they shouldn't have left out the killer verse he dropped on EPMD's \\"Back in Business\\" album, when he ripped \\"K.I.M.\\" which also featured Redman.

On the other hand , Andrei Bushilow made the same in the late sixties as musical leader of the Philadelphians.Listen Debussy's Violin sonata or Cello sonata, the fabulous transcription of Prelude and you will understand how this approach simply dissapeared in these times.Recordings of first-order relevance that -under the light of four decades- merely confirm something missed under the bridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad transfer to CD","review":"I found this CD after looking for \\"replacements\\" for the vinyl LP I have of this recording (excluding the \\"Apres midi...\\") Bad choice.

Personally, I find that the series thus far is not quite as great as others (Rurouni Kenshin, Escaflowne, ect.), but I expect future episodes will improve as the plot thickens.

You can read the story synopsis from Publisher's Weekly above, so suffice it to say that this book exudes a false nostalgia for a true America that (of course) never existed. Big obvious targets like religion and consumerism are lampooned, but there is also a more subtle wit weaving around the dialogue and even in Mason (the narrator's) voice.One problem with comic novels is that the joke usually gets tired, or the plot gets so silly, one loses interest. By writing Mission to America in the form of a folktale, Kirn is able to elude this problem to a degree. And by being an extraordinarily witty writer, he may be on the verge of joining others who have transcended the form, like Joseph Heller and Roger Kaputnik."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not complete, nor even division","review":"Product received was 9ft and 14ft length cord, yes 25ft total, the listing made no mention that the cord would be divided.

I don't know of one absolute best source to recommend to you, and I doubt that there is one. It depends so much on exactly what you need the practice on.

My thinking was the more times I practiced taking the test, the better. While I certainly can't hold this book accountable for my performance or my score, I can caution potential test-takers that this book seems a little incomplete. There are areas in the math portion where items are left blank. For one of the passages in the reading comprehension section, the question asked about an author never even mentioned in the text!

However, you still need to polish up on your vocabulary to actually answer the questions, and practise writing essays and identifying issues, etc. The 3500 Master Word list is helpful but some definitions of some words are inaccurate. I had to double-check with a proper dictionary! The Math review section and practice exercises seem to be incomplete in some areas - No answer choices (A, B, C, D, or E) were given, so you don't really know what the actual answer is other than the letters A, B, C, D or E! The Math Review section is a tad bit cluttered and not as concise or simple as I'd like it to be.

Also, there have been many changes in the offshore world over the past few years and the book does a good job of describing current issues with offshore banking and other vehicles.

It shows the innocent and fun times of the surfers, vagabonds and young people of that era whose lives would forever be swept away by World War II.The subjects of the photos display a remarkable athletic naturalism, unlike the steroid artificiality of today. They surf, drink beer, and lay on the sand, ride the waves, enjoying life to the fullest-- splendidly isolated from the darkening events of the world.Beautifully photographed in black and white with some color, it brings back a time before Southern California was choked by overdevelopment and young people could enjoy the sun, water and natural beauty of this state with fear of skin cancer, water pollution and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummmm","review":"Why on earth anyone would publish this former paperback into a hardcover is beyond me.

They charged me about $6 for shipping a part that cost about $3. The system can't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler. Also, it is hard to reel the hose in.

Volume 2 talks about Keichi's and Belldandy's life after 8 months. Hilarious Skuld and flirtatious Urd now live with them in the temple but a challenge awaits Keichi's and Belldandy's love.

Sure, there is love, but it's from the male point of view. Belldandy comes off to me as a sort of airhead, which I can't stand. There are much better animes out there trust me. What's so great about watching an anime where one ugly boy is surrounded by gorgeous women? Fushigi Yuugi is the best shojou, one girl surrounded by bishounen like guys. Well, most anyway. I didn't like this anime because I thought it was just another male-type fantasy. Would never spend another penny on this junk.

It still works perfectly and looks almost like the day I bought it.- The rubbery plastic that the remote is covered with means it is pleasant to hold, it doesn't scratch tables or become scratched itself.- The remote's signal is very strong. I can point it in almost any direction in my living room and the signal still goes through to my devices. This is a relief after using some finicky remotes that had to be pointed EXACTLY at the devices they controlled.- The batteries need changing every 4-5 months. Not bad, not great.- Some remotes have LCD buttons (which give you no tactile feedback), and some remotes have regular buttons (which you can't change the labels on). The MX-500 eliminates the disadvantages of either approach by combining regular buttons with LCD labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The macro feature of this remote is awesome. I was getting annoyed with having to switch both my TV and A/V receiver inputs whenever I wanted to use a different device so I got this remote. Using the macro feature all I have to do is press one button and all the switching is done. My old receiver only had Component inputs so I was considering upgrading to one with HDMI inputs.

Afterward, my tv, cable box, 3 dvd players and reciever were all programmed working properly. The display is very easy to read and the layout is totally logical. I have dropped it a few times and can tell you it is very well built. The case and buttons are sturdy; no ink has rubbed off and it probably looks pretty close to when I first got it. I got an awesome deal through Amazon. Some places were selling this for double price I found on Amazon.Although it's working great, I'm thinking of replacing it with either a Harmony or another URC.

Setup is very easy and quick, and it's built very solidly. You can also program macro buttons - for example, I programmed one button when I want to watch regular cable TV which turns on my TV (including turning it to the proper TV/Video input), receiver (including setting it to the TV input), and cable box. Then I programmed my system off button to turn off all my components with one button.I use it for a Sony 36\\" TV, digital cable box, Sony DVD, Sony CD changer, and Harmon Kardon receiver, and have had zero issues.

I don't know what I was doing wrong, but the remote would simply not learn the commands like advertised.Maybe its user error, but the device is not intuitive. I have had several Harmony 650s, but they have been fragile with a 12 month old baby in the house and she's broken them. I was hoping for something more robust.

I don't know what stuff Mr. Two-star is listening to that he can afford to trash this CD, but CD's like this are a rare find for me. I love the way Cathy and Amelia sing in dialogs; I love the strange ?percussion? they use in several of the songs; I love the imagery that is conjured up in my head when I visualize Amelia's lyrics; I love that they used a word I actually had to look up in the dictionary; I love the double entendres.

Therefore, in the original series of books, with the exception of Harold himself, everything is only a purple outline, because he has drawn it with his purple crayon. In this book, the drawings are in color, with only a purple outline around the multi-colored drawings. Is Harold now carrying around a 10 pack of colored pencils? How does this book demonstrate that Harold is drawing anything with his purple crayon? It doesn't make sense. The magic is absent. How sad that we think children need color more than imagination.

Battling foreclosure on her chateau, and eviction of herself and her 12 \\"rainbow tribe\\" children, she gratefully accepted Castro's invitation to perform in Cuba.In the 40 or so years since her early days in Paris, her voice had matured from something small and sometimes shrill, to an instrument of great expressive power and impeccable control. She easily took to Latin American adaptations of the songs she had made popular in France, and readily internalized the Cuban tunes \\"Esto es Felicidad\\" and \\"Quando, quando\\". Other than offering a most enjoyable Latin side of Josephine, this album is the only source I've found of some important material (i.e.: \\"Dans mon Village\\", sung in French) and is a must-have for anyone wishing to appreciate Mme.

Originally written in 1868 it briefly presents 507 different mechanisms with a graphic for each. When I first received the book my first impression was that it was too small to be much good. Indeed, I think it would benefit from a total reformat devoting more space and detail to each mechanism. However, as I looked further I saw that there is JUST adequate size to see everything. (The formatting has obviously changed since the original which leaves wide spaces above and below each page. It occurs to me that they should be good places for making notes.) The illustrations are numbered and correspond to the text on the facing page. The drawings are simple and beautifully done in the style of the time (nineteenth century).

Classic songs such as Ol' Man River, Bill, and Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man are sung beautifully. You can hear William Warfield's pain as he sings Ol' Man River.On some studio cast recordings you may find that since the cast does not perform on stage together, they do not have a sense of closeness and in turn do not give heartfelt performances. This is the case with this CD. While all of the songs are great you are just missing something. I can't put my finger on it but it just lacks gusto in some parts.

By the end of the movie we were left feeling that we could not recommend watching it to our friends because we would not want to leave them also feeling depressed. The devotion and loyalty of the sister was commendable, but the sacrifice of her own marriage and family in the process was very disappointing. On a positive note, Megan's character, with her sister's encouragement, was able to lead a happy and productive life, and this could inspire others in this situation.

Then again, another example is of a woman who sells her handknitted baby blankets for [very little money for the effort] She must make a few cents an hour. What kind of profit is that? The author seems to assume that if you love to knit, you'll be happy making whatever money you can above the price of yarn. There are no details on how to get into selling designs, or opening a shop.

I suspect that both the disk and the label were copied without the permission of the publisher.

And very grainy besides. There seems to be an earlier version with both formats. Get this instead.The movie itself. Seems as if Malick is trying to create a boring, poorly acted, pointless movie. If it has artistic or other redeeming features they are beyond me. But I only went to college for 8 years so what do I know. See the Starkweather bio instead for real horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This is a 4:3 aspect ratio version, with terrible image quality.

He has the rare ability to go from a violent mood to a lyrical one and back again. All his films are beautifully filmed and have compelling story lines. Two of our country's best actors, Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, star in Badlands.There is one scene in the film in which Sheen is peeking out of his underground hiding place that would not have seemed out of place in Apocalypse Now.Badlands, which was first released in 1973, does not show its age. It looks as good as any new release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"As with all Malick films, he enjoys potraying the stupid as intellegiant; as victims, of the banality of life. The live based on emotions, well so do, dogs and cats.Martin Sheen's character shoots people in the back, and reasons, that their motives are wrong because they are \\"bounty hunters\\".Listening to the moronic Sissy Spacec character's narration is almost unbearbable.But as with any sociopathic characters that are potrayed in the movies, both of the murderers in \\"Badlands\\" are extremely good looking.Which makes his next project of the murderous and good looking Che, seem appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"senseless and absurd","review":"sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original True Romance","review":"The first time I saw this film was on video. Before the film was the theatrical trailer. It started with a balloon floating above a barren landscape. A voice-over tells us that the young couple of the film are Kit and Holly. In 1950 they killed a lot of people. The balloon bursts to reveal the title \\"Badlands\\". This is effortlessly cool, it hasn't dated a bit. The amount Tarantino \\"borrowed\\" from this film is unbelievable, Hanz Zimmer even copied one of the songs.

The seat cover is machine washable, so it's always clean. The basket is a little hard to access when you have the sear reclined, but I use a pretty small one, and really don't carry a diaper bag on most quick trips. The wheels have held up really well. Overall, I am very glad I bought the Cortina - based on a recommendation from another parent who loved it at BRU. I was about to give up on finding one I could lift/open/close easily and I'm glad to have run into this woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Bought this stroller for my first Grandbaby.It was simple to put together.Roomy seat, and not very heavy to lift to put in the car when you take it places. The only thing that I am not crazy about is the drape that goes around the back.It's stiff, and not able to roll it up,it's great if its breezy and you want to keep the baby out of the wind, but can get a little too warm it your out on a sunny day.Overall It's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat Cover Nearly IMPOSSIBLE to Remove for Washing","review":"The stroller as a whole is so-so. It's rather flimsy and cheap--as other reviewers have mentioned, the wheels are cheap and bouncy, the wheel locks only worked reliably for about 5 minutes, the canopy is pretty much a joke. The thing that bothers me the most, however, is the difficulty in removing the \\"washable\\" seat cover--yeah, it's washable if you've got a couple hours and a couple engineers handy in order to get the thing off! The majority of the straps holding the seat cover in place come undone in a snap. But there are two straps near the feet that literally took my wife and I 30 minutes and a handful of various kitchen tools to get loose! Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this stroller","review":"I hate this stroller and am trying to sell it. It is too bulky to shop with. There is no need for it with the infant seat, and I want a better stroller now that he's out of the infant seat, so it was never useful. I used a Maclaren Easy Traveller (much recommended over the coordinating Chicco travel system strollers) witht he Keyfit 30 Infant Seat to get him everywhere. I wanted the Cortina so that I could lay him flat and not have him trapped in the car seat all the time. Even for an obsessive mom like me, it just wasn't worth it. The storage is minimal and impossible to get to if the seat is down, it turns poorly, it is wide, and it takes up my whole trunk! This stroller is sitting unused in my house, and I don't have space for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I haven't had the opportunity to begin any projects from this particular book, however, having looked through and had the opportunity to read the patterns and see the accompanying photos, I am sure I have not made a bad move purchasing this book.

It's not because of the subject matter or the anti-government propaganda or the hard right Christian fundamentalism. I can deal with all that in a work of fiction. It was the writing that made me throw up in my mouth a little. I've read better from elementary school children. I won't cover all the problems I had with this book, other one and two star reviewers have done it better.If you are interested in this book in the slightest, please read as many different reviews as possible. It's not for everyone and actually shouldn't even be allowed for human consumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivalist manual: 3 stars. Novel: 1 star","review":"Your liking or disliking of this book will depend on whether or not you share Mr. Rawles hard-core survivalist mindset. While the book is ostensibly a novel, it reads more like an outline of a novel, heavy on technical details of survivalism, particularly guns, and on Mr. Rawles' daydreams about how he personally plans to save the world and give all the globalist conspiracies their comeuppance, come Judgment Day.As a novel, the book is almost unreadable. Most sentences are written in the passive voice and use various forms of \\"to be\\" as the sole verbs. Characters have no personality, dialogue is stilted, and plot flows along at the speed of cold molasses. But if you're deeply into survivalism, you may find that Mr. Rawles' fantasies resonate with your own, and you may not care that he writes at a grade-school level of proficiency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I started reading this book a couple of weeks ago, it was recommended to me by a friend.

Written years before the current economic mess, it is uncannily.The struggle to stay alive by this group of survivalists could be a warning for those of us who were late to understand the possibilities of the current crisis to get our act together and prepare for an uncertain future.The story of their efforts to survive the chaos of the post-crisis world and the attempted imposition of a UN imposed governmental framework seems real close to a certainty. The ruthless use of foreign forces to establish a new government, which allies itself with an UN effort to control the once mighty United States, sound and feel like a probability, especially for those who doubt the UN and its attitude toward the United States.The group's eventual overall success sounds less than probable but it is a good, page turning read.Honey, we better get our supplies ready! The stuff may have hit the fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel, a Liberal Bashing Survival Handbook","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book, but I was looking for a novel, as in, entertainment, not a how-to guide.The first third of the book is an exhausting account of their preparation. How many cans of this, how many bales of that etc.. ad nauseum.I'm neither Liberal nor Conservative, but the book felt like the author took this opportunity to accuse all the ills of the modern world on Liberals.I dislike giving an overly harsh review, because the author spent a lot of time and effort producing this book, but that said, it just didn't do it for me, on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book BUY you wont regret it","review":"i have bought other copies to give as gift great book to read to anyone prepping to survive with a great story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author great book","review":"Is it possible that another author could compose a better novel on this subject?---Yes.

Also Scouts stuck together, as friends and in teams. So to this book makes a point of recommending that one be mentally, emotionally and physically prepared. Or as prepared as you can be, given that we really don't know how the major calamity or calamities will hit us. So I recommend it, to those who want to know more, think outside of their safe, little box, and have a chance to survive when the going gets tough, then tragic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Because I Couldn't Go Any Lower","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! I have heard that the author of the book told subscribers of his website to go to Amazon and give the book 5 star reviews, so read the 5 star reviews for this book with extreme scrutiny.

But still, fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read and Great Info","review":"This was a good informative book. It explained things as a fictional story for you to get a sense of how things could go and how you should react to different things, set up your retreat and prepare to defend it. I thought it was very interesting. This isn't really a step by step guide for anything. It's a scenaro based story for you to learn from. There were a lot of bad reviews on this book, but if you're anything of a survivalist or just looking for some ideas to help get yourself set up for when TSHTF, this is a pretty good start with a future fight for survival. One of the reviews complained that it would cost too much money to have all the stuff the writter talks about, but the writter also mentions that they have been stocking for years and years. This isn't something you're going to do over night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but a MUST read.","review":"Nothing is perfect, this book included. But I feel it is a must read because it will make you think about things you would not have thought about before. One thing it drove home to me is, assuming you are not at your retreat location when the feces hits the occilator, that you need to ere on the side of caution and if in doubt leave early rather than later. You do not want to be on the road trying to get to where you should already be.After reading it while living in Southern California it dawned on me that the best thing is to live in a place were you would want to be in a survival scenario. I think it is important that you become part of the community and are a know commodity, a known \\"good guy\\". Showing up someplace you spend no time and expecting a warm welcome is not realistic. I have since moved to Western Colorado and am exactly where I want to be if the SHTF. I recommend you think along those lines if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I really can't say much more than what's already been covered in other one star reviews.

Then you might have a good book.Are there a few good points in the book about scenarios that may possibly happen in our future? Yes. But they are buried too far beneath the junk that should be in a survival handbook (not a novel) and the poor character sketches and obvious author opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Title Only for the Initiated","review":"Rawles attempt to write a novel is just that, an attempt. Yes, he tells a story that somewhat engages the reader and does a somewhat below average attempt at characterization. But, the reader only stays engaged if he or she can tolerate the intolerable minute descriptive details of material, weapons, military terms, foodstuffs, toilet paper, and more. In fact, one might think that this \\"novel\\" is a disguised manual for survivalists. Unfortunately, it is sold as a novel. Furthermore, Rawles' attempts to portray his militia as Christian is pathetic at best, and lacks theological foundation. For example, for a man to kill another man, for the first time, even in combat, is a soul rendering experience. For the characters in this \\"novel\\" it is a matter of course. Just doing the job.If the author had just told the story and left out 90% of the detailed lists the book would still be amateurish but at least entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"As a medical professional, I found Mr. Rawles's descriptions of medical procedures and basic medical knowledge to be laughable at best and potentially downright dangerous. I know that the book is supposed to be a novel, but the lack of factual information and the inclusion of just wrong information reflects very badly on Mr. Rawles's research capabilities and casts a pall over all of the content in the book.There appears to be a personal political and philosphical agenda to this book and Mr. Rawles has apparently chosen to not allow fact to interfere with his expression of that agenda. That choice detracts from his message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing","review":"This is not a story, this is an extreme right-wing diatribe against everything. According to this book the government, the police and all blue states are commie, pinko traitors who are the enemy, and the apocalypse is something to be welcomed as an opportunity to rid the world do all who don't share this author's extreme views. I love the post apocalyptic genre, but this is not it. This is a laundry list of weapons to stockpile mixed in with all kinds of bizarre justification for hating pretty much everyone. As an avid reader I could not get past the third or fourth chapter- it was hopelessly dull, and mind-numbingly doctrinaire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary book","review":"Don't buy this book. Maybe I took it too seriously. I like survival, alternate lives, etc. but this was all guns, militaristic, dying, and someone's idea of what mainstream politics can lead us into.At times it read like a weapons list. The love of guns was nuts. I live in a society so that I don't have to carry a gun. I don't want to worry about some idiot or some criminal pulling a gun on me.It's also dreaming to think only the good guys have guns and that the \\"good\\" guys will win. The post collapse society could just as be controlled by feudalism, fascism, theocracy, communism--all forms of government that I do not want.Scary, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad,Just Bad!!","review":"I won't go into great detail about how bad this book was, everybody else that rated it 1 star before me said it all. I could literally skip 4 or 5 pages (so I didn't have to read the blather about technical aspects of every last thing they owned) and not miss a thing. I read the entire book, sort of, but I couldn't wait until it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Too Late","review":"This book was an interesting read. If I'd had the foresight to be born rich, and to have read the book ten years ago, it would be quite helpful in setting up a safe house in the country. Unfortunately, we are out of time. What with the corporate looters (AKA CEO's) having stolen what little money I had, it looks like I'll wind up on the \\"them\\" side of this book's \\"us vs. them\\" equation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Patriot","review":"I was bitterly disappointed with this book. It was more an \\"infomercial\\" than a novel. I guess if you are someone who is impressed with acronyms and lists of guns you might enjoy it but I could barely slog through it. I didn't even read the last chapter because I couldn't stay awake. The worst part of the whole experience is that I paid full price for it. UGGGHHI love survival novels (Alas Babylon, Day of the Triffids etc.) This book was a DRAG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study of worst case scenarios and how to survive them","review":"I enjoyed the storyline approach to survival tactics. The book plays out various do-or-die situations and the characters survive them. I kept a list of things that I would like to add to my survival cache as I read through the book.After reading the book, I feel like I have returned to a state of bliss with our current freedoms and lifestyle. I will never complain about the price of gas again and I enjoy each trip to the grocery store. It is nice to have fresh vegetables in the middle of winter.I hope we never have to survive worst case scenario, but I feel this book gave me a better basis for facing it if I have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is what it is.","review":"JWR has a lot of good survival/firearms information like any good libertarian. However, he really should have read a few how-to books on fiction writing, character creation and dialogue. His whole aim with this book was to sneak helpful how-to info and instill survival mentality through the brain's backdoor by making an informational book into a novel. The problem is he's not a fiction writer, so his characters and dialogue end up being wholly bland and unbelievable. A real person doesn't go on unprovoked expository tangents detailing the compatibility of blood types. JWR should have contracted a real fiction writer for this one. Beyond all that though, there is a lot of great useful reference-type information there if you're able to stomach the format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"There's a lot of good, solid technical information salted throughout this book, and that is its sole strength. The plot is paper-thin, characterization nonexistent, and the villains cartoonish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriots","review":"A very realistic analysis of our current government's financial policies, what it is doing to our economy and potentially where it could lead demonstrating many of the similarities with the historical collapse of the great depression. It details many of the characteristics of a soceity under collapse with no law enforcement, banking systems, common currency, communications, transportation, oil or gas refining capabilities and total chaos.The book was very well researched and the information on the care of fuels, choice of weapons, munitions, area logistics, plant seeds, canning, radio transmissions and vehicles was highly accurate.In addition to all of these positives it was well written, exciting and appealling to the character traits which have historically defined our nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right out of today's headlines.","review":"With what is going on in this country today makes this very real. Good read. Never give up your rights like sheep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed","review":"I don't have any particular issue with the author's politics, which seems to be an issue in some of the one star and five star reviews of this book.That said, the author takes an interesting setting and just fails to do anything compelling with it. Characters can be charitably described as one dimensional. There is no real tension or drama developed during the course of the novel. The plot becomes increasingly improbable (and inconsistent with earlier events mentioned in the book) towards the end.As a novel this is definitely one star stuff.As a primer on 1980s style survivalism it is an interesting book, as many portions of the book are barely more than a thin fictional narrative mapped over the author's take on how a survivalist group should equip itself and function. Even in this capacity, I don't think the book breaks any new ground compared to 1980s vintage writings by members of the then much more vibrant survivalist movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future is NOW!","review":"This book perfectly outlines a sustainable lifestyle in an austere environment. Don't just survive - survive well. The story ties together the aspects of suvivalism with societal collapse and rebuilding. Throughout the book I learned many subtle preparedness strategies. This book is well worth the read. The characters are believable and I could hardly put the book down. The second time through I used a highlighter. I am now incorporating what I have learned into my plan. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Wing Wet Dream","review":"Wow the only thing this book is good for as a look inside a right-wing christian survivalist's mind! The writer has no ability to tell a coherent story but manages to ramble away chapter after chapter! It'd be entertaining if it wasn't so unreadable. The author makes clear that the only way to survive is if you are already wealthy and happen to own a well fortified house in the country and of course it helps to be christian! Anyway even if you are a survivalist there has got to be better books than this for you out there. I actually threw this thing in my recycling bin may it come back as the tiolet paper it should have been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about nut-jobs, written by a nut-job","review":"Wow ... I didn't realize how off-kilter and just plain crazy these milita-survivalist types really are. All that was missing here was the big finish with a kool-aid ceremony. The Atheist accepting Christ as his savior ... really? what a bunch of \\"bravo sierra\\", as the book often uses so quaintly. Making the U.N. out to be the globalistic, freedom-hating organization was a nice touch: that feeds right into the paranoid delusions these people experience on a regular basis. Note to the author: one does not have to be god-fearing to be freedom-loving.If you're into god, guns, playing army, hate the U.N., and love the gold standard, this book is for you. It's four hours of my life that I'll never get back reading this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scary review of ultra-conservative ideals (poorly edited)","review":"After reading the various review, I decided to purchase this book. I quickly learned that this was a ongoing description of ultra-conservative ideals. From suggesting that the oklahoma city bombing was a government plot to idolizing two gun-toting criminals who have shoot-outs with police, this story is a scary view into how some people view the world around them. The main characters are very wooden and consistently praying (while ambushing travelers along the road)The only reason I finished this story was to see if it ever gained a resemblance of sanity (no).In addition, the book was very poorly edited. It was obviously rewritten from an earlier version, but only some of the dates were changed. The timeline made NO SENSE. Please, don't waste you time or money on this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hoped for More","review":"I had high expectations for this book, but was very disappointed. It is a survival manual but not much of a story. If you want to learn how to store gasoline or make your own soap get the book. If you want an interesting story get something else. The good guys in the story are over the top good, and the bad guys are rediculously bad. For a book that takes place after society crashes there is little to no action through most of the book, and even the action parts are boring and brief. I finished reading it hoping it would get good at the end, but was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"what would jesus horde?","review":"heavy on the christian preaching, light on the \\"how to\\". should be renamed - \\"christians will be the only ones to survive the coming colapse\\" as they are obviosly the only people the author finds worthy of survival despite the \\"token\\" jew."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"James Wesley, Rawles' novel \\"Patriots\\" is looking closer to reality with each passing day. He wraps a riveting novel around a very useful \\"how to\\" manual. Yes, this novel was written a number of years ago, so some of the \\"how to\\" items are a bit dated. But, for any serious preparedness minded person, this is great info in a very easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone preparing","review":"If you are a person that \\"feels\\" things just are not right and are preparing for the worse and hoping for the best, this book is a MUST READ! The information in this book is wonderful and detailed! Many things you may not think of or may not know to expect are covered in this book. Now that being said it is fictional and therefor it is fun to read. I would suggest reading once for the story and then the second time for taking notes! I enjoyed the book, even though I bought it for my husband and never expected to read it. It is a book you will pass around to all your like minded friends. We purchased several copies and handed them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I didn't enjoy the way this book was written at all. It jumps around from scene to scene and character to character and is hard to follow. Some characters play absolutely no relevance to the story at all. The only thing that I enjoyed was the overall topic of survival. Rawles should stick to blogging and leave the novels to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too planned!","review":"I tried to get through this book, but I just couldn't. It has a great plot....I love this genre, but it just seemed too unrealistic in the fact that they had been planning for years. I would rather read about people unexpectedly trying to survive the apocalypse. You could also see the political slants in the writing....but that could have been the writers intentions. I do like the line that said something about it being better to do all of this planning and looking foolish than yo not plan at all and the end really happening. That's not a direct quote, but I think it is close enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"I am open to reading just about anything interesting. So when a friend suggested I should read \\"the manual\\" on economic collapse in book form, I said sure. I also purchased Rawles other book that details how to be prepared for an emergency scenario and it wasn't bad, so I thought I would give this a try.First, it is concerning because Rawles and others seem to actually think this is happening. Right off the bat, the current events described in the book aren't even remotely accurate. IE the supposed GDP figure that is given for the annual debt servicing.Even if the book is taken as fiction, the characters meant to survive seem to be almost as dark as the villains when things get rough.I would suggest other post-apocalyptic fiction for entertainment purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please dont waste your Money!!","review":"I think this mans intentions were good, but this book will have your head spinning...its psychotic to be quite honest! There are alot better books on survival out there than this...I was Hugely disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy book with cheesy writing","review":"What a let down this book was! I have read many apocalyptic books and this has got to be the worst one! After reading the S.M. Stirling trilogy, Stephen King's The Stand, Lucifer's Hammer by Pournelle/Niven, One Second After, Earth Abides, The Road by Cormac Mccarthy, etc. this book was a HUGE letdown. First of all, the author should not have written a novel. He should have written a survival book and left it at that. His writing was sometimes childish, boring and way too descriptive on firearms, tactics and what ifs. His characters never gained any personality and were shallow and boring. His scenarios were very hard to believe and bordered on the ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book for Beginners","review":"This book is ok for new preppers but not much help for advanced. Allot of the gear the author speaks of is way out of reach of a normal prepper or group or not feasible to own as it would cost a fortune. He does a fair job of describing the gear and its purpose. As far as the story goes it has some discrepancies in its time lines. It has to much religion in it and he assumes that the characters have the values of 18th century settlers. Even the people added later in the story talk as if they came from Amish town's. Overall the story is not to bad and it does have some value to teach new people about prepping gear and terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful - Couldn't pick it back up","review":"I could go into detail here but just read the other 1 star reviews; it's all been said before.Instead of calling this a novel it should be a checklist - and free:\\"Here is what you should buy - in this size and this type and this is why and this is where I would buy it from this at this distributor in this city.\\" If you want to read this every time he mentions a piece of gear - you'll love this book. I was going to look for the \\"sponsored by\\" pages at the end of the book but never made it that far. The only reason this book didn't get turned into kindling; it that it was on my Kindle. It still almost went out the window. I returned it after torturing myself through 165 pages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a Sears catalog","review":"Reads like a sears catalog, lots of pieces of information but realy not a good read as a story. The dialoge between the characters reads ike a \\"c\\" average high school kid wrote it. Poor writing skills by the author...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good survival info but horrible writing","review":"I just got this from the library today (fortunately I didn't buy it offhand!) and I could only make it 4 chapters in before I had to give up on it. I skipped thru parts of the rest of the book but the quality of 'storytelling' didn't improve. All of the characters are faceless interchangable cardboard cutouts. They all have the same beliefs, morals and values and character development is non-existent. While I see that a group hard core survivalists would have a similar set of ideals and such, it makes for a very boring novel. I think this would have turned out much better if the author had just written a straight up survival reference book instead which would have made the few important aspects of the book much more digestable. Skip buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a sensible person, don't bother.","review":"I love the survival/post-apocalyptic sub genre. On the Beach, The Postman, Dies the Fire... all great novels. This book, however, is not one of them. The only reason I even gave 2 stars was for the astounding amount of information packed into the book. The author clearly knows what he is talking about, but his literary prowess leaves something to the imagination. I got 100 pages into it and couldn't finish; it was boring and skewed with right-wing extremist propaganda. This book, by comparison, makes Fox News look like crazy free love hippies. You want a survivalist manual? Then buy a legitimate manual, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some good information on stockpiling/preparing but overall not an interesting read at all.","review":"Some good information but mostly a very boring read. And what's up with the lets hold everyone and anyone at gun point who just so happens to be travelling on a very public road that runs by the hideout. The writer makes negative references to the BATF but finds it perfectly OK to not only hold people at gunpoint on a public road but got through all the belongings and demand them explain their travel plans. Sounds like he'd fit right in with the BATF. About the only thing I found of value is the preparing and stockpiling part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but could use some editing","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Mr. Rawles makes a point of making it a \\"how-to\\" on surviving an economic crash and describes (accurately I think) how quickly things will devolve once the thread starts being pulled. It could have used someone with good editing skills and that's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. The story is very Christian-focused but not preachy. Good story as well as good practical lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate survivalist fiction","review":"Best survivalist novel of the past 15 years, top notch practical information.Well written and right on target for its intended reader population.Liberal's hate this novel, hence the rare bad review - let the grasshoppers stew in their anger, the ants love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Prepare to start preparing","review":"Wonderfully written. One of those books that you just can't put down. Real time news events leading up to the story. This book will definitely make you think! What if?? And how would me or my family survive. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is garbage. Underdeveloped characters that I cared nothing about even at the end of the story. Underdeveloped sub-plots that had nothing to do at all with the main plot and that were oddly interjected. Time lines jump all over, holes all over. I know what this book was going for: a how-to/novel. It fails as a how-to. It fails as a novel. It fails miserably at trying to be both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly written.","review":"I read this book about a year ago. I thought the story subject matter was god, but Rawles is a lack luster writter. I also thought the fact that he tries to make a reference to the Keyhoe (sp?) brothers (Shane & Chevy I believe are their names) as real American heros rather pathetic. They are nothing more than racist murderers. This makes me wonder if Rawles himself adheres to their ideology. The book as a whole was not very good, but as I said the idea was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse","review":"One of the best books I read about a fictional post apocalyptic situation. In this day and age, with the financial and political environment we now live in, makes you think about what you would do if a scenario like this ever happened to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I really loved this book. It reminded me in some ways of the \\"Jericho\\" TV series (without the nuclear bombs). There were a couple of parts that dipped into a little too much detail such as one part on radio communications and hardware but aside from that it was excellent. After I started reading it I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"GodAwful!","review":"There are some very good post apocalyptic novels out there: Alas Babylon, Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer . . . On the Beach. However, this \\"book\\" is the singularly most Godawfully written book I have ever tried to read. It is BAD. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunatic fringe","review":"A view of the coming financial and social collapse as seen from the lunatic fringe. The characters hold such main line opinions as the federal government has no jurisdiction in the states and driver's licenses are only legally required for commercial drivers. All of the positively positioned characters are devout christians...even the jewish ones.Anyone associated with the government, including the police, are portrayed as evil and incompetent.The main characters although described as middle class, were able to accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and supplies before the crash. One couple was able to walk from Chicago to Idaho apparently carrying several hundred pounds of guns, ammunition and food.Certainly among the top 10 worst written books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed information, sadly bound with poor characters and religion","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting \\"what if\\" scenario type story, with factual survival information backing up the characters actions. What I discovered was that despite the extremely in depth level of detail regarding gun models and supply products, the story itself was useless. The characters feel fake, their dialogue is consistently dull, and their actions mirror those of robots as opposed to real people. Compound that by the fact that every 3rd page a heaping serving of religion is force fed to you, and the book goes from passable to barely readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!!!!!","review":"This book was the worst book I ever read. I'm not even finish with it but I had to say something. Even if he was trying to disguise \\"prep tips\\" in his book. He still missed the mark. The characters are empty. The tips are one dimensional. And the gun cataloging is crap. I like Mr. Rawles' tips on survival, hell even his site is awesome with great tips. But this book should be burned. TWICE!!!!!!!When I finish this book & get my senses back. I'll make a more in-depth review."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should have this book !!!","review":"The best way for me to review this book is just to say........That was a frightning horrific story!.

This is a must read for anyone interested in survival!!!Some great tips and facts!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the naysayers, this book is a treasured survival guide!","review":"This book takes into account a factual understanding on national economics and the potential impact of the economy being mishandled in our nation. Mr. Rawles does a fantastic job of teaching, providing information, and tactical understanding all through the platform of a compelling story. If you want a good novel that might teach you something and make you think this is the book for you. Lord knows with the current administration at the helm, having read this book will probably come in handy someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Prevue","review":"This is a very interesting book, and it's easy to envision the utility of the detailed preparations outlined. One hopes that the scenario presented in novel format never materializes, but if and when it does, we will all need to be aware of the greatest number of survival techniques. The author does a good job of interweaving this practical info into an entertaining volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a \\"You need to read this book\\"","review":"The Patriots is not on my list of great literature but the informational content makes this a must read. I made notes in the margins as I read it so I could refer back for easy reference. If you are worried that America is headed for some heavy times economically and then socially this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info but...","review":"There is some good info in this book, however, it is, for the lack of a better word, corny. For instance when one of the main characters gets shot multiple times and his intestines are hanging out of his body, he exclaims \\" Oh Crud!\\", how's that for realism. A lot of other things in the book are very unrealistic. This group is very concerned about having enough food and supplies, yet they give away a lot of it to strangers in need. A nice thought but not to realistic. This book also goes on and on and on in way too much detail about things such as the finer points of radio transmission and M1 tanks. The only reason I bought this book is because the author was on a local radio show and made this book sound fantastic. The only reason I read the whole thing is because I had $15 invested in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will motivate you to begin preparations for survival","review":"I was amazed when I read this novel about all the things one should take into account to survive a collapse of our dollar.

In a piece of fiction I want to use my imagination. This book goes into so much unnecessary detail I gave up on it before I was even half way through the book. If you need to know the brand, color combinations and number of squares someones plaid shirt has along with the number of buttons and their colors and whether or not they were buttoned then get this book.

I'm an avid reader, reading at least 4 or 5 books a month. I rarely, if ever, don't finish a book I start. However, I made it about a quarter of the way through this rag before I had to put it down. This book is good for use as fire starting material or for lining the bottom of your birdcage, but other than that it has no value whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasn't prepared for the insight provided by Mr. Rawles","review":"An absolutely superb book.

I like the constitutional amendments in the back and think we need a turn around in this country. I borrowed a copy from a friend, but will be purchasing my own copy soon so I can loan it out to my family. I disagree with the author's portrayal of a certain group of society as he not only questions their patriotism, and overall intelligence, but then makes a sorry attempt to smooth it over by a one time comment from one character who compliments the group. Other than that, The book is GREAT!! PS.. I am from Cedar City"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head for the Hills!","review":"A great \\"Armageddon\\" book as well as some very practical survival skill info. The sections on armament are only appealing to someone with military leanings and a lot of weapons knowledge. The chapters dealing with food, water, and issues of hyper/hypothermia are great. The chapters dealing with all-out military battles ala \\"Mad Max\\" scenarios, are unrealistic in view of current technology available to the powers that be. The section on preparing and cooking rat will definitely get your attention!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware, its not a novel","review":"this book came up as suggested reading after I had read William Fortschen's One Second After, so because I liked that, I gave this a try. Should've saved my money...First of all, there really isnt any story, the characters are so weak, so you cant call this a novel. Its so didactic, there isnt any build up of tension or excitement that would lead me to want to prepare for something, all it does is put me to sleep. The whole thing reads like : Oh, Jesus likes Swiss knives for skinning because they are the sharpest, and Joseph carries a revolver because that can easily be concealed, and Mary can transfuse blood and sew stitches in wounds\\" and proceeds to tell you in several excruciating pages how she does it.

And to have Mr. Rawles' work reviewed and commented on in a flattering manner by another top drawer author like Jerry Furland, \\"(Transfer: The end of the beginning\\"), is high praise indeed! Both \\"Patriots\\" and \\"Transfer\\" deliver engrossing tales that are hard to put down. Both authors see the future in a way that makes us want to pay closer attention to the current events we read and hear about every day. \\"Transfer\\" zeroes in on more of the technology that is in place or presently being developed that could make his fictional view of the future highly probable. Mr. Rawles and Mr. Furland, you guys do good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality book, entertaining and useful.","review":"I read \\"Patriots\\" and enjoyed it very much. In fact I enjoyed it so much I read it five times. It was well written and had some very valuable information on how to \\"take care of yourself and your family\\" should the need arise. Also, I found that I became good friends with the characters in the book. They had their acts together and even a certain wit about them at times. This book is an absolute must for those that are concerned about what the near future might hold for us. I can hardly wait for the next series of books by Author James Wesley Rawles."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much manual for me!","review":"I really wanted to \\"get into\\" this book, but I just couldn't. I was interested in the idea of the story, but it really is a survival manual disguised in a story. From the first few pages it starts to get a little dry because it is so cluttered with ridiculously detailed specs on each and every gun the characters own, each item the people coming to Idaho brings, and every item in the Idaho compound. It begins to distract the reader from the actual story line. I also was unaware that religion would play such a large role in the story. Religion isn't really my thing so I found myself rolling my eyes a little. Anytime something happens they pray and what exactly they prayed for would be described. Overall I was not impressed. Great concept, not well executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This would be interesting to middle school aged children, not a piece that looked as storylike but this was more of an entertainment piece and was sub-par at that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Detail and I Mean Lots and Lots and Lots....","review":"I read the first couple chapters of Patriots and was expecting great things. The more I read the more I was bogged down in the author's details. Everything was described to the extreme that it actually made my head hurt. After reading about six chapters I couldn't take it anymore. It is apparent that the author knows his stuff in relation to this type of survivalist book but he really goes into so much detail that reading is no longer fun. Your mileage may vary.

We can never be fully prepared for the atrocities that are being planned and are coming our way but we can sure as hell do what we can now to be ready for it with as much preparedness and strength it will take to survive it! Read the book it is chocked full of information, and awareness if you care to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"If possible I would give this book 4 1/2 stars. Patriots is an interesting mix of genres. It's part novel, part instructional manual, and part political manifesto. It's bound to stir emotions and opinions and at the very least it will generate discussion. It should appeal to fans of post-apocalyptic fiction and anyone with even a curiosity in survivalism. The overt Religiousness was a bit glaring but I was able to overlook it and found Patriots to be a highly entertaining and informative book. You'll be thinking about it long after finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Should Not Have Been A Fiction Novel","review":"The author should have written a non-fiction piece on survival skills. It is clear he is very knowledgeable on this topic. However, by putting it into the context of a fiction novel, it loses its purpose and its appeal. Unfortunately, the story line is so bland, boring, and frankly, poorly written, its hard to read it -- even though I'm a big fan of survivalblog.com and the author. I'd have prefered a simple tome on survival skills. The storyline just bogs everything down and its poorly done. There is useful information to be gleaned in this book -- but its hard to want to read through it to find it.Sorry, write another one and this time focus on what you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"This book is little more than a long list of things to take with you to the bunker when the end is nigh. To call it a novel or a story or a thriller or anything positive, would be fraudulent. Characters are laughable. The degree of paranoia expressed here is breath-taking. Even if you're a world class survivalist, you'll probably find this book over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book will keep you riveted to your seat. It also gives some good ideas on survival if governments breakdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Nonsense","review":"Don't waste your time with this book. It's on the bottom rung of survival fiction. Interesting tale, but very formulaic and predictable. Definitely not very realistic, but hey, it is fiction! Go read New Madrid Run, War Day, or Lucifer's Hammer instead. Don't waste the time or money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete piece of garbage","review":"I couldn't get past the first 30 pages of this crap. But, I did learn how to perform an impromptu blood transfusion, in mind-numbing detail. I wish I had my $15 back."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet","review":"James Wesley, Rawles is one of the best authors out there. He keeps updating this wonderful work of writting. This is a good starter book for those who dont know where to begin to stock supplies or anything else that is related about long term survival and the fall of the government.Can't wait for his new books to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in years...","review":"I have to be totally honest...I hated this book with a passion. I do a fair amount of reading and this is one of two books in the last twenty years that I literally hurled into the trash can. I was so offended by the author's obvious conceit and delusional superiority complex. The text was weighted down with never-ending details upon details about guns and survival techniques. The dialogue between characters was similar to watching an elementary school play. There's a story in here somewhere, but it was so buried beneath details and sociopathic opinions that I couldn't get past chapter two. This sucker went into the trash can. What a waste of paper and time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"I bought this book after reading the other reviews on this site. The first half moves along and was hard to put down. After that, it degenerates into a bizarre scenario where the \`\`Patriots'' in the title are fighting to keep the United Nations from conquering Northern Idaho.Other folks may have found the book a valuable textbook, but unless you need to know how to brew up grenades capacble of \`\`taking out'' Bradley Fighting Vehicles and other tools of the New World Order, it's not that great.The book was really silly. Try \`\`Alas, Babylon'' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian fiction","review":"Parts of this were quite good, and a lot of research went into it. For me however its was just too Christian to finish, if thats what you're into you will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and not recommended.","review":"I gave this book a second chance and re-read it.I can't say enough about how disappointed I was in this story.When a book makes me either laugh out loud in disgust and throw it on the floor, or slam it shut in disgust and throw it on the floor, it's something I won't be recommending anytime soon.I think it hit me the hardest when the group ambushed another group they felt was a threat, shooting them in their sleep and murdering them all, then kneeling and holding hands to pray. Are you kidding me?The writing is very poor. In fact the first several chapters didn't actually seem connected at all to the rest of the book. Nothing in the story timelines match up.So I guess if you want a story for the proverbial wet dream for preppers, with unlimited funds and resources at your disposal, and with a few survival tips right out of the US Army 1980s Survival manual thrown in, this book might be for you.Otherwise, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you are an extreme right wing Christian gun nut you will love this book.Not only is this poorly written, but you get the sense that the author really wants the collapse of civilization to occur, so his dreams can come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Story, Jr. High school grade writing skills","review":"Yes there is a story here and thats the redeeming part. Plus the plans and execution give one some solid \\"how to\\" ideas for your own preps. The big downer here is the basic lack of writing skills. They really dumb down the book and give it an ackward, oafish quality that it was written by a Jr. High student with limited writing, imagination, and vocabulary skills.So as long as you are reading it with low expectations of literary quality you will be fine. I'm not saying its not worth the read just that it is lacking in the level of quality that would make it a fine to excellant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ, EDUCATIONAL AND ENTERTAINING","review":"Downloaded to Kindle, read in one night. Just ordered a printed copy. I highly recommend. Even though it was written as entertainment it is very educational as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Can't Finish It...","review":"Like the other reviewers, I have found the timeline really screwed up (tried to ignore that) but I just can't seem to get past the brothers who have the shoot-out in NC. While I don't believe everything my government tells me, I certainly don't condone the behavior of these 2 characters. So far there is no story development and certainly no character development. If you want to read an excellent TEOTWAWKI novel, then spend your money and time on One Second After. Patriots just seems like a \\"how-to\\" on breaking the law and evading capture. I have ordered Surviors and am hoping for a better reading experience but don't hold out much hope if this is typical of Rawles' writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a story","review":"This is a very poorly written story. The characters are never developed and it is filled with huge lists and overly complex details. As readers we don't need to know what each person is carrying down to their pocket lint!Also, so many of the scenes were so unrealistic and unbelievable. I like being prepared and enjoy reading books about everything crashing down and by far this is the worst I have read yet. Save your money and find stuff on the Internet or pick another book, like one second after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patriot surviving the coming calapse","review":"Interesting but it had a bit too much religious content for my liking. It was a little dry in the delivery and I don't think it shows a true representation of the possible events that will occur due to a Christian perspective which tends to discount the darker less cheery side to reality and has a certain bias as to how other participants respond which is incorrect. At least it does relate the facts that our present economy cannot continue and that anarchy and/or a police state is soon to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worse book on the subject","review":"Having read more than a dozen books in the subject matter I can tell you this is the worse I have read fact or fiction . The caracters are not well developed , the story lines have multiple inconsistencies as pointed out in other reviiews and the amount of recommended \\"essentials\\" listed can very well put the preppers in the story well over the millions spent to survive Armageddon, Hard to believe given the fact that most of the caracters have professions and jobs that hardly qualifies them as wealthy. I recommend the book by Ferfal Aguirre instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was like twilight for conspiracy nuts","review":"This book read like the masturbatory fantasy of a mentally challenged militia member.It was also awkwardly and inconsistently edited which made it even more painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing... read 1 second after instead","review":"The writing is just horrible and I had a hard time getting past the first chapter. I'm cringing at each page and not sure I can finish it. It just seems so corny with all the overly frequent and lame references to various guns . The picture on the front cover should have been the clue as to the level of lameness inside. It seems as if a bi-polar meth-addict edited this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare for poor writing","review":"I think the editor must have been killed in the collapse, as he is nowhere to be found in this book. Seems very thrown together with almost no narritive flow.This book is great if you beleive the government is evil and planned 9/11, that the UN is planning on throwing conservative americans into concentration camps at the first oppurtunity, and that 10 guys with rifles can defeat entire mechanzied armies of raping, looting, dirty foreigners. Oh and it helps if you are a fundamentalist christian as this book was written by one obviously. About every paragraph contains them praying.Also large sections of the book are lists of what to buy, what to do, etc. Would have been much better as just a non fiction set of lists rather than the \\"novel\\" thats really just a hardcore-rightwing wetdream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many details!!!","review":"I think this book would have been much better if it had been cut in half. I skipped through as many as 5 or 6 pages at a time in some places and still didn't miss anything at all! The author over explains every weapon, battle, character, idea...the list goes on and on. This is the first review I have ever written, and I only did so because I don't think I've ever read anything as long winded as this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need a supply list","review":"Not too good. No plot just a detailed supply list. No character development or story. If looking for a \\"survive the government\\" supply list you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Scenario","review":"A good read once you get through the first third as the author sets up the story. Excellent attention to detail in a broad array of disciplines. The scary thing is that given our national government's out of control deficit spending and this country's economic condition, the collapse of our currency and risk of followed on vulnerabilities is not as far fetched as some may think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story with worst case scenerio.","review":"Well written story of possible collapse of our economy. Poor outlook and worst case scenerio. Didn't care about eating the dogs but otherwise good reference and \\"state of mind\\" to take in this event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully boring","review":"Ok, I was really hopeful about reading this book because it was recommended to me by a good friend. After reading for what seems like forever I keep waiting for something to happen that will keep my attention. I read some of the other reviews and realize that I am not alone in my opinion. There is no story line here and the dialogue is awful! I have to keep looking back to remind myself who is who because I can't really relate to any of the characters. It all seems very random. While I do agree the author seems to be very knowledgeable on the subject of 'prepping' but I've read many other books that I've gotten so much more info from and a better story to boot. I'm going to finish the book because I keep telling myself it will get better and I owe it the chance, however I am 2/3 of the way thru the book and don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. If my opinion changes upon completion of the book I will update my review accordingly but I wouldn't count on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its alright","review":"Ive read much worse books, but I am not sure the author has any idea about what he was writing. There is a story in their about a survivalist group. Except for the chapters where the author rambles on about communication gear or firearms. The book goes from story to laundry list, back to story and back to laundry list. There is a couple chapter story about two brothers stuck in the middle and they are never brought back up. Its totally out of place. That being said I did make it all the way through the book, but i was listening to it on Audio Book during my commute. Also the religious piece is a bit obnoxious. I dont believe in it or hate it, but at certain points he lays it on pretty heavy. Enough that i said \\"Oh My God\\" several times and I wasn't praying. If you have another option, read that one and leave this till you've read the second to last book after the apocalypse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must read!","review":"This book is sort of a wake-call. Anything can happen. No country lasts forever. Be prepared. Patriots is sort of like a survival manual in story format. I highly recommend it. In a country, and world that is not so stable. It is better to have, and not need. Than to need and not have. Most people only have about a weeks worth of food in their house. The grocery stores only have about 3 days supply. If it stops coming in the back, there is nothing to go out the front. If you are going through life with blinders on assuming that there will always be food on the store shelves you need to wake up. Were are you going to get water if it stops coming out of the faucet? You can live about 3 days without water, maybe a month without food. If you do have food, and water do you have the means to protect it. Survival of the fittest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"As I big fan of the collapse of civilization genre I had pretty high hopes for this book when I ordered it especially after seeing all the reviews that gave it a 5 star rating.However any hope I had for this book was pretty much dashed by the end of the second chapter and by the fifth chapter I had reached the conclusion that this was the worst book I'd ever read and possibly the worst book ever written. To call the characters undeveloped two dimensional carbon copies of each other would be an insult to two dimensionality. The book is northing more then the gun porn version of Penthouse Forum.The only thing I can say to anyone thinking of buying this book is save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of a 3 book series.","review":"Great book. One that you cannot put down. Hope he writes More!!!! I would recommend this book and his other two in this series to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to finish...","review":"The book would have been much better if the author would have added more story and less detail. If you added all the information about what the survivalists purchased, where they purchased it and what it cost it would most likley eliminate 2 chapters of the book that could have been used for more story!! There was a little helpful insight on some of the preps they had and made, but not enough to warrant me recommending that someone read this book. Im about 2/3rds complete and just trying to finish it so I can move to the next book on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I thought the story was great and the charactor development was superb. People complained about the religious aspect but it fits the charator of the people in the book and it didn't bother me at all. Not only will you get a good read but you will learn a lot about survival and tactics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I enjoyed reading Patriots so much I read it twice. The story is exciting and the knowledge provided is great. It started me thinking about the future and possibilities. With the economy in poor condition, Iran and Al-Qaeda threats of blowing us up, Korea testing nukes, EMP in the news, and Obama on a spending spree, the future seems pretty shaky. Some of the knowledge put forth in the book may be really useful in the future. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you do not like this book, you are doomed to fail.","review":"Mr. Rawles thinly disguises preparedness techniques in a fictional novel that is very, very good. For those who are looking for a superhero ending, look elsewhere. The storyline is a worst-case scenario, but it is better to be prepared for the worst, and pray for the best. If you want to take an \\"ostrich with it's head in the sand\\" approach to the world today and the forthcoming unrest, do so and be swept away. I, for one, will not. Thank you Mr. Rawles, I am a true fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Just Terrible","review":"This is quite simply the worse book I have ever read. It is poorly written, poorly conceived of, and a so utterly implausible as to be laughable. The author, a well known survivalist online, cleary fancies his protagonists in the story as true patriots, fighting against the injustice of an overbearing world government threatening to take away their \\"Freedom\\", whatever that means. But the real irony here is: these neo-conservative, evangelical, anti-government, quasi military heroes end up being lawless vigilantes, cold blooded killers who justify their killing in the name of freedom, and miss the fact that they have merely replaced the system with their own brand of oppression. I could go on and on about how silly it is--I mean the only liberal in the book is portrayed as a communist cannibal--but it aint worth the time. The author has some solid emergency preparedness information throughout the book, but this is just cynical, fanciful, apocalyptic porn. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think it can not happen here.","review":"As a retired banker, I am telling you to prepare, the governement is either clueless, corrupt, or stupid, probably all three. While this is a facteous story, it has great survival techniques, and will have you thinking about what if."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent plot but reads more like a checklist","review":"I rarely write reviews, but this book had me so annoyed I had to let people know. For some reason, this book seems to be popular amongst 'preppers'...and after reading it, I can't figure why that would be. This book has a decent enough plot, but the author seems to want the reader to know how much knowledge he has regarding survival equipment. This becomes ridiculous after the first couple chapters. People just don't talk like the characters in this book, I typed on my HP keyboard while looking at my HP LE1901w monitor. See how annoying that is? That is all throughout this book. If you want a good book that puts 'ordinary' people in a survival scenario - read One Second After - possibly even Lights Out (although not necessarily well written, it is a good plot).Stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BIG dose of reality!","review":"An absolutely awesome book! You could almost call it a survival handbbook. Excellent story line because it could all start tomorrow! If you had never thought about what a collapse of society would be like this would definately be close! Look at our gov't and say you can't see this already started! I highly recommend this literary masterpiece to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"I am the LEAST likely person to give up on a book but I had no problem doing so in the case of Patriots. The book was literally unreadable in every sense of the word and even halfway through I could find nothing in the story to interest me. This book was part of the first group of Kindle books I purchased and I felt literally no regrets in deleting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light on story, long on details","review":"This book is more of an encyclopedic approach to the nuts and bolts of setting up a retreat than anything else. The characters don't really matter accept to give the author the ability to use them to pitch survivalist products. However, I'm fine with that. I don't think he tried to pretend that he was writing an epic character study. He executed his intent with extreme detail.I gave it four stars because of his use of the Chevie Kehoe and Cheyne Kehoe shootout in Ohio as vehicles in the story. Those two were murderous thugs, not freedom fighters. His interpretation of the police actions (which really just displays his take on police action in general) and their response was embarrassing. If someone wants to be taken seriously on the topic of preparedness by a wide audience, they need to stay away from idealizing jerks like these guys. His use of them was the only significant downside to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good NOVEL about surviving the end of our complex society","review":"Good survivalist story about Christians who stockpile guns, ammunition and food, hide away in Idaho, and slaughter looters and the later totalitarian regime soldiers.This novel contains a huge amount of detail on weapons choices, caliber, brand and ammunition, and some details on ways to go off grid and survive without our complex society.If you want to learn how to survive when society deteriorates, but does not go away completely, read \\"The Modern Survival Manual: Surviving the Economic Collapse\\" by Fernando Ferfal Aguirre. Aguirre's information is from personal experience surviving the collapse of the Argentine economy in 2001, and is MUCH MORE applicable to what will likely occur in the USA in the next few years.Patriots is surprisingly well written, and chock full of information, but is really only relevant if you expect the end of the world as we know it, and not just a severe economic shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too churchy","review":"I found I knew a lot of the information presented in this book as someone fairly informed on survival practices in the first place.I learned a few new things about survival as well, however. The story is weak, as are the character creation and general narration. The information is interesting though. The thing that bugged me the most is the authors constant interjection of conservative christian beliefs and jargon. The militia in the book will let noone join their group that isn't a conservative christian, that seems very un-christian like to me. It just takes away from the rest of the book in my opinion, and gets annoying in it's repetition. Obviously this person is a survivalist and conservative christian first and a writer distant second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure conservative Christian Fantasy","review":"Not only do you need to be a good Christian to survive in the author's opinion, much of his firearm information is dated. I have a feeling this book was written sometime ago and only recently found a publisher. Very poorly written. Is this from a vanity press?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even better if you don't read the last 50 pages","review":"Pretty good read. The problem is the last part of the book where the \\"new\\" America is described. How unrealistic and naive considering that it is now 2010 and not 1810. The last bit almost ruins the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse","review":"Couldn't put it down! Real world advise in Novel form. Watch the news and get PREPARED."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sincere wish for those in search of a spine.....","review":"The message in this book is loud and very clear, freedom is not free. We will pay dearly for our complacency, avarice, greed, and selfishness in the future.From a preparedness and military operations point of view, this book is well founded in actual theory and concepts. I would recommend it to anyone who is having nagging doubts that 'all is well - just keep your eye on the ticker and everything will be just fine.To the scoffers and doubters, just remember this is exactly what civilians went through in the Civil War (carpet baggers et al.), and indeed what our founding fathers went through. The book clearly is issuing the challenge -- what kind of man are you? Would a real man not defend and provide the best way possible for his family?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star review","review":"I consider myself well rounded and conservative in my personal and political views. This book is the first and hopefully only ebook I had to return before finishing it (less than 20%). It was highly insulting and I was more than offended with the author's theme and his \\"tinhat\\" conspiracy agenda. After reading some background about the author and visiting his web page blog (?) I hope this is his last attempt at writing, or at the very least, I hope for his sake he keeps his day job. I gave it 1 star because that's as low as the ratings system will allow me to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Terrible","review":"There are a good number of excellent one-star reviews of this book that outline the plethora of reasons that this is one of the worst novels ever written, so I am not going to rehash those details. Suffice to say, I had to stop reading this book in disgust after only about 100 pages or so. Since that time, I have gained much more enjoyment from reading the one-star reviews here on amazon than I did while reading the actual book. You will find a large number of short, unsubstantive 4 and 5 star reviews here which don't really tell us much about why the book is good. You will also find a not-insignifigant number of very detailed, well-reasoned and analyzed 1 and 2 star reviews - this observation alone illuminates the true nature of this book very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible novel","review":"This is the most poorly written novel I have ever read. The author has no idea how to tell a story. What is worse, much of othe medical information presented is laughable. I am an orthopedic surgeon and I hope no one relies on the downright ludicrous descriptions of surgery. Makes me wonder what else he got wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"A chilling and thought provoking account of the coming collapse of society as we now know it. The author has remarkably included good information from good sources. It is refreshing to read for this reason alone. While I am an agnostic the references to religon are more than palpable and don't take away from the story. Rather they enhance the story and explain some of the motivations of the characters. Additionally the author refers to suppliers that exist and can be contacted if certain items refered to are of interest to the reader. All in all this is a good read that will keep your attention.

You say thank you and slide it under the table-at least until the appearance has ended.On the flight home I devoured Patriots-shortest six hour flight in history. You will want to hang on to this one-loan it out, but insist on it's return.To Mr. Rawles, I tip my hat. You Sir, spin a compelling and thought provoking tale. One of the best I have read in this genre.Jerry Furland, author of \\"Transfer-the end of the beginning...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, plenty of good information","review":"Enjoyed the book a great deal. Only complaint is that there is just too much christianity in it (IMHO anyways :) and I just can't see how the graphic descriptions of so many killings can get along with christianity the way it does in the book. I'd have to say the story is pretty realistic and generally good tho'. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"This book was a real stinker. The only entertaining passage in it was the \\"Commie Cannibals\\" and that was unintentional. I noticed many reviewers mentioned they got survival tips from this book. I suggest instead Rawles non-fiction bookHow to Survive the End of the World as We Know It: Tactics, Techniques, and Technologies for Uncertain Times. Judging from the negative reviews on his other two fiction novels, Rawles should stick to non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sovereign Citizen Propaganda","review":"This book is not fit to use for toilet paper. Characters are unbelievable, editing is horrible, plot is thin to say the least. This is nothing more than a thinly disguised book of propaganda for christian identity and sovereign citizens as well as other assorted extremists. While I am solidly conservative this veers farther to the right into pure lunacy. If you are one of these inadequate type personalities you will love this, but otherwise give it a pass and spend your money on better paper.

I had high hopes for this book -- I thought it would be another \\"One Second After\\" or \\"Alas, Babylon\\". It's not.While I appreciated some of the survival ideas and lists/inventories, the actual story (it is supposed to be a novel) is simply awful. Totally forgettable one-dimensional characters, laughably wooden dialogue, implausibly ridiculous plot, etc.Another reviewer mentioned that the author is working on a straightforward handbook. I would be interested in that. But, please, no more *novels*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent survivalist novel.","review":"This book, a novel of survival, is a fine companion boot to the more do-it-yourself oriented \\"How to survive the end of the world as we know it\\" by the same author.The novel is well written, abiet sometimes more detailed in the specifics of survival methodology that is necessary for the story line, However, it is chillingly plausible in both the events and direction that the country could be led if the national infrastructure was broken for any reason.The book is well worth the read, even if your optimism precludes the possiblity that disease, inflation, subtrafuge, or invasion could undermine the social,moral,technical or financial fabric of the nation to the point of non-functionality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Preparedness Guide!","review":"This preparedness guide is GREAT!If you're looking for character development you should look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a story that teaches you how to prepare and survive, look no further.

The detail was detailed but it did help in many ways to understand many things I had been reading on the web. The techie stuff on weapons and radios and miltary stuff was tuff for me. The American making people pay for their bad deeds and regaining the constitution was a plus for me....made me think of G Washington's vision. I would recommend this book for those who realize that the world is not a perfect place and America will suffer some loss because we forget what we ran from when this country started.....plus we just have ungrateful people who want power over their neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"This book is one of the best i have ever read, if you are interested in survival you will need to read this book its a real eyeopener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Patriots by James Wesley, Rawles (what sort of an idiot puts a comma in his name?) is one of the worst books I've ever read. The book is a thinly disguised collection of lists of \\"what to have when the big one hits\\" and the political ravings of the far right wing militia movement. Throw in lots of extreme fundamentalist Christianity, some hard core survivalist rhetoric, a time line that is internally and historically incorrect, and characters that come out of a poorly written comic book and you've got book that ought to win the prize for the worst novel of the milennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely worthless..","review":"Worst novel I have ever read.

Things other than the bible beating i didnt like were that it was set up as a group who had a good bit of money, and were able to tailor their entire life to being a survivalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored, Bored, Boring.","review":"This book may appeal to people who want to constantly read compiled lists of equipment for a survival situation.This is not a novel nor is it a mockumentary in print, it is an excellent sleeping pill.The characters(if you can call them that,they have no character at all!)are wooden and have one dimension. The story is one of tedious explanation and mind numbing detail.I will admit i survived only 56% of the kindle version before i capitulated and surrended up to the emeny!The are a lot of great post apocalyptic books out there, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't say enough bad things about it","review":"I'm not going into details as others have already done so here in 1STAR land (yes I know, there should be a NOSTAR rating.) Suffice it to say I've just burned this book in my fireplace fearing if I recycle it another might be subjected to the work of a completely talentless author. Characters & plot alike are stiff and lifeless as a 2x4. You'll notice the book is self-published, and granting there exist books rejected by publishers that merit publication, believe me this is not one of them. It has been rejected and deservedly so. So I advise caution. Try just reading a chapter or even a few paragraphs before purchase. It'll save you from getting burned like I and so many others did.

I really appreciate Rawles stage-setting which gives him the openings to explain tools, weapons and actions.

I think the book is even-handed, not full of polemics, not hysterical, but actually matter-of-fact.I have loaned out my copy and told friends to ignore the post-it notes which are my flags for re-reading parts which I deem are particularly educational.

But honestly, it struck me as something written by a 13 year old fascinated by low-budget 1980s post-apocalyptic movies.Rawles has some good solid knowledge of self-reliance, tactics, situational awareness, preparedness, and survival. He knows that stuff. He just doesn't know how to write fiction. He seems unable to construct a believable story or flesh out compelling characters.I'd happily read any non-fiction he wrote, but as a fiction writer, he has over-stepped his talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"A situational survival manual recognizing the importance of urban survival in conjunction with the \\"norm\\", wilderness survival. A great handbook for certain brands, tricks, tips, and sources. I recommend using a highlighter and keeping it in your library. The novel itself is written in a sort of junior high or high school type style.....and there is way too much \\"churchiness\\" for my taste. I don't like being witnessed to in my fiction, but of course, I haven't gotten off my butt to write a novel and do as I see fit....I give it four stars based on the info contained within, and keep the fifth star out based on the churchy factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many positive reviews ?","review":"I was curious, bought and read it.

And you wonder why people who are seeing this hypocripsy (Blackwater, anyone?) are leaving the church in droves? I have seen the TRUE ANTI-CHRIST: It is people like the author and his ilk.

The author clearly is an expert in survival and preparations, however there are some definite editing issues. There are many instances where the years given make no sense. They seem to jump around.

I first heard of Patriots before the reprint and was very interested. As soon as I opened the book I was hooked. I don't think I put the book down for two days. The detail that Rawles goes into in this book is incredible. The man really knows his stuff. Also the way that glossary is set up is wonderful.

I took pleasure in the message from this book. The bad reviews I read seemed to be from people that wanted to indulge in the plot and characters realism. I took the characters with a grain of salt and took note of all the tips and references in this book. If you believe that a collapse is possible then I recommend you use this book as you would a reference book. So many things I never thought of came to light in this book as I prepare for my future. Don't read this book for the thrill of a fictional detailed story. Read the book to discover the things you have not yet considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish the book because it's so boring","review":"I was hoping to read a good adventure story while learning about survival skills, but the story was just too boring.

Buy it now! You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and Engaging Story","review":"Before buying this book I read the author's survival blog quite a bit. I looked at both the good reviews and bad reviews for this book and noticed what bugs some people is the stuff I really like. For example the intricate detail given to the gear and weapons that each retreat member is using. The exact foot movement each member takes in a firefight or the detail given on the 5 1/4\\" plates welded together over the window to deflect incoming fire. This book reminds me a lot of the older books series \\"The Survivalist\\" by Jerry Ahern written in the 1980s. Overall its a fun book to read and I can't wait to finish it and read the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and informative novel","review":"Don't expect to read poetry with this novel, but if you want to learn a lot of extremely useful tactics and techniques for surviving in difficult times, read this book. I learned more from this book than any other book I have ever read. This book turned me on to James Rawles and now I am a daily reader of his website. He is EXTREMELY knowledgeable in a very wide variety of useful topics. On top of that, he loves America and the constitution, and is a good christian man with high morals. Exactly the type of person we need more of in America today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Post-Apocalyptic book available!","review":"\\"Patriots\\", is a more filled-out, detailed version of J.W., Rawles first work, \\"TEOTWAWKI\\" (The End Of The World As We Know It). I own one of his original, home-published copies- and this is much better than that early story. In short- it is the story of a small group of friends, struggling to maintain civilization and morality, in a world gone crazy.A very realistically portrayal of how things might occur in America, when \\"TSHTF\\", in the jargon of Rawlesean folk. Mr. Rawles is one of the few writers of survival manuals that actually knows what he writes about- living full-time at an off-grid ranch/farm, where he and his family and neighbors have a close to idellic existance.I highly reccomend this book- while not giving away the plot, it has many, many excellent survival hints, and could possibly save the life of someone you love- IF you have read and absorbed the details here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"I started reading this book, then quickly got up to get a pen and paper to take notes. This novel tells a good story, but is also full of tips and pointers that I wanted to write down. This book will get ya thinking about how fragile society really is. I give it 5 stars for its unputdownability (was up all night reading), and for its nuggets of useful information on how to prepare. As far as being a survival book, I think it's a good book that will lead you to other, more in depth books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dry and technical","review":"I was really excited to get this book, being a fan of post apocalyptic and zombie genres. the book starts out ok, but quickly turns into a technical read. The author spends more time explaining the technical or \\"how to\\" tasks that the characters do than actually developing the story and characters. It turns dry and become boring. If I want to learn how to dig a fighting position, I will read an Army manual. I am more than half way thru the book and just cant bring myself to finish it. It's that boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"Rawles is an excellent non-fiction writer and has a great blog/site...but this is a really awful novel, more like a weak attempt at stuffing prepping lists into novel form. The writing is stiff and awkward; remember how middle school kids read Shakespeare aloud in class?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Poorly written. Very little character development, with not much for story. A few moments of fireworks drama here and there. It seems the only thing he got right was all the firearms brands names and the tactical planning. Almost everything else was skipped over or he messed up the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lists and no charcters does no equal a good book","review":"I got this book and with all the positive reviews had high hopes. Less than 50 pages in I was banging my head against the wall so I forgot how to read but that didn't work. Writing a manual is one thing but disguising it as a novel is a sure recipe for nonsense. Pages upon pages of lists of gear, no character development and the most predictable close minded characters with NO CONFLICT makes me hate this book with a passion and I hope the author never writes again without taking a class or two on creative writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad I Couldn't Even Finish It","review":"If I could give this Zero stars I would. If you want someone's opinion on how to be a paramilitary person this book is for your, BUT don't even think you are going to be entertained. The characters are SO thin that you could compare them with a Comic Strip character. There is no plot other then the fact that the world is going to crap and there is a small group of people that just want to play soldier and this is really their dream that this is happening. I would compare the plot with a book that 5th graders read. The items he recommends, I am okay with... a little out there, but if that is your thing go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be 2 things at once, fails at both","review":"This book tries to be a novel and manual at the same time and fails at both.My problems with the book.10% of the text describes weapon specifications, it's just not interesting and doesn't add to the story.These people never run out of a vital item, they have bottomless cash to stock up. I would roughly estimate more than 60% of their income would have to be devoted to what they came up with. Also they never ran out of anything medical items or raw material for creating needed items, just happened to be on hand. The characters have no character or personality, when someone dies, you don't really care. Read \\"One Second After\\", by William R. Forstchen for a more realistic and story driven view of a modern PA event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Preparedness Novel","review":"Several reviewers have categorized this book as a survival manual put in novel format. There is some truth to this. It shares weaknesses common to many action-adventure novels in that there is little character development, growth or even individuality. This is not to say that there is none of these things, but the characters remain mostly two-dimensional, and the reader never really gets to know them. So, great literature it is not. But it is a satisfying read, and the author weaves in a lot of interesting information that could be of great help if society ever did melt down as happens in this novel. Certainly, everyone would benefit to giving some thought to personal planning for disasters, as everyone from local fire departments to FEMA unanimously recommend. I found the book a page-turner, and was sorry when I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL to read... this is a series of shopping lists connected by a few sentences of dialogue or \\"action.\\"","review":"This book DOES have some value... there are a lot of details in this book regarding weapons, tactics, survival methods, even cooking different food in a pinch.And herein lies the problem; it's NOTHING but endless lists, with a little bit of other stuff to liven the banality of these lists.The lists cover, in excruciating detail, every bloody thing they do- the steel shutters, the LP/OP, preps taken on the vehicles before they make a trip, etc.It seem to me that I'm reading a series of recommended shopping-lists, with a few lines of dialogue or character action to act as filler between the shopping lists.I kid you not, this is the worst, most painful book I have EVER read... Keep in mind, I read a LOT of books, mainly of a technical or research nature. And honestly, I'm more entertained reading a poorly-written doctoral dissertation, than this book.Don't waste your money on this P.O.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"The writing is at about high school level.

Currently reading Survivors which is another hit. Good author, great information, from someone with lots of experience. Looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"Patriots is a series of lists held together by a tired premise, boring characters, and a weak plot. If you want a diatribe on poorly thought-out economics which causes the world to crash, checklists of paranoid survival gear and strategies, and a catalogue of firearms unnecessarily made available to the US public then this is the book for you. I will not even touch the contradictory and oversimplified politics. All of this could be overlooked if the story was at all engaging but it is not even campy - I had to force myself to finish it due to stubborness."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I appreciate survival tactics and the idea behind this book. It just seemed amateurish to me. Way too much information. How/why does telling me the processor speed, amount of ram, hard drive space of a computer a character bought add to the story. Brands of boots, why someone bought one brand over the other... I know this was supposed to be based on modern day realities, but I think writing all of these details in fiction is unnecessary. Its a burden. The editor should have caught this. Without researching the author, it seems as though its a first book and the writer thought it necessary to include every single bit of information they came across in their research. Gun models are rambled off as it is supposed to be common knowledge. They are compared. Brand names of boots are mentioned when a character chooses one over the other. I dont need this information. I want an enjoyable survival story, not a fanatical extremist rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOPHMORIC DRIVEL","review":"I wanted to like this book but the charaters were so flat I couldn't tell any of them apart, There was some useful information which is why I gave it the second star .

It is a work of fiction and I found the characters to be unsympathetic. In other words, I did not care enough about the characters to continue to read of their experiences. Some aspects of the character profiles appeared to me to be more judgmental and \\"nut-job\\" than real people seeking to protect themselves from the tyranny of a collapsing society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and your money","review":"This book is just about the worst thing I have ever read. Unlike the other reviews say, it isn't even a good \\"how to\\" book. The first two chapters about the economic collapse are a good read, but the rest is terrible. To sum up the entire book, if you make $100,000 a year and are friends with a bunch of other people that do to, you can buy everything you need to sustain yourself for ten years. Oh, and don't forget to do the exact same thing that the military has been doing for years and you can survive the collapse of the American economy and government."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I'm surprised at how many great reviews this book received. It is one of the worst things I have ever read. There are some interesting tips but the story line and dialogue are awful.This is unrealistic (mostly), gun-nut fantasy land nonsense.

You need to read this with a notebook and pen so you can jot down notes for your own prepping.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the editing issues and problems with the story line. I think this occurred as the latest edition tried to bring updates to the book but forget to change other vital areas to bring the storyline into harmony.Overall though a great book and great read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters","review":"Thisis the first book that bought by this author. I found his writing skills lack-luster. There are no indepth characters and too many to keep track of. In addition, it always seems that a new character would appear at just the right time. Too predictive and not worth following the plot, if there is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat","review":"I was disappointed in Patriots and not worth the read or the cash. The first book 'Survivors' was generally a good book. Following up with 'Founders' was a great final for the two books. In fact, I enjoyed the turn at the end of Founders. However, to rename Survivors, change a few details, and call it a new book is sort of like repainting a car and changing the tires and saying its new. I quit reading Patriots after I started to recite the upcoming pages from Survivors. In fact, alot of the material just did not make sense like another person mentioned. I tell friends to read Survivors then Founders and just skip Patriots. I am afraid Rawles will rename Founders and change a few lines just to make money. He needs to concentrate on a new direction, maybe dive into the hispanic gang in detail or the farm family for an entire book. Don't rename a book and call it new."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it ...","review":"I really wanted to like this \\"novel\\".

I too enjoy for my guilty pleasure post-Apocalypse books. I read 10% of this book last night. I thought...no, it can't be this bad. So this morning I checked the reviews. Yup, it is that bad. These people definitely didn't come across as characters one could relate to but rather as \\"these are some scary nut jobs\\". I very seldom stop reading a book once I start.

I got to a point in the book where all the main characters should be known. Yet, a character would say something and I couldn't remember anything about that character. Also, this is the type of book you would get if you smashed a novel and an instruction manual together. Information is good, and a novel can be a great tool to share the information. But there is such a thing as information overload, which this book as plenty of. When in the book a character puts on his boots, that is good enough. You don't have to say that the character put on his Cabela's model #XYZ123 UPC#01121252514011 fall catalog page #287 retail $69.99 on sale $59.99 boots.

Who plays CD's anymore? Most of us want to place this on a digital player. Not that iTunes doesn't easily see or upload the files, but the producer of this CD has named the files on each of the discs the same code, so when you go to upload you spend hours renaming and filing so they will play in the right order. Each 30 to 40 seconds it is a new track with a repeated code so there are 99 on each CD. It is certainly not worth my time to upload the numerous tracks and do the renaming/filing so I can play it via my iPhone. They need to move into the current times! What a disappointment.

The characters are so underdeveloped that it was difficult to differentiate them while reading this book.

And I've got to warn you - it's really poorly written. I'm no writer, but I can tell when a hack who thinks he's more than that pushes something out before it's ready. It's almost like the writer is still in high school (or possibly just never went to college, or took any writing classes, or this is his/her first novel). Have you ever read a short story from a typical high school kid, with poorly developed characters, over-the-top descriptions, and almost no intrigue or plot. This is like that. A lot.If you want a very technical depiction of a bunch of people in Idaho, then you might like it okay. If you're a hard-core Christian ands like reading about similar types, you might like it okay. Otherwise, skip this book and go with something of literary quality, like World Made By Hand or The Road. Patriots is Not Good."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so manual, horrible novel.","review":"The author of the excellent survivalblog site should really stick to non-fiction. He's got a lot of useful tips and info to offer the world (which he generously gives away for free on the web), but I've seen teeth-jarring \\"Mary Sue\\" fanfic that shows more talent for storytelling than this \\"novel\\" does.I suspect a lot of reviewers are so blinded by the culture clash between the prepared and the ostrich set that they're inclined to give this book far more credit than it's due. But I'll say it here...just because you agree with a writer's political views (as I mostly do) doesn't mean you have to say he's a great novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeful - But Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this book based on reviews. However, after only 1/4 the way through, I am done. My gripe is that the author seemed conflicted between writing a novel and a non-fiction book. Thus, the inordinate amount of detail regarding how the characters prepped gets in the way of telling a good story. Above all - a novel should tell a GOOD STORY. It is as if it was written by someone with autism or other disorder that disconnects them from the details of human interaction. The mood of the story is flat, as if I was reading a technical manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patriots: Surviving The Coming Collapse","review":"I agree with a lot of the reviews that gave it 1-3 stars. Parts of the book were really good and other parts I just skipped over. It is classified as a novel but too much of it read like a survival manual. Too much detailed info on lists, guns, ammo, etc. If you are the Rambo type then you probably liked those parts.Too much Military lingo, sorry normal people don't speak in these terms. I do not have any desire to learn it either. Way too much religious stuff. Seemed to be saying if you have lots of guns, ammo, military tactics and pray every day then all will be fine.Many mistakes with dates and timelines. Although I appreciate the concepts, the overly religious and military stuff really turned me off. Who uses words like fornification? Maybe someone stuck in the 1800's. Hello, it's the 21st century.

Readers who have sought out this book because of its BDSM side will also be disappointed with this read.As someone who typically enjoys Suzanne Foresters books and enjoys the less \\"vanilla\\" type of read, I was disappointed on both aspects. This book did nothing to assuage either hunger. Most scenes built the tension but quickly changed chapters before the follow through. It became so predictable that I wouldn't allow myself to get caught up in the anticipation because I knew there would be no payoff. The constant let down was the only thing this book delivered. The ending was very weak and like the rest of the book ended before the payoff.

However, they definately need re-think their decision to start releasing titles in the Blu-ray format, as there's really nothing to add to the old video masters that make up most of their product.A Howling fan from way back, I knew this would most likely be pretty bad, but decided to take a slim chance anyway. Needless to say, it was the first time I've ever encountered a Blu-ray that wasn't at least marginally better than the DVD.I would suggest that one instead buy the widescreen Elite Entertainment disc of Howling III and the original (presumably out-of-print) Artisan double feature of Howling V and Howling VI.

However, if I sit in a chair that is not directly in front of a window or under a light, then the clock stops working. The clock also stops working if I accidentally put a sheet of paper on top of the solar power cell. When I take the paper off of the power cell or move back under a light, then the clock starts working again, but it picks up where it left off - e.g., if I had a paper on the power cell for 10 minutes, the clock falls behind 10 minutes. This clock created a lot of problems for me on my first day of using the clipboard.

When it arrived, the panel that absorbs light was loose and I had to manually put it back in place. Everything else is wobbly and the clip somethings fails to secure a sheet in place. Worst of all, the calculator function does not work. Something it does, but barely. You can only see the numbers for the calculator if you tilt the clipboard but even then it only shows fragments of each number. This product is definately not worth $15.

Not only does it make my work easier, it allows me to time things in an unobtrusive way, that most patients do not even notice. It also allows me to check the time without blatantly looking at my watch.

This makes my job so much easier, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has similar needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This product is very durable and has six different functions.

The main character definitely incarnates the whole Eros/Thanatos deal!The next to last chapter is quite upsetting to read, and I mean that in a positive way.

I would recommend this product for someone who is looking for an inexpensive moisture meter. It works well on dry wall and wood. The prongs can be a bit difficult to get into wood, but that is usually a sign that the wood is dry. It served its purpose and helped me find where the leak was coming from.

I had the drain fixed, but I wanted to be able to monitor for signs that the water was coming back through the cyder block. This moisture detector has worked excellently for my purposes.It isn't great in terms of giving you a quantitative measurement of how much water is in a certaing surface- depending how hard you push the prongs into the surface, the reading will change. But for getting an idea of how well your drainage system is working, it is hard to beat this detector for the value.

Instead of negative themes, such as Sherwood Anderson's chapter \\"Hands,\\" it relishes in the small town life of nice people. The author puts his heart into this work and you get a sense that he's proud of where he's from and thinks that others are being deprived by not telling the story of his wonderful upbringing. If you're from a town with happy memories, you can relate to this book.

This has only happened maybe 2 other times in my years of reading. I am 30 and an avid reader. Lake Wobegon was grating at my nerves from page 1. I could not get into it.

It stands some years later as something of a landmark in literary humor. There are few who can craft a story this funny and yet of this high a literary quality. True, the story in the book hops from place to place and seems disjointed at times, but I believe this is intentional.

It's just obscure and negligent, and for once, I wish it would be kept that way. The sum of this hundred page book is: inconclusive. It's a theory based on looking at a few flags and thinking to yourself \\"Hey, these are similar.\\" One of the ideas used to support the theory in this book is the lack of evidence in the formation of Switzerland, and then the large omission of time between that and the Swiss bankers infamous today. There is little concrete historical reality beyond a few fantasmic imaginations and a lack of true Templar scholarship. While I like to believe that some Templars survived the Inquisition, and God knows they did, there is no way, simply no way that a lack of evidence refutes and/or supports evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective ~ Enjoyable","review":"This music was designed specifically for Osho's Dynamic and Kundalini meditations.

A dance that never ends. To dance until the dancer is lost and only the dancing remains.Third track - the true beauty of this album. It is contemplative at a much slower tempo than his younger brothers. A sense of the ancient-most eternity can be gleamed from the feeling that pervades this piece.Fourth track - silence.

Use too-shiny a mousemat and the optical detector picks up false reflections and can make it think the mouse has moved a significant distance.

After studying piano at the university level, I finally got around to picking up a copy of his book. Reading through reminded me of the many exercises we went through. I think that Mr. Fink's suggestions on technique are of good resource for all serious pianists. As others have pointed out here, a literal interpretation of the illustrations is not the intended point. It is most useful to use the techniques illustrated as a guide and then adapt them to your own particular usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy approach to piano technique","review":"As a trained dancer, pianist, and teacher I have thoroughly appreciated Professor Fink's complete physical approach to piano technique. I have found it congruent with physical movement principles and especially applaud his emphasis on movement originating from the torso and the use of large muscle groups in sound production. As a teacher I have found it an exceedingly helpful guide for developing within students a thoughtful awareness of how their body \\"dances\\" at the piano in the creation of a musically beautiful and expressive performance. This book and video promote a healthy, whole body approach that is essential to long-term physical fitness at the piano. It is thoroughly worth the time and effort to study and master the principles laid out in Mastering Piano Technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the video","review":"I've owned the book for two years; I read well, and am a serious pianist. Yet I have not penetrated beyond the first quarter of the book. The author's prose is not tangled, nor troubled by academic jargon. It has, however, a creepily lobotomized quality. One feels as if one is translating each sentence into human speech as one reads: a tedious process. The content appears useful and trustworthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I found this book to be very comprehensive and helpful for refining technique at a more advanced level.

I have read Amanda Ashley before and enjoyed her books but not this one. The heroine is somewhat.....helpless/flaky in my opinion. It just seemed like she had no common sense at all! I mean the \\"twist\\" that the other reviews had, ehh, I was ok with it, it was really the romance, which made me gag at times, and the fact that the heroine seemed stupid. I mean, if you know you are being hunted, why on earth would you keep calling your family to check in and then show up there? Why not ask how the family member in the hosipital is doing? But no \\"OH I know I'm being hunted but I MUST go running to my family without knowing if they are ok and risk getting captured!\\" If you are thinking of buying this book, just say no!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad...and it just got worse","review":"Initially, the plot had so much potential - that was my initial disapointment.The characters (esp Kara) were just nutty - complained way too much. The two leads kept rehashing the same topics over and over till I finally put the book down right in the middle with no desire to finish it. The love scenes were also lacking in any real passion.The dialogue - in my opinion - was poorly written. Not mature, realistic phrases, but more contrived, juvenile, and tedious. This is the first Ashley book I've read. I do hope the others (if I ever pick up another one) are somewhat more intriguing in subject, character and dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing! :(","review":"I usually like these kind of romance novels, but although the descriptions were colorful, the heroine seemed to be contradicting herself at every turn. She was obsessed with religion. Now, I don't mind a bit of religion, in fact, I think it adds a nice tone to stories, but the Heroine had a preoccupation with her own religion (that I feel the author was trying to convert people with) that would not have allowed her to make many descisions later on. And, I know I won't tell the end, but that Vampire thing was the worst part because, well, it was just EXTREMELY disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, wonderful.

I felt cheated, you know. ashley had me totally fooled for the first few pages. i thought i was having a vampire cruise. i thought i was having a helluva time. i thought it was a good buy. i thought WRONG!!!! the sexy 'vampire' turned out to be an alien, and the rest of the story goes down the drain from that moment of unveiling. okay, there is such a thing as letting the reader have a bit of suspense, but there is also such a thing as cheating the reader into believing something so dumb!!! oh, i hate this book. when i discovered the hero was an ALIEN, i jumped up and down on my bed in disbelief, threw the book across the room and didn't bother to pick it up until after the next spring-cleaning day. my advice: when you see this book, forget it. you will thank me for saving your precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely lame","review":"This book was so bad, I had to finish reading it out of morbid curiosity - rather like watching a cheesy B grade movie. Other reviewers thought this book and their love was profound? I find that incredible! The characters were shallow, nondimensional. The dialogue was boring. The sex nearly put me to sleep. The bad guy was ridiculous. The only character I found interesting was the little girl who believed in monsters and read horror novels. I agree with other reviewers that the constant back and forth between devotion and pushing away got tedious, but then, the whole book was tedious.I guess what I am really annoyed with, is that this book contains no personality. Some of her basic concepts were good, like the whole alien thing, but the writing was so vanilla it almost seemed as if there was a deeper satire that I somehow couldn't quite catch.I surely will never waste my time reading anything by this author again. Even bad romance is more exciting than this slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trickery!","review":"It's one thing to surprise the reader with twists and turns, but to deliberately trick the reader... I was very annoyed. Everything in the first ten chapters is designed to lead the reader astray. Like Alexander's book The Dark Gift, there's no reason for it at all except to lead us to believe he's a vampire. Why else would this book be forgotten after the truth is revealed? And I found the notion that he frequented prostitutes unsavory behavior for a hero. I truly disliked this book. The writing was more than spare, it was immature for a seasoned writer. The motivations were severely lacking, the plot was thin once the prank was revealed. There may be plenty of vampire books out there but I would have been happier with this one if he actually had been a vampire. Reader beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing twist","review":"I was curious about \\"vampire romances\\" and picked up this book. After reading the synopsis on the back cover, I figured I was getting a vampire romance. The first few chapters were riveting, I was enthralled with Alexander, the vampire. You cannot imagine my disappointment when he turned out to be an alien. Yes, he was still sexy and entralling, but I wanted a vampire, not an alien. Had I known he was an alien, I would have not bought the book, and I felt cheated. The writing was not great, and I didn't really care for Kara. I haven't given up on Amanda Ashley (M. Baker) - I plan to pick up one of her her \\"real\\" vampire novels this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who thought this book was awful. I have read almost all of her books and really wanted something as good as her books normally are. The description of the story is misleading. i thought it was a vampire book. When I realized it was an alien book I was sorely disappointed. The story is tedious. And Kara is just so stupid. I know I'm being hunted lets go back home and have my lover save me so he can get captured and tormented. I couldn't even finish the book. It gave me some weird not so pleasant alien dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the twist!","review":"This story really intrigued me as it starts out making you think the hero Alexander Claybourne could be a vampire but he is not, he is an alien. I loved the book, it is one of my favorites of Ms. Ashley's. I truly loved the characters of Alexander and Kara and thought the story very well written. It is a definite keeper and will always have a place on my bookshelf as one of my favorite stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a bad taste in your mouth","review":"This book had to have had one of the worst so-called heroines that I've ever read. She was such a whiney little ditz that at times I found myself wanting to throw the book across the room in frustration and stop reading. But I kept struggling through to the end hoping that the alien vampire concept would win out and make this a worthwhile read. It didn't. Without revealing specifics all I can say is that there are plot holes galore, numerous convenient coincidental occurrences, uninspired sex scenes, and an absurd ending. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the????","review":"Awful...Just Awful. I'm all for a little magic and surprises are always good, but this was just plain stupid. I was really ticked off! The book looked alright, had potential, could have been alright...then BAM! JUST KIDDING! VAMPIRES ROMANCE? NO NO, WE REALLY MEANT SPACE ALIENS! What on Earth (no pun intended), I honestly had to back track and re-read a little way to make sure that I actually read it correctly! I forced myself to finish the book because I just knew that the man had to be lying, attempting to cover up his vampirism or something...ANYTHING!!! Anything else would have been okay. Very unrealistic, not only the plot, but the time it took them to fall in love, and well lets just say most of the book. My sincere appologies to Amanda Ashley, I'm sure she does great work, but seriously, Deeper Than the Night, was really lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Efficient--try the demo","review":"(...) Power Writer is a word processor and database. It does keep all of your information in one place. (weblinks, outlines, character diagrams, and Chapter/Act goals).

It is such a fabulous tool for tracking information and keeping your mind on the work, but it doesn't in any way tell you how to do your story or build your characters. You can choose to fill out notes on characters, but it is not a requirement to start writing.

So now I have a big black paper weight that I have to figure out how to return/replace. I hope this is just bad luck and the new one works for a lot longer than 30 days. Amazon, what gives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Plant Light","review":"I highly recommend this product. I just plugged it in and it did the rest. My plant now has a myraid of blooms. The moisture meter makes taking care of my plant easier. I plan to purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...","review":"Unlike another review, I had my plant light from Amazon within a few days. It has worked like a charm in the 2+ months that I have had it and I just love it. It is the perfect answer for my office which has no natural light...my plants are thriving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after less than 2 months","review":"Initially I asked Amazon for a replacement for this before I found out they were going to authorize my card for the amount of the product. They would then presumably cancel the authorization after they received the defective product. I don't make MY customers do this when a part is obviously bad and I don't appreciate it.This WAS a great light while it worked, but after 2 months it quit. Tapping the head sometimes gets the light to come back on, but pretty sure the ballast is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly Expensive","review":"I bought this light for an office without windows and liked it for a small plant. But, when the light bulb burned out in about a month I found that there is no generic replacement bulb and their replacement bulb is $12.95. You can only find the bulbs online so you have to factor in shipping, too. Do the math. You will spend enough in one year for replacement bulbs to make buying fresh flowers from the grocery store more convenient. I am junking it and getting out while I can. Expensive lesson in checking out replacement parts before buying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working Replacement Bulbs Unavailable!","review":"I bought this for my Venus fly traps at work. The light itself works great when you get it. However, eventually that bulb is going to burn out. Of course, the only people that make the correct light bulb are the vendor. You *can* purchase the vendor's light bulbs here. I bought 2- and while the bulbs were fine, the connection wasn't. The lamp can not supply enough power to the new 9 watt bulb to get it to work consistently. I saw the poor reviews on the replacement bulbs and ignored them because these bulbs were the only replacement bulbs available. Now, not only do I have to replace a lamp because the bulb burnt out- but I am out the money for the replacement bulbs too. I was lucky, my bulb lasted almost a year. Some people have bulbs that only last a few weeks. Good luck if you buy this. I would strongly recommend another product. In fact, I am searching for another brand of lamp right now. Myself, I will be paying more attention to these reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timer doesn't work","review":"I took a chance even after I read a review that said the timer didn't work on theirs either. The light stays on all the time. I think I have really just bought a glorified fluorescent light. I have only had it for one day, but my carnivorous plant seems to have responded. The adapter that plugs into the wall gets pretty hot. I am thinking I should have gotten one of the clip lights that cost $8-12 instead. I don't think its worth the $42 bucks. Maybe half that."},{"rating":"2","title":"grow light","review":"this grow light is great. set on a timer for different seasons and works great. I don't have to think about it. It even has a watering notification, which is a good reminder. It is small but good for little starters. I have been totally please with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think it's working","review":"I don't think the water indicator works; if taken out of the soil the \\"needs water\\" light comes on but when I leave it in the soil it NEVER comes on. I planted seeds and left them under the light for a month and got nothing. I'd return it but my 30 days are up. Amazon, can I still return this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved this product and I received it as a Christmas present. I would have rated it a 5. However I would have gone back and changed my rating because it is less than a year later and it is bot working! This is why I am rating this product as a 2. My mom paid nearly $40 dollars for this and less than a year later it is broken. It was great while it worked. But it's life span is disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resurrected my sad orchids","review":"I started my sad, dying orchid on this in early November 2010. It is now January 4th 2011 and my orchid is so happy, so green and looks to be sprouting 2-3 flower stems.It also worked wonders with 1 night (!!!) resurrecting my over-watered kangaroo paw. She went from droopy to standing up and firm.The only plant that I have not had luck with are my succulents (cacti). I do not know the plant names of my cacti but they have continued to droop and lose new leaves. I more blame this on myself than on the grow light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for displaying smaller flowering plants","review":"This little plant light is great for displaying flowering plants that are under one foot tall and not too wide. I grow my plants under larger lights and bring them into my living room to dispay them under this light when they are in full bloom. It could also do a good job of growing small to medium african violets and similar sized plants. But the built in timer is a nuisance, it resets every time there is even a brief power failure and the start time is always when power is restored; a conventional timer would be better. The water sensor is of limited use, but might be useful for inexperienced gardeners or those who tend to overwater plants. It has a tiny flashing light that tells you when to water, but this can be easily be overlooked and is unlikely to help those who forget to water plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable, inadequate","review":"I bought this lamp when I moved into a very dark NYC apartment. Several of my plants began to die do I purchased the lamp to provide my orchids (2) with additional light. The first one I received did not work at all so I sent it back. I received a replacement that did function. My orchids did okay under the lamp, but they did not flourish. One year later I moved to a much brighter apartment and within a week my orchids began to flourish again. The lamp only seemed to be just enough to keep them alive, but not growing or flowering. I decided to move the lamp to work since I no longer needed it at home. It worked fine for a couple of days, but not the light is struggling to stay on. I have had the lamp for maybe 7 months. I will see if a replacement bulb will help, but overall I have not been impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed, poor quality","review":"I love the idea of this product, it has all the features i wanted. but i have gone through three of these lights in less than five years, and they do not last. in fact, the one i just got (less than a week ago) only worked for one cycle, and now it won't come on, same as the other two. i called the support line, very nice and polite, but they said send it back and we'll replace if under warranty. given it's only been plugged in for three days this time (the other lasted 10 months, the one before about 3 years), i think i'll pass and find another product. too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I just received the item.

Do not buy this item, unless you want your house to burn down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"Light died after about 2 months. I smelled a burning smell upstairs and came down to my entire first floor smelling like burnt rubber. Worked just ok for the two months it functioned. The \\"water me\\" feature never worked. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work after changing the bulb twice","review":"I have replaced the florescent bulb twice after the original one quit working. I believe that the bulbs would work if the device that charges the florescent worked, but the light just flickers without turning on fully. I've now spent money twice to fix a problem that remains unresolved. So, the plant light worked great until the bulb went out. Then you might as well purchase a new light, otherwise good luck trying to get it fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonable lamp but no replacement bulbs","review":"Do not buy this lamp - bulbs are nigh impossible to find. The bulb lasted about 3 weeks for me and now can't find a replacement anywhere - not on Amazon, local hardware, local electrical store nor major DIY outlets. So its $$$ down the drain for the entire lamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"My wife and I are avid orchid growers, and find the 9W lamp perfect for displaying low-light plants (such as phalenopsis) that are in bloom. The colors are pleasant, and the plants seem to do well. We do not use the watering probes as we have our own watering schedules for the various plants, so I can't rate how well they work.We have owned six of these lights over the last five years, and all six have had their timers either fail to switch the light on, or fail to switch the light off. We also had an out-of-box failure that Amazon exchanged immediately. They last no more than about two years. I'm currently sitting with three dead PL-1 lamps next to me, and came here while searching the web looking for instructions on how to \\"hot wire\\" the circuit board so the bulb will just stay on. That way I could keep using them with a $4.95 mechanical timer.If they just had a bulb and a switch, they'd be perfect. Unfortunately, the \\"intelligent\\" electronics die quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great invention","review":"I could not keep a bonsai alive for more than 2 weeks. With this light I have been able to keep my bonsai alive for more than a month and it is flourishing. I love this item, especially the \\"time to water light\\". Thanks to a review I read, it is best to turn on in the AM because it goes the length of a day during the day. If the electric goes off, be sure to wait until AM to turn on. Also makes a unique accent to your room. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime addict","review":"Actually I finished watching all the episodes of Yu-yu hakusho when I was in the Philippines way back year 1997, however the agent of the television channel dubbed it too Filipino. It is maybe because the original language is in Japanese. So I guess this is the tactics of that television channel so that young viewers or teenagers will always visit their channel, which they succeeded. Not only Yu-yu hakusho did I truly finished watching all the episodes, but also Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z & GT, Lupin the 3rd, Baki the Grappler, Slum Dunk, Recca, Tri gun and Zenki.

However, there are some pretty dumb things......Good things:1. wonderful and beautifully done action2. really nice characters3. good comedy4. beautiful music5. good storyBad things:1. idiotic concepts: for instance, Toguro's thing about beging able to increase his strength by a certain percentage is the dumbest thing. Also, the outcomes of a couple of the fights leave stuff to be desired.2. some characters are idiotic: Yusuke is supposed to be the fearless hero right? Yet, he seems to get scared all the time when something bad happens and even when his friends are hurt, the fool hesitates! Kuwabara I can tolerate depsite the fact he is an incompetent idiot.

As a computer enthusiast, I was already familiar with most of the concepts which that exam covers, but wanted a refresher and something geared specifically for it. I was very disappointed.This book is overly basic; I have known everything in it for years. It does not at all reflect the relative depth of the A+ exam. If this is your only preparation for that exam, you will fail miserably. Only the bare fundamentals of hardware and OS's are discussed. Basic things are repeated ad naseum.If you have never looked inside your PC or read anything about PCs before, you might like the super-beginner level of this book - it will familiarize you with basic PC terms like \\"CPU\\" and \\"PCI.\\" If you're at all serious about PCs and/or the A+ exam, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer beauty","review":"Few bands make more moving music than this british band, fronted by one of the finest female voices around: Lucinda Drayton.

While most grunge bands would call each other sellouts if anyone offered the vaguest hint of melody, the Posies embraced melody with a Beatlesque fervor. This is my favorite album of theirs, with my favorite song, \\"Solar Sister\\". While local critics raved about \\"Dream All Day\\", it's \\"Flavor of the Month\\" that was the catchiest single of that year. \\"Definite Door\\" and \\"Burn & Shine\\" are also killer cuts. \\"Lights Out\\" jumps from a quiet acoustic strum with an \\"Are we there yet?\\" chorus to a piercing, feedback-drenched bridge and coda.

This is not great pop music by any stretch of the imagination. Dream All Day is good, but then you probably knew that back in 1993. Nothing else on the album approaches the strength of that one song. The tracks on FOTB are okay as background music, but there is nothing that amazes you in terms of melody, lyrics, or creativity. If you want to listen to an under-appreciated 90s artist, pick upIn Reverseby Matthew Sweet. Now that's some vastly underrated pop music right there. FOTB is average pop music for people without much of a sense of what great pop music is, but want to feel like they're cool because they like a band from Seattle that has been \\"criminally ignored\\" by people who actually like to listen to something worth their time. Don't buy the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete gem","review":"I am not going to be one of these people who will tell you that this album changed their life. I will, however, say that when I first heard this album, it did a pretty darn good job defining that point in my life. It's a great power pop/garage pop/catchy rock/whatever you want to call it record. It's intelligent, well written, and completely catchy. It's one of those records that seems to be impossible to get sick of, partly because it's so intelligent and partly because there's so much music to disect. Every time you listen to this album or read the lyrics I feel like you'll discover something new.Well, anyway, if you want a catchy rock album that will put you into a good mood without being overly loud, this is completely an album to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor quality","review":"As another review mentioned, these break easily. I have owned 3 now, and all three have broken after several weeks' usage. Functionally, it works great, is lightweight, and makes it so easy to carry hangers around the house, and keeps them untangled. I have some wire hangers that have a tighter fit, but the plastic tubular hangers, as pictured with the product, fit very easily on the holder.I am going to buy a wire holder elsewhere on Amazon; hopefully that will work better, and then I'll throw these plastic things out. As another reviewer said, they are not repairable. If I was handy, I'd try to make myself one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"As they say- you get what you pay for. My bad for expecting a cheap item to be actually functional and of decent quality. The product is terrible- flimsy, rickety and very cheap looking. It fits only plastic hangers properly and although the label said would also fit wooden hangers, it did not fit any of the wooden hangers I have. I returned it back to the Container Store. Sometimes an inexpensive product is just that- cheap and horrid vs. being a decent product at a bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy!

It was far less than I expected though. Very small, and poorly made. It wouldnt even stay together. I had to use plastic glue on it before I could even use it.

I did read the other bad reviews before ordering but since I could not find anything like these for a reasonable price , I decided to order any way.

These holders enable the user to keep unused hangers off of clothing rods thus reducing clutter. They are great in the laundry room and perfect for bedroom closets. If you hate unused hangers falling in your face as you search for an item of clothing, these hanger holders can be useful.While it has a handle of sorts, the construction is rather flimsy. If you are going to transport your hanger holders from one place to another, put a hand on the bottom of the device to ensure your hangers stay on the device and do not spill on the floor during transport.I purchased my hanger holders at Big Lots for two bucks each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Works like a charm. I love that I can organize my hangers in the manner that I need them. Very effective for doing clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Comedy Lovers...","review":"I like many kinds of movies, also silly comedies like \`Dumb & Dumber'. \`Four Rooms' is about as serious and about as funny as that one (except that it has less dirty jokes). It is very fun, I think. Obviously, some people don't like it, but if you don't mind silly comedies that are made only to be fun, with no deeper meaning, I think you will laugh a lot while you watch this movie. I laughed almost every minute. Tim Roth is overacting in a funny way and makes it without getting too annoying. The cast is impressing, but don't expect to see very much of the stars. Most of them have very small parts and quite few lines.If you don't expect this movie to be serious at all, I think you will be very entertained. But if you know you don't like that kind of movies, I guess you should avoid it. But if you don't mind watching a silly movie now and then, give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Tim Roth is brilliant in 'Four Rooms'. He plays a bellhop, just-to-a-perfect-extend overacting, who on New Year's Eve gets four very different assignments, one more sick than the other - in Four Rooms, by four different directors.The ultimate Room is the Penthouse, the last of these Four little films. In 'The Man From Hollywood' by Quentin Tarantino, thrill is combined with absolutely brilliant humour. And again, Tim Roth, though small his part and few his lines in this Room, is the STAR aming stars.An absolute must-see! A brilliant, hilarious and different film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"This weird movie tries hard for a kind of quirky (and obscene) humor, but it merely succeeds in being bizarre. An idiotic bell boy goes to four different rooms during the course of New Year's Eve and gets involved in four different, rather miserable situations (though those who are fond of bare breasts will enjoy the first act, in which a coven of witches seduces the bellboy.) The acting is mannerist and rather poor, and I can't say much else for this movie except that I'm sorry I wasted the time seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Unpredictable","review":"This movie is like several movies in one. It is very Pulp Fiction-esque with unattached thoughts and wandering conversations. I believe the last \\"skit\\" is even written by Quentin Terrintino. Madonna,Antonio Banderras,and Bruce Willis all make guest appearances. You will be happy you saw this when you are through."},{"rating":"1","title":"dv that doesnt work","review":"the dvd didn't work and returning it couldn't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightest"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 98 minutes of your life or $11.24","review":"FOUR ROOMS was the single worst movie I ever attempted to watch, turning it off before the end of the second \\"room\\".

I should have heeded the Amazon Editorial Reviewer and saved time, money, and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather keep your good money","review":"The more this Tarantino guy attempts to be sophisticated, the worse he fails. This inexplicably overrated, clumsy effort is even worse than Pulp Fiction. Packed with violence and poor taste, it sticks out like a sore thumb for its total lack of talent, humour, ideas. The film equivalent of a crapburger with 200 chili peppers (expired, too), it lets the amazingly childish ego of its director transpire from its every pore. And I don't tolerate such yobbo in my private living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting space on my DVD shelf...","review":"I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother, Unless you are a QT Fan","review":"I am not a Tarantino fan and thusly did not like this movie.

Unless you like Tarantino's other films I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"jackschlatter@yahoo.com","review":"What pile of total garbage...The writers used the 'F' word for half the script..How nice to see a young 10 year old girl utter words that would have gotten her mouth washed out with soap..Total nonsensed from a bunch of directors who have championed senseless violence...My idea of hell for these jerks would be to sentence them to the type of world they are trying to create..A bunch of prepuresent puke....I have never spoken to the former friend who foisted this film onto me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"QT IS A DRAG","review":"It's sad, but if you look at it, Tarentino was a big spike of hype because NOTHING ELSE was happening. This guy made a career by ripping off and disecting finer films and he still sucks. THE WORST, being his own, ugly cameo roles, which slow movies to absolute halts. His sickening, saddening ego must be vanquished, so that actual, cool and less pathetically juvenile films can be made again. Good hair implants though, DUDE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SURPRISING DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Lawrence Benders' surreal comedy is split into four sequences, linked by bell boy, Tim Roth as he goes through each room, dealing with off the wall customers. Its all a bit of a hit and miss affair. Ambitious and seemingly desperate to plumb new depths, it often fails with many scenees falling flat. This is all the more surprising when it has such an impressive and talented cast which includes Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Quentin Tarentino, David Proval and Amanda De Cadanet. The whole thing holds a few laughs along the way but on the whole its only very moderatley enjoyable. See it only if curiosity gets the better of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have problems.....plural.","review":"Look this movie is a great, fun little film PERIOD. Tim Roth steals the show from a huge cast,strutting all the way. Just know that this film is 4 different stories with nothing in common but poor Ted the Bellboy. Roth is hilarious as he tries to get through New Year's eve without getting shot, stabbed, or thrown out a window.(oh yeah he did get stabbed didn't he?) Antonio, David Proval, Tarantino, and an uncredited and stoned Bruce Willis take the unusual walk to the funny side and thrive.(especially antonio) Trust me rent this film and you will wish you would have bought it. The best in short attention span film and a MUST HAVE for Tarantino/Rodriquez followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Low Blow from Tarantino","review":"Being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino I decided to rent Four Rooms the other night. Little did I realize, I would be wasting a good hour and a half of my life. I knew right away it was not going to be half as good as his other work, but my main expectation was to see my favorite actress, Marisa Tomei, in the film. I kinda figured she would be in the movie a bit longer since she was placed on the cover in a blonde wig, but that was just a \\"low blow from Tarantino\\". Marisa shows up for a grand three minutes. You can't fully blame Tarantino for this movie, because 3 other directors helped him to make this movie. Basically I was expecting much more, but I realized it was just a series of one-acts and should only be appreciated as that. The acting is good, but its just simply bizarre, and leaves you wanting more (Marisa Tomei)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is really funny and worth watching","review":"this movie is one of the funniest movies i've seen if you havent seen it its worth watching and very entertaining it stars tim roth (who was great in reservoir dogs) as a crazy whack job bell boy on his first day it deals with 4 rooms and there stories behind them it has a great script with very original and extremely witty dialogue Quentin Tarentino (the master of ultra violent witty satire along with great directing) plays a funny role is this as also antonio bandarez does as a crazy father trying to get his children to behave it turns into real mayhem and chaos as tim roth's jobs turn into bloody,chaotic, and just plain hillarious this movie may seem expensive to buy but when you splurge for it you'll see where your money went (laughed so hard i almost pee'd my pants)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One room only, please","review":"I bought this film specifically for the Robert Rodriguez segment. For me it was the only amusing one. The music by Esquivel was too busy, intrusive and tiresome. I'v begun to hate \\"clever\\" animated opening credits...unless they are truly clever.

This trashy, quickie film seems so slapped together and an otherwise excellent cast is left standing around, wincing and praying for script approval next time. But, wait, WAS there a script? We get Antonio Banderas, Madonna, Tim Roth, and Kathy Griffen standing around and saying lines that they seem to saying for the first time ever. This film is just embarrasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO YOU LIKE COMEDY? SO THIS Isn't the movie for you!","review":"There's no comedy here. Fooled by a great cast, people went to see this garbage (or rent it), and got perpleexed by Roth's horrible acting, trying to vote which of the four episodes is the worst of them. By the way, has anyone seen Tarantino around these days...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, this one's a real \\"indie\\"....*sarcasm*","review":"This pathetic excuse for a movie is not an independent film. Only an unexperienced and incredibly stupid moviegoer would mistake for an independent production. It's released by Miramax, who have become a major studio, and that's the only even slighlty indie thing about. At an hour and a half, it's still a stupid bloated mess. The third segment is worth watching for the puke, but Rodriguez' fast approach to filmmaking has never seemed more whorish. The fourth is worthwhile because of Tarantion's occasionally funny script, but even the great QT couldn't keep this mess afloat. Alison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell completely screwed themselves with their terrible segments. While QT and Rodriguez came out of this cinematic Vietnam somewhat unscathed, Anders and Rockwell never recovered. Utter shit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please for the love of Christ don't watch this movie!","review":"I'm not usually one to be critical of a thing and not back it with balanced insightful information, but I wasted enough of my life with this movie to go that deep.

Instead of trying to distract you with usless 3D characters and HD backgrounds, Fours Rooms uses script development, formidable acting and the lost art actually having a plot to deliver this rollercoaster ride of entertainment. With some really outstanding performances from this truely All-Star cast and showcasing the directorial talents of Allison Anders, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Alexandre Rockwell, Four Rooms is a light hearted, tounge-in-cheek picture that doesn't take itself too seriously.

This is by far the best story of the group. The kids are terrific actors; the absurdity of the final scenes is not to be missed. The final story is in a distant second place for me. The other two vignettes are awful, especially the first one. I agree with the person who said it's just an excuse to have a few beautiful actresses show their naked breasts. Tim Roth makes a bad imitation of PeeWee Herman throughout the movie, but his antics are more moderate in the last two stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is a great, typical Quentin Tarantino movie.

They sent me a new camera within 3 weeks and I sent the bad one back. Low and behold 3 months later the new one they sent me HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!!!! This time they have told me their process has changed and I have to send in the bad one first before they will send me a new one. The whole process will take about 6-8 weeks they have said. I'll almost be out of warranty by that time and it'll probably just break again....arg!!! You'd be better off buying a throw away camera....DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happy Camper (figuratively speaking)","review":"Had it for about a month.

One area of the bits didn't even record picture information, resulting in a white spot in my picture. Even when used as a web cam, the camera has fuzzy, speckled video feed. When I contacted AGFA about it, they gave me a long distance number to New Jersey (I am in WI), and told me repairs would be charged to my credit card!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Don't waste your money\\" Vote","review":"I bought this camera while shopping for a web cam, I decided to buy this camera because it would also \\"Travel\\". It quit taking pictures after 1 trip outdoors, it just makes little chirping sounds now when you push the buttons, this camera apparently doesn't like to go outside. I could get my money back or a replacement but don't want to bother. It still works ok as a web cam, I guess I'll just use it for that. The few times I did take still photo's the resolution is very poor and the colors were washed out badly. I shouldn't complain cause when I bought the cam I think it was mispriced at a national office supply chain, I bought it for less than half the price I've seen it for anywhere. I just look at it like I have a fairly good value in a web cam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agfa Cl20","review":"Recently purchased an Agfa CL20 which looks exactly the same as a CL18 but features a Compactflash disk. This camera was inexpensive and simple to operate and download. In June I went to Europe and took about 350 pictures most of which came out very good....why?...because I know how to take a picture and more importantly learned how to use this camera....it is that simple, and might I remind some critics that cameras don't suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality camera","review":"I didn't expect an excellent camera for this price, but just wanted to be able to take pictures and upload it to the Internet. It messes up colors, and you can't get a really close shot of your object. Also it takes too long to take a picture, I had to keep it still for at least 10 sec., so the pictures won't come out blurry. Overall I think this camera is not worth its price. I'd rather wait a few months and get a better quality camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Better Than A Toy!","review":"Unfortuantly this camera is a real dud. I don't know where all the positive praise is coming from.The big problem is one must hold the camera absolutely still when taking a picture - and if the subject is moving at all, forget it!It is almost impossible to take a picture without using a tripod without getting some blur.Add another $100 or so and get a camera that is actually usable to take pictures.Maybe buy this thing for the kids (if it gets cheap enough), otherwise pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Did Not Work","review":"I bought this camera used. It arrived in just a few days and was packed well. I have been unable to get it to work. I went to AGFA's website and downloaded their newest driver for this model. It still did not work. The camera indicates I have taken pictures, but I cannot get them to download to my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I got this camera for myself for Christmas and I must say the $140 I paid for it was DEFINITELY too much. The photo quality is poor as a webcam. There is barely any detail. As far as using it as a digital cam, it projects too much of a contrast and really focuses on shadows. The quality is just poor. I was too happy to replace it when I got the money. If you are taking pictures of things such as scenery outside, then it is ok. As far as people, no. It makes everything look terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting a 2MB smart media card -- shame on me for not reading very carefully -- the real bummer is that this ONLY transfers via USB -- it's fine for my desktop, but not for my laptop. It may take nice photos - but if I can't get them out of the camera it's of no use. Seems silly not to have added a serial interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible camera!!!","review":"This camera is terrible!!! I received it as a gift, luckily I didn't waste my money! The picture quality is extremely poor, battery life sucks, flash is useless and it takes to ... long to take a second picture. I had to take 100 pictures of the same thing in order to get a few decent pictures, and nothing fantastic. It takes nice outside pictures, but inside is diffiuclt to take nice shots. I've spent about as much money on batteries as the price of the camera!!! The software is decent, and the camera bag convenient. Another problem is that it doesn't have a lense cover. The lense gets dirty quickly, and if you forget to clean it, it's super blurry, on top of how already blurry it is just by its mere nature. Anything that isn't perfectly still comes out a mess. This is probably one of the worst digital cameras out there, I do not recommend it at all. spend a bit more and get something better! I agree with the negative reviews! Be wary!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's in the classroom","review":"Hi, I'm using this textbook in a classroom with some Grade 10 students, and to teach myself Flash as well. I find the book good over all, but some of the exercises have been difficult.The instructions don't work as written sometimes, and I have to 'feel around' the program to figure out what I'm supposed to do to get the expected result. I'm not sure if that's because I'm not understanding things clearly, or if I have a slightly different version of Flash. The book is for Flash MX 2004 and I have Flash MX 2004 professional. I don't know if that would make a difference. The book is a comprehensive introduction broken into manageable lessons. The kids find the exercises fairly manageable, but the lessons in between the exercises are written at a bit of a high reading level for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you get it from the local Library for free","review":"Useful book, but not ereror checked thoroughly and not consistent and clear in its presentation.

The book is based on the correspondence between Victoria, her mother Queen Victoria and her family over 40 years. I was interested in the royal diplomacy and Bismarck's role in Germany in the 19th century. It is a sad account of an English Princess who, reared by parents with ambitions for a democratic Germany, was not able to adjust to the Prussian court. The role of Bismarck is fairly well covered in the book not only from the point of view of the royals. I enjoyed the book very much; it seems to me to be an honest, unflattering account of all the participants. It is a serious book without frills, gossipy or juicy bits. Enjoy it and be thankful to live in the 21st century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful just to WATCH !!

The Complete Protein Diet has a fairly good taste when you first take a sip, but holy jeebus, the aftertaste. I have no idea how to describe it, besides it tasting like chemicals and cheap flavoring. Plastic-y like taste, that I have to make myself swallow.It also has a pudding like texture, except it's still kind of gritty. I was very disappointed in it. It has absolutely wonderful nutrients, and the kind of proteins I was looking for. But the cons outway the pros.Take a look at the Pro Complex (not the natural, no idea about it's taste).

What I LOVE it for is roller printing on sterling and copper. I stack it with thinner gauge sheet metals (24 gauge and thinner) and patterned paper textures. That thin layer of foams acts kind of like a pusher for the metal and helps me get a better, deeper impression from paper patterns. I prefer it over paper towels or cut up pieces of manila folders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh","review":"Double edged sword: Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent book for facts!

I thought that I knew Joséphine de Beauharnais. I grew up thinking that she was this great beauty who was flawless in every way, I find that she was someone who had a greater depth to her than just a courtier with great connections. She was born in Martinique to a father with mounting debts and marriage to a man who was killed in the Reign of Terror. I found out that like me, she suffered from migraines, that she and Napoleon didn't have a mutual love affair. Not only that but through her grandchildren the royalty of Sweden is still connected to her even today. This biography revealed that Josephine was not physically beautiful to some but she had the grace and style that made her the talk of France, from Bourbon rule to the end of Imperial France. She is still an icon of an age and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empress of the French","review":"This is the third book I've read by Carolly Erickson and I have not once been disappointed. Miss Erickson successfully brings history to life in each of her books, this time taking on the tumultuous life of Josephine, future wife of Bonaparte and Empress of France. From the beginning you realize how many harrowing events Josephine went through, sometimes emerging a stronger person, sometimes not. Despite all that, she was devoted to her children and extended family, never forgetting where she came from and what she wished to achieve for them after she had gone. Remaining popular with the people up until her death, Josephine always expressed kindness and generosity to all she met, despite station, friend or foe.

She shares her feelings and behaviors with all their warts -- so that I got frustrated with her frustration. I was so sad the Meseta was depressing to her and that she couldn't sense the beauty of the place. Also sad that she so took for granted her companion. Somehow, though, it all made sense by the end (no spoiler here), which made it a worthwhile read. A true happy ending! What makes the book rewarding ultimately is her very honesty. I'm glad she didn't hide her feelings, but just wish she'd been a little more even-tempered as a author/guide/companion as I \\"walked\\" the Camino with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Insight in Grief, God and the Camino","review":"I was looking for personal insight into how a pilgrim experiences the camino and the author provided it. It's a very interesting and personal story about her walk on the camino and in life. She deals with the grief of both her father's death, the grief over a lifelong bad relationship with her father and her mixed relationship with God. She writes with humor and clarity. I really ended up liking both Kerry and Alex and wish them very well in their journey together.

The big problem was that about 6 weeks into using this, one of the nobs fell off. That didn't bother me so much because I could still turn it with the metal ring that the nob used to be attached to, but a day or two later, that ring came unhinged, and the hotplate was permanently set to on.

But those words just don't add up to a great story. The story is too unrealistic. I don't care for the hero or the heroine. The hero was too much of a casanova type for me and its hard to find a man who wears powder/rouge/heels attractive. I know during that time period this was in fashion, but, the very detailed descriptions displayed the hero more feminine than masculine! It didn't help when his enemy tried to kiss him! Now the heroine is too bitter throughout the entire book. She hates men b/c of how her marriage turned out. She takes her anger out on the hero all the time. Throughout she's always seeking to hurt his feelings when he never does anything to provoke her, aside from the bet which he doesn't even go through with. The scarce sex scenes are awful. The first is done in a completely dark room where they can't even see each other and they are over in a few sentences.

I only put it down because I had to sleep and it almost broke my heart to have to put it down. I got so swept up in this one, I felt emotions I haven't felt in a LONG TIME! I feel like this book took all my romantic yearnings, even ones I didn't know I had, and put them all on paper. It wrote of what I've secretly considered, the ideal romance. This is the perfect book for the good girls who always like the bad boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first half, disappointing second half","review":"I loved the premise of this book, and the first half of the novel fulfilled its promise: well-written, vivid, and very sensual. Unfortunately, the second half brought in a lot of unnecessary and uninteresting plot elements. A romance doesn't need tons of plot: the idea of the seduction could have carried the entire book.I notice that several readers disliked the hero's \\"feminine\\" lacy handkerchiefs and so forth. That didn't bother me at all. It's a historical novel, and different time periods have different ideas about masculinity. He was quite masculine enough for me, lace and all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both Fantastic and Disapointing","review":"Actually, I give this four and a half stars. I could not give it five for the following reason: once the actual intimacy happens, it was lacking. It made me wonder how Alden could be considered a great lover. The seduction was fantastic. It makes you look forward to when they actually make love. When that happens, it is a let down. But, besides this flaw, the book is hard to put down. Both main characters are very well developed.

The plot is almost identical to the original \\"Bring It On\\" but characters portrayed less fully and the cinematic quality much lower. My roomate and I fast-forwarded through the slow and painful dialogue to the cheer scenes, but poor film quality hurt the impact of amazing choreography in the cheer sequences.

I was very happy with the Epson printer I use to have. The only reason I bought this printer vs. Epson is because it had Fax as one of the options.Canon gave me the option to have the printer replaced with a refurbish one or have it serviced at one of their authorize dealers.

Of course, during the honeymoon, you're still in love. One weekend I decided to do my taxes, and anticipating a lot of printing/copying to be done, I bought an extra cartridge of black ink. When i started to print (black & white, not color), the magenta ink ran out, and the printer stopped printing B&W.; In case you missed it - IT WONT PRINT B&W; IF EVEN ONE OF THE COLOR INKs RUNS OUT !This strikes me as being incredibly un-consumer friendly, and plain dishonest on Canon's part. I will not buy another Canon product. Also needless to say, any inks I buy for this printer will not be from Canon either. Meanwhile, its 7:00 pm on Sunday, the stores are closed, and I can't print. Thank you Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-in-one","review":"I've had this product for about 2 years now. It is a great all around office machine. The scans and copies are clear and crisp. Printing in color is sharp. Photo printing is great. I think this can be adjusted. I use third party ink which is cost effective. The only issue is there seems to be smudges on the underside of the scan window. It doesn't seem to effect scans but I would like to figure out how to disassemble and clean it. Its interesting to note that this model was discontinued by Canon about a month after I bought it.If you are looking for an all-in-one, I would recommend a Canon Pixma. It works so well that I bought one for my office in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink problems","review":"This printer worked well for a month and then started its fits.

On to a Brother multifunction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality printer","review":"This printer begun to fall apart after about 300 pages of copying. Of course, that was right after the warranty expired. First, one of the feeds broke, then the ink measurement quit working, then couldn't change the image quality setting off of photo, photo copying changed all pink tones to salmon, paper started coming out with one corner turned down, etc. etc. The only good thing was the Canon rep really tried to help.

It's the copy and fax where the problem lies. If the printer hasn't been used for awhile and you select copy or fax you get a warming up message. Then you get to wait and wait and wait and wait.

It is very quick in warming up and relatively quite operation. Print quality is good too, rivaling lasers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this model if you do a lot of scanning","review":"I am thinking of returning my unit, here is why. The scanner is very slow. My old Canon MP 730 scanned about 3 times faster. I scan a lot of documents to PDF. I called Canon tech support and they were very nice but could not help me improve the scanner speed. The tech support rep did confirm that the MP780 was slower than the older MP 730. Canon really went backwards by having their new model be about 3 times slower than their previous model. I was hoping thr MP 780 would be a better version of the MP 730 but it is not. Someone at Canon made a very poor decision regarding the scanner for the MP 780."},{"rating":"2","title":"MP780 is nice but ....","review":"The MP780 is a good solid machine and an improvment in print quality over their earlier multifunction machines. I also like the flatbed scanner in conjunction with the sheet feeder. However, Canon did not include the best feature of past machines - computer based programming. The MP780 has to be programmed on the machine itself, not an easy task given the small keys, multiple tasks, and limited visual feedback. The biggest disappointment is not being able to review the received faxes before printing and deleating spam. Canon has the technology - why didn't they give us that option?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon MP780 Review","review":"We simply love this thing. We had been looking for a all-in-one for a long time. Late last year, we settled on the Canon MP730, only to find out that it had been taken out of production. Then we saw pictures and stats for the MP780 on Canon's website. Well, after several months of waiting (due to production issues I believe), we finally got ours a few weeks ago. It is amazing in every way. First, it really looks neat. Like another reviewer mentioned, the automatic door for the paper is kind of neat (I just wish it would close when the printer goes into sleep). Scanning and printing quality is fantastic. The document feeder is a godsend (nice for scanning stacks of documents). And to top it all off, the machine really feels solid. Not like some of those creaky models by other manufacturers. I really recommend this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Smooth for the cost","review":"I was the proud owner of a Canon Multipass F50 but I retired it to move up to the MP780. So far a good decision. Though not as fancy wancy as comparative HP models the individual inkjet cartridges is reason enough to go with this model. Picture printing is outstanding and compared to my F50 it is as quiet as a church mouse. The style is very cool and matches my decor perfectly. Overall the MP780 is a good solid multi-machine at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Printer, so-so scanner","review":"I bought this printer to replace an Epson CX5400 that died before it's time. I absolutely LOVE the quality of the printouts - crisp, clear, A+. It is also remarkably quiet. The scanner quality is less than stellar - the Epson was much nicer. Scans are too light so I have to copy everything first, darken and then scan - a waste of time when scanning receipts for business. Still, would make the same ourchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"I received my all-in-one and discovered the multipage automatic feeder did not work in either the copy or fax modes. I called Canon and the only solution they offered was to replace the unit with one that had been refurbished. Not exactly what I expected considering I purchased a new one. With this in mind, I would stay away from Canon products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you use a MAC","review":"I purchased this printer because of its compatibility with the Mac OS. Don't make the same mistake as I did - if you are planning on printing wirelessly through the airport extreme base (which I wanted to do), airport does NOT recognize this printer and it won't work through the base. An expensive mistake for me as I am now saddled with a unusable brand new printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this printer because I couldn't get a machine that was just a printer without all the bells and whistles that I don't need. It was a canon as was my old S600 workhorse but this is a piece of garbage and a lemon from the start! The paper doesn't feed correctly so half the time it's torn along one edge, it only wants to use about 2/3 of the ink in a cartridge, and the heads clog or misprints half the time, you can print a couple dozen pages before it starts messing up. If you have time to wait until the next day it might be willing to print another couple dozen. I'm going to send the old S600 to get a new print head... it'll be worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this for a network!","review":"I bought this Pixma for use on a small office network - big mistake. Canon tech support said that they do not provide help for using this model on a network and that it was not designed for use on a network to begin with. Gotcha!My problems began with a MultiPass F80 - a predecessor to the Pixma 780, when I had a paper jam. Needing a multifunction immediately I bought the Pixma directly from Canon. This was in February and the Multipass is still in the shop for repairs.The first Pixma 780 sent by Canon didn't work - a problem with the ribbon carriage. Neither did the second one - same problem. The third one finally worked, but now I found out that it is not supposed to work with small office networks.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular quality - Super value","review":"The Canon PIXMA MP780 has fabulous print-quality. Glossy photo prints are excellent for a unit that is so low-priced with great color accuracy, sharpness, and text that's laser-quality. It's also very quiet with loads of extra features that cost more on competitors' machines (if they include them at all). Ink is a real value factor with 5 ink cartridges that are low-priced and separately replaceable. Scanner works great. Finally, the fit, finish, and feel of the plastic parts indicates that this is a quality product - very different from the recent model HP machine we replaced with this. We're very satisfied with this unit and like it so much, we just bought a Canon PIXMA ip4000 printer with the same guts as the MP780!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Printer I had","review":"For an all in one it is giving me what I want.

It was good while it worked, but 2 failures of the print head in less than 2 years (and I am using canon cartridges too!). Never again. HP or Epson from here on out.

Something that couldn't be said about my HP All in one. I love the ability to easily configure the machine to do what I want--print from tray one or two, duplex on or off--and so on. I had to buy my HP's duplexer, and then found out it could only duplex if I printed from the computer!Canon choose to counter balance the lid, which is very nice, and the Lexus like drop of the front paper door sure is a nice touch. Way too often, I've dropped my ex-HP's scanner lid, only to startle myself. The displays are backlit, and if you don't touch it for about 15 minutes, it'll go into a powersave mode and turn the scanner light off. Two distinct paper trays, with one enclosed and away from dust all highlight the great small details Canon engineered into this machine. Bravo Canon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasts . . .","review":"We had our MP780 for about year, and it worked pretty well apart from being a bit of an ink-hog. But the real problem is that it recently just stopped working -- it no longer powers up. It is dark and silent.I checked around and found this is not an uncommon problem with the Pixma series printers. After doing some research I found that all I have to do is take a day off from work, drive 2 hours to a repair shop open only M-F, and pay more for the repair than the printer costs in the first place.

This drastically increases the total cost of ownership of the printer and makes it a much worse by.

I'm pretty disappointed, Im a huge Canon fan and of their products, but this All In One printer left me with a lot to be desired. It seems as if they are made to die 2-3 years after purchased.

Automatic duplexing!","review":"The machine is a good value, seems well built so far, and fairly easy to use if you don't mind learning how the menus work. Has lots of setting options and features. My mother can't change the settings but she can use it fine anyway.The automatic duplexing feature should be standard on all multifunction machines built today but unfortunately you have to look hard to find this in a SOHO machine. Automatic duplexing saves paper, postage, storage space, and of course is good for the environment.Note: Canon replaced the first one we received because after a few weeks it developed the habit of turning out only all-gray pages after waking from power save mode. Canon service was easy to work with and fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA?","review":"This printer seemed to have the best reviews of all the ones we were considering. Needing a printer immediately for a very important deadline, we had this shipped overnight with Amazon Prime. After receiving this printer, we spent about 4 hours installing software and attempting to hook it up. Finally gave in and contacted Canon's customer support, who informed us that the printer was dead on arrival. They would be happy to send us a REFURBISHED printer as a replacement!! My issues with this are:1. A printer that was purchased new should be replaced with brand new.2. What is the long term quality of a printer that is dead straight out of the box?3. This was a big deal for us .... deadlines missed, chaos, etc.Thank you Canon, but NO THANK YOU. We are off to explore HP and Brother laser all in ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again!","review":"I purchased this MP 780 Printer in May 2006. 6 Months later the problem began. The only color that the printer was able to print was basically black. All the other colors were barely visible. I contacted Canon and they sent me a replacement print head. I had to wait 3 weeks to receive it instead of the promised 3-4 days because it was on back order. Anyway, it worked fine after that. Now, 2 months later after replacing the print head, the same problem has returned.I bought this printer because it got such good ratings. I will not be buying another Canon Printer again. I have an old HP inkjet printer that I bought in 2000 and have never had a problem with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, helpful video!","review":"The best video I've seen that provides concise information along with do-able exercises. Contains 2 sets of classes -- one for the beginner (about 30 minutes long) and one for the slightly more advanced (about 40 minutes long). Both classes have explanations, stretching, exercises, and meditations. There's also info on how to modify the exercises if you have back problems (which I do). After doing yoga with the gentle Nirvair Singh Khalsa (who teaches yoga at University of Alaska), I feel relaxed, healthy and in love with life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kundalini Yoga for Relaxation","review":"I thought this video was a total disappointment! It mentioned a \\"beautiful natural footage of Alaska's majestic Mt. McKinley\\". Although it did show brief segments of Mt. McKinley, the actual background had a black wall with a PICTURE of Mt.

BUT, BUYER BEWARE, the blade & the chopping plate (the round thing with the little holes that the meat comes out of) are not, I repeat NOT STAINLESS STEEL.

This is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the job.","review":"I bought recently this product and I have to say that it is working fine. I tried it with pork, beef, bread, onion and pepper and it is doing fine. It is heavy solid made product from stainless steel. However the knife and the grinder itself are catching rust, so probably they are not a stainless steel parts. For this reason I dry these parts after I wash the machine. As the product is cutting well everything I put inside I guess I shouldn't complain. I didn't try it for sausages yet, so I can't comment if it is doing a good job there. In genereal I consider the product as a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets the job done.","review":"Overall, this product was a good buy. The construction is solid and rugged. The best part is that I don't need to plug it in to make it work! As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the unit is not entirely of stainless steel. You have to be sure to pat the cutter head and plate dry, or they will rust. If I were to change anything, I would want- at least one other grinding plate of a different size, and a taller design that would let the user place a deeper bowl in front of the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"order replacement knife at the same time","review":"The knife (blade) was dull. The rest of the machine probably works great - but since the main function is to grind meat with those blades, it's difficult to tell. Order a \\"Stainless Steel knife, #10 grinder\\". You might not find this on amazon.The \\"C\\" part of the clamp is only 1/2 inch deep, if you have a decorative edge on your counter (bullnose etc) greater than that the clamp will not fully catch the counter. Since the clamp only opens to 1 1/2\\", you can't put a piece of plywood on your counter and clamp onto plus the counter. The only solution is to get a couple of C-clamps and clamp a piece of plywood overhanging the counter, then clamp the grinder to that.Other than that, it seems very sturdy and well made. You can coat the knife and the grinding plate with mineral oil to prevent rusting (vegetable oil will eventually turn gummy and rancid)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Put Together!","review":"This product has gaps between the moving parts, which make grinding very frustrating and almost impossible. In order for the blade to cut/chop/mince/grind it needs to make contact with the screen. The only way to do that, is to push in while you crank, so I returned mine and will purchase a better product. Stay away from this thing unless you plan on having both hands on it at all times to make sure the blade makes contact with the screen. A waste of time and money - period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I read a great deal and have never written a review until now because this book was SO BAD, I had to.I did enjoy the info about supplements, however I am sure if I did a web search I would have found the same material..There is a tremendous amount of repetition and a sense of self-promotion on the part of the author.I have a knowledge of herbs and am using them for perimenopause with great success. I have not found a solution to weight gain and increase of appetite.After several re-reads, this Diet made no sense to me.It seems way too radical and almost impossible to implement..with serving sizes that would keep only a hamster alive.Will put to use several of the pointers and will refer to the diet as a general guideline.Perhaps I need to have a swig of Flax Seed Oil and I won't feel so let down by this book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read For Every Woman Over 40","review":"This was one of the best books that I have read. Prior to reading this book, I knew my body was feeling different but did not understand some of the symptoms and was not quite sure how I would explain them to a doctor. Well, now I don't need to. I took some of the advice on the Peri-Zapper's and within days I had more energy, my mood was better and I was sleeping like a baby again.

After about 5 weeks on the supplements my pms is not so bad. I am adjusting my diet now, and work out even more than I usually do. The symptoms are better, but this book helped a lot. I strongly urge this purchase. I bought a used copy and w/shipping it was only $8, the best $8 I have spent. Order yours today, don't wait, and don't suffer anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, But....","review":"I had to downgrade this book from four to two stars because of the author's frequent promotion of particular brands, such as Uni Key. Perhaps it's a pet peeve, perhaps it's just rampant raging hormones, but I've always been driven nuts by that particular practice. I also found the plugs for her other books a bit tedious.Having said that, the information contained in this book jives with what I've read in others about perimenopause - all of which I've purchased in the past several days. (I'd highly recommend \\"The Change Before the Change\\" by Laura E Corio, MD. It does a much better job of explaining the medical underpinnings of what we're all experiencing.)I have not yet begun the recommended regimine of supplements; it will be interesting to see if what she and others propose actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Promotion","review":"I could only give this book 2 stars due to the fact that the author just promotes herself continuously either by way of mentioning her books or the supplement company that she obviously owns.

There's no reason why a woman who weighs no more than 100 lbs and is more fragile than the glasses themselves should be able to break them while hand washing with a soft sponge.

The company claims that the glasses are the most break resistant in the industry. The wine enthusiast website has nothing but good reviews. Interestingly enough I can not seem to write a review on their website. So my order: Two of the three boxes I ordered at Christmas arrived with SHATTERED glasses. The customer service is good. They quickly replaced the broken glasses in time for Christmas. Within the first 3 weeks of use (careful wash by hand use) two more broken glasses. One broke in my mother in law's hand. (I was rather horrified.) So of the 12 glasses that I bought in 6 weeks of use 5 have broken. Now here is the really good part.

It was such a relief to be informed that I am a 'scanner' - a Renaissance thinker i.e. following and studying many, varied paths.In 'Refuse to Choose' Barbara Sher gives lots of guidance to create a career and/or life of variety with ideas on how to combine totally separate avenues into one journey.Choose this book if you are being pulled in many directions and want to successfully combine them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Prism Records - Not Original Tracks","review":"Through painful experience I have learned to avoid certain labels in the US (such as Madacy) because the items they sell are remakes of the original material.

Eadulf, on the other hand, sort of follows along providing occasional backup.While I'm not sure that I totally agree with Tremayne's view of 7th century Ireland, the books give a good view of a time and place not usually dealt with in light fiction. The homicide body count in Araglin is quite high, not to mention other assorted lesser crimes from cattle stealing to allowing your animals to trespass on a neighbor's land and defecate there (very disapproved of).

It is not very loud--no louder than other warm-air humidifiers I've bought before, you don't have to hold it under a sink to fil it, and there's no chance of it tipping over and spilling water all over your floor because of it's lockable cover. This humidifier is a lot like a rice cooker, with a huge display and a bunch of on and off settings.You can set the machine so that it humidifies just for a few minutes, or you can set it so that it runs on high or low for just an hour or just two hours. You can also set whether it comes back on at high or low in four hours or in six hours.

This humidifier is very loud, I can't bear to stay in the same room while using it. The second big flaw is there is little control of how much water vapor I want to output. There are two choices, low(50%) and medium(60%). The comfort zone for human is 40% - 60%. In my area, winter humidity is about 30%. Setting it to 50% is too much for me. How can 50% be the low setting? This product is designed without customer in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Could Be","review":"I had high hopes for this book because the subject vitally interests me. But I was greatly disappointed. It is mainly a compilation of stories gleaned from author's counseling practice, with very little effort to generalize from the stories to make points that could be useful to a broader audience. Authors very occasionally cite names and dates of other research, but there is no reference list on which to check those citations. Seems very unprofessional. Sketchily written; seems like author just gathered his years' worth of notes together, outlined, and made a minimal effort to integrate them.

However, the information contained in it is now very outdated, due in part, to the rapidly changing landscape of alternative cancer treatments and practitioners in the US and abroad. Also, a number of so called 'alternative health-practitioners' do operate at less-than scrupulous levels, and tend to pack up and leave town for greener pastures from time to time. [By the way, anyone considering an alternative therapy should always ask the therapist for records and clinical data in support of their therapy; the one's who don't provide such should be suspect, and often, it's these folks who don't seem to be in business for very long durations.] Overall, Fink's book is a fairly decent introduction to alternative therapies---however overly optimistic the tone is from time to time. However, don't blindly accept the information for its accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This book is extremely helpful, very informative, and a must-buy for anyone seeking information about alternative healing practices for cancer and a range of other degenerative diseases.

The corners are always white. Not much use for the temp sensor as I have to set it all way to the max to get golden brown waffles--Far below expectations for a unit of this price. I guess I'll go back to my 30 year old Made in the USA unit; its a little slower but the waffles come out great. I want to send this one back to China. The last complaint is more of a nuisance than a problem - It will stand on end but is rather unsafe as there is no latch and the lid crashes down if not secured."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"So, I have absolutely NO experience with waffle irons. I received this as a wedding gift and we used it to make a Christmas brunch this year. My mother, who remembers using older fashioned waffle irons, was just a-twitter with praise for this iron. It didn't split them in half, it cooked the waffles nicely (don't know if I like them crispy or not yet) and it DIDN'T STICK. I think that has got to be the most important feature of a waffle iron. We liked the \\"ready\\" indicator, both for temperature and done. The alarm was a tad shrill but would definitely alert you to attend to your waffles especially if you tend to multitask in the kitchen. This was very user-friendly. Overall 4 stars. Can't go five since I haven't experienced anything better or worse to compare it to. I like this iron very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it, and returned it","review":"This was my second waffle iron, first one a different brand. I did not like this one, it has a \\"waffle tone\\" that sounds like the smoke alarm going off, it went off when it preheated, when the waffle was ready, when the waffle iron cooled a little and reheated, it went off way too often. Made all of us nervous. Waffle quality did not come out great, either. Disappointed, still looking for a belgian waffle iron instead. But will definetly not buy one with that awful waffle tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As It Seems","review":"I bought this waffle iron for my husband as a gift, and I must say it was disappointing on Sunday morning, after reading through the manual, washing it, preparing batter, etc, and eagerly anticipating a waffle breakfast for the family - to find that the waffles were unevenly cooked, flat in some parts, risen/puffy on others, mostly burnt in the middle. I decided to check online for reviews and apparently others have had the same experience. We won't be keeping it for a second run. Not worth the bucks we paid at a well known kitchen retail store. We plan to go back to the $30-$50 range and look for a more reliable inexpensive model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"The heating element does appear to have been made for a round waffle maker.

I mistakenly thought that by buying a more expensive model I would get better waffles. It only cooks on one side and no matter which recipe I use they're flat.

We use to have waffles every Sunday, we've switched pancakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful - It's a Square Waffle but they use a round element","review":"As others have said, this waffle iron clearly uses a round heating element in a square iron. Of course that leads to uneven cooking where the center gets overdone, while the edges are just barely cooked.I would not have expected that sort of compromise for such an expensive product.I still have not found a suitable replacement waffle iron for my old GE and Sunbeam units which worked great for many years before they died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Villaware Waffle Maker V2001C","review":"Most noteworthy feature of this quality heavy duty family waffle maker is its quick recovery - the 2nd, 3rd, 4th batches cook as quickly as the first. This is not typical of all competitors' waffle makers and buyers who intend to cook for a family should consider this when comparison shopping. I bought through Amazon because this model was recommended to me, and I could not find it in any local store. Too bad there was no choice of shipping options, I received it in 2 days but at a very high \\"shipping cost\\" - could have waited longer for a less expensive method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money, Look for Another Brand","review":"Along with all the true comments about the unevenly cooked waffles, and the smoke alarm style alert, the unit is unstable when storing. After wrapping the cord, I pick up the unit by the loop hand to store it, but the loop only allows one side to be held. Once it was off the counter and over the floor, the other side opened, pinched my fingernail. This resulted in a drop unit, which shattered into 10 or so pieces. Poorly designed, should have a latch to keep unit closed when storing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this wafflemaker!","review":"The appearance of the wafflemaker is great...silver, shiny, modern motif. The bright red and green lights, as well as the bell that rings when the waffles are done are great thoughts, too. HOWEVER...I've now tried 2 of this model.

The first half of the book seems to consist primarily of a history of Root Beer followed by 15-16 pages of recipes (short, limited in detail)many of which are only vaguely related to the subject. The book also has lists of books, supply outlets and internet sources (this may be the best part of the book)and a few other soft drink subjects.

Because I live in an apartment I thought that this item would be perfect for me as space is limited and would serve as 3 appliances. I have used the pizzelle and waffle functions and have been less that pleased. Using the recipes included I found that baking took much longer than the recommended time to achive a nicely browned item. Also, the baked product was not light or crisp. The waffels were dense and the pizzelles were thick and had more of a cakelike bite rather than a thin, crisp cookie. The Inter-Baker was very easy to clean as stated in the instructions and if the the grids were coated with shorting as suggested nothing stuck to them. All in all not a great experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just shy of 5 stars","review":"I would have given this 5 stars if it did a little better with waffles, they turn out lighter on the top side.

Viilaware designed a great machine with one very big absence, the \\"done light\\". I tended to open machine before food is cooked enough so that the food came apart.Waffles especially are a problem because the batter amount differs on each pouring.When I guess correctly and raise the handle, machine has done a great job with heat distribution.I guessed correctly about 50% of the time. It took me twice as long to bake Italian waffle cookies due to this problem and I will have to buy different model similar to my old machine.One other FYI is to use a little cooking spray between batters to prevent sticking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Didn't Happen!","review":"The product pictured and priced in Amazon is NOT what DealYard sent.

The removable plates are also great for cleanup! However, be very careful and read the directions before removing the plates for the first time. I didn't read the directions carefully and ended up breaking the inside of the handle. Once you break that, it's all downhill from there.

I have no alternative, but to buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"waffle iron not so hot","review":"I bought this waffle maker because it has removable plates, so it is easier to clean than a traditional one. However, it does not get very hot and takes up to 10 minutes to make a waffle!

Never have I seen anything \\"crunch\\" this hard. When i first got it, I crushed a plastic pen to try it out. It shattered. I then moved on to the garage. I latched its shark jaw onto a stripped nut. This thing gives so much torque. I yanked and yanked but this was on tight. The crunch is also good to take on bike rides. It tightens the chain and all of the other hex nuts on it. The crunch is like every other leathrerman, except with less tools and a far better set of pliers.

I also have a hard time not liking an album that a member of Bad Brains appears on (although they sound NOTHING like Bad/Soul Brains.) The music is noisy pop, with a lot of glossed production that adds to some tracks, but some sounds are over-produced.

Still, it's a fun disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare I say, better than their last album..!","review":"Turnpike Diaries, the newest effort from the Getaway People, shines as an example of what most pop music should strive to be. Like on their Self-Titled debut album, Turnpike Diaries finds the 5-piece band deftly weaving threads of hip-hop, rock, jazz, and even a little reggae, throughout the entire album. Standout tracks include \\"Six Pacs,\\" \\"There She Goes,\\" and the uncharacteristic ballad \\"Deceived by an Angel\\" (Perhaps the only GP track on which one could say Boots actually 'croons'). If you enjoyed tracks like \\"She Gave Me Love,\\" \\"Plastic People,\\" or \\"Chocolate\\" off of their first album, then this album comes highly recommended.

Much more convenient than a short-handled scoop. Also works for loose tea or anything else you need to scoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke when dropped 3 feet!","review":"This double-headed measuring spoon appears to be well constructed on initial inspection, with a decent heft and simple, clean appearance. However, less than 6 months after purchase, a minor impact (fall off of a counter) made the 1-tbsp measuring scoop pop off of the handle! The revealed weld join was porous. For info this spoon is 18/8 stainless steel, and the spoon is made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Must read For Aviators","review":"This probably one of the best books about aviation that I have read. Ernest K. Gann takes you into the cockpit and lets you enjoy flight and share in the nerve wracking conditions in which pilots of his era had to cope with. I give one respect for Mother Nature and does prove that fate does indeed hunt the flyer. Readers will learn that at times the flyer is just one step ahead of fate and must employ skill, discpline and a cool head to keep fate at arms length. The book provides lessons that apply to all aviators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stikit is great!","review":"The Stikit soft hand block is great! Very comfortable in the hand even for long periods of sanding. It allows the paper to conform to gently curving surfaces. Stikit paper may be expensive, but you don't have any waste when using Stikit sanding blocks. I used the Stikit system in building a wood boat, spending many, many hours sanding by hand. I can't imagine a better system for hand sanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The music starts at nine and the fighting starts at ten.\\"","review":"Hot, bluesy Western swing from pre-Beatles Bay Area rednecks. Rivers was a transplanted Okie whose amazing, Charlie-Christian-inspired twin-neck guitar playing was the feature attraction of the early-60s house band at the legendary DeMarco's 23 Club in Brisbane, Calif. The other hot player was Sacramento steel guitarist Vance Terry, giving the unfortunately named Cherokees a seductive, switchblades-in-the-alley sound that drew equally from blues and country, while its rawness and backbeat are suggestive of the sweaty rock 'n' roll waiting just around the corner. Sometime between 1961 and 1964, Terry snuck a tape recorder on stage and captured these tracks. Look, Jimmie Rivers is one of Merle Haggard's idols. Who are you to argue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelming Unknown Genius!","review":"It blows my mind to think that a guitarist of such high caliber could toil away nightly in total obscurity at such a rough&tumble blue collar dive bar. From start to finish this CD is jammed with endless bebop runs in the style of Jimmy Bryant, Charlie Christian, etc. impeccably executed to the absolute disinterest of the assembled patrons and the world at large. Thank god someone was running a tape recorder so that we can now appreciate this immense talent and these fantastic performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"check it out from the library","review":"I thought this book was disappointing. I was looking for more general ideas on how to decorate, but this book doesn't give that type of information. It shows specific rooms and how they were decorated. Also, in the quiz to find your decorating style, there are 20 question, and I scored 5 points in three of the categories (Traditional, Country, and Ethinic.) So, you'd think there would be a section on decorating in an ecletic style, but there isn't. If you want to see this book for decorating ideas, check it out from the library before buying--you'll be glad you didn't spend the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and a fast read","review":"An important book for any dog owner to better help them to understand their dog and a well written and fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I purchased this book as my 2 year old cavoodle has fear aggression issues. She gets nervous/scared and reacts, usually by barking but the other week, she went for another dog at the beach. This book gave me some great ideas but I also called in a professional dog trainer. The book and the trainer have worked exceptionally well."},{"rating":"1","title":"29 pages of fluff... nothing here to help a dog or an owner","review":"I hate to pan this book but, if your like me looking for help... this 29 pages of fluff isn't going to get the job done.Keep looking, and let me know if you find a good reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical How-to Guide","review":"Very straight forward guide on how to approach implementing a program to help a fearful dog improve.

There could have been more detail and more examples to work out for the author--more situations or examples. I just wanted more information to help as we deal with our great pyrenese--one well raised since coming home at 8 weeks and one just rescued from a shelter at 10 months and having some fear issues; some crate issues and some mental baggage. Both dogs have a great personality dog #2 just needs to find it again....the book was helpful, I just wanted MORE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cautious Canine by McConnell","review":"This short little book is wonderful. It concisely explains the counter-conditioning method to help your fearful/aggressive dog cope with their problem. McConnell makes is clear to understanding not only how to practice the method, but why it can work. From barking at the doorbell and guests, to aggressively barking at other dogs and people, this little book can help make life better for both the dog and the owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Systematic desensitization/ graduated exposure therapy","review":"If you already understand systematic desensitization, then I wouldn't bother with this booklet. This is basically a 25 page overview of how to use the technique using the example of fear of strangers. However, it is a fairly good overview of the system, as long as you are capable of imagining how to modify the techniques to your own particular needs. One thing I loved that she pointed out is that the majority of \\"aggressive\\" dogs are actually fearful and just willing to bite first. My major disagreement with her is her attitude towards \\"guard dogs\\" instead of dismissing them as \\"a loaded gun on the coffee table\\" it would have been better if she had gone into explaining the difference between a truly protective dog (one that will protect on cue) and a dog that will bite without anymore provocation than somebody dared to walk by. For the price though, it's worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"I have an almost 7 month old puppy who is not at all afraid of people but is quite afraid of moving cars and other \\"non-human\\" things. I purchased this booklet thinking that, based on the title, it would cover more than just dogs who are afraid of humans. It does not. If you have a dog who is afraid of people I suppose this little pamphlet could be helpful. It is completely worthless for any other situation.It would be more appropriately titled: \\"The Cautious Canine - How To Help Dogs Conquer One Very Specific Fear\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh...","review":"I discovered, after I bought and payed the shipping fee, this same pamphlet on my vet's impulse buy rack for cheaper. I guarantee that you, interested in your pet enough to buy yet another specialized book, have seen, heard, and read the information within a thousand times before. You would get more from literature from Authors Jean Donaldson or Nicole Wilde. I really don't know why Patricia McConnell, who has a great radio show here in wisconsin-\\"calling All Pets\\" on NPR, wouldn't write a more thorough/expanded edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I was expecting more. It's a VERY short pamphlet, and while it is informative, I was just expecting something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written & easy to understand ...","review":"Fortunately, there are very few overtly aggressive dogs, most dogs act aggressively because they are fearful ...Unfortunately though, the bite from an aggressive dog and one from a nervous dog are equally painful, and often attract the same dire consequences ...This is a great booklet that teaches us how to manage a nervous or cautious canine ...First, the author shows us how to identify our dog's fear ... and then the author teaches us (step-by-step) how classical re-conditioning can help to reduce such fear ... in a gentle and effective manner.Often the biggest barrier to effective training, is our own lack of clarity as to what is required of us as trainers ...But the short chapters and the step-by-step format used by the author makes everything so very clear and easy to understand ... And just as helpful, the author also provides suggesttions, when a particular step does not achieve that intended ...All in all, a useful booklet ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner's guide","review":"This is a great guide for learning the basics of how to counter-condition your anxious or fearful dog. It's short but concise, with clearly defined steps that are easy to follow. However, if you're looking for a really in-depth guide, or are already familiar with basic counter-conditioning, you would probably be better off with a more intensive guide. Still, for a quick refresher course or a foundation for future work, this booklet is great, and I do recommend it. (Plus it's cheap - what have you got to lose?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a pamplet at the Vet's - same info for free","review":"I should have read the ALL of the reviews, then at least I would have known I was getting a 30 page PAMPHLET. I was extremely disappointed. First, anyone with more than a passing familiarity with dogs is away of the type of techniques presented in this book. Second, virtually identical information was in a pamphlet that my vet has hanging on the wall, which I picked up for free this past week when I had a dog there. Don't get me wrong, if you know nothing about dogs, this is good STARTING information, but for just maybe a dollar.
