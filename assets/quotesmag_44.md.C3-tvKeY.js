Author does a pretty good job following the lives of some fascinating people, including those from the Bombay underworld. He paints a really vivid picture of the city, which is both fascinating and disturbing. Overall, it gives a pretty accurate description of the city and its workings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"Most amazing travelogue I have ever read. Beautifully written. A must read for anyone interested in Bombay, India, Asia, Cities, people, stories, love, hate, fear, religion, life."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incomplete tale by an author fascinated by the dark side!","review":"They say \\"no news is good news\\". In the same spirit, this book dwells on the dark side of Bombay. It would have been fine if the title would have claimed this upfront. But, we are led to believe that the book would be about Bombay itself. While the book is still about Bombay, it is not the complete picture. It would be difficult to characterize all the different facets of a complicated city like Bombay. But, to say that Bombay is all about sex, bar dancers and delusional gangsters is nothing short of preposterous.Do NOT buy this book unless you are interested in these \\"sensational\\" aspects of Bombay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uttter rubbish","review":"Mr. Mehta has lost the plot. He returned after 21 years to find the city different. What did he expect? I mean seriously...Heck I returned after 3 yrs and found a massive difference. The character of the city is such that it constantly keeps evolving. Was New York the same 21 years ago? Mr. Mehta is a gifted writer - it's not how he writes but rather what he writes that is important. And he writes utter crap - you can't possible raturn to a city after 21 years and say \\"Oh boy! It's not how I left it!\\" Some authors love potray the negative aspects of India cause it pleases the western reader - they empathize with him. Bombay has its share of flaws. I'd rather live here than anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catering to the india illiterate audience","review":"I think the author does a good job of capturing the attitude of \\"secular\\" indians. It seems to me that the author almost feels that the Bombay bomb blasts were actually justified. It an appalling state of affairs that many Indians actually follow this line of thought. For that perspective alone this book is worth reading. No matter how much it offends you.On a more technical note, the way the author makes conclusions from the data points he presents is clearly intended to convince someone who is not aware of the context. For example, the author makes a claim about how Bal Thakeray mentioned Ram Mandir and Lucknow in one sentence and how that means Bal Thackeray thinks Ram Mandir is in Ayodhya. What that basically means is that either the author has pretty weak reasoning skills or that his hate and disgust for people prevent him from making an objective inference. Both of those reasons are strong enough to give this book a 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"The author is a charalatan, insensitive and (I am sure) \\"casteist\\" (worse than being a racist, in my opinion). He claims to have information about \\"murderers\\" that he has willfully withheld from the police and now wants to sue the Indian government for their mistreatment of children! How bogus can this guy be? If he wants to make a difference to Mumbai or to the world - he should start with himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anybody who enjoys a dose of harsh realism.","review":"I knew tons about Bombay, its history and its present; the gangs, the Hindu-Muslim tensions, the problems it has in its infastructure. But Mehta's book brought all of these things to life, the different levels of society (from the slums to the socialite parties of the rich) and how corruption and violence show themselves in the lives of people. It's just a fascinating account all around, and his writing depicts both a story of a city and that of himself. As the reader is caught up in the world of underworld dealings, Mehta also finds himself sucked into the circles of these awful killers.I haven't visited Bombay but if I ever will, I think this book has made a little more prepared for things I will probably witness there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bombay 101","review":"Mehta provides a very human introduction to this incredible metropolis, keeping the narrative alive with a steady stream of seedy underworld nuggets. For instance, learning about the shadow courts of the underworld that resolve everything from property disputes to trade negotiations. It drags towards the end, but makes up for it in its overall illumination of this city.

Admittedly, I'm a new sewer, but my Mom is quite experienced. We both spent over an hour trying to get it threaded the first time! Once you figure it out (forget about the directions!) it's relatively easy. However, the machine doesn't handle heavier fabric well and the thread and stitches quickly get uneven.

It features wonderful vocals from Airto and Flora and of course amazing percussion from Airto. The supporting cast is equally strong with Kei Akagi on piano and the great Joe Farrell on saxophone. Kei Akagi is an amazing piano player who went on to play with Miles Davis. I use to see him with Stanley Turrentine and later saw him do a show with a nice quartet including Rick Margitza. Kei reminds me of Bill Evans or Allan Broadbent combined with McCoy Tyner, a very sweet combination. Of historical significance on this album, it was the last recording of Joe Farrell prior to him death. Joe Shines with his obviously Coltrane influenced soloing. He was at the top of his game and is brilliant on this recording.

While Wesley's solo albums feature pre-programmed keyboard tracks, the Fiasco songs have a hard rock feel to them. The Fiasco is actually a very good hard rock band. As for Wesley, well... he's Wesley. All his songs follow the same basic structure, but at least with the Fiasco there is some variety in the intrumental arrangements. His solo recordings tend to sound very similar instrumentally. Those of you who like Wesley will love this album. Those of you who don't like Wesley won't like this album. It's that simple.

Mary Higgins Clark has the ability to capture you into the minds of the characters in her novels. You know what the villian is thinking at all times. Her books are not easily read on audiocassette because the smallest details are not to be forgotten, I often need to flip back to earlier portions of the book to find the relationship between characters or events.

Unfortunately, Clark seems to have no faith in her readers, feeling the need to smack us in the face with the clues.

Because of her hamhanded treatment of the clues and red herrings I knew immediately what would happen. A bit more finesse might have kept me guessing until the end.

This was written by an amateur definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written mystery, with only a few flaws...","review":"Since this was my first Mary Higgins Clark novel, I was expecting that if I liked this one enough, I would request her newest book, You Belong to Me. I did. Now I've heard that her newest novel is definitely not among her best, but I'm willing to try it out anyway.This one only has a few flaws in it. For one thing, sometimes things move a little to fast, so that the reader might get a little confused. Second of all, the last scene of action was WAY to short. She wrote the whole book so that you would just enjoy the beginning murder and the last, 3 page action/suspense scene?? Come on, she could have put more into this book than that. The characters (especially Lacey) are memorable and well created. I can only think of one mystery I like better than this one: Blood Ties, by Sigmund Brouwer.All in all, this was a fine novel. Not to bad, but not to good; yet it was more good than bad. I look forward to reading more from this talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite page turner!","review":"While the beginning started off with a bang, the middle tended to slow down at times.

I now reserve them from the library rather than plunk down the big bucks for a hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"Well, I've read a few of Clark's books and I always find her characters to be cut outs with very little development.

This one seems to have just sort of fallen together, as we're quickly told a few things about Lacey, and almost too much about the supporting characters. The journal that's supposed to tie everything together only muddles things even more. The stereotypical 'Italian mobster' bad guys, and the sometimes stilted and outdated dialogue, seem out of place for a mid-90s book. The tension is drawn-out and forced, and can't over come the predictability of what's going to happen(or actually, what's not going to happen; the major flaw of the book is that it makes a point of suspense out of something the reader knows isn't going to happen, anyway).Sure, it has a happy ending...it's the beginning and middle that need help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ususal formula","review":"Pretend You Don't See Her is a typical Mary Higgins Clark novel - lots of characters, lots of plot, lots of plot twists but not too much substance. I enjoy a plot-driven book, but need the characterizations to make it a fulfilling experience, and I suspect that MHC sacrifices characterization for plot. At least, the lead player should be deeper and we should get to know her better. With Agatha Christie, we always empathised with at least one person (usually the detective who was seeking to resolve the mystery), but with Mary Higgins Clark, that closeness is sorely missing and, unfortunately it detracts from the pleasure of her novels. That said, Pretend You Don't See Her gives what it says it will give - a fast-paced thriller that will have the reader guessing right up to the final chapter. For plot, I give this book five stars. For depth of character two. Average? Three and a half, so let's say four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either pretend you don't see her, or still watching....","review":"For almost twenty years, this writer has used fomulated receipe to write simplified so-called thriller for simple-minded fragile readers to get goose bumps for no obvious reasons; if you feel like nail biting, contact your family doctor and elementary school teacher. All her books are almost the same; either still watching after twenty year since falling out of the cradle, or gradually turned into a typically formatted across-street scenario; somebody's still watching, but you could be pretending not seeing yet.

However, the manual is another story. In the English section, after page 4, it switches to Spanish. Then, in the Nederlands section, the preliminary english pages repeat, followed by the rest of the english pages, then switches back to Spanish. I didn't go through all of the other languages. I went back to Canon and asked if I could get a manual that was properly organized. They told me, by return email, that this is the only manual available, but I could call an 800 number if this response was unsatisfactory.So, unless you can puzzle this out without printed guidance, be prepared to an upfront challenge.Fred"},{"rating":"1","title":"overkill","review":"more than 15 years ago I was able to buy a wireless remote for my EOS Elan that was about the size of a box of matches and didn't need anything attached directly to the camera.

Due to the weight it adds to the body it caused my tripod to fall yesterday which made the piece that fits in the hot shoe snap off, now it is worthless. Thankfully there are better (non-Canon) options to be found today so I'll spare Canon my angry note about the price of progress and how ridiculous it is to pay hundreds of dollars for something bigger than an ancient TV remote control.

Something which would probably not be possible today, at least as far as main stream music is concerned. Back then musicians were truly artists. They recorded what they were inspired to do, not just to sell records but to create music that would inspire them and listeners as well. That said this is truly an exceptional album with some great songs! In my opinion this was Dylan's best period. His playing is at its best and his lyrics are thought provoking. There are some political songs but there is also \\"boots of spanish leather\\" one of my all time favs. But if you are not a fan of singer/songwriters (of which Dylan might have been among the first) then this is not for you. If you are a fan of great lyrics and great playing then by all means buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Bob Dylan is by far one of the greatest song writers around. His music has spanned the decades and continues to thrive into the new millenium. Even though the events have changed, the references made can still pertain to things happening today and tomorrow and probably forever. Dylan's creativity continues to thrive and change on his third album and every album he continued to make. There seems to be something that everyone can enjoy. From traditional folk to rock influenced, his sound will be forever etched in stone. The Time They Are A-Changin' is a must have for all Bob Dylan fans and just another way for the younger generations to feel the emotions that were flowing throughout the 60's. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"I was deeply impressed with this album from the first listen. From the opening track 'The Times They Are A-Changin' to 'Restless Farewell', the listener is immersed in an album truly reflective of the chaotic 60's in which it was produced. So much of these songs still ring true today. Consider this a mint from Dylan's protest days and an essential purchase for all those into acoustic folk. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remaster, but...","review":"The reissues of Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' are excellent releases on their own merits. Still, I can't help but feel like both of these releases fall short of the phenomenal 2003 remasters of much of the Dylan catalog. Those discs were Hybrid-SACDs, packaged in cardboard cases that replicated the original album jackets and artwork. By contrast, these 2005 remasters are regular old CDs, and packaged in standard, generic jewel cases. Curiously, the 2003 series was issued on the Sony/Legacy label, while the 2005 titles are released by Columbia. This may account for the difference.Of course, the music is as great as it always was, and the remasters are much better than the old CDs. Still, it's troubling to see Sony taking a step back from the care that they had previously given to the Dylan catalog. Here's hoping Sony gives the future remasters of albums like The Basement Tapes and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid the consideration they are due."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are looking for all in one ladder get this one.","review":"I bought this ladder three month ago and it is a saver.

I suspect the boy who sings many of the leads doesn't speak English, as he seems to be singing phonetically. However, there are several songs done by an adult group that sounds similar to the Ray Conniff Singers or the New Christie Minstrals. Those songs are better. There is a version of The Twelve Days of Christmas which is sung by a man who may be Perry Como, or a sound-alike. There are no liner notes to indicate who the performers are.I keep this CD in my Christmas collection because I like two songs on it. Sleep Well Little Children and When Santa Claus Gets Your Letter.

That's the soul fan's misfortune too as Arthur lingered in obscurity until his untimely passing. This collection does a great job of bringing Arthur Alexander out of the shadows and it is essential listening for fans of countrified soul music. 'Anna' is probably the best known song here having been covered by the Beatles, but this version easily outpaces theirs. The Stones did a nice version of 'You Better Move On', but again, Arthur's is the one to own. It became patently obvious to this listener that Mr. Jagger spent some time checking out the vocal style of Arthur Alexander. You should too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I speak so highly of Arthur Alexander's THE GREATEST that you would think I had a box full of them to sell. I bought this CD because of Alexander's smoldering vocal on \\"Anna,\\" which I had heard on a various-artists album. By time \\"Dream Girl,\\" track 6 of THE GREATEST, played, Alexander's passionate singing had mesmerized me. He tears it up one way or another throughout this gem-laden collection. Arthur Alexander passed away in 1993. Look for his last release, LONELY JUST LIKE ME and a various-artists tribute, ADIOS AMIGO, if you agree with my opinion of THE GREATEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of top-notch performers and selections","review":"Please note: The artwork of this CD (not pictured in this listing) indicates two women indicating lesbian intimacy.

Not explicit in any way, just evocative.Great selection of classical works, with very fine performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, but beware of offensive packaging!","review":"The music on this CD is lovely - it's well played and the recording is of very good quality. I have no problem endorsing the CD itself, however, don't order this for a gift or if you have children in the house unless you're planning on taking the cover apart and replacing all the inserts. Even though the CD's title, \\"Classical Erotica II\\", might give one pause, I certainly didn't expect to find a 5-panel unfolding insert with soft-porn lesbian-oriented photography. The packaging is extremely offensive and totally unnecessary in getting across the point that the music would be good for romance. The manufacturer/distributor should save this type of photography for books and leave it out of CD covers. It may be catering to a lesbian market, but my lesbian friends are also put off by this packaging - it is totally inappropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely 5 stars!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is just simply fantastic!! I personally think her songs in French especially her dance versions to French singer Mylène Farmer's \\"Désenchantée\\", and \\"Libertine\\" are the best songs on the CD!!

If you're a fan of that genre, do yourself a favor and pick this up. Turning Japanese is, of course, infectious. The other tunes to look out for here are \\"Sixty Second Interval\\", \\"Letter From Hiro\\", and \\"Bunkers\\".There really aren't any throw-away songs. This album rocks from start to finish.

It was an addiction between us. The whole album is great. Cutting edge stuff that was way ahead of its time. Dance to Jackie Onassis and What Does Sex Mean to Me. Learn the words to Marone Moan - it's a great ballad. If you know this band, you already have this album. If you are curious, waste no time in buying this CD. Oh, and Wendell did indeed lick Betty Ford's boots. He worked at Filenes when Betty ordered a pair from the famous department store to wear to China. He was packing them to send to her and decided to lick them before he put them in the box. She wore them all over China."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated and unknown","review":"Bostons best kept secret of the 80's. I saw them perform live three times in the Boston area.

I was wrong. I found this book to be rather bland and severely lacking in detail. It covered too many episodes in too few pages and, to me, a fans' episode guide to a television series should be more than half a page of synopsis and a 5 second interview with a cast member with some random behind-the-scenes drawings and photographs shoved in to fill the back pages. Just like most other \\"official\\" guides to television series, it was too brief and not worth the 10.99 or so that I paid for it.If, like me, you expect a lot more information and detail from an episode guide, I'd recommend \\"Beyond the Gate\\" by Keith Topping. Much less official with much more thought put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book","review":"I purchased the first stargate sg1 the Illustrated companion seasons 1and2 and seasons 3 and 4.

I have done nothing but listen to it all afternoon. It is one of the most beautiful collections that I have ever heard. The artist's name on all of these songs is Lee Johnson, yet I have never heard of him before. Sounds like some great music for a movie soundtrack.

My father saw them butchered when he was 11 years old. His sister was younger than he. He feigned death and managed to escape alive and eventually come to America. I heard about his experiences first-hand. Is it possible that these children and mother were threats to the Ottomans? I think that the claim of the Armenians as a race being a threat to the Turks was a bit far-fetched. How can that justify murdering mothers and their children?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete distortion of history.","review":"This book is another addition to the unsuccessful but well-funded attempt to give credibility to the allegations of a genocide and blaming Turks as perpetrators.

It came in a box that looked like it was kicked to my house from the seller. Then the actual wood panel was cut. The wood was not as pictured, more like the wood paneling of 70's era basements. The boys were so excited to play with it and anxiously awaited us to put it together but still when it was all set up, everything still just felt a little off.

There is also quite a bit of assembly required so be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed","review":"The Franklin Sports game was intended as a Christmas gift for my son. He had picked it out and was very excited about it. I had intended it as a surprise, but when it arrived (at my office) the packing had ripped and it was clear what was in the box. Unfortunately, my son saw the box before I had a chance to move it! When we tried to assemble the item we could not put it together. Several of the screws were stripped. It was very heavy, which made the attempted assembly even more difficult. The final frustration was the difficulty in packing it up and returning it because of the size and weight! I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"We bought this for our 8 and 4 year old boys. The product was damaged when it arrived (storage drawer broken). My husband attempted to assemble it anyway. The bottom panel for the foosball table was warped making that game unplayable because the handles couldn't spin freely. The ping pong panel was 'dead' so the imitation ball did not have much bounce. The pins to hold the net could not be inserted far enough into the table to stay perpendicular to the table so the net kept sliding off the pins. The air hockey puck kept getting stuck in the goal slot instead of going through it for a goal. The only surface that did not have issues was the chess/backgammon panel. Needless to say, it was promptly returned. We would not recommend this for any amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Christmas Present","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this toy is very low quality and overpriced. The storage drawer had fallen apart. The wood veneer was peeling off. The air hockey may be the only portion actually used, but it is nearly impossible for the puck to fit through the slot on one side. The foosball game requires more tedious assembly than indicated. This has to be one of the worst gifts that I have given and will probably be in a landfill before the end of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"previous reviews scared me but product is great!","review":"When I read the previous reviews I wasn't sure what we were going to get (box of smelly, broken pieces??). For $100 I wasn't expecting miracles. Our product arrived on time and everything was fine. There was a tiny part of one corner piece where the laminate was chipping off, but we will glue it back on. Also one of the wooden dowels was pushed too far in and cracked a little bit of the wood, but it still works great. I think this is an excellent product for the money. My boys 4 and 3 LOVE IT! We've played fooseball and air hockey nonstop. We purchased pre-fab table legs from the local Home Depot and it is a great addition to our basement. Even the adults play. We are very pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product emits really bad chemical smell.","review":"I bought this product for my 6 and 7 yrs old nephews. I am very disappointed about the bad chemical odor that this product is emitting. I have left this product out in the patio for 2 days but the bad odor has not gone away. My nephews are very disappointed because they cannot play with it. The smell is so bad that it fills up the room when I try to bring it back into the family room. I have to move the product back into the patio hoping the odor will go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the Price","review":"After reading all of the bad reviews, for the low $54 price I took a chance and ordered it. My 7 yr old son loves it. It was a bit of a pain to put together but a lot of fun to play with. There is a lot of air produced with the air hockey table but the puck does tend to get stuck if the bracket that keeps score is pushed down to far. I will agree with the other reviewers that the draw will probably fall apart very soon but again it is very compact, so to expect a larger draw would be too much. What I like about this the most is the size. It is definitely not meant for an adult. But for a 7 and 9 yr old it is perfect. I can place this ontop of my sons desk and easily put it under the bed when not in use. If you want to get the kids away from the tv, computer or video games and have a family night of games, this will be perfect. Cheap price, easy to store."},{"rating":"2","title":"6-1 game","review":"I bought this for my 8 year old grandson and every time we talk he brings up the fact that it was the best gift ever.

But remember you have to take each one of his albums as a seperate entity, because Bowie does what he likes when he likes. \\"Young Americans\\" is a masterpeice crossover album for David and shows just how far his talents can strech...heck \\"Fame\\" is even on Soul Train's \\"top 25\\" album! Overall this is a cool, soulful, beautiful album that you will enjoy listening to, except for the Beatles cover song. The bonus tracks should have been included originally and \\"Across the Universe\\" left out. Other than that it is a great Bowie CD from his best period of the 70's. Not as good as \\"Ziggy\\" or \\"Hunky Dory\\" but almost.....a 9 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an outstanding Bowie album. Don't dissapoint yourself!","review":"Yes, there are a few really good tracks on the album; Fascination, Fame, and maybe Young Americans. His duet with Lennon on Across the Universe is good. But, to the Bowie enthusiast who likes such masterpieces as, \\"The Man Who Sold the World,\\" and \\"Hunky Dory,\\" this album is a real bummer. It's probably a necessary transition album for better things to come because \\"Station to Station\\" and \\"Low,\\" that were made after, are brilliant. Skip this one. There are too many other Bowie albums that are worthy of buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of those reporting this revue dont know Soul!!........","review":"Simply stated this is the Bowie Soul album...many of those Glam heads reviewing this disc simply dont understand this,although they all seem to love it!

Besides the fighty rendition of \\"across the Universe\\" (nobody signs \\"nothing's gonna change my world\\" like the King :)) and the OK \\"Fame\\", the rest is commercial, and badly so. I don't know what happened to him. I'm glad Amazon's Dan Epstein put it so well: \\"transitional step (...), not a great record\\". One feels so much better when \\"somebody up there agres with you :)\\".There are many other better Bowie albums. This is for fans only. Maybe if you like \\"Soul funk\\" also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly average","review":"Although its better than most of the stuff today its Bowie's worst effort out of his best period. I own everything from Space Oddity to Scary Monsters except Young Americans. I can't stomach it. It's actually pretty funny that on the timeline of releases its right next to his best: Station to Station"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute to Errol Brown","review":"It's ironic that David Bowie refers to this album as his version of American soul. Like most of David Bowie's \\"innovations\\", this work is based upon the previous works of other artists. In this case, David derived his inspiration from the great British soul band, Hot Chocolate.Bowie emulates Errol Brown on all of the successful tracks. The fact that Brown was later accused of being influenced by David Bowie's vocal style - is nearly as ridiculous as Bowie frequently being credited for influencing rock innovator, Alice Cooper. Even Bowie's Spider band members admit that Alice Cooper was the prime influence on their music / presentation.With the possible exception(s) of Sting and Madonna, David Bowie is the most highly overrated performer of the past 40 years. To paraphrase Mark Twain, his works are both good and original; but the original parts aren't good - and the good parts aren't original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bowie album ever","review":"How does one go from Ziggy to this crap. If I wanted to listen to soul music I would have pulled out my mowtown collection. I actually had the displeasure of seeing this tour live. Cant tell you how disappointed I was as I had no idea he was going to do this garbage. This album never should have been made. Wish I could rate it less than 1 star. I'm afraid it was all down hill for Bowie after he lost the brilliant Mick Ronson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win! Win! Win!","review":"I thought this was another great album on Bowie's part. I especially LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the songs \\"Win\\" (very soulful, very deep, very melancholy), \\"Young Americans\\" (quite a fun classic), \\"Fame\\" (good message and funky), and \\"Fascination\\" (a really neat dance mix), and such. Any Bowie fan should totally add this CD to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bowie Classic","review":"I like this album and Fame is my favorite track. Some say Bowie was trying to sing soul. While not necessarily a bad thing, soul is not my first impression of this album. David Bowie has on of the strangest voices I think I've ever heard. I'm not sure how he became a rock star. His singing alone doesn't cut it for me. He's no a great singer but his voice has a certain charm all its own. The all time best thing about this album thoough is to play it now and listen to Luther Vandross singing background at a time when nobody knew who he was. His voice was unique and distinctful even back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Perfect","review":"If you skip the Beatles Cover, this is a nearly perfect Bowie release. Another funk, soul and rock combo like Station to Station that has a very strong grove to it! One of Bowie's better albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dull.","review":"I never cared much for this album and I doubt I ever will. Fame and Young americans are standout tracks but the rest of the songs just sound too much alike. When listened to them seperately they're enjoyable enough, but played one after the other they become a bit of a drag. Bowie's voacal delivery on this album is admirable though, it's just a shame most of his songwriting is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"More on the sound quality","review":"Since a lot of the comments here are regarding the sound quality, I thought I'd chime in too. I don't have a surround setup so these comments are just regarding the stereo CD. A careful comparison with the Ryko CD reveals the stereo \\"stage\\" is different on this new release. For instance, on \\"Win\\" on the Ryko release, the guitar is off to the far left, the sax to the far right, just like the original RCA LP. On this new release, the instruments are much more towards the center, creating a narrower soundstage. Furthermore, the sax seems to drift from right to left at some points. This leads me to believe the stereo disc is mixed down from the surround version, which I imagine has some of the instruments moving around at points. While the sound quality is overall quite good, I would prefer the stereo imaging mimic the original, not change things. The original LP did have a bit of an exaggerated stereo effect, but that's the way it was recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance if you are willing to listen for it...","review":"Others have suggested that this is a non-event as far as Bowie albums go, but they are missing the intent.

A must as far as Bowie albums go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Bowie's best","review":"David Bowie hits the mark with Young Americans, his \\"plastic\\" soul album.

The beats are great chillin beats especially in songs like \\"Pacific Heights\\" and the title song \\"Ascension\\". For those of you who are familiar with Pep Love from the Hiero album, his lyrics and flow are once again off the hook. The only thing I didn't like about this album was some of the lyrical content. A few of his songs (not just \\"Black People\\") seemed to reflect black power themes such as would be heard in Dead Prez or KRS 1. That just isn't very appealing from a Hieroglypics member for some reason. Other than that, it is an excellent album and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, ....

I refill my own tanks with ink from [...] and have never had to even run a cleaning cycle. I especially like the fact that the tanks have no chip and are very inexpensive. I have purcased only Canon tanks and installed nylon screws in the filling holes to allow for easy filling. I keep a spare set of tanks at all times and never let them get to low or run dry. I had one printer repaired (surge tank) and was told by the tech person that this printer is easy to repair and the parts are very reasonably priced. Since I fill my own, I purchased a spare printhead as a precaution but I have never had to use it. As I own a Canon 5D, I do a lot of 13 by 19 printing and have never had any problems. Prints are sharp even up close. Just remember to use the printer at least once a week.

Loading the software was straightforward. Even getting the first print was no problem. Print qulaity is exceptional.

The only trick is printing from Photoshop or other non-Canon based programs. Setting up the color profiles to get a good color match can be a learning experience.

With that piece of Junk epson I broke open the cartridge and there was atleast 30% of the ink left in it when it said it was empty.I love the photo quality on my 9900 and I have finally found a photo printer that actually deserved to be called a photo printer.

That replacement motherboard lasted only about 2 years before it also failed. I will not replace it again.

However, the printer is now 14 days out of warranty, and the same problem has now recurred on the replacement head. I plan to chalk this up as one of those things in life and dispose of the printer before it gives me any grey hairs. Unless you really need it, don't buy a printer that has so many - eight - ink tanks. That's an expensive overkill.I won't again buy a higher end printer.

I upgraded from the IP3000, which, by the way, is itself a very good printer.I'm a budding professional photographer so I was very excited to print some of my work on 8.5 x 11 and 13 x 19. The results were astonishing. I use a 10.5 MP digital camera and this printer truly does it justice.The colours are VERY true to life and bright and lifelike. I think it's very important to use the Canon papers in order to get proper results every time. They may cost a bit more but i will NEVER switch to any other brand.All and in all, I am very pleased with this purchase. However, i do get a little start up noise ( a slight knocking sound) and I wonder if this is normal or if there was probably a slight damage in shipping.

First of all, it is very selective on printer papers. I can not get good result on a wide range of papers including presentation papers in various brands. The ink is buit-up on presentation paper and I cannot print it in both sides. The color is hard and rough in gross photo papers from generic brands or brands other than Epson. Secondly, the print head get dirty easily. Even after cleaning several times, I still get uneven colors.So I decide to buy this Canon i9900 to replace the Epson 1280. I made the choice based on my test on a $49 low-end Canon printer, and based on my experience with other Canon products including camera and scaner. My decision is right.

His range is wonderfully displayed in Lonely Teardrops and To Be Loved.

They keep getting stuck when I try to lower them, and they even get stuck when trying to raise them. I've experimented with them and found out that on one pump jack, I had to make sure the crank used to lower the jack must be pushed into the square hole as per instructions, while the other pump jack didn't work this way. It didn't matter if The crank was in the square hole or not. And then when I wanted to raise the jack again, I had to use a hammer to knock the crank back out of the square hole since it wouldn't budge no matter what I did.

Since it is made with great strength and reinforcement, I believe it will not affect the performance of the ladder. It is just as good as a perfect one! I have used the ladder three times since my purchase. It is stable and usable in unconventional areas where other ladders could not be used! Overall I am very satisfied. It could be that I did not read everything in all fairness! Everything else was perfect.

All content has been published in hundreds if not thousands of other publications. A quick internet search will convince you of this. Also, the book is badly edited.

There is something mysterious and sublime about this work, and I'd recommend it to anyone, whether they think they're interested in Israeli literature or not. These poems seem to open windows into experiences at once ordinary and fantastic, and they contain a subtle power capable of moving the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Collection","review":"Marcia Falk has created a textured and rich translation of Zelda's poetry, here in this handsomely formatted bi-lingual edition. Falk allows the reader of English to catch a glimpse of the layered world of Zelda's Hebrew with the extremely helpful notes at the back of the book. Zelda's poems skip across worlds; they are by turns modern and archaic, religious and secular, mystic and orthodox. Falk's collection provides a good glimpse into this complex poet, her work and world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best gift","review":"I bought this and had it sent to my sister in NY as a birthday gift for her little boy (toddler). She said he didn't play with it much, and she honestly wan't very impressed with it.

I had no idea which one they even got (which I thought was kind of a bummer)!

But I ordered and received DVDs with no bear. The DVDs alone are certainly not worth the price as they can be purchased cheaper alone, plus the whole reason we ordered was to get the bear.

I am a casual photographer and not a pro by any mean, however, when I go for a shoot whether it is nature, or portraits etc I take a lot of pictures usually between 200-300 pictures. I received my package, unpacked it, installed the battery grip since I already had 2 charged batteries. First it seemed very nice to have especially for portrait shots, however and after 10 minutes or so, your hands start getting sore, this thing is heavy added to your camera. Also, I have small hands so I have to produce and overhand grip which strains my hand a little bit. Another thing is that the sling of the camera always gets in the way, with the battery grip it became more noticeable. In my case, that product did not improve my experience. Thus a 2 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit pricy","review":"A little over priced for the amount of plastic and metal but does a very nice job.

The great thing about this is that you have the option of using two Canon NB-2LH Rechargeable Battery Packs (not included) or six AA batteries (also not included). If you're going to be away from electricity and won't be able to recharge your batteries this will give you a way to use your camera with common AA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"great add on for rebel","review":"The battery grip is a great add on for those who have big hands and take many vertical shots. The quick dial and shutter button on the side of the grip is cool and you will start using them quickly. One thing that surprised me is the amount of battery life you will get with the additional battery. I can shoot and shoot and it seems that I worry less and less about having to change out the battery. The grip will add some weight. It may not seem like that much but if you have a speedlite and heavy piece of glass on the front you will notice your arm starting to get tired after a long shoot. Overall if you don't mind the weight that is added to your camera I think you will be happy with the grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batatery Grip","review":"I wouldn't have a SLR without a vertical battery grip.

But I still like that feature. Mostly I bought this to make series of vertical shots easier. This does make it easier, but there are two small drawbacks. With a neckstrap, the right side (the thin part near the camera) always slides over the viewfinder when I change from horizontal to vertical. Secondly, looking through the viewfinder with your hand so high above you is sort of awkward at first. It feels very different when your shutter-finger is near the top of your head instead of where it normally is at eye level. But getting over these small drawbacks, its a great addition to your Rebel. When I'm out shooting, the square shape of my camera and grip makes me feel like a pro with a 1dS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacture Defect","review":"Order the first one last week and I found that the corner of the leather on grip was peeling off.

It's well built and attention was paid to details in its construction (for example, the fact that it safely holds the camera's battery door so you don't lose it, and the fact that you can use alkaline batteries when your rechargeables are dead!) I also find that it makes it much easier for me to stabilize the camera when shooting in low light situations, resulting in sharper photos. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera works great without the extra grip","review":"Let's make this simple:Pros:Holds 2 standard batteries, extending your shooting time.Can also hold 6 AA batteries. For anyone who has ever run out of juice during an event, it is nice to be able to go to 7-11 and get back in action. This alone could make it worth the price.Adds counterweight to the flash unitCons:Makes the camera bigger and heavier. I do not like the bulk and weight. Even using a 200 mm zoom, I do better without it. For verticals, I just turn the camera and keep shooting. Canon did a good design on the camera, it does not need this.If I shot MOSTLY portraits, it might pay to have another shutter button.However, it does help balance the camera when the flash is attached (at the price of adding more weight.Bottom line: I do not recommend it.I gave it 5 stars because it is well designed and constructed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Grip","review":"Very easy to install.

That just leaves low paying service jobs left in this country.The U.S. will lose its Superpower and soon China and India will be the next superpowers and hold the U.S. hostage with huge export charges which will jack up prices on all goods they currently produce.

They were being collected by his producer Tommy Quon, who owned the label Ultrax. That label was struggling at the time.Just think. If \\"Scheek\\" went beyond being a local song, Goldfinger could've made millions!All of his songs have their own unique blend of rhymes and beats; from guitars to boom bass, and from standard rapping to fast rapping.If you were expecting stuff from the band, youre on the road to Nowheresville.But for those of you who just love all types of music, give this CD a go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruler of the Oud!","review":"Hamza's Eclipse is his best album.

I believe there are two seperate versions of this particular toy, one that comes with an interactive DVD and this one that plugs directly into the TV.

In these episodes, you will see ALOT of great action, you will hear the truth behind Yuskue's new found power's, and you will see the end of a great story arc.

Everyone must find their own feet to stand on. I find that the college students I teach respond well to this particular piece. The violence, gore and blood keep our up-to-date students involved. They also seem to respond well to Aaron. They are amazed at the evilness and the twisted plot. I will continue to teach this in my classroom and think this version is just fine for the beginning Shakespeare student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same Bard???","review":"Sometimes it's hard to believe this story was written by Shakespeare. Perhaps it was a warm-up to his better works (Othello, Hamlet, etc.). The Bard didn't take the time to explain the motives of the African villain making him seem more like a cartoon or metaphor for evil than an actual person. As an African-American perhaps I was longing for some deeper explanation of Aaron's emotions, rather than simply placing a dark-skinned man as the villain for the convenience of \\"dark=evil\\" imagery. The gruesome images of rape and disfigurement also didn't appeal to me, as enamored as I am of happier topics.This play was written purely for entertainment, much like our contemporary horror films. There are nuggets of quotable poetry (mostly the expressive curses and lamentations). Sci-Fi fans will giggle in Act II.I when Demetrius addresses Chiron as \\"youngling,\\" but as a whole, this is not one of my favorite plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Wizard of Gore","review":"This is perhaps The Bard's least well known work, but a classic nonetheless. If H. G. Lewis had been a playwrite living in Old England, this is no doubt the kind of drama he might have produced. It has more blood & violence than the most exploitive exploitation film. Heads severed off, murdered children baked into a stew & served to their father, rape, vengeance, mayhem, insanity... all served up in the guise of classic literature. PERFECT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guts, Gore, Gross...","review":"I will admit that I am definitely not a Sakespeare expert but read several plays in order to choose which enactment to see at the Stratford Festival. I didn't choose this one!This tradgedy was horrifying to read because of the sheer evilness of the characters and the outrageous violence throughout the story. There's deception, manipulation, rape, torture, gore and more gore. In my opinion, it isn't Shakespeare's most meaningful or enlightened work but it wasn't boring either. Hardly anyone escapes this story alive and the most redeeming quality, in my eyes, is that everyone in the end gets just what they deserve. This play must have shocked the audiences in the 1500's. If you're into violence and shock value this story won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review: So Bad It's Good","review":"(...)This is a particularly gory and bloody play, with at least one murder / rape / mutilation / act of cannibalism in every act, and others being planned-very sadistic, and not at all nice. The characters are one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, all actuated by some horrible form of revenge or sadism, and all plotting against each other, all two-faced (...). What little comedy there is, is black as the soul of the Moor Aaron: the comedy comes from the scene in which the Andronici are arguing over which of them will chop off their hand and send it to the Emperor; and from some of the worst lines in Shakespeare (...).

The dialogue is old school Hollywood with lots of ripostes that would never work in real life but were at least not infantile.

Farrah only had to be herself, one dumb blond playing another dumb blond. She was never famous for her brains or her talent which she had neither. Lindsay Wagner was a far superior actress winning the Prime Time Emmy for best actress for that year. Even though Farrah later claimed that she won that Emmy. Which made her not only brainless but a liar as well. Farrah never won anything. She was nominated for her role in the Burning Bed but didn't win.

Each page is a fun challenge to find an item a fairy dropped and lost within the picture. Even my five year old grandson had fun helping me find these well hidden objects. It was challenging, but we did find them all. Just when you think the fun is over you get a surprise at the end of the story to go back and find more things. A joyful book for ALL AGES!!

I've used it for a month now and can hardly notice any difference at all in the texture or colouring of the skin on my arms. Disappointing considering how much it cost. I'll continue using what I've bought. Hopefully eventually it'll show some benefits.I think it'd be good if the product description included the amount of the active ingredients in the products.

The best songs on the cd are 45, Burning Bright, and Lost In the Crowd. To the author of the comment that it's a controversial song it's really not that controversial. It's explaining about his situation of what he has learned in his life and sometimes you have to face the bullet sometime even if it is hard to take. Not to go kill yourself. That's like saying that Good Charlotte's song Hold On and Blink 182's Adam's Songs are also for suicidal people which they aren't. It's message to keep living no matter how life gets. It's also stating in the song that no one really knows what he believes and what he wants to do in the situation that is presented to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Shinedown, a band for the people put down by society, is a very unique one.

They are hit-makers and have a raw, hard-edged style with soaring vocals. Check out the hits \\"Fly From the Inside\\" and \\".45\\", but the whole cd is pretty great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time's the charm","review":"Whule flipping through radio stations, I happened to pause for the last few bars for Shinedown's \\"Fly from the Inside.\\" Intrigued, I bought the CD, but my first listen did not impress me, and it was banished to my glove compartment. But the songs had curled into my subconcious, and I found myself digging the CD out a few weeks later. That was when I fell in love. The lead singer's deep, full voice carries clearly over the powerful guitars, combining with the instuments to convey emotions with a talent that simply is not on the radio today. Shinedown keeps a delicate balance, letting raw emotion through without resorting to indescriminate shrieking that other hard rock bands are so fond of. The last, heartbreaking song on the album, \\"45,\\" catches me up every time I listen to it. No other singer could do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of fresh new music","review":"Shinedown are one of the few new bands that actually havet talent and are keeping the modern rock scene alive. Their whole album is perfect and it grows on me every time I listen to it. Their choice of videos is not the best to go with 2 of their slower songs but \\"45\\" just blew me away and it will never get old. Solid vocals, gritty guitars, perfect rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2004","review":"I heard 45 on the radio last spring and felt that it was the song of the summer. But it wasn't until I heard Burning Bright that I decided to give these guys a shot. So I bought the album and was shocked at how good it was. All the songs are powerfull with heavy guitar riffs and crashing cymbols. It's tough to pick a favorite on an album such as this, but I would have to say the best songs are \\"Stranger Inside\\" and \\"All I Ever Wanted.\\" One thing I would like to see on future albums is longer songs and maybe some guitar solos. All the songs besides their cover of Simple Man are within a one minute range of eachother. Other than that, the album is flawless and they deserve some more recognition for their music. Would have loved to see them live. Buy Leave a Whisper NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Listen!","review":"Wow it's been a while since I've heard a fresh CD like this.

The 4 man group from Jacksonville, FL, Shinedown, came correct with this album, this is about my 720th review and over 600 of them are rap album reviews but I do like some alternative music and this is one of the better albums I have heard. I don't have this version but I'd have liked to get the re-release of this with the remake of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Simple Man\\" and the 2 sonus tracks, but oh well. Back to the album, with 13 songs and 2 bounus tracks it's not the longest but it delivers. It has 2 classics, 3 ok songs, and the other 8 are good or real good songs, I'm not much of a fan of the acoustic song (although the original \\"45\\" is a great track)and I never heard track #14.

The rest descends into \\"I'm in pain . . . I'm in so much pain . . . look at the darkness around me . . . PAIN\\" shlock. At one point, the singer actually says \\"I'm staring down the barrel of a .45\\" (in an I-can't-take-it-anymore context, not in an I'm-being-mugged context).It's like Ozzy's music with Morrisey's lyrics. One star being the lowest I can go, I give it two, because the music's slightly better than mediocre (although the drummer almost ruins one of the songs by overplaying), and the singer's got above average range for this day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new band out there right now!","review":"I first heard 'Fly From the Inside' on my local station here in Knoxville. They have a thing called Southeast Exports where you can listen to local bands and stuff.

Perry's book should be taken as an official bio. It doesn't look at Dean's life in a sleazy way, but it does tackle questions about Dean's lifestyle in a fair & balanced method. The photos and layout are nice. There are extra informationa nd fact boxes relating to the chapter's material.

In fact, the book was probably the worst I have ever read. I honestly couldn't even get to the plot because the grammar and punctuation were so bad. There is a typo on the acknowledgement page, where the author dedicates the book to her \\"ion-laws\\" instead of her \\"in-laws.\\" On the first page of the book, the author switches from writing in past tense to present tense and back again. The thing that really blew me away was that in the author bio, it says that she has her Masters Degree!!! Besides the grammar, all I really felt this book showed me about military life (and I am an army wife myself!) was that everyone sleeps around and has really screwed up lives. Not really much of an insight to someone wanting to learn more about military life.

What a joke! This is a poorly written book in which the reader has to slog through 3/4 of the book in order to finally read about life in the military. And throughout the whole book there are the most outrageous typos and other editorial errors. Who was her editor? As a military spouse I could not relate at all to either of her charaters. The words and actions of Ms. Gaines's characters did nothing to help diffuse the common public misnomer that military personnel are the low class side of our society.

Later she finds her mom there -- who did NOT commit suicide, and yet, there was a body, because Lois had buried her mom, but here she is on this other world -- hmmm, major plot flaw. Most of this book didn't seem thought out. And really just bad writing. The 3 men weren't interesting at all and fell so quickly in love with humans. It seemed like they loved the women because they were from another world -- the world their mother was from -- hmmm, Oedipus complex???

The writing wanders all over the place and jumbles up the history of ancient Egypt into a mass of hyperbole and useless trivia - it's practically impossible to follow as coherent history.For teachers, do not buy this for your classes - no child or teenager with even the vaguest hint of ADD will want to watch this for more than 30 seconds.After the first few screenings, I like to have documentaries as background noise while I'm doing busy work at home. I can't even stand 15 minutes of 'Mummies' as background noise. I've given it two stars because it has SOME value historically."},{"rating":"1","title":"20/20 Hoarders","review":"What a rip off!

Not sure if \\"The Platinum\\" 05' (1cd only) is Vol 4, but it seems to capture some gems from all three cd sets (2 discs ea), and adds a DVD (34 min worship experience) to boot.Well, about this gem, I especially like the lite funky rocker, \\"The Light The Fire Again\\". Driving bass n drum line/phrase with background electric/ fuzz guitar, keeps it HOT! \\"Let Everything That Has Breath\\" is in the same vain, it cooks! Most the rest of the songs are more a laid back feel ( dubbed are some drum loops) med tempo to ballad style. After all, it's worship music, right?

It's their best album ever.It's similar to Kiko, displaying their mastery of rock'n'roll, blues, Mexican folk music, country, and psychedelia. It differs from Kiko in that the styles are even more melded together, and every track is so sharp and strong my mind is simply boggled.I had started thinking Los Lobos would never write a song that would relentlessly haunt me (like When The Circus Comes) again. I am gloriously wrong. I've listened to the album four times in two days and I can't tell you which track is the finest. Let me listen to it a couple of hundred times, and I'll get back to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different approach, still great","review":"Kiko is my favorite Los Lobos album. It should be in the top 50 albums of all time. This album is excellent. It doesn't have the super creative, sophisticated percussion of earlier Los Lobos efforts, but after listening, who cares. You can sway, rock, groove and move to the terrific songs. Some are bluesy, some bop, it's only on the reggae Latin beat tune that it does not really work. In some ways this is superior to earlier Los Lobos selections because the songs rest more on quality of the writing rather than the muscianship of a great band. Hidalgo and Company still manage to make the music vital and edgy. For those of us who grew up on rock n' roll in the 70's and 80's, Los Lobos shows what is possible if music is to develop and progress into a higher life form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Los Lobos is best when they sick to their roots","review":"Really like this CD - don't know what they're saying, but like the way they say it. Have liked these guys since \\"How Will The Wolf Survive?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Little things I could have...always on my mind","review":"Little things indeed! I think it even shares an interval on the turn. The second track is about endlessness and it seems endless. First few listens really got enjoyable from The City on through to The Town and I would even say that The Town and The City are the best tracks. Cesar Rosas is pretty quiet after his terrific songs on The Ride. But Los Lobos can't make a bad record and I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not Trying!","review":"I have been a fan of Los Lobos for over twenty years. The music has always inspired. This latest release, however, not only was uninspiring but I had a hard time staying awake through it. It has some lyrical moments that prevent me from giving it less than two stars but lacks any of the power and excitement of previous recordings. It just sounded old and tired, like they just weren't trying. If you have bought this disappointment and want to give them another try, I would suggest Good Morning Aztlan or one of my personal favorites, Colossal Head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the same old thing","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Los Lobos. I just think this theme of Mexican-American victimization has gotten old after about 10 albums and the music on this cd illustrates my point. There are a few good songs, including, \\"The road to Gila Bend\\", but by in large, the cd drags and puts you to sleep after a few listens. Check out \\"Kiko\\" and \\"Collosal Head\\" or \\"The Neighborhood\\" for classic Los Lobos or any of the Latin Playboy discs. Los Lobos is one of the premier American bands, but this is not one of their better efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"music fan","review":"boring, boring, boring, and uninspiring.

As far as I know a music CD is a thing you like to listen to, but not throw it out of your window. I can't say anything bad about Ernest Mosley but \\"Honey, You Are My Sunshine\\" seems to be made by a drunk World War I veteran recorded sitting in a bathroom.

When he opened the CD case it contained a CD called \\"G Unit - Return Of The Body Snatchers\\". I'm not sure if this was a joke by someone in the CD packaging business, or by G Unit or Amazon. We listened to it because as musicians we appreciate almost all kinds of music. Unfortunately it was not to our liking. I guess this would be the \\"Gangsta Rap\\" genre which neither of us appreciate due to the constant gunshot sample and the constant references to killing police and having sex. Sadly I tossed my receipt so I can't return it. I'll just purchase Planet Drum from the record store next time I'm there. Not a good joke in my opinion. I give it one star simply because it is music that someone wrote, played and recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"This is the first CD of all percussion I have ever bought, and it'll prolly be my last.

I think it should be 1 segment and then the last segment (the lunar flow) should be its own segment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Radiance...","review":"More advanced video than advertised. Wonderful strength and balance poses, but DO NOT try them unless you are well conditioned. Spring, fall and winter are warm up, strength and cool down seasons. Summer is particularly difficult and includes some of the most advanced yoga poses I've seen in my 10 years practicing. Wonderful to aspire to do, but you will hurt yourself if you go in without warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Radiance","review":"Contains yoga sequences of poses (vinyasa) drawn from Series I and II of Ashtanga yoga that are divided into 'seasons' with a narrator and three yoga instructors presenting the material. Previous exposure to this material or concurrent instruction would be helpful to understand the biomechanics of the individual poses and the details of their use. The format is not uniform throughout: in different parts of the video, both Sanscrit and informal English names of the poses are used, which would make it difficult to access additional material, such as the Yoga Journal website.Ably presented and useful for supplementary practice for all levels of practitioners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves to fast and is slightly weird","review":"This DVD moves through the poses at such speed that I cannot keep up or get fully into the poses. Also, the instruction is so minimal that at times she doesn't even state what pose is next. The names of the poses are not the traditional names that I am used to. The girls are doing yoga indoors, however they must have the furnace cranked because they are wearing extremely small clothes and sweating profusely. It is kind of uncomfortable. I agree with another reviewer that it felt kind of like it had a \\"soft porn\\" feel to it. I can deal with that, but not with the speed.Last night I tried to give it one more try and just did the lunar section -- seems hard to get that wrong. Again, they moved through the poses way too fast. I liked the sequence and choice of asanas, however I will just have to do them on my own at my own pace so I can get the benefits of the pose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely workout- not for beginners!","review":"I got this workout recently because I was intrigued by the idea of yoga practice for each season.

This is because Mr. Tegner's approach to self-defense took a more realistic and simple approach to learning self-defense and the martial arts. He always emphasized that learning effective self-defense is not mystical in anyway.This particular book covers all the basic technqiues and self-defense responses to numerous types of attacks, This book shows how to counter punching, kicking, grabs, chokes and other attacks. In conclusion, this book like any other physical skills text in that it has limitations. Using this text in combination with actual training with a competent self-defense instructor will produce the best results.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J.

I had never heard Michael Buble before, but he has three tracks on the CD and his voice fits the tone and time of the film perfectly. Two versions of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" were used interchangably in the film and I was glad to see both included on the CD. The score was interspersed with the vocal tracks but didn't interrupt the flow of the CD.And of course- the final track featuring Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger... Man, Ewan can sing and while Renee seemed a little outmatched at time she still sounded lovely.On the enhanced part of the disc is the video for \\"Here's to Love\\", which is seen in the movie with the end credits and links to the official sites (movie and soundtrack) and artist sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, Where's Judy Garland?","review":"Since Judy Garland's 1964 video of the title song (in the film said to be a guest shot on \\"Ed Sullivan\\" in '62. but in fact was a clip from her own CBS weekly variety series) is a major plot point (her appearance catapults the book to national best-selling status), it's odd that the audio clip of the performance is not included in the CD soundtrack. Has anyone else noticed this? As the author of \\"Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show,\\" I can only speculate that perhaps the reason for the omission is based on legal issues but, conversely, I know Sid Luft and Classic World granted permission (their names are in the closing credits for its licensing) so it would seem the Garland vocal should have been included. After all, the CD certainly had room for an extra three-minute performance. Oh, well. Loved the soundtrack, btw, particularly the final performance of the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up With This Soundtrack","review":"First of all, Down With Love is a great movie. The music compares ot the 60's romps, but it's full of a fresh zing and power. Since the movie used sly and cunning humor tospoof the flaws of 60's films, it's got quick suprise notes here and there. The songs Down With Love is funny and fresh, a tune you'll get in your head (And you'll want it there!). The other's, like \\"Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words)\\" isn't what people would say is one of Sinatra's most famous, but is one of the best; sly and romantic. The duo of Ewan and Renee in \\"Here's To Love\\" is good, but Ewan seems to take over the song. It's still another tune that'll get stuck in your head. A definite buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Cool Soundtrack","review":"This is a real cool soundtrack. If you saw the film or not this is a very neat soundtrack capturing all the fun times of the swinging era of the 60s. It's just such an enjoyable album to listen to. You get two cuts of \\"Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words).\\" You get Frank Sinatra and Astrud Gilberto and I love them both. This is a really likable CD that I have played over and over many times now."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOWN WITH LOVE IS UP WITH MEMORIES","review":"The soundtrack strikes a chord of Doris Day and Rock Hudson all over again. This soundtrack though \\"Down with Love\\" cries \\"Pillow Talk\\".With the past \\"Frank Sinatra\\" and the present \\"Michael Buble\\" this soundtrack has it all from the singers to the instrumentals, brings back good memories and puts a smile on your face.Go see the movie too, a fun little gem and a sweet delight that will make you remember the 60s when clothes were hip, drinks were style and people still had some class, and Tony Randall makes an appearance too.The soundtrack and the movie go together like a fine wine. 4 stars instead of 5 because the soundtrack needed more songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking Outside of the Box","review":"This book provides a good jolt to the creative juices and provides the framework to spark innovation.

It was made for TV and you can tell as the scenes wind down for a commercial break (although there are no ads on the Amazon version.). I believe it showed as being PG-13.

It is also a personal memoir of one man's coming of age, first as a citizen and soldier, then as a lover and spouse. The story is well told and, at times, beautiful. I have done extensive scholarly work on Don't Ask, Don't Tell, interviewing scores of gay and lesbian soldiers in the process. McGowan's book ranks among the most powerful of the stories that I have encountered.We all have a responsibility to understand the impact that our government's irrational and discriminatory policy has upon the gay and lesbian citizens who serve in the defense of our country.

Two different and incomplete versions of the story that Dick started to develop are just pasted together in a totally incoherent way. On top of that, one of the story developments is at best mediocre and the other is worse. I don't understand how anyone can give this a good review. I would love to know how the person who edited this atrocity ever got to be an editor for a major publishing house."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a fan of PKD but this","review":"is not a finished work. When authors leave something unpublished there is usually a good reason. According to the 'editor' of this volume, PDK published the beginning and the end of this book as a single, long short-story. Then he wrote an extension to go in the middle, but abandoned it. This extra section was 'discovered' more recently by the editor and stuck in place (or not) by him. As a result, although there are several solid PDK moments, the patched-together format is incomprehensible. A main character has two totally different story lines, and though that is not unusual for this author, he would tell you why. But this was not sent out into the world by the author, and therefore is not his. I guess publishing it is fine for hardened fans, but it's certainly not great for attracting new readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating story - with a small quality problem","review":"i really don't want to give away too much in respect for all those who haven't read the book yet. just this: written between WWII and the german reunion in '89, the story confronts the reader with a very frightening and amazingly visionary view of a possible future world. i personally found it most fascinating, including its weird detour into psychedelic paraworlds.the only negative aspect i feel i should mention here are the annoyingly numerous grammatical and spelling mistakes whenever dialogs or narrative is in german language - as a native speaker, i really got tired of stumbling over them, and i think it's a pity the editor - vintage books - didn't have a translator check the foreign language in the story for the sake of its overall quality and credibility ... given the fact that this is not the first edition of the story, and there is an existing german translation for cross-checking!other than that, it's a great and very consuming book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why drugs are BAD, ok?","review":"As others have pointed out, this was originally an excellent short novel titled The Unteleported Man. Then PKD was asked to write a second half some time after the drugs had done serious damage to his mind. Well, instead of being a continuation or a prequel, the second portion is slapped into the middle of the original. The new section is jarring, makes no sense whatsoever, and does not in any way fit into the original Unteleported Man story. While some may say the writing is a sterling description of a bad drug trip, it has no place within the story. Sadly, Lies,Inc, instead of being a masterpiece, like George Lucas' despicable later endeavors, is a travesty. Every copy should be burned, and the original left alone, in the un-buggered form that was first published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Good","review":"The advice that other readers give to just skip the stuff between pages 73 and 173, or to save it for a very rainy day, is good advice. That section of the book is terrible; bad writing in the service of who-knows-what concept. It's disjointed nonsense. Dick should have thrown it away.The rest of the book, the original novella, is pretty good pulp sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"All messed up","review":"Some good writing here but the story is all messed up.

The coverage is thorough, the exposition is tight and the use of graphics is restricted to just what is necessary to support the text. I particularly liked visualizations like the one on page 70 where the computer keyboard is related to a piano keyboard in a clever and effective form. Nice going on this one. The Missing Manual books can be inconsistent but this one is great and definitely worth it for the price. A must buy for GarageBand users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invigorating","review":"With all the fuss being made over young, photogenic pianists today, it is good to have this memento of Leif Ove Andsnes from the beginning of his career. There is no doubt in listening to this that, unlike some more recent artists, Andsnes had the goods right from the start. His approach to Chopin is vigorous and full of excitement. Tempos in No. 2 are a little on the fast side, less so in No. 3. Andsnes could not be confused with an older generation of pianists whose interpretations of these works was more overtly Romantic. He makes more sense of the last movement of No. 2 than just about anyone I've heard, and the lyrical elements in the first movement of No. 3 are not slighted in the least. His piano tone, whether from his own doing or the sound engineers', is somewhat brittle at times, emphasizing the impression of youthful vigor and rigor. This would be a welcome addition to anyone's Chopin collection. I also like budget priced recordings by Jerome Rose and Cecile Ousset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me want to buy all his old albums!","review":"So I had to spend [money] to realize that I really just need to own all his albums released through 1980 plus \\"Pride\\" from 1983.

Only way to justify this being on 2 discs would be to include at least 1 bonus track, which Columbia has done on some other artists' reissues. Other labels have reissued 2 LP sets on 1 CD, such as Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, The Who's Tommy & Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, so they should have done that with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"best of\\"","review":"I don't believe there is a better \\"collection\\" out there, apart from maybe the first bootleg series.

And for some of the most intruiging Dylan from a brief period around 1970 (not many of them \\"hits\\" as far as I'm aware) get this one. Some of the songs are downright masterpieces and you won't find \\"watching the river flow\\" on anything else either. \\"Masterpieces\\" is great but rare, \\"Biograph\\" is another worthy collection, but this one is concise, much cheaper, and has as consistent feel -almost as though it had been planned as a new album in it's own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you must have only hits, then okay.","review":"My problem with hits packages is that it's so easy to want to buy them, but then it sort of keeps you from buying other actual albums.

However, this book is not enough to really get you running smoothly.Linux is still not ready for the average user -- though the book would argue otherwise.

But most of the tracks on this compilation are vocal goodies. Many have heard this version of \\"Tired of Being Alone\\" by Al Green, and maybe also Al's cover of \\"The Letter\\", but chances are most of the other tracks are new discoveries, tunes from Hi Records stalwarts such as Don Bryant, Otis Clay, O.V.

Morphine are NOT the quintessential rock band. Why? well, instead of using the usual triumvirate guitar-drums-bass guitar they opt for a more uncanny instrumentation: drums-bass and saxophone. The result is so good that it has to be heard to be believed. There are uptempo, jazzy tunes (like Buena) and bluesy melancholy numbers (such as the title song).

I've always found Bitchy a grimly hilarious take on the petty awfulness of dull office jobs, crummy worker- and worker-management relations and the difficulties of being an aging singleton straight woman who relentlessly resists embracing life. Certainly anyone, male, female, gay, straight, whatever, who's done a dead-end job will relate to this character. But Roberta Gregory has also dug deeper into Bitchy/Midge, and I think most rewardingly in the strips in this book, in which we explore her traumatic 50s childhood and the horrors and delusions of adolescence and teen pregnancy in the late 60s/early 70s ('Hippy Bitch Gets Knocked Up'). These stories are moving because they are so entirely unsentimental. They are larger than life yet feel horribly accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good murder-horror rock","review":"No matter what band this singer is in, his lyrics never stop making me laugh. My only VERY MINOR complaint is the album is definitely not perfect, a couple of the songs are a bit slow and repetitive (no changes, pretty much the same riff from beginning to end) As others have mentioned, it is not quite as heavy as murderdolls, but this CD is still a must buy. At times, parts of this album remind me of Alice cooper, murderdolls, faster pussycat, and marilyn manson. The cd and music itself make it about a 4 star album, but the lyrics push it to 5 stars. If you look above, amazon has song clips, try listening to some of these songs: \\"Bad Things, God is a lie, Buried by Christmas, Haunt me. Anyway, verdict: not to much is coming out lately in terms of good, new music. So you better pick this one up. If that is not enough to sell this album, then go to a search engine, look the band up, and then find some of their lyrics.

What I will say no matter what your skill level, the pictures are hard to understand because within one pattern there are several patterns which you can't see in the image and have to think, versus the book giving you this.This book was clearly published with a concept in mind, but not enough consulting took place with the yarn manu or they simply provided them with old patterns.

The booklet is not without typos or factual errors (the writer places Pearl Bailey's famous ad-lib in the wrong song).

They were looking for a name, which they got, but poor Pearl couldn't do the job. She was completely lost on stage and it you can hear it in the songs. Although, the revival opened in 1968 off-Broadway and didn't last very long,it had a much better cast and the music direction was tight and well done. I remember how much I enjoyed my record back then on my tinny phonograph player, and what a pleasant surprise to find a CD. This one is filled with plenty of charm.

This book will surely bring happiness to your next Valentines Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memorable Read","review":"I love this book. My mom used to read it to me when I was small, and it has always been one of my favorites. I lost my original book many years ago but now that I am an aunt I have searched high and low to relocate it as a gift for my nephew. The short stories in the book are touching as well as humorous and have a way of gripping readers both young and old!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cd Would Have Been Great&#65533;","review":"Make sure that you check your compilation right when you leave the store. When I purchased this CD after seeing Dio this summer on tour, I opened the CD and there were two of the second discs. Not 1 and 2. Just be careful. Other than that it sounds like a great CD. I like the one I have, but got neglected on some of the earlier Ronnie stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of a Beast of a Performer","review":"As small as Ronnie James Dio is, he stands like a collossus amidst the rock Gods. This double set is one of two great collections from his early days up till fairly recent times. Whilst you can see the transition, or I should say hear, but DIO is just so evocative that you will get the picture, the transition from Straight up rock to the style of music that only this man with the magical voice has. He has a great voice in 70s material, and his vocal chords are still some of the best set still into the next Millenia. A true testament that pesistence and skill with ability to deliver, can provide quality material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful voice, distinctive personality, and powerhouse rock","review":"This collection, spanning the entire(?) career of Ronald Padavona (Ronnie James Dio) showcases the powerful vocals (first present in ELF, who I got to see in 1975, when they first toured with Deep Purple, and stopped in St. Louis, MO; through the days with Rainbow, and Black Sabbath, as well as his master solo career, from the molten metal classic Holy Diver, to Strange Highways, this unique rock personality showcases some powerhouse songs, such as The Last In Line, We Rock, Carolina County Ball (not metal, but pretty damn good rock), and many others. Can't wait until volume 2 is compiled. [I own all of the individual solo work, as it's well worth it for the material not included on this collection.] Congratulations to Rhino, for finally giving this underrated singer his due. Also recommended, Rainbow's Anthology, Catch The Rainbow, see in a future review.Peace, Love, and Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt through the shadows","review":"This book was a pleasure to read. The language was masterfully crafted, a real tribute to both the author and the translator. The seduction of power in its many forms is considered by the protagonist who recognizes how those around her come under its sway but who, only in retrospect, sees its impact directly on her. As she progresses through the novel, she causes the reader to consider the essence of guilt and of shame and how they are tied together. In today's political climate, it is interesting to reflect on what the German populace knew during the World War II era and Knauss makes us reflect on that society's and our own society's responsibility for allowing cruel, totalitarian leaders to continue in power.Three months after completing this book in our bookclub, we still find ourselves returning to this book as a point of departure for discussing our other readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eva's Boring Cousin","review":"I guess this is is proof that one can experience history without having an original though in one's head. Perhaps its the historical fiction aspect of this novel, but \\"Eva's Cousin\\" is so much an observer in her own life, I began not to care very much what happened to her and those around her. Perhaps if she had been closer to the center of power, the dispassionate nature would have worked in a fly on the wall sort of way, but given that she never met Hitler and was on the periphery, late in WWII, of the Nazi circle. I understand the account is fictionalized, though its hard to see what aspects of it were so exciting as to have to have been invented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"This book is a novel written by a cousin of Eva Braun, who never met Eva until 1944. She spent a few weeks at her side, but admits in interviews that she never met Adolf Hitler, nor did she ever speak to him. Even more insulting to the reader is that Eva never spoke about Hitler to her cousin. The reader is then forced to ask, \\"What is the point of this book?\\"The answer is... nothing. Being a blood relative of Eva Braun doesn't entitle one to write a book which contains nothing whatsoever of interest, either historically or emotionally. The content is desultory and devoid any new nuggets on Hitler. Though it's written with reasonable skill, the end result is boredom for the reader. Had the author not been related to Eva Braun it would never have found a publisher, and that would have been the most pleasant outcome of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical Analysis Simplified worth every penny","review":"I found Technical Analysis Simplified to be an apt description of what Droke explains in this book-an extremely simple, easy to read way to forecast from stock market charts. This book is great in that it can be read in one or two sittings and is a helpful reference manual for looking up chart patterns that occur over and over in the market. Droke does in a little over 100 pages what Edward & Magee took over 500 pages to do. The reader who trashed this book apparently doesn't know how to read, because the introduction to Droke's book is less than six pages long. Murphy's book is also good, but is too long and much more complex. (BTW, this book is NOT out of print, as the reviewer below claimed because I got it in a couple of days from Amazon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Title Would Be: Technical Analysis Unsimplified","review":"There is a reason this book is out of print. Just getting through the first chapter was painful. The book reads like a high school term paper. I couldn't bring myself to read anymore. I ended up taking it back and getting a refund. The most useful part of this book was the suggested reading in the back, which I used to purchase \\"Technical Analysis of Financial Markets\\" by John J. Murphy instead. All I can say is this one is a keeper. It's easy to read and eventhough it was twice as much, it is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor arrangements.","review":"Only 1 Star for the album. 5 Stars for Peter Hammill. \`In A Foregn Town' isn't a representative album.The real problem here are the arrangements.Very poor and repetitive in \`new wave' style.

And, I guess it was a bit over-done, but Malory's grief was acceptable. But, after that - there was no point left to the story. There was not one single obstacle put in this woman's way - everything she tried to do turned into a roaring success! She hints at money problems immediately after the husbands death - yet there is no indication ever that money is a concern. Matter of fact, she just buys whatever she wants, keeps a staff of housekeepers on the payroll while she trots off to England for six months. Who was footing the bills?Anyone who struggled after the death of a spouse, or anyone who ever struggled to build a business best NOT pick up this book. You'll end up throw it across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Having read the majority of Bradford's books, this was very disappointing. Some parts of the storyline just didn't work like the founding partner's son-in-law's poor performance was never explained. I actually felt that because of his bad business practices would have led to the murders of Andrew and the children and not by the thugs in Harlem. It was all too much or not enough. The ending was the worst. Some man down the street and around corner befriends Mal and her Sarah. They dine, drink coffee, he travels, purposes, Mal considers her answer and they shack up. End of story!? Honestly, this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional book. Very well written.","review":"There are people that think the best never happens.

I made it almost all the way to the end of cassette 1 out of 11.Oh my dog, this book is so bad. The adverbs are reminiscent of an old bodice ripper, where you will find such overused and misused gems as irretrievably and irrevocably.

Includes 32 key phrases of special theological importance like \\"Angel of the Lord\\" and \\"Children of God\\". Includes over 1000 common words in the KJV, and gives their NKJV equivalences. Even includes in the back a list of the 100 most common articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and pronouns (without the context lines).For quality, the book's binding is average, but the pages are thicker than most, using the same amount of paper while containing 300 less pages. Not too much to complain about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very simplistic Information you probably already know","review":"I bought this book since it was the most up-to-date book discussing financial careers.

Get this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Akufen Records is Very Good, but...","review":"But...I must take exception to the first review on this page. There are plenty of \\"serious\\" music fans who DO NOT consider house music to be a \\"stain in the history of electronica\\". Quite the opposite in fact - house music has and continues to be one of the most creative and inspiring forms in popular music today.It is NOT surprising that artists like Herbert and Akufen produce/create house music, as it's a form that has constantly evolved to accommodate a myriad of styles and offshoots. It would appear that this reviewer has minimal knowledge of house music beyond the pop/house of \\"Leftfield, Daft Punk, & Basement Jaxx\\", or he/she would know that it has had more than a \\"minor influence\\".\\"Isn't it odd?\\" Yes, it is!

This one album and its follow-up \\"Vast Haloes,\\" can be considered the earliest definite form of the genre now called trip hop. All the features are here: surreal lyrics, ethereal voicing, unusual arrangements, danceable ethnic rhythms, unexpected turns of musical phrasing. A side project by Steve Kilbey of The Church, he had his then love interest Donnette Thayer do the vocals to songs he composed that he felt were outside his band's range. He would later employ some of these experiments on The Church album \\"Priest = Aura\\" in 1992. If you want to see the kernels where My Scarlet Life, Portishead, and even Dead Can Dance started, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worth Steve Kilbey side project","review":"Like the review below, I enjoy the first Hex album very much. Of the two CDs, this one is the more essential. It is focused, has better songs, and is the better representation of the fruit of the labors of Steve Kilbey (The Church) and Donnette Thayer (Game Theory). Songs such as 'Diviner', 'Ethereal Message', and 'An Arrangement' are excellent cuts that are among the best of any Church member's side projects. Also, despite the 'goth'-style cover, this isn't a goth album in any way, so don't order it expecting dark and gloomy. It may not be sunny pop, but this is a work that reveals new intricacies every time you listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"I just have the pedal 3 weeks now, its responding well on foot movement.

It may not be the fastest model around, and i'll probably change it for that reason (my foot is too slow, hehe) or maybe get a double pedal one day, but for a beginner like me this is perfectly ok.For the price it's probably the best model around.

You go through a dialogue, then you read the grammar trying to learn how the language works, but you get little or nothing. The language information comes in rigid blocks that have little or nothing to do with the more practical sections of the book. A logical link is missing between the two. It is very difficult to learn the language with this course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather frustrating","review":"Basically I find this course very difficult to follow.

It is one of Klemperer's best live performances of the 9th, right up there with the Philharmonia live version (Testament) and the Concertgebouw version (M&A), both from 1957. By 1960, KIemperer had been through yet another near-death experience (burned from smoking in bed), and had responded with his usual determination. This is a dramatic, hortatory 9th, well-paced, emphatic, and well performed. The sound is boxy and unappealing, but the performance is first-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The full book has been published.","review":"Although this bootleg/samizdat edition served a purpose, the full book has been published in 1994.Get it hereThe Truth, the Way, the Life: An Elementary Treatise on Theology: The Masterwork of B.H.

Although I only have a few of his albums so far, this one again comes up short for me. Sonny seems to have many sides though and I give him credit for his attempts at a variety of ideas and sounds. I am not at all familiar with Skopelitis but I have to say I can't often tell which is which on this unaccompanied duet effort. Some tunes, like the first one, really strike me as pretty mundane efforts. Other tunes have a fairly nice feel to them but it is mostly very simple ramblings relying heavily on the electronics for that Bill Connors / Return to Forever effect. It just doesn't generally come off as powerfully as Bill & Chick pulled off and it lacks all the other instrumentation that made RTF pretty inspiring for it's day. This is OK but it doesn't seem worthy of what Sonny is capable of from what I have heard of his earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rainforest in Your House","review":"Ruth Happel and Rykodisc's 'A Month in the Brazilian Rainforest' is a valuable addition to anyone's environmental recording collection.

The book flowed very well and you won't even notice how fast you are turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simplistic, disappointing tale","review":"I was really excited to read this book, but about halfway through I just wanted it to end. This book was far too simplistic and broad for its subject matter. The three boys are real cardboard, two-dimensional characters. The trek through the jungle, I thought, just skimmed the surface of the atmosphere it was capable of. In fact, the whole riddle of the codex is nearly forgotten! I'm a big fan of Preston's and Child's writing, their collaberation is terrific. But this one is poor at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"I love other Preston/Childs books so I thought I would love this one. I didn't. It is completely predictable. I was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists, but there were none. And parts of it were ridiculous: the length of the entombment, the amount of the treasure, the manner of transport, etc. The only character I really liked was the monkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I am a big fan of Preston and Child. I thought The Cabinet of Curiosities was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I wasn't expecting much of Still Life with Crows and thought that was excellent as well. So, although this is minus Child, I was anticipating the Codex with great excitement. Unfortunately, I was let down.The premise is pretty good, but the story is way too shallow, as are the characters. Most things are fairly unbelievable and the plot just seems get more and more unrealistic as they venture further into the jungle. The love story is completely pathetic. Why even make the love story part of the plot when you are going to devote about 1 full page to developing it, and most of that consists of a sexual encounter in a hut after struggling through the jungle for a week to the point of near exhaustion? I got about 7/8 of the way through the book then decided it was not even worth my time to reach the conclusion.I'm looking forward to Brimstone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be taken too seriously","review":"The Codex is the type of book you grab to read on the plane or on a beach. It is a light-weight thriller with an improbable, but interesting, premise and good action sequences in the Honduran rainforest. While there are quite a few things left unexplained (e.g., Hauser ends up with a whole lot more equipment than he seemed to be carrying earlier in the book) and a number of things that just don't seem too realistic, the pacing is fast, the adventure is compelling, and there is enough humor tossed in that you know you aren't supposed to be taking things too seriously. The things that moves this up from middle-of-the-road action fare are the two jungle characters and the fact that Preston manages a credible way to escape once or twice when you are convinced he has written himself into a corner. Not as good as his earlier book, RipTide, in my opinion, but a rollicking good read. Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"This book is only good for light entertainment.

I honestly was wondering whether the book was written by a junior high school student. When I learned that it was actually written by a successful author, I was astounded. Obviously there are readers out there who enjoy this kind of writing since Mr. Preston is a NY Times best selling author, but I have to wonder how such a book could appeal to a reader with a fully developed sense of social interaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst chapter and a paragraph I ever read!!!","review":"This book was so painfull it made a trip to the dentist sound enjoyable.

As with Child's books, I found this book to be a great thriller, but not as powerful as a P&C collaboration.

I hope they make this into a movie -- it was great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bungle in the jungle is right","review":"Having read all of Preston-Child's collaborative efforts (and considering myself a fan), I was/am shocked and saddened at how bad this book is. I've read 'Deep Storm' by Lincoln Child and enjoyed it. I've also read 'Monster of Florence' by Douglas Preston and enjoyed it as well - So their solo efforts can be good and engaging - I just don't know what happened here... How could Preston send this to the publisher? How could an editor approve it? Truly, shockingly bad. I only made it to about page 90 before putting it down. I just couldn't take any more. Instead, I picked up 'The Terror' by Dan Simmons and I am enjoying every word.Time's too precious to waste on bad books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Codex should be your book - buried treasure - should have been rated 5 STARS!","review":"The team Preston-Child is one of the most wondrous writers of today. Individually, they outshine themselves! The Codex is a treasure - literally and figuratively - three + brothers on a wild ride to find their father's inheritance in the Honduras. It spawned an excellent sequel, Tyrannosaur Canyon, but Codex is amazing - non-stop action as the Broadbents find what treasure really is -One of the most wonderful 'characters' is Hairy Bugger - he features prominently in the plot and readers will really loved Bugger's part.Mr. Preston, keep 'em coming - Fans of good reads - this ranks high up the list.Should have been a 5 star review, but my finger must have slipped!!! 5 stars folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Read, Predictable Plot, Yawn.............","review":"I am a big fan when Preston & Child collaberate (except Still Life with Crows, booooring).

Leave this rubbish to the other guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"This is my third book read by these authors; Riptide, Thunderhead (both great - 5 stars).

I plan to check out other books by the authors including Relic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial Characters","review":"Artificial characterization of too beautiful people made them unbelievable. The plot was interesting and decently told. However, the descriptions of the persons acting out their roles was Victorian era and did not fit the time table of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced adventure","review":"Codex is great entertainment if you like reading adventure novels. The action shifts focus quickly between the point of view of the main characters. The chapters, all 87 of them (yes, 87 chapters in 404 pages), were short, some only two pages long. The introduction of the subplot involving Julian late in the book seems a bit puzzling, but didn't distract from the book overall. All-in-all it was a good book, not great, but very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greetings from the dead","review":"The premise of the plot was exciting however, I felt that the story was a bit boring. Maxwell Broadbent wants to send his children on the daunting task of searching for their inheritance as he buried himself with his riches in a Central American jungle. The beginning and the end of this novel were intriging but I had trouble staying awake while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloriously Stupid","review":"So, like, this rich guy's dying of cancer but he still has enough get-up-and-go to schlep $1 billion worth of renaissance art, ancient books, gold and silver, etc to central america, across a vast swamp, up a river guarded by indians with serious anger management issues, to an ancient redoubt deep in the cloudforest. And he's gonna, like, bury himself with all this stuff. And then his three sons (by three different mothers) set out -- individually -- to stop him. And then--Well, I won't give it away. It's an utterly ridiculous story, too silly even for Hollywood (though I'm probably wrong about that). Still, the writing ain't bad, and if your TV's busted, well, this might be a good way to kill a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Codex","review":"I loved this book, Jungle adventrues are fun and this one was great. If you want an escape then read this book.

After reading other books by Preston and Preston & Child, I expected a much better story. The Codex reads like it was the first book he ever wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"If you love the works of Preston and Child, but have been holding off on trying out their solo books, this is a good one to start with. It's an adventure in the Amazon with a strong mystery element. There's no character like Agent Pendergast, but the characters are still well-rounded and interesting. I put The Codex a notch below most of the Pendergast books but still in the upper echelon of action and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was rather disappointed in this book. The information on the history relating to books was interesting, I'm not the least involved in computer games so that was lost on me, and the story rather plodded along without real suspense, without a murder, and with a horribly-done ending. I definitely wouldn't compare it to Di Vinci Code in terms of a page-turning read but if you've nothing else on the shelf or are stuck at the airport, it's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to insult your readers","review":"Readers over grade 4 level beware: this book will confuse you. Despite good media reviews, The Codex is so badly written it's almost impossible to read.

He takes us through one of his toughest seasons ever, both on and off the field. If more people read this book they wouldn't believe the hype of Tom Osborne being a \\"win at all costs coach\\", rather they would see him as he is - a simple, caring, religious man with a love for football and the kids he coaches. The sports world could use a few more role models like Dr. Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Dr. Tom's three books.","review":"It's a little too defensive, a little too closed up. I think, with time to look back, he creates a more persuasive work with Faith in the Game. Coupled with Osborne's eventual retirement two years later, the book seems even more like a cover than it might as first. I imagine it was a hard work to complete with full honesty.Nebraska fans may love this chapter in the Osborne trilogy the most, however, because it acts as a direct refutation to the media's charges during the 1995 national championship season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie's carrier at a glance","review":"Bowie's carrier has to be one of the most varied and most interesting in rock history. With so many album and so many different songs, making a compilation is not the easiest thing to do.

There are all - time greats in the likes of \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Rebel Rebel\\", \\"Golden Years\\" and the unforgettable \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Ashes to Ashes\\". Dance hits \\"Let's Dance\\", \\"China Girl\\" and \\"Blue Jean\\" round up this compilation (it's a shame \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" is not in here).If you're not planing on collecting all of David Bowie's albums, then this is a good choice for you. However, it's just a tip of the iceberg in Bowie's carrier. Even if you do plan on getting all of his albums, get this one first. It'll be a good starting point and it'll show the way Bowie changed his sound through out the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can find it well worth it","review":"This is a CD that has grown on me.

The Sony lenses at about $600 were a bit to rich for my blood so I looked for a non-Sony lens. Everyone kept trying to sell me the Tamron 18-250mm lens but once again , you are talking $650. or more. I finally decided on this lens. I have to tell you, I'm blown away. It focuses quickly and the quality of photo is amazing. It is a bit slow at longer focal lengths but it is still an amazing lens. I did take advantage of the Tamron rebate- that was a bonus- but even without it, I would have been one happy camper!! FYI- if you buy one- check out Mel Pierce camera through Amazon- just a great deal and wonderful buting experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Picture quality wise, it was OK, but not great.

It's a really good multi-purpose lens to keep around with you.

I've read some reviews and while I'm sure they are accurate, I just don't believe my photography skills will match this lens' capabilities for quite some time.

Great results. Highly recommended for everyday use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all-around lens for the money","review":"My Nikon D90 came packaged with this lens and I've found that this lens can really do it for most occasions. It's 18-200mm flexibility allows for a variety of shooting situations without the hassles of swapping out lenses on the fly. It takes sharp, crisp and clear images and is fully compatible with the D90. However I rated only 4 stars simply because of the fact that this lens does not have the VR (Vibration Reduction) feature of Nikkor lenses. To what extent this may or may not be an issue depends on the person shooting the picture but to me, its a convenience I can get by but would be nice if it had it. So, if you are looking for a lens for your Nikon DSLR, check this one out...Great flexibility (18-200mm) for most situations and good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron 18-200 for Pentax","review":"I'm happy with it. Worth the price. It's compact and lightweight. Can do portraits at 18mm and zoom over birds and distant subjects. It is also reasonably good for macro photos - tried it in some butterflies and small insects.Problems: Needs a lot of light. Cannot control aperture manually in the lens (most people may not care about that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"fuzzy photos","review":"I am really unhappy with this lens... unless I am in bright sum it seems all my photo's are extremely fuzzy.

It seems like a great idea -- but one must remember that a super zoom must make many trade-offs. My first bad experience was trying to put two Tiffen filters on. At 18mm it created a black shadow on the sensor. I then started noticing the lack of sharpness and distortion compared to the stock Nikon 18-70 lens. For most of my shots, it probably is OK. But when one counts -- I don't think it will deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Leans","review":"I don't recommend this Leans, the one I got it is not sharp and all the pic it takes are soft and not sharpmaybe the one I received is like this but I can write a review for the product I got"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you buy a 200 dollar lens you get a 200 dollar lens","review":"so i guess ill give it the benefit of the doubt and say it took good pictures at 18mm to about 70mm, but after that you might as well digital zoom it. i bought this lens only a month ago and its already toast. i pulled it out of my bag this weekend to shoot with and and the mount was completely detached and broken. so i popped it back together (because its made of the same plastic as a coke bottle) and the focus ring was locked. i tried and tried and tried to get it to move but it ended up breaking again. this time the zoom ring was locked too. i will never buy a tameron lens again. you cant afford to buy cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow or non functional auto-focus","review":"I should have listened to the other reviews that stated poor auto focus on this model.

I am not expert enough, nor do I have time with 4 small children running around to spend the time to manual focus. THe kids are gone before I would be done focusing! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for basics, not for professionals","review":"This lens is appealing for its wide to zoom abilities. BUT it has a very VERY small focus. The focus seems to move around constantly, especially if there is any kinds of movement. It seems good for still life but for people it does not work well. I tried shooting a wedding and a portrait with it and found many of the images were out of focus and while I was working with it the focus kept moving all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"good lens for the money","review":"This lens is on my Pentax K100 super and does a good job.

However, it tends to be a little slow to focus on my D90, especially in low light."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN EXPECTED","review":"I bought this lens a month ago and for my CANON T2i. It performs like advertised. Great zoom, very good build quality, light weight and very classy feel. Easily mounts to camera, and feel good in my hands for shooting. Since is doesn't have [image stabilizer] I usually only use it during the day in good light. Use of a tripod is optional if your hands are steady. Close-ups are crisp and even when I crop the photo, everything is clean. It is now my all around lens for trips. I have a high speed lens for indoors and museums.I just finished shooting some great photo's using the shutter priority setting on the T2i. I was amazed at the clarity and the color was also great. For longer shots [over 100mm] I double the shutter speed to help control stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron AF 18-200mm Zoom Lens for Nikon","review":"I gave this lens as a gift to my son. He wanted to get into photography for the first time so I gave him a Nikon 3100 body and this lens. It's a great lens for everyday use. The pictures he took were so vivid. I was happy with the purchase and shipment. Oh, and thanks for the rebate too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens","review":"I just purchased this lens for my Nikon D50 that I had been using the Nikkor 18-55mm and Nikkor 55-200mm lenses on. These were good lenses but it was becoming very annoying to have to swap lenses constantly. The Tamron lens is worth it just for convenience but it also takes great pictures. I have been playing with it for a few days and all my photos have looked as good if not better than with my previous lenses. I decided on the 18-200mm lens over the 18-250mm lens based on recommendations from friends that are amateur photographers, the reason being that once you get up to and over the 200mm range you really need image stabilization at the longer ranges. If I decide I need a lens with greater than 200mm zoom range then I will probably buy a true telephoto lens with image stabilization. So far I can't see why some reviewers gave this lens negative reviews and less than 4 stars. I think it will be serving by photography needs for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then expected.","review":"When I first bought this lens, I thought the color would be a bit distorted based on other comments. When in fact the color is nice. Not professional grade, but just right for my family. I have two little girls that run a lot, and for the most part, this lens can keep up with them. There are times when the focus is slow; but not often. Always use a tripod when shooting past 120, you will get to much motion and the lens can not help with that. Our Paris photos came out good with my Nikon lens, but our Bavaria photos came out just as nice with this Tamron. Bottom line, if you are not a professional or have less then a professionals budget, this is a great lens you will be happy with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around lens","review":"I use this lens on my Canon XS and have gotten some really good shots with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one lens for traveler","review":"This lens is good enough on my Canon rebel XT.

I should have just kept saving for the real deal. This is one of the WORST lenes I've ever owned and I have been a photographer for over 30 years. I got it in August and didn't take many shots until I went on vacation at the end of September. Now I have 167 files that over a third of the image is blurry. Since I waited past my 30 days, Amazon wouldn't help me. I sent the lens back to Tamron for warranty repair. I got it back and it is better, but still not really sharp. How disappointing! I've always hoped for a lens that would cover all the bases, but I guess having it be sharp is TOO MUCH to ask!!! My recommendation, is RUN the other way from this lens.I've used Tamron a LOT over the years and never had a problem....this is a true lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grey Market product from Amazon - Beware!","review":"According to my invoice, the item was sold directly by Amazon.com, LLC. However, when I shipped the item in for warranty repair, Tamron informed me the lens did not have a serial number which probably meant it was a grey market product. Because there was no serial number, the warranty was voided.I don't know where this serial number is supposed to be, but I doubt it fell off. This can only mean Amazon is sourcing this product from a questionable source hoping that there will be no need for repair.Amazon did however return the item for a full refund. They did not explain how the item could come without a serial number.I don't know how this happened but it does cause me to be concerned about where they are getting their products and if they are going to be covered by warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow focus","review":"I am a professional wedding photographer and I tried this lens on my canon 7D at my daughter's Halloween party at school. I'm glad I didn't bring it to a wedding off the bat. The room (as most school rooms are) is well lit from windows and the florescents were on - the lens couldn't pick up on the dark costumes to grab fast enough. It hunted a lot and I lost some shots. At the widest, there was A LOT of blur around the edges. Not a crisp shot. I returned it today (after receiving it the day before yesterday). I do have another Tamron zoom that is slow to focus, but this one was much slower in lower light - would not have worked at a wedding ceremony (especially a church) nor a reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this lens for a Rebel T1i","review":"My husband bought me this lens for christmas and I was so excited to start shooting with it. When I attached the lens it kept giving me a Err 01, clean lens contact. Well I did, several times and knew it was not my camera because my other lens was working. I started to search this problem to see what to do about it, and found that many people have this issue.In further reading I found out that in the locked position it does this, and if you unlock and turn it ever so slightly it works. I am not comfortable having a lens that can not be locked. It appears that the contacts on this lens don't line up properly with the contacts on the camera body in the locked position. I don't know if it works better with other versions of the rebel but I do know, don't buy it for a T1i."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focusing Problem","review":"Sadly, I am returning this lens. Shooting in low light, it can't seem to autofocus. Using my bedroom overhead light and focusing on something across the room, it will zoom in and out while it flashes to find its focus, and when it is done with its process, it is very blurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Focus","review":"I was very disappointed with this lens. I purchased it to replace my Canon 28-135 IS as it was too bulky plus I would get a bit more zoom.Close in this lens takes some good shots, I posted a few at pbase. The problem was that at anything over 150mm everything out past 15 - 20' was a blur. I tried the 28-135 at similar focal lengths and the IS beat it hands down. Granted there is that 'IS' function, but even with it off it was much better.I tried this lens on both my Rebel (A300) and my Rebel XT (A350) getting the same results.End result, Tamron 18-200 is going back (just packaged it with the RMA# right now). I am keeping the IS, I've grown to re-like it. Will either get the 70-300 IS (which is why I am out at Amazon right now), Canon 100mm Macro, or the Sigma 105mm Macro in its place.I would NOT recommend this lens to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work well with K-7","review":"I havent tried this lens with any other camera but I'm assuming that its not compatible with Pentax K-7. The distortion was off the charts at just about anything less than 100mm. I returned this and got a Pentax 50-200mm and it works like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I am a fairly serious photographer, and I have a pretty extensive lens selection. I wanted an all-in-one lens for days that I didn't have specific shoots planned, but wanted to keep a camera with me just in case. I have used Tamron lenses in the past, and the ones I've used have been pretty good. Unfortunately this one isn't nearly as nice.The main issue I have with it is that it can't focus very well indoors. Now I realized before I bought the lens that it probably wouldn't focus that quickly, or quitely, but I'm telling you, it has real issues focusing in low light. Even with a speedlight attached to the camera it still has issues.Sometimes even in good light it takes it a couple of passes to focus, so you have to really pay attention to make sure you're getting an in-focus picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron lens","review":"Have had the 'itch' for a new general purpose lens for a while, and saw this one. With the price, and the features, seemed hard to pass up. My order was received quickly, and the lens is everything it says it is...I would like to see it focus a little faster...it seems to need more light than my other lenses to hit the focus point clearly, but other than that, this is a very nice product. My shots are clearer, and cleaner than with my other lenses, and the 62 mm size brings in a lot more light. A great general purpose lens. Shipping was extremely prompt, and Tamron was more than timely with the rebate. An outstanding buy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment","review":"This lens has exceeded my expectations!!!!

In limiting its scope to what the reader will immediately be concerned with (i.e. understanding what Aristotle is talking about, rather than e.g. discussing later criticism, etc) Broadie has leisure to be thorough. The translation is okay, but I think Irwin's (published by Hackett) is better on the whole.One complaint: I would prefer it if, in the text, references to the commentary were signalled somehow (w/ an asterisk (as in Irwin's) or whatever). Broadie's discussion is so insightful that it often reveals obscure implications of seemingly straight-forward lines, lines of which the reader might not be aware that he or she has anything to gain in reading a comment. So, one has to constantly keep a finger in the back of the book while reading, randomly checking the commentary and then going back to re-locate the relevant lines in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"reminds me of Turkey","review":"These coasters are very decoartive, oriental, and very lasting.Being turkish I can not think of any other coaster rug to use after seeing these cute little rugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent a different item than the one I ordered","review":"I looked around to match a scrapbook I had at home, to give my grandkids matching scrapbooks of their own.I found this site which had a photo of the exact book I was wanting.

Because they so rapidly become outdated.Everyone was making less in 1994.

My daughter likes this teether still because it reminds her of a pacifier (which we are having a hard time leaving behind but that is a different story).

Maybe they are better readers than I am, but frankly, I missed the point somewhere along the line. The novel just didn't work for me. It starts out with the lawyer who was wrongfully accused and then moves on to a list of other characters that just don't fall together or make any sense.Perhaps the doc should stick to medicine. Or maybe he'll try his hand at writing another novel. I commend him for his effort but I can't offer my praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"nc student/Enloe High School","review":"From the title, I expected the book to be full of folly and sexual content; however, I was suprised at the textual content and intergral plot developments.

It is full of idiotic New Orleans cliches, completely one-dimensional characters, and innumerable inaccuracies. All of these things could be excused if at least an interesting, believable story were told. However, the book seems little more than an excuse to get the reader to buy book number two in order to answer questions raised by this book. Since this book was pure garbage, I think I'll save my money. I truly cannot imagine how anyone can recommend this book with a straight face and a clear conscience. I must agree with another reviewer, if only it were possible to give it no stars.Miles"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Orleans Classic","review":"Obviously the past two reviewers who have given Murder at the Butt a one rating have not taken the time to examen the brilliance of the work.

A great collection of Christmas songs with that unique Caribbean flavour for a real departure from the usual North American/European classics. All different moods from ballads to exuberant dance-ables and mellow jazzy stuff, too. All Caribbean cultures are represented here with new and old songs. The liner notes alone are worth the price of the CD! In addition to the lyrics are factual notes about each song explaining the cultural and historical aspects -- I learned a lot just from reading them! And Machel's Soca Santa is now an absolute staple in our house every Christmas. You can't not dance to it and my nieces in Boston play it all year 'round! Give yourself a great gift and buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDS MUCH MORE IMPOROVEMENT!","review":"The idea is great, it just needs some major improvements. The most glaring problem is the NON-PORTABILITY FACT. This unit plugs into the wall only and has no battery power to be able to take it with you to show off your pictures. That majorly [stinks]! Another major pain is the fact that the item only has PHONE JACK hookups. Look, it has to connect to the internet to get information and pictures anyway and PHONEJACKS take forever so they should also add the option of ETHERNET/NETWORK hookup. If they could add those features to the new model when it comes out I would be much more intrested in trying it again but this one has got to go. If you want PORTABILITY and SPEED, than you do not want this model. Wait for them to improve on their new technology. And hey, even better, How about support for more than just COMPACT FLASH cards too? Back to the re-drawing board for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke very quickly!","review":"I bought this item because you dont have to connect it to a network for it to work. You just store your pictures in a compact flash card. I did like it, however I must say that it would show some pictures too many times, and others would never be shown. It sounds like a small problem, but it gets very annoying. Eventually the item broke during a trip to Europe, when I tried a store bought DC adapter that didnt have the Amps needed. I know it might have been my fault, but given it being such an expensive item, I felt that it was made kind of cheaply to break just because it was pluged two seconds with the wrong Amps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!","review":"This thing's a total waste of time and money.

I own one and am looking to begin a class action suit against Kodak for misrepresentation of the product. As a long time user of Kodak products, this is the third time that this company has left me with a nearly worthless product, and I will never again purchase anything that has the Kodak label or is manufactured, merchandised, or supported by Kodak.

The picture quality is excellent, the connection time is fast, and the setup very simple. You can see the bright pictures even from side angles, and the wood frame looks elegant, not cheap. The website is easy to maneuver around and I already have pictures on my frame! I'm giving it to several as a Christmas gift. Although it is more expensive than the Ceiva, it is head and shoulders above that black overstated advertisement when you take into account the more extensive features, prettier look, and ease of use. It's definitely worth the extra dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product Has Seen Better Days","review":"I really enjoyed this product over the past year. The frame had some glitches and the dial-up network was intermittent, but overall it was a great product. Unfortunately it appears that the StoryBox Network is in the process of shutting down.

When my parents told me that their friends had a Ceiva I thought they would like the Kodak frame better, but it has more buttons and they really don't need the smart card feature, since I'm the one sending all the photos to them. So in the end, I made the wrong decision which cost me more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Smart; just Framed","review":"I was very disappointed to do the research on products like the KODAK smart frame, purchase it for my parents 50th anniversary, and have THEM discover that the contract obligations are greedy and well disquised.

The book seems to have been put together with minimum thought, poor photos of items that have already been published in much better form."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"From the first time I listened to the cast album of Company, then on to A Chorus Line, I've always enjoyed Donna McKechnie. She always delivers a spectacular performance (especially on the great Follies album) and I was thrilled to hear that she'd be releasing a solo disc. I was especially looking forward to it because it would be on the Fynsworth Alley label, who'd released such great live recordings of Elegis for Angels, Punks, and Raging Queens, and their Jason Graae cd. However, when I was finally able to listen to Donna McKechnie's Inside the Music, I found her sounding tired and ragged. The whole thing seems to be mixed improperly... Too much of her talking is cut and the listener is left feeling out of the loop. I just can't figure out how a cd with such a great performer could be so unpleasent to listen to. If you want my advice, buy some cast albums featuring Ms. McKechnie and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Don't get me wrong. I am a big Donna McKechnie fan. I have seen her in several productions starting with \\"Promises,Promises\\" leading up to her bravura performance in \\"A Chorus Line\\".I guess I thought this CD would be a recreation of those moments I saw. Unfortunately it is not. She acquits herself very well, but the material comes across very flat. There is nothing to excite the listener. I think one of the problems lies in the fact that McKechnie is an actor who needs a role. CD's like this are best in the hands of cabaret singers or entertainers.Performed before a small audience in a New York recording studio, it is autobiographical which is interesting. Christopher Durang wrote the script but it doesn't develop into anything.I was so hoping I would spend hours listening to it but unfortunately I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted View","review":"I'm probably not the best person to write a review of this book, as I did not get to finish the entire book (interlibrary loan). But quite frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it. Yes, some parts were poorly written, and it did have a lot of detail. However, those weren't the parts of the book that bothered me. I thought the author's viewpoint was slanted. From the very beginning the author wrote about Lorna Anderson as a woman without virtue, a scarlet woman, etc. whereas, Tom Bird was a paradigm of virtue. And if he wasn't exactly that, his notes, conversations, etc. to Lorna Anderson could be easily explained so the author was still able to show Tom Bird in the best light possible. Lorna Anderson may be everything the author says she is, and more. But the very thing the author complained about (the prejudice of the movie about Tom Bird) is the exact same thing he has done in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad beyond belief","review":"For the past 20 years I've read an average of 40 books per year. This book is without a doubt the most poorly written I've ever read. I only hung on through its repetitious hundreds of pages because I was interested in the murders that happened in a familiar locale. Early on, Racer thanks his (volunteer, father?) proofreader. He should have sprung for a pro. The punctuation in this book is not to be believed; a third-grader could do better. Beyond being poorly written, the book is totally one-sided and defies logic. I think this guy has his own publishing company, which may explain how this sorry work ever got into print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost excellent","review":"CBS' mini-series, \\"Murder Ordained\\" makes us think that Tom Bird is a manipulating murderer, a real louse. But the movie is wrong.Dave Racer's book lays out the case and allows the reader to make his or her decision. The detail can sometimes get tedious, but Racer wants us to see it all. Still, the story moves along remarkably well.True, there are typos and punctuation problems, but anyone who reads the introduction will understand. It has nothing to do with the author's incredible ability to relate a very complicated story in a way the reader can understand.True Crime readers need to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Rider information needed","review":"I would like to contact the distributor of this film.

It's broken down into four main areas. \\"The Hominid Fossil Record\\" is the longest topic, covering man / ape creatures found throughout the last 5 million years. Some material will be recognisable to readers of Cremo & Thompson's Forbidden Archaeology. \\"Human Genetics\\" is the most technical section, discussing DNA and other markers in human / ape populations. \\"Unrecognised Hominids\\" covers familiar ground - Bigfoot / Yetis, and other \\"wildmen\\" across the globe. Corliss is dismissive of virtually all of these cases, with the notable exception of the Yeti, which he confidently rates as real.

Her powerful delivery is unforgettable as she takes us through songs such as Diamonds Are Forever, Something, Big Spender and a number of other gems. Yet with all her power, she sings songs like Yesterday When I Was Young with a tenderness that shows control and sensitive interpretation. Listen to This Is My Life and you would realise that this woman can make you feel joy, pain and every other emotion that is part of that song. Finally, she deserves to be recognised as one of the Best entertainers this century and her Grammy Award Nomination is a fitting accolade.

Lacey Lane held herself up to be a pristine stripper with morals of gold - while her fellow dancers are portrayed to be a little more nasty and a little more seedy, and a little more willing to do anything for a dollar. In the beginning Ms Lane hints that her life, like the life of any dancer, was chock full of drama ... and yet we heard very little about it.As for the actual tales from the VIP room, I have heard them all before, and they were told with a little more vim and vigor the first time I heard them.I was so disappointed in this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Tame and too boring!","review":"This one is a fast read, but it's fast because it's boring!

Lots of space in the 5500 model, Handy side pockets and hydration port make it very convenient when you cant stop every ten minutes to search for a compass or water bottles. Slim design with few outside pockets cuts down on the \\"snag\\" factor when hiking in heavily wooded or rocky terrain. Very handy for hiking to distant crags or multui-day backpacking trips. Little seperation in the interior main compartment makes it a little bit of a challenge to pack for maximim efficiency, especially if you have a full hydro pack installed, but with some careful planning and a basic knowledge of weight distribution, you have a top of the line pack for a VERY nice price. Dont worry about how sturdy this pack is, it will outlive you if you arnt careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best textbooks I've ever had.","review":"This book is great.

The pictures are fantastic considering all I ever do is point and shoot. If I'm taking pictures indoors or out all I get are sharp focused pics. It tics me off that the trend is sending these cameras out with 8 meg cards....but it seems all the manufacturers are doing it. So the 3 things I would strongly recommend on your initial purpose is a larger storage card, battery charger kit..... and, although not an absolute nescessity I would order a card reader. The reason I suggest the latter is due in part to the cable hookup from the camera to the computer. Unlike my Nikon 990 which is so easy to connect the Kodak is quite a task and everytime I hook it up to the camera I fear I'm going to crush the pins in the camera. So to avoid it I strongly recommend getting the card reader shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Digital Camera","review":"When I finally made the decision to buy a digital camera a sales person told me that the best camera to buy would be one from a camera manufacturer.

Unfortunately, Faith abandons his style for this rocky outing from the early '70s and it is a difficult listen. This disc is filled with bombastic arrangements filled with guitar licks and blaring brass. An easy listening version of the theme from 2001 would have been wonderful to listen to, but Faith interprets in a style that any rocker would find annoying. And why decide to reinterpret Superfly, Dueling Banjos. Oddly enough the best track is the theme from Ben. Go figure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The authoritative source for any baseball card collector","review":"The Standard Catalog of Baseball Cards is absolutely indispensible for the Baseball Card dealer, and a near necessity for the advanced card dollector. Nearly every card ever produced up until the early 1999 issues is included, with both prices and complete checklists. There is also a sample photograph for each issue to help you identify those old cards you found in your attic.The only reason I don't give this issue 5 stars is becuase of organization. Rather than purely alphabetical, the book is devided into several sections (really old through 1980, 1980 - present, minor league, etc.). Some prior issue were simply alphabetical, which made it much easier to use.

I just kept getting for re-routed back to my home page.I am not sure if the damage to the spine was originally like that (from the warehouse)or if it was damaged during shipment. The packaging that the book was placed in was really poor, for a book of its size. The hardback book is a very heavy(contains over 1200 pages). If it would have rained, the book would have suffered water damage, because there were openings on both sides of the packaging and it didn't help that the UPS man just left the book at my front door, in the element.Nevertheless, other than the spine issue, I was pleased with the timeframe in which the book arrived and the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Resource","review":"As a recent graduate of the CIA's Career Discovery program, I look to this culinary \\"bible\\" all the time for recipes and ideas for menus.

However, when I started to try to download Hibernate, I became aware that the book is based on Hibernate 2, while the current version is 3.3. Although I thought version 3.3 would be backwards compatible, it was not. Since I didn't want to learn a technology 4 years old, I tried to adapt the examples to version 3.3. In the end, I finished the book only to be aware of the legacy of Hibernate 2. Finally, the book always assumes that you are building a totally new database, which, in the enterprise environment, is rarely the case. Coverage of legacy databases is light or null. You might want to take a look to the book \\"Java Persistence with Hibernate\\", which is one of the most comprehensive books I've seen about dealing with legacy databases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent overview, but has a few shortcomings","review":"This book belongs to O'Reilly new series \\"developer notebook\\". I am not sure I really like this new artificial format, that this book tries to adhere to. \\"How do I do that\\", and similar named sub-titles make the book appear the same regardless where you open it! Lack of good diagrams (it has a couple, but that's it) with database relationships, class relationships, etc. make this book hard, if not impossible, to use as a reference.Finally, I found that querying was not adequately explained. How do you query a join based relationship?Overall, I think the book does provide a decent introduction to Hibernate. I give it four stars, but I doubt I will ever buy another \\"Developer Notebook\\" from O'Reilly again."},{"rating":"1","title":"error & outdated","review":"not only is this book pretty outdated as it only focuses on hibernate2 and not the newer release hibernate3 which is not backwards compatible... there was also a \\"serious technical error\\" early on in the book that set me back a while... google the corrections if you use this book.the writing style was decent... i wouldn't mind reading an newer updated copy"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dated intro","review":"In its day, this must have been a useful text. It certainly served as a good introduction to what Hibernate is and does. The examples in this book use Ant 1.5 and Hibernate 2.x. If you still use Ant, you're probably using 1.8.x. Hibernate 4.1.1 has been released as of this writing. I enjoyed the challenge of migrating the examples from Ant 1.5 to Maven 3.0, and hunting down replacements for Hibernate idioms, methods, and fields that were deprecated in version 3.x and removed in 4.x. Take the time to do this, and you'll still get plenty of value out of this book. If you're not interested in doing homework, you're better off looking for a more recent publication date. Also, while this book reads nicely front-to-back, it is difficult to use as a reference due to headers that say meaningless things like, 'How do I do that?' over and over instead of meaningful things like, 'How to generate schema\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very, very helpful","review":"This is a great book to learn Hibernate. The only thing I have to complain is that the author sometimes wants the examples to explain what he is trying to do rather than explain it in words.

In many ways this novel ends up reading as a farce or a comedy of errors except without the comedy. The hero takes a decision that could ruin the lives of people for whom he cares and is responsible. The heroine runs from pillar to post which solves nothing except for creating more drama and possible secrets which can be exploited later in the novel. I am all for slipping into a fairy tale for a little relief from the days pressures but to try and bring that fairy tale into real life (even if the real life is in a novel)is beyond my capability of understanding.I would like to say that the writing itself was good. The story, while slightly convoluted was told well. I just did not like any of the characters that the story was happening to. I did not like the martyred decisions they kept making.

Both characters started out ok and then suddenly changed. The hero who supposedly is a nice guy and honorable turns out to be a liar who can't stand lies. And the heroine was strong but lost in fairytales, and suddenly becomes a pushover. Also, I found some parts so confusing with too many characters. And the numbers and some parts of the story don't add up. Hero's mother is 44 and was married at 15. Yet her son is 32. Doesn't add up.

If you liked Def Leppard \\"Pyromania\\", WASP, Michael Schenker Group, or Ratt, then buy this.

We just recently finished remodeling 60 stores for a fast-food restaurant chain throughout the New England area. Zipwall was awesome for us!!! The ability to easily corner off sections of the restaurants made our projects very successful. The stores were allowed to continue many of their daily operations because we could contain ourselves within these working areas. Without zipwall the stores would have had to close much more than they did. Staying open made the operators happy and allowed us to work during normal business hours, keeping our costs down too! Thanks Zipwall!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was dissapointed with the patterns, they were all very interesting and the pictures were beautiful but the yarn use for the patterns was ridiculously expensive. I made a pillow and it ended up being $65. The patterns also had several misakes in them, I made the slippers and the pattern was incorrect, I brought the book into my yarn shop and they said they do NOT recommend the book to newer knitters due to the multiple pattern errors. Great pictures and good for ideas but not great for a newer knitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"Well, almost. I know how to knit and can do some basic things, but I was looking for a book to take me a little further on in my skills, but to date I haven't found the book that can do it. I was also looking for some things to decorate my home with, as always, and this book gave me that. The patterns are simple for the most part, easy to accomplish, and simply explained. I'm looking forward to doing several of the throws for my furniture. One of the things I wish authors wouldn't do so often is include baby items all the time. There are just too many books on the market already on knitting for baby, it's not needed in every book that comes out.

The 18-200 range is of course terrific, and for an all-in-one walkabout lens I'm very impressed by the level of detail captured in the images. Unlike a lot of the recent Sony lenses, this one is made like a tank - without the cheap, light plastic that seems to characterize many new Sony alpha lenses. The lock switch prevents lens creep when it is hanging around my neck, which is handy too. While it probably doesn't take as high quality images as a thousand dollar lens, for the money it is a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"I have an Konica Minolta Maxxum 5D that is no longer made.

When I received this one as a gift, I was excited to try out the Asian salmon recipe. I made it for a group we have over for dinner. Now, I enjoy salty food, but this was almost inedible. The recipe called for a cup of soy sauce for the marinade, to be poured over the salmon, with a breadcrumb mixture on the top (also covered with the marinade). Everyone at the table had to scrape the topping off just to be able to eat the salmon. It was that salty. I wonder how testers ever could have approved such a recipe? Why didn't they call for low-sodium soy, or cut the amount of soy to a quarter cup? I was very disappointed.

Many historians would have us look at historical infomation as if men have always had the upper hand in power positions. They have not.

Massively so, with chapters devoted to all kinds of minutia that really wasn't related to the incidents of that day or its aftermath. I would ask the people writing the positive reviews of this book if they felt that given a ruthless editor who made Winchester remove a full 1/3rd of all the pages, if they don't think it would have made a much more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too verbose; his editor must have been on vacation","review":"Never use one word when ten will do.

However, i think the author tries to take advantage of 9/11 and terrorism in Indonesia to sell copy and it's both tacky and unwarranted. It's one thing to suggest that Dutch imperialism and its cruel nature left the door open for islamic radicals to take hold of the population; however, I think it's way over the top to suggest that Krakatoa's eruption did it. It seems relatively safe to say that seeds were sown well before krakatoa and it was a question of time before the Dutch were booted out as other colonial powers were globally. It was not as if krakatoa went boom and islamic radicals kicked out the Dutch a few months later. Overall, it could have been a good book, but I think the tacky exploitation of terrorism earns it one star and the author, my enmity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorinnnggg","review":"Q: How do you make the world's biggest explosion boring?

Around page 200 it got interesting and was an easy read. But much of the book is about the history leading up to the event, along with a good dose of plate tectonics.Perhaps in the hand of another author this supporting material would have been acceptable, but as it was, this book felt more like a text book than a book to be read for pleasure.

This event precipitated a major tsunami that killed nearly 40,000 people.The book takes a look at the microlevel events--what transpired in villages as the tsunami hit. The details of the book provide a gripping tale of a first class natural disaster.Winchester provides information on some of the major actors in this event; he describes in minute detail events from place to place; there are numerous maps that illustrate points made in the text.Intriguing, too, is the material at the end of this volume, indicating that after the volcano destroyed itself in the massive eruption of 1883, \\"son of Krakatoa\\" has been developing. Another eruption in the future? Another Krakatoa?

In my opinion, the power of non-fiction is the sheer amount of interesting tidbits that get passed to the reader.For example, in a few sections of this book, you hear about how Darwin didn't coin the term \\"survival of the fittest\\", he borrowed it. You learn the origins of the Reuters news service. You learn about Islamist nationalism. And of course, you learn about volcanoes, plate tectonics, and all manner of geology, biology, and geophysics. (did you know DesCartes had it all figured out before anyone else? I didn't!)It's these diversions that make a non-fiction book fun to me.It is also obvious through this book that geology is Mr. Winchester's first love, and he treats her with a velvet touch. I always found this stuff boring, but he treats it with reverence.I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it.(*)>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Krakatoa","review":"This book is quite slow which lost me.

Krakatoa was a cataclysmic natural disaster that affected the world. Its seismic effects were felt across the world. There was plenty of warning across the world and most of it went ignored but when it exploded the response was immediate. The island was completely swallowed and the implications are well outlined. As with all Wincheser books the general effects of a volcano are outlined. Occasionally it does wonder off topic but it mostly stays on track and does an excellent job relating to the main topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, I gave up","review":"I like nonfiction occasionally, and the subject of this one seemed fascinating so I was eager to dig into it.

I may give Winchester another chance since The Professor & the Madman seems interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Wonderful","review":"Yep you are going to know all about Krakatoa, but Mr. Winchester gives you so much more. You'll know why you now know all this stuff about Krakatoa and this is where Mr. Winchester shines - you will end up with a different world view just because you wanted to know about Krakatoa.

His Professor and the Madman was also too stretched out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krakatoa - The Book Jacket was cool","review":"While not being of a scientific mind, I found Krakatoa to be very interesting. I loved the illustrations and maps. I found myself writing down words to look up in the dictionary. I have never been one of those people who enjoyed reading history, but with Krakatoa I enjoyed it tremendously. The author really knows his subduction zones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant after December 2004 earthquake and tsunami","review":"Although Krakatoa was published in 2003, it has assumed new relevance since the December 26, 2004 earthquake and tsunami. This book is at its most engaging when it outlines the development of our understanding of the Earth's geologic processes (Chapter 3) and describes how the Krakatoa eruption affected people worldwide (Chapter 8). It is at its least successful in demonstrating cause and effect between the August 27, 1883 eruption and the 1888 Islamic rebellion in the Dutch East Indies."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Marketing","review":"I was pretty upset when I read this book--the marketing for it is very very misleading. Here's the honest marketing: It goes on and on about the geography and Dutch colonization of Indonesia for pages and pages. And I mean on and on. Then info about the culture and people of the island. Then you finally get to the volcano erupting--but it's a very short description of the event--and very very disappointing, especially after having slogged through Dutch colonization 101 for pages on end. It's not a vivid, detailed, fiery reconstruction--it's much more bland than that. Like I said, very misleading marketing. I read Isaac's Storm by Eric Larson and thought this would be even better. Krakatoa doesn't even come close to being as good as Isaac's Storm--buy that book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winchester Takes You on a Journey","review":"The joy of a Winchester book is in the wide variety of interesting and insightful discoveries that he can weave into the main subject. He is my new Ambrose, wherever he leads, I follow along on an fascinating journey.This books is not just about a volcano. It has insights into exploration, colonization, botony, plate techtonics, and many other interesting subjects. But you do not need a deep or even modest understanding of them, as Winchester smoothly explains the key details in easy to understand and interesting ways.Needless to say, I loved this book and I am working my way through the rest of the Winchester library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dry for me","review":"Maybe I expected too much from this book. The author seems far too proud of his researching skills and never fails to mention useless bits of informtion that he found. He even goes on his own little personal trips down memory lane, which just made him seem a little pompous to me. But the overall amount of information made me feel like I was swimming against the current to get to the interesting things. Like telling me the life story of a man who did nothing but report the eruption.For example, his plate tectonics explanation was far too complex and riddled with unrelated information. I found myself skipping over large portions because they were simply too technical or had nothing to do with plate tectonics.Overall, I found the book uncompelling and the author's need to show off his researching skills snobby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written like a technical journal article","review":"When I heard the author interviewed on NPR I rushed out and purchased a copy of the book. What a disappointment! As an avid reader I hate to abandon a book after I start it. I did finish Krakatoa but it was a real struggle - actually more of a challenge to prove I could do it. The book is verbose, written like a technical journal article and is overloaded with footnotes and run on sentences. For a 350+ page book, surprisingly little deals with the actual eruption and aftermath. It's more of a book about the geology, politics, biology, botany, and economic history of Java/Sumatra. Although there are several maps in the book, none of them actually says \\"this is where Krakatoa was\\". The author assumes you'll be able to figure it out by reading about a bunch of obsure landmarks and then looking at a map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but stretched","review":"This is an interesting history and account of Krakatoa and the 1883 explosion. Much of the book is interesting and readable. In particular, Mr. Winchester makes the geology accessible, and even fun, for non-scientists. However, I felt Mr. Winchester did not do as well with the historical accounts. This seems more because he tries to cover so much history than anything else. The book is best when it focuses on the volcano itself, not the people. Besides this, it is still a great read, and I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winchester: As a writer, this bloke's a fine geologist","review":"Repetitious and full of digression, this book concentrates on substituting personal stories and the author's deep knowledge of geology for a general history. Some of it is interesting, but it takes 150 pages to actually get to the eruption and the times directly leading up to it. Too much unnecessary background, and too much about Simon's personal life.Discerning readers would be better off reading something else besides this. The guy can't decide whether he's writing for fellow geologists (a party crowd, no doubt), a personal travelog (at these points, his vivid description and interesting anecdotes are as scintillating as Aunt Patsie's Branson Missouri slides)or a serviceable history suitable to the casual reader. He does all of these (even fairly well at times), but the whole is incoherent and a mind-numbing slog.I can't wait to avoid any further literary work on his part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and long","review":"It would seem that a story about one of the biggest natural disasters the world has experienced would, by necessity, be a compelling read. Instead, Mr. Winchester tries to link everything from pepper plants to religious fundamentalism to the island eruption, yielding a long and boring narrative that jumps back and forth between subjects. If you can remember being in a professor's hot afternoon classroom as he drones on about his detailed opinions and observations, then this is the same feeling you will get from trying to read the book. Sorry, but I couldn't force myself to finish it. Find a copy on the bookshelf of your favorite retailer, skip to page 200 and read the limited 40 pages about the actual eruption, then put the book back on the shelf for some other hapless buyer to purchase. Overall, a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Read","review":"I really expected an exciting read, but what You get is three quarters of a book full of REALLY BORING FILLER! Was a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject Killed With Minutiae","review":"I really enjoy books that describe the 'bigger picture' that frame individual events. But this book is so far down that road that it lost the main event of the title. Honestly, knowing the construction of transoceanic telegraph cable or knowing if Wallace or Darwin was first to realize evolution theory is way more than I need to know to understand the context of devastating volcanic eruptions. When I finally got to Krakatoa blowing up, this same obsessive detailing detracted from the real power and horror of this terrible event. If you chose to read this, skip to the final third of the book....you'll be a lot more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longwinded, repetitive and messy","review":"I bought this book months ago out of curiosity. I read it after the Asian tsunami happened Dec 26,2004 since it seemed relevant. The book certainly is well researched, although perhaps this may be its problem. The storytelling is never quite exciting enough. It's longwinded, repetitive and quite messy - the author sounded over-excited. The danger with a subject like this is there are tons of facts and information that when handled the wrong way can make a book a chore to read - and this book is. You get bits of this and that but never quite the big picture. This book needs editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This cumbersome, meandering volume was a real disappointment. Written in an academic and uncaptivating style with so many asides and footnotes that the reading experience was exhausting. Though an avid reader, I gave up on this book after 200 pages. Though the content was good, the writing was scattered and too detailed; the author's scope too large; and his points poorly interrelated. Pick it up at your local library if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I think the title is misleading. A lot of gibberish about evolution, which is a theory at best. Not near enough information about Krakatoa. Chapter 4 is the first real point in the book that gets on subject. I wonder if any of the folks that wrote reviews for the book actually read the book. I am an avid reader and I struggled to get through this book. It is a good thing that I bought it for a dollar as it is not worth much more than that. I have read books about Krakatoa and researched the volcano some before. There is some worthwhile information in the book, mostly about the history of the region. There is some information about the Krakatoa if you are not familiar with it's eruption.It was a disappointment for me. I do not recommend the book unless you really have lot of interest in Krakatoa. I was expecting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally interesting, detailed account of the worst volcanic eruption in recorded history","review":"The first 90 pages of this book are boring, but after that point, the story picks up into a gripping, detailed account of the worst volcanic eruption in recorded history.This book not only recounts the geology and history of the event, but aptly points out the complex interplay between natural events and people. Moreover, it shows how much the world had become a global village, even by 1883 and that politics and the environment are intertwined.It is masterfully written (minus the first 90 pages) and is perhaps the best science related book I have read this year...and as a geologist I read quite a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Account of the Global Village Event","review":"Simon Winchester has entered the disaster field with his newest pop history entry and has created a book, Krakatoa, that succeeds, in terms of entertainment, beyond his previous very well-done works. The astonishing fact about this book is that the most interesting aspect is the first couple hundred pages of history on both the colonization of the East Indies and the development of the study of the earth. That he can render the history of geology so fascinating should be no suprise to readers of his last book, The Map That Changed the World, but that he can almost suceed in rendering it more gripping than the account of the explosion itself is a wonder. Which is not to say the explosion of Krakatoa is not incredibly nail-biting because it most certainly is. The story flags a little in the politics of the last chapters recounting the aftermath of the explosion, but only a little, as the author seems on less sure ground. An exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic coming of age story in British Army","review":"Author John Masters turned to fiction after a successful career in the British Empire's old Indian Army. Bugles and a Tiger recounts Master's army years up until World War 2, from military academy days at Sandhurst through service with the famed Gurkhas. The responsibilities of company command mature Masters, until he becomes ready for the greater responsibility thrust upon him in World War 2 . (See The Road Past Mandalay for that story).Bugles and a Tiger is a warm, thought-provoking, and entertaining look back at a time and place that seem exotic by today's standards. Highly recommended for all, especially those who have an interest in history, India, or a good old-fashioned \\"ripping yarn\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Charming","review":"This is my favorite military memoir ever. John Masters served as a young Gurkha officer in the twilight of British India shortly before World War 2.Written in middle age, the memoir tells how Masters grew from cadet to company commander in an Indian Army Gurkha regiment. It's a universal coming of age story enlivened by exotic locales, an attractive protagonist,and and a loving eye for a way of life that was known to be ending while it was being lived.Masters is a natural storyteller and parts of this book linger in the memory long after it is finished. Master's World War 2 years are also ably described in the sequel, \\" The Road Past Mandalay\\". Of the two, I prefer the first: some of Master's WW2 experiences were grim indeed, and the second book is less light-hearted as a consequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Suede??","review":"Signature Series Dash Cover 81237-00-25; BlackWhat suede?

I have no confidence it will look like it belongs. I will use it; if nothing else, it should, at least, protect the dash from further sun damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, bad execution","review":"The book's concept is good, a collection of oral histories of workers from Jones & Laughlin in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. However, the editing is absolutely atrocious. Typos and spelling errors abound, and at no point does the author offer to explain anything the workers are talking about. If you're knowledgeable about the steelmaking process, you will understand some of the things they say, but the author could have put in footnotes to clarify some of their points or make some things more understandable. The editing of this book greatly detracts from the overall work, and after a while, becomes outright frustrating. That's too bad; these workers lived hard lives, and they clearly have something to say. Too bad the author and publisher couldn't help them with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful votive","review":"looks great and the candle sparkles like a star wherever you place it. very nice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with this bulb","review":"I'd suggest caution on two notes:1) I bought this bulb thru amazon with the intent of replacing my '00 nissan altima's headlight bulbs. But the product label says \\"For offroad use only\\", implying it may be illegal to use as replacement bulb for normal use.2) The item looked very flimsy and one of the bulbs (it comes as pair) was already broken when it arrived.

Many of the stories were boring & did not catch my attention - maybe I had high expectations after reading \\"Fed Up With the Fanny.\\" I hope this author gets back on track writing novels, because he does not have a gift for writing short stories - maybe he needs to take a writing class from J.

To make this short Death Don't Always Do Us Part which I thought was deep!

From the begining the first story had me hooked and it was fulfilling as any book I've read this year. I could really relate to the first sister and her situation, having a man locked up with children to care for. I also enjoyed the return of Deric and Kelly from Fed Up with the Fanny, boy was I surprised! Kelly's new personality was a welcomed change but that's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the ending for others. This one is a must read for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"I did enjoy this story. I believe Mr. White put his heart and others feelings into this story.

It kind of reminded me of a sitcom on television where all the couples are sort of like going through the same thing but in different ways.

If you're a big fan of previous O.A.R it may take a bit of listening, but you'll learn to love it. If you haven't heard any previous O.A.R you'll like it.

I have been the biggest O.A.R. fan ever since the release of the Wanderer, and I have always lived by their music. In Between Now and Then is not the true sound of O.A.R. that I know, instead it is the band's made for radio and tv version. I read another review that said In Between Now and Then sounds like pop-rock, and I agree. Except for two or three exception all of the raggae feel is gone, the song's corus are bland, and the energy has been taken out. I still listen to the album because it is still O.A.R, but it is no where near the level of all their other albums. O.A.R. please take away the requests of the new label and be yourselves!!!

That's all it took for me to immediately purchase their CD from Amazon.com.\\"In Between Now and Then\\" is an amazing amalgamation of different genres, as a reviewer previously suggested. The album flirts strongly with the flavors of reggae and ska and a dash of alterna-pop and pop-contemporary. The horns and guitar riffs in \\"Anyway\\" are reminscent of \\"The Dave Matthews Band,\\" but Marc Roberge's vocals are much more dynamic.Regardless of attempting to pigeon-hole O.A.R., their music is unique and refreshing.

I Used to Know?","review":"Things change, sure we all know that. But, this change for O.A.R. going from an unknown to a major record label is a change for the worst. Their music here on the new album is not indicitive of the great, fun music O.A.R. is known for putting out on their previous albums (the best of which I thought was \\"Souls Aflame\\"). The problem for old O.A.R. fans will be that all the songs on this cd are messed with by the studio and take away from the lean and bare straight shooting sound of O.A.R. That is what made them such a great live band. When musicians like them get messed with by studios it is for the worst. Like John Mayer he is at is best live.

I have four of their cds and thoroughly enjoy this In Between Now and Then in particular. Each song seems to show a point in life or experience that everyone can relate to. I love how the cd has a rapping effect in that it begins with now and ends with then. James and Coalminer show an extreme amount of talent lyrics wise as do many of OAR's songs. The story like songs completely draw you into the album. Every song has it's own \\"thing' about it that you can't explain until you hear. Old Man Time is probably my favorite, but I love every song.

I've seen it a number of times and I continue to find it entertaining. I was never a big Elisa Donavan fan prior to this but after this movie, I actually grew to like her very much. There are some funny things in the movie that I chuckle at----like the fact that this is set 10 years ago (10 years ago from point of filming which was 2004, so 1994) and supposedly Eve can create a working website overnight and sell things over the internet the next morning, linking the store's inventory up, etc. Humm......I don't think it was quite that easy in 1994 but I'm no IT expert.

I generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year, but come Christmas-time, I lap up these sappy movies. But even I couldn't stomach this one.

The acting, writing, directing, camera work, and editing (They edited this? There was someone directing? Really?) are so amazingly awful that it is fun to watch as a group and laugh and try to find something new each year to make fun of. And finding something new to make fun of is NEVER a problem, this movie just keeps on giving year after year.Lifetime only aired it once this year (2008), so[..] was a very small price to pay to insure our family enjoys this steaming crap-fest in years to come.

I LOVE IT! It's primitiveness is what makes it so wonderful. I listen to it and feel as though I am part of the celebration! This is music made with what is naturally given to us, our voice and hands. Music in it's purest and most beautiful form. The basic-ness of the music is a valued part of my collection of music of the Middle East. Don't get me wrong, I dig George Abdo and Hossam Ramzy as much as the next person, and Natacha Atlas makes me shimmy with delight. But for me to truly understand and enjoy the music of the Middle East, and be a well-rounded student of Danse Orientale, I feel I must embrace the earthy, as well as the ethereal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authenic rural Egyptian grooves","review":"The cd is about the closest that Westeners minus the plane tripe will get to rural Egyptian music. Most of the songs comes from parts of extreme southern Egypt[that is Luxor and Aswan] but some tracks are a little further north in places like Qena which border Middle Egypt. The previous reviewers have unfairly branded this as unauthenic. Such criticism does not suprise be due to lack of understanding or knowledge that some have of rural Egypt. I would argue that this cd is more Egyptian than most sha'abi due to the lack of western influence.Anybody that is into anthropology or field recordings is for a musical treat. All the music is supervised by the late Nubian ethnomusicology/oud player,Hamaza el Din. The only thing missing from a otherwise wonderful cd is funeral laments from Luxor and fallahin music from the Delta.

One of the handles has a 32th of an inch gap where it is supposed to meet the brass. Lastly it has sharp edges besides the blade. The edges of the lock are pretty sharp as well as the brass where the blade closes. I bought this knife to use at work and it's going to take a beating. It's not worth the time to send it back.

He has a strong, well-profiled melodic sense and a superb rhythmic sense. These overtures are prime examples in miniature form of his work, and the peformances are impeccable: authoritative from the man himself, who knows just how to get the results he wants from the players. He lets his creations bloom in a way that holds your attention - and brings you back for repeated hearings. If you do not know Arnold, this is a perfect introduction. If you do know his work, why are you reading this; you should be ordering it!

The silver tab on the stem that seats into the carrier however is a piece of junk. The collar is not secured to the actual lock ring so it is able to swivel which it does while you are riding. If you have the holder located on the one place on a bike that has space for it (the vertical post under the seat)like i do, then you will be constantly banging your legs against the lock as it sways back and forth as you ride.

For one, I kept having a hard time trying to lock it into position with the bike clamp. Even after spraying some WD-40 on it, I was still having problems. Whenever I do manage to lock it into place, pulling it back out became a whole new problem, and oftentimes, it would slam into the frame of my bike because of how much force was needed to pull it out. Lastly, the clamp itself is extremely cumbersome. Instead of traditional screws, it uses a plastic belt. Once I had it locked in, I couldn't undo it to re-adjust. I ended up returning this lock and getting aOnGuard Bulldog MINI TC 5013TC Bicycle U-Lockinstead. The bulldog is a much, much better lock because the clamp uses screws the the latching is actually done from the side, so it won't damage your bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't risk your bike with this lock!!!!","review":"There is a serious flaw to these locks: the keys open multiple Kryptonite locks. I guess they were too cheap to manufacture unique key threads for each lock.

Another reviewer mentioned this problem with Kryptonite locks in Amazon reviews. However, I didn't think much of it and regretfully purchased the Evolution Mini.

It barely fits through either the wheel or the frame and the bike rack - no way will it fit through both. Not good with quick-release wheels! Doesn't fit around the down tube of my road bike frame, either. I had to jimmy and juke my bike up against the rack to get it close enough to click this tiny lock closed around the top of the frame.

I highly recommend it.I only took of a star because the keys seem a bit flimsy and i don't like how the keyhole slides around. It's annoying sometimes to have to position the key just so and wiggle it around a few times before I can get the keyhole to engage/disengage right.

What I didn't know was that this chair won't stay folded shut unless it's laying down. If you plan to stand it up against a wall or somewhere else for storage, it won't work. The weight of the chair seems to make this happen. Also, the back does not \\"lock\\" into any positions other than straight up or totally reclined (about 45 degrees).

Benji's Queer and the Cats song are my faves but I loved the whole CD. Jack Black, Conan, Sandler and Horatio all score jamming with my favorite puppet. The DVD may even be funnier.

Triumph, claim your hardware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"If you can invision a dog singing these songs and doing these skits, then it's hilarious.

Why not five stars??! I laughed all the way through. Yeah, it's not quite Triumph with the Star wars nerds, or at the dog show, but they don't make enough stars to rate those!

I love Conan and have actually cried tears from laughing so hard while watching Triumph on his show so this was a major disappointment.

Plain and simple, it just wasn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews","review":"Man, what a rip off. Conan should refund my money because I blame him. The bits on his show are hilarious and that's what I was expecting from this CD. Boy was I dissapointed. It's nothing but \\"F\\" words and the crudest style of humor around. If it had been recordings of the bits on the Conan O'Brien show I would have been completly satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"My brother bought this CD, so we listened to it together. To put it simply, this CD is not funny at all. The jokes are completely unoriginal. People can call Christina Aguilera names in songs only so many times before it gets repetitive.

I love the Triumph character and have collected many of the videos available on the web, but this CD/DVD set is less than mediocre. If you are looking to find anything on the order of the Bon Jovi, Star Wars, or Hollywood Squares videos, there is none of that here. AThe CD is a bunch of reasonably lame songs and repeating tired jokes, and the DVD is just video of the same stuff that is on the CD. I bought 4 of these for Christmas presents, and 1 for myself.

In fact, I want a refund, this is so utterly mediocre. The record company responsible for this garbage 'filler' material should be ashamed for releasing this second rate stuff! This release is truly, unequivocally FOR ME TO POOP ON!!! The CD would make an excellent 'pooper scooper'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Listened to several tracks, kept having the feeling I'd heard it before.

For 10 bucks you could listen to the album on Napster and have access to thousands of comedy album, including all of Adam Sandler and Richard Pryor albums and 500,000 other songs. The whole album is available on their premium service subscribers, so you can listen to it as many times as you want for a month.I mention this because only 5 songs are funny and that would want to listen to more than 3 times. The prank calls are painfully unfunny.This is definitely an album NOT worth owning. But Triumph fans will want to listen to it ONCE they try my suggestion.The best songs are:'you got to work blue''Benji's qu**r''I keed''blackhawk'There are basically 8 songs on the entire album. The rest are filler. The prank calls are a big FU to the people who bought this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting and should be pulled from all shelves at stores","review":"Wow, what a horrible disgrace to the music world.

He makes an album so terrible with prank calls that is basically him reading names off a telephone book.The whole album is crap. The one flower to place on top on this crap is 'I keed'. It's an okay song that seems a lot funnier after you listen to this album.Avoid this album. The word is out and that is why the album is not selling well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop for sale!","review":"I feel like what they are trying to accomplish with this record is to convince people that poop smell good.

Because I heard a lot of his humor on Stephen Lynch's two comedy albums. Smeagol is the Robin Williams of puppeteers.There are basically 4 decent songs on the album the best being I keed. The rest are failed prank calls that should never have been put on the album a lot of silent pauses. They just didn't work and I say about two minutes of the album is dead air time because of the failed crank calls. And then Smeagal breaks character and gives a pro-Peta message and says that Triumph is not made of leather.I love Triumph on Conan. But this album reeks. It is not even worth listening too once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD...for me to poop on!","review":"I've always loved Triumph, always will, but this is just a crappy album unless you find loads of profanity amusing. And I am in no way against profanity. There's just so much of it that the \\"jokes\\" become repetitive and boring.Skip the CD, watch Conan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Triumph is funnier than this CD","review":"I wish I could be more positive about Triumph's first CD/DVD, because he's funny enough to have a great one.It's just not this one.His appearances on Conan O'Brien, Comedy Central Roasts and Hollywood Squares are absolutely hilarious and perhaps, because of the restraints of TV censors, he's funnier because he has to hold back on obscenities. The nonstop profanity actually becomes tiresome after several tracks. I wasn't offended, I just got bored by it.There are funny moments, but nothing that would win Triumph any new fans.Instead of confining Triumph to a stage show, they should put together a DVD of Triumph's segments from Late Night (the Bon Jovi concert, the Hollywood bus tour, the Star Wars premiere are all hysterically-funny classics) with some interviews with \\"celebrities\\" and such.And, of course, Triumph violating Muppets or the Petsmart sock puppet."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"I love Conan and I always look forward to seeing Triumph on his show.

Good title, come to think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"Do you like your humor stupid and sophmoric? Then this album is for you. Is your IQ sub-average?

Everybody else, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving this even one star constitutes insanity","review":"I find it interesting that this is listed as a comedy album because there is no comedy in it.

Perhaps robert smeagol needs to review another line of work; pooper scooper maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sure ain't a 5 star CD","review":"Who the hell is giving this 5 stars. Five stars it given to nonnegotiable artists, artists who everyone respects whether you like their music or not. 2 Pac, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Elvis, Buddy Holley, Eminem even.

I held Triumph in high regard as a witty, intelligent character who never ceased to make me laugh. This album changed everything. Once Smigel gained freedom from the censors, he no longer put any effort into wit, and instead replaced it with profanity, hoping that the profanity, in and of itself, would make people laugh. I listened to this album with 6 other people, all of whom love South Park, Tarantino movies, etc., so the profanity is not an issue. We all sat in dead silence the majority of the time. It was painful and very disappointing. What a letdown. All wit was gone. The DVD is even worse. The bits with guests, especially the Dell guy, are excruciating to watch. We fast-forwarded the Horatio Sanz bit. If you really like Triumph, please do not buy this album if you want to remain a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop was funny in 3rd grade","review":"I tried to like this album, but it grows tiresome quick.

Overall, I was extremely dissapointed. The songs on the CD were pretty funny, but I really think Triumph's gag is better with visuals so I was looking forward to the DVD. Maybe my expectations were too high but the DVD was just horrible. It just wasn't up to the par that he sets on shows like Conan OBrien or Hollywood Squares. If someone would put together a DVD of those moments (the Westminster Dog Show segment comes to mind), it would be an instant top seller I think. My advice is... don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you get it, you'll get this!","review":"If you get Triumph and laughat his skits (on Conan), shows (TV Funhouse), and other bit parts on shows like Hollywood Squares etc. etc... you'll be very happy you purchased the CD/DVD. It's a lot of the same stuff, sending zingers to celeberities that were at the event and singing dirty songs about underage bischons. If a real dog humping a puppet dog (and vice versa) offernds you, you'll want to close your eyes for a second or two and listen to your cool friends wetting them selves at the dog on puppet action.

I do agree with many of the earlier reviews tho--there's not much production evident here, either on the DVD or the CD tracks.

The broomstick scene has its moments, but LB is an icon due to her innocent facial expressions framed by all that early teen hair, and she spends too much time in the 'stick scene lying on the floor protecting her chest from the camera, and her hair's all wet.The producers knew exactly what they were doing, even down to the title. If it been a theatre release they would have sold out on raincoats. Two solid stars, in spite of no nudity, a first.

The fashions, the hairstyles and the classic acting by Linda Blair, make this a must own for anyone that appreciates the classic made-for-tv movies of the '70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inexpensive Solution!","review":"This product is An inexpensive Solution to paying $80.00 for an 1/8 inchcollet for your 1/4 inch router.

I really like to swing back and forth when I sit in a rocking chair. This chair makes that possible. I ordered one and then immediately ordered a second! I highly recommend this chair.

The sound is very thin, could be software compression, and on some tracks (Blue Day in particular) the mix seems to be a mono sum of one stereo track because some key instruments and licks are very faint or missing entirely.

Common sense is repackaged as 'Auction Secrets' that purport to enable sellers to obtain more money than they would be able to through a real-estate agent.

It was compelling to see the change in mindset of this intelligent group of filmakers and to see them defend the indigenous community to their government even though they were afraid to do so.

Took about 2 months to get the correct lens"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for All-in-One lens for digital SLR","review":"This is a very good choice for anyone shooting Nikon digital series cameras, and wanting an all-in-one design that small and light weight.Although it doesn't give us the overall range of the most common choice for Nikon users (18-55 & 70-300), it does give us a smaller and less expensive option to Nikon's 18-200VR.The lens features internal focusing (in neither basic Nikon zoom, but in the VR), which means filters, like polarizers, won't spin with the autofocus. It also means we'll have a more useful lens hood, which is included.The max aperture at 200mm is 6.3, adequate, but not the best we can get in a 200mm that's still reasonably priced (here's were we loose a star). But construction seems very good, and the warranty is a year longer than Nikon's.This is a solid 4-star product, but Nikon users need to be aware that there is a better, although more expensive option, in the very fine Nikkor 18-200 AF-S VR lens (5-star)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginners, but watch out for the addl. info","review":"It has excellent sentences and doesn't use a lot of big words to define other words, nor does it give circular definitions (defining cat as an animal and an animal as a cat) but it does go into grammatical terms and usage notes that might be confusing if not properly learned. It's the first dictionary (besides the Webster's New World Dictionary of Basic American English, which is absolutely invaluable) that allows me to get a full understanding of a word without making me chase through twenty other words.

Also, even more irritating, they were irregular. I mean noticeably irregular. The pillow cases were so poorly constructed that the seems on either side were completely un-parallel. It not possible to put a pillow in them an have them look normal. It looks all twisted and mangled.I don't mind paying a little less for irregular items sometimes.

Kinyan is a widow with three children looking for a way to save her ranch and in order to that she must marry. She's not crazy about the idea, neither are her twin boys, but from the time she and Ben meet, you know an fast-paced, sensual plot is going to emerge. I like the way the author developed Ben's relationship with Kinyan's twin boys, and eventually her young daughter (who reminds him of his little girl). As the plot unfolds, it's clear that Kinyan's husband's death was no accident. The author creates some intriguing characters, including a saloon whore who's tied to the villain. I like the scenes where Colter is teaching Kinyan how to defend herself, and when Ben is injured, Kinyan is determined to help her depressed husband use his other senses to in order to save their family. The way the author weaved those scenes in was pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another JJ delightful read.","review":"I am so pleased that I ran across this author.

Colter, our physically and emotionally scarred hero, has spent years tracking down the confederate soldiers who (post war) brutalized his wife and child...and left him to die. Unable to locate the last of them, he heads west to start his life over, such as it is. Kenjin is a young widow with precocious twin boys and a little girl who is trying to save her ranch and they enter into a marriage of mutual need and benefit.As he teaches her how to run her ranch, he also becomes, against his desire, a surrogate father to these children. The dialogue is so believable and touching that u feel like you are there.Naturally there are bad guys who try to take over the ranch, kill Colter, etc....and the love that kinjin brings to heal colters heart.

All I heard was the No being chanted.If you get really really lucky the horrendous keyboard player will attempt to sing and do the worse humble pie/ 70's soft balled song.

The author constantly jumps between different time periods and throws names and facts at the reader without really ever explaining in depth of what they are. As in example, the term singory is used throughout the book yet Martines never explains what it actually is. The author makes the assumption that as a reader you are an absolute expert on this time period. If you are an expert, this book will probably read like poetry to you.

The Breakthrough Bible (Good News Translation) by St. Mary's Press has some of the same features that other teen Bibles include in their text, but this Bible has full color, one-page interviews with the patriarchs, prophets and historic figures of both OT and NT books.

I find myself using it because of the many inclusions such as interviews of main characters of the Bible, \\"Live It\\" where they apply a reading to current day life, small snips of info or question at the bottom of every other page to encourage further reading, and a list of Bible readings to be used in different times of your life (sad, hopeless, loss of loved one, etc.). The Bible also has a subject index, \\"Pray It\\", and \\"Catholic Connections\\" to better explain the Bible and how it connects with the Mass or other Catholic traditions.

There are multiple typos, grammatical errors, and mis-spelled words. Even worse, a lot of the text doesn't make any sense. A subsequent paragraph often contradicts its predecessor, for example. I'm going to call Dearborn's \\"help line\\" with all of the questions/clarifications that I've marked throughout this book. It will probably take an hour to get through all of them. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it's organized well.

Although the author clearly knows his material, the delivery was so dry that it was difficult to get through. The title proves different than the content, because it really deals less with helping readers to take risks, but seems more about the field of risk management. I think the author intended this book for professionals in the field, but for generalists who want to understand risk, I would recommend other books. For instance, \\"Predictably Irrational\\" by Dan Ariely and \\"Feel the Fear...And Do It Anyway\\" are much better books for personal and professional development when it comes to risk and fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic lock","review":"For a few months, I would lock my bike up in an open parking space using this lock, and after a period of no incidence, I became complacent and lazy and started locking only the front wheel and frame to the post. Imagine how stupid I felt when one day I came back from work to find all but those parts stolen. So speaking from experience: this lock works.The lock is big enough to lock two wheels together to a post, or one wheel and the frame to a post if you angle it correctly. It's hefty, but not prohibitively so; I carry it on my commutes in my bag without really noticing the extra weight (I don't trust the mounting bracket after reading the other reviews).As others have noted, the key sometimes requires a little jiggling to get it to work properly, but otherwise I've had no problem with it. All in all, this is a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did its job for 3 years then just wore out -- too expensive for short life span","review":"I used this lock heavily over three years. In that time I experience one minor and one major issue. The minor issue is that the mounting system is terrible. It just can't hold up to the shock of carrying a heavy lock on a hard tail bike. The major issue is that the lock failed to open reliably after three years of use. I tried all three provided keys under the assumption my key was becoming worn. I was mistaken. After 5 minutes of jiggling the key I always use, I was able to get the lock off one final time before permanent retirement. For the cost I would expect a longer lasting system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mouning system EVER","review":"How good is this lock? I don't know, but I do know that I'm very likely to forget it because I can't mount it on my bike. Every u-lock I've ever had before went on my bike by just slipping the lock into a bracket and pushing a lever. This one has a cheap, cheap, cheap plastic mounting system that straps on (and undoubtedly UNstraps easily. It wouldn't fit on my new bike because a) the top bar is too thick, b) the brake cable goes under instead of on top of the bar, c) I couldn't mount it on the front bar because of the gear cables d) and it wouldn't fit ANYWHERE because the mounting system keeps it too far away from ANY bar and you have to have a LOT of room above it to be able to snap it on and off. FORGET about leaving your water bottle holder on. It won't even fit with it off.

Some of the stories aren't meant to be taken seriously.If you're interested in the history of the rural midwest, you will find this book extremely interesting. It offers a lot of insight into what people really owned, and what they did from day to day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unvarnished voices","review":"This book is a selection of stories, told in the voice of the person who was interviewed, about what the dustbowl years were like. I loved seeing the different takes on life at that time. One thing the author did was stay true to the voice of the person so you will find the work strange as it is not 'edited'. Still, I thought the stories were worth it.While I don't know and have never met the author of this book, I was fortunate enough to know one of the contributors, Lillian Jeffryes. I had an opportunity to see the house where she lived during the dustbowl and found her description of all that dust, in everything including their food interesting (if a little repetitious). Looking at the house (long since torn down), I thought of all that dust swirling around, eking into every little crack.For someone interested in what it was like, this is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous but fun serial!","review":"This is a ridiculous serial (What do you expect?

The first volume serves as a great introduction to a remarkable cast of characters and lays the foundation for a story which combines sword and sorcery with classic literature references to such novels as \\"Moby Dick\\". This story is truly one of a kind and contains detailed fleshed out characters who bring levity to the dangerous parts of the story and who bring wit and warmth to the light parts. Jeff Smith created something special when he set about writing \\"Bone\\" and this epic should be enjoyed by anyone who fancies his or herself a lover of graphic novels or the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 8-year-old went crazy over this book","review":"I have been trying to find something new for my 8-year-old son that really grabs him.

My previous 4th graders and middle schoolers (especially the boys) adore this series, so I was willing to give it a go, but I found the humor and storyline unappealing. I forced myself to finish this first book in the series--I was uninterested by the tribulations of three 'bone' characters, cousins who journey into the unknown, become separated, and eventually reunite. But clearly more trouble is headed their way as this first book in the series concluded. But I will not be reading on to find out what that trouble is! I can see why this plot and humor would appeal to middle grade readers, but it just didn't do much for me. Would not recommend this to many readers, except my most reluctant student readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out From Boneville","review":"In the first Bone book Phoney bone gets into trouble in his own town causing him and his cousins Fone Bone , and Smiley Bone to get chased out of town.

I'm 35 and have been reading and collecting comics since I was 8 or 9. I've seen a lot of great stuff out there but this is tops. Jeff Smith's art is so unique, the writing is excellent and the story throughout the entire series is just epic.

My second grade daughter LOVES them. My high school students dove for them when I brought a few to class (I had to make a sign-up sheet). They're surprisingly popular, and I love it that they are such kid friendly graphic novels. I believe much of the appeal is in the odd but fun illustrations and humor. The reviews on Goodreads are very positive, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT appropriate for children","review":"I was completely shocked and horrified that this book is marketed to young children by Scholastic. My eight year old son received the first Bone book as a gift. I could not believe that the content contains characters smoking and drinking beer. This is NOT a book that should be given to a child for that reason alone! After doing some research I read that Scholastic at first did not want to include the inappropriate content, however they decided to leave it in the book anyway. As a parent I do not think any child should be reading a book that \\"glamorizes\\" smoking. I am also disgusted that Scholastic, which is a name parents trust, would allow this series to be marketed to young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bleak, Pity Party of an Album","review":"Smile Empty Soul's album sounds exactly like what you would expect from a band with that name. It's a depressed alt rock act taking a cue from Staind by crying on all 14 tracks about foul family life and how much life sucks. This wouldn't be such a fault if the music itself was compelling, however, the band is less intrested in playing rock than crooning sad songs. The result is a second rate run-of-the-mill sound. The songs, while painful and cathartic, are sloppy in their writing and execution. This is only excusable because of their age and inexperience. They still have a way's to go before they should be considered as true rock musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick A$$ music!!!","review":"Hey yall this is the kid who said I don't like the rock music but that was before i bought the disc and when i wrote that i was only listening to free clips like watching the video on their web-site but now that i've listened to the whole cd throught i just wanna say it rocks , All the tracks rock so good it just the best cd well it is smile empty soul keep rockin A** and taking names because you guys rock cant wait for a second album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad...but there's hope!","review":"Smile Empty Soul is not what I would call the greatest band in the world. They sound almost identical to the multitude of other nu-metal bands. Still, they show some promise. They lyrics aren't completely worthless- in fact, they are actually good at some points. Bottom of a Bottle and Nowhere Kids are two excellent songs. After that, the album falls flat on its face. The band attempts to make some \\"soft\\" ballads-- with horrible results. In fact, after the two aforementioned songs, the rest of the album is pretty forgettable. I think the words of my local radio station put it best: \\"These guys peaked with Bottom of a Bottle.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't","review":"This is one of those band who think they are better than what they actually are. And i am actually ashamed of myself that i actually took the time to listen to this album, i was drunk.

They don't even deserve the one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most painful thing I've ever heard","review":"Uggh. How can so many people be praising this band? This is literally the worst album I have ever heard. Half the songs seem to be about repeating the chorus at least three times in a row. This is probably to make up for the fact that this band doesn't really have anything worthwhile to say to begin with (much like fellow cookie cutter band Trapt) I'd give this zero stars if I could. Take my advice and avoid this CD like the plague. However if there is somebody in your life that you don't like, I suggest buying them this CD. There's no better punishment then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Band","review":"With the first single, 'Bottom of a Bottle' from Smile Empty Soul's self-titled debuet release, the band has gained the recognition that they deserve. With most rock albums, they are not solid albums. You can't listen to the whole CD, song after song. But with this SES CD, you can. From the awesome guitar playing on 'Bottom of a Bottle' all the way to the thoughtful 'Eraser', every song is a hit. With heartfelt lyrics such as \\"With this knife I'll cut out the part of me, the part that cares for you..\\" in 'With This Knife'. The vocals of lead singer Sean Danielson shines a bit of light on his life on such songs as 'Silhouettes' singing, \\"I don't want to live like my mother. I don't want to let fear rule my life. And I don't want to live like my fater. I don't want to give up before I die\\" All in all, this CD is one of the year's best and I give much props to the three-piece band."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Overall this cd gets a thumbs down.

Not opinion, it is the truth. How can a human being sit and listen to recycled, retarded lyrics, the likes of which appear prominantly on this album? A friend told me of this band, saying their \\"Bottom of a Bottle\\" song was AMAZING. I listened to it... and heard the usual crap: guitars that do NOTHING, non-existent bass, simple drumming, an extremely annoying, one-dimensional siger, and , for some reason, the line \\"I did it for the DRUGS!\\" excited my friend. \\"See?\\" he said, \\"I told you they kicked @ss!\\" I simply sighed with frustration, knowing it would take many weeks for me to forget this terrible crap, so I immediately went to my room and listened to GOOD music, such as: Cradle of Filth, Ministry, DevilDriver, Candiria, Dog Fashion Disco, Opeth, and anything else that I thought would help me forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This was a good CD. The lyrics have a meaning to me even though the lyrics probably aren't meant the way they mean something to me. I'd say I'd give them 5 stars.

The sound is awful and the lyrics look like a whiny 5-year-old wrote them.Im so glad i copied this CD instead of wasting 15 of my own money.

I first heard Smile Empty Soul while listening to the radio, and they mentioned this new band, and i loved what i heard. I have been waiting for the cd to come out, and in the meantime, i've listened to several of the song samples, and i had to buy it. The only reason i rated this cd 4 out of 5 is because i just got it and i haven't had the time to listen to all of the songs, but from what i've heard, it's well worth the 10 bucks i spent on it. I really hope these guys make it, because they have a lot of talent! Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Unoriginal...","review":"C'mon, how many times have we heard this by now? I understand having angst and stuff, but there's a limit. I think the whole hating your parents thing is played out by now (I mean, even Korn has moved on past that). There isn't much talent in this band, anyway. Generic three to four minute hard rock songs, as well as the now frequent acoustic \\"ballads\\" are all you'll get here. I won't say there isn't anything good about this CD, because songs like \\"All My Problems\\" and \\"Radio in a Hole\\" have some catchy parts, but not much could bring this album back out of its unoriginality. You can skip this, and if you want good hard modern rock, check out Three Days Grace.

The rest of the album is not particularly good.

The band that created this: Smile Empty Soul. After hearing this song, I just had to hear more of this influential band. I then listened to the acoustic ballad, \\"I Want My Life,\\" after that, I was hooked. Smile Empty Soul is just simply an awesome band. What makes them simply brilliant is that they can transition from hard rock to the more simplistic soft rock ballads, such as \\"This Is War\\" and \\"I Want My Life\\" with such ease, and their singer/guitarist Sean Danielson helps most greatly with the use of his poetic voice. I wouldn't be quite suprised if this three pronged rock group became as popular as the Deftones or even Nirvana."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all sounds the same....","review":"To the fans of Smile Empty Soul...what does this band's music do for you? There are seriously a million bands that sound exactly like this. What? Do you think these guys are changing the face of the music industry? Please...their songs sound much like my Greek dad when I hear him singing Grrreek songs in the shower with his dreadful voice. Based on popular music of today, I would not be surprised if Atlantic Records paid a visit to my house and signed my dad to a lucrative record contract, based on the talent (or lack of talent) of mainstream bands. Ok kids, lets sneak out of our houses, steal candy at the local convenience store, then during the getaway, blast \\"Nowhere Kids\\" in your '94 Ford Tempo. Soon all kids will get inspired to do something \\"bad\\" from listening to Smile Empty Soul.

They sent their album to our school and I was the lucky one to review it and keep it. I must say that this is one of the most powerful albums in my collection. The music is heavy, it's soft, and Sean Danielsen writes some of the deepest lyrics I've ever heard. If you like alternative rock or metal, I definitely recommend this album.By the way, Smile Empty Soul is awesome in concert. I just saw them with Trapt a few weeks ago.

If you just listen to the lyrics, it brings out the whole song and what makes the cd so great. Give it a shot. When you feel down, this is a good cd to play cause you can relate to the songs.

Then it turns out its another new band called Smile Empty Soul. I was intrigued by there name so I wanted to find out more about this band. Luckily, I downloaded the songs because I find this album to be somewhat boring, and they need to practice a little more. Another thing that makes this album bad is the production.

For example, if you put a mix of puddle of mudd songs, trapt songs and smile empty sould songs on a CD I couldn't tell it was from different bands.

I listened to the cd on cdnow.com and really enjoy the song \\"bottom of the bottle\\" so i bought the album. Like the other review, I too give them a \\"4\\" for a rating because I have yet to listen to the entire album because of how much I enjoy the first 5 songs.

I mean i think it's one of the best rock cds. Their first single \\"Bottom Of A Bottle\\" is actually a really good song on it. I mean u might think thats all they got but definately not their cd kicks!!! And well they kick ass live!!! I got to see them with Three Days Grace and Trapt! it was an awesome show so if they come near u definately go see them and the CD go buy it at ur favorite cd store or buy it here on Amazon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SES ROCKS","review":"Smile Empty Soul, is a great band their c.d. rocks. I have seen them live 4 times and they seam to get better everytime I see them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not reaching potential","review":"I liked this album, I really did, but one thing that could've made it better were less of the toned-down mellowed out songs.However, in comparison to a lot of typical nu-rock/alt-rock releases this was more than just all 'straight-edge in your face' rock.After hearing 'bottom of a bottle' you tend to expect a more heavy sound on most of the tracks, but I suppose they wanted to go in a different direction for the rest of the album. Yes it has its peaks, and its a great listen for when you just feel like kicking back with some pure music. I don't think SES is reaching their full potential, which isn't a bad thing but it never hurts to put out more aggressive music. Hopefully more of that will be on their sophomore album as well as the sound they've put out already.4.5 / 5.0"},{"rating":"2","title":"SES= Real Rock","review":"In a time where rap/rock rules the airwaves, SES breathes life into a dying art form. The art form that I am referring to is hard rock. There are only 3-6 other groups out there now (KoRn, Cold, Staind, Metallica, Ozzy and Rob Zombie) that are still rock. SES returns to the scene of real rock. I'm not saying groups like Linkin Park is bad but give me a break. I am thankful that SES is out. Every song on this cd is great but the standout tracks on this cd is \\"Silhouetts\\". \\"Nowhere Kids\\", \\"This Is War\\", \\"For You\\", \\"Your Way\\", \\"Every Sunday\\", and \\"With This Knife\\". Go out and buy this cd if want to listen to real rock with true emotion. I would personally reccomend it to anyone who likes Cold and Staind. For that matter, anyone who likes groups that deal with personal problems and problems teens today face, Smile Empty Soul is the band for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"The cd has no bad songs, the lyrics capture something where u feel the emotion of the songwriters, and while you listen you don't feel that the music has mocked what music is all about, artistry, and this CD truly grabs the essence of what true artwork in music is, perfect CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter's cd","review":"my 14-year old daughter left this cd in my car, so I listened to it.

But the fact of the matter is this album is really just beating a dead horse. If youve heard Puddle Of Mudd and Nirvana youve heard this band and they dont bring anything new to the table.

There are so many good rock/metal groups that make Smile Empty Soul look like juvinille pop stars it's laughable. Such groups include the older bands like Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and Iron Maiden (and plenty more), as well as newer groups like Tool (well, they aren't very new, but new enough), Pantera, Hatebreed, Mushroomhead, Disturbed (I'm probably going to get greif for mentioning them, but I don't care), Spineshank, Korn, Chevelle, A Perfect Circle, Godsmack, Coal Chamber, Rob Zombie, Ill Nino, Cold, System of a Down, and Soulfly. Even if you don't like nu-metal, I think anyone with a brain can realize how much better these bands are than the generic bands, such as SES, Trapt, Three Days Grace, Staind, and, the worst of them all, Linkin Park (DON'T get me started on them!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"generic rehash of everything else.","review":"This cd is terrible. It's nothing but a rehash of everything that's been previously done in alternative music. There are no original ideas whatsoever here. None. Angsty lyrics, grungy guitar, etc.This album might have been cool in 1991, when angst rock was just getting started, but now it sounds horribly dated, and it doesn't help that they haven't brough any new ideas into their sound.If you want a crappy ripoff of a crappy style of music, then you'll probably love SMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sadly disappointed","review":"I must say...this CD is a waste of money.

DO NOT buy this CD unless you are looking for sheer disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mundane CD","review":"Maybe ten or twelve years ago this could've worked, had it not been done over about a thousand times. Songs about anger, opression, running away, being covetous and whining. It's all in here in disposable package too.The band caught on like wildfire with their first single: \\"Bottom of a Bottle\\", and rode the success of bands like Korn, Papa Roach, and Limp Bizket (All of which suck). The band does their best efforts to relinquish a bit of their monotony by precipitating a few ballads...or slower songs. Like \\"Silohouettes\\", but with a rythym all all too familar, a lack of strong lyrical content jagged guitars that sound out of place. This album demonstrates well that Smile Empty Soul indeed are a band as their name implies. They simply in the end, have empty soul in their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH ANNOYING!!","review":"jeeze this singers voice is so annyoying expecially when he sreams-WOOF! it makes my ears bleed-im sick about hearin about you bad childhood and you love relationship gone bad-get creative with you lyrics-o and by the way anarcy SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty is right","review":"Let me just say this....EMO.

I was in a bit of a foul mood to begin with when I got there and the mass amount of time we had to wait and the lame crowd put me in a bad mood and then on top of it there was this rediculous local band that played first. I was ready to go when they came on but decided to wait to see the band I had come to see. Then they started to play and it made staying all worth it. They were simply put- fantastic. For those of you who has seen or heard their first single \\"Bottom of a Bottle\\" you have and idea of their sound, but don't be fouled--they have a range in sound all worth hearing. They are alternative and thats for sure but they are not your typical alternative rock band.So if you are looking for something a little different with words worth actually listening to seek no further than than Smile Empty Soul"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for people who really want to know about the breed","review":"i bought this book originally because i own a sphynx and wanted to have some reference material about the breed.unforunately this book comes across as rich reference material in the description, but is anything but.it's written as though a parent is reading it to a child, or a child is reading it themselves.

Besides the propagandic issue, it's surprising that the fight scenes in this big budget film shot in 2009 are so uncinematically klunky.Russians also tried unsuccessfully co-opting the Ukrainian-American actor Jack Palance, See 'Jack Palance rejects Russian award.' [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Religion and Nationalism","review":"If the point of this movie is to display how life was once a bit messy then in every redundant grimy bloody detail it succeeded. The actors, dirt, blood & Vodka, etc. were continually well played to the point of being overly used and eventually tiresome. Is there some sense of historical record? Yes, I suppose, but who's to say after 500 years with few first hand accounts. Even Gogol rewrote the Bulba novelette, two hundred years after the portrayed events, in the mid 1800s to appease Russian sentimentality.One star because the entire production from writing, to directing to editing is an affront to any viewer who succeeded in passing the 11th grade (graduation not required). If there ever was a modality to showcase nationalism, particularly with religious underpinnings, then this movie did so but contrary to it's intent the result is a sense of disgust.

And it's not just chemistry specific either (it provides applications to advanced chemistry, but those aren't necessary to enjoy the book)The best part is, it gives proofs for _everything_. All the math equations I'd known for years but had never found proofs for I've finally found in this book -- from the definite integral to the logarithmic product rule to the vector cross product. And the book goes step by step, so if you're the type (like me) that learns by reading the actual proofs for an equation (rather than vague descriptions of equations which, we are told, \\"work\\"), you'll be able to learn a lot of new math as well as reinforce the old.If you like math........ buy it. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"I will give five stars for this really good book.

There was nothing joyful about the book. It was all sad, nothing happy about it. The only likeable charcter was Bill (the Cowboy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice","review":"This book was okay. I recieved it as a gift. But to me, Jessie wallowed in self-pity way too much. It got pathetic. Many kids have gone through much more, and didn't whine nearly as much. It was hard to read through. You could guess what was going to happen in the 7th chapter.I think that it's cool that a male author wanted to write a book. But let's face it. He's a man, yet, he wrote from a women's point of view. Men think, act, show emotion, so much differently from women. If he wanted to write a book, he should have written it from a man's point of view. Because, obviously, he IS a man. Few men can be sensitive and emotional.

Due to hum-drum writing and poor lyrics, Ms. Easton has never found a writer's voice deserving enough to be the vessel for her own talent. Depressingly, Freedom is nothing more than another notch in the album belt. With the exception of Misty Blue, the songs are flat and entirely forgettable. And whomever recycled Modern Girl should be fired from his/her P.R. job! The only upside here however has to do with the continuing development of Ms. Easton's voice. It beckons towards the Blues and longs for another album of classics like No Strings. There is raw talent here, even polished. We, the listeners, and Ms. Easton just need some song lyrics worthy enough and large enough to resonate and have an impact. For whatever reason, the power ballad wanna-bes keep finding a home in Ms. Easton's musical repertoire. Give us a break and set her Free!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment!","review":"Being a big Sheena Easton fan, I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this album. Given that it is an import, even more so. When the CD opens with a children's chorus singing la la la la, I knew I was in trouble.Sheena's voice is a apppealing as ever, but the material here is very blah, very forgetable. Songs like \\"One Man\\", \\"Misty Blue\\", and \\"Love Will Make You Wise\\" keeps the CD from the trash can. These should be pleasant album tracks, not the standouts.This CD is an example of why Sheena doesn't have a U.S. record deal.

This is really ideal for doing drywall work in a \\"lived in\\" house.For contractors, once you are set up, you can absolutely fly with this thing. I'm sure it will pay for itself in time/money. Sandpaper is expensive, but they last a long time.

Not even the copious resource lists in the second half of the book are of any use, as they are terribly outdated. This book is just another in that category of \\"self-help\\" \\"pursue-your-dreams\\" books, as alluded to by another reviewer, that, for some reason, promote the idea that spending one's spare time compiling a bunch of lists will lead to some sort of epiphany about what one should do with one's life--a shallow, self-indulgent, and thoroughly ineffective endeavor.But I'll let the book speak for itself.

However, much of the first half of this book focused on the question of whether you should leave the profession of law (which may be helpful for people who have not yet made this decision.)

If you're an avid Titanic fan and have read everything else it's a decent buy seeing as how most of the photographs that you see of the Titanic came from this man, but the pictures aren't very dramatic and it's not a good place to look if you want a good summary of the Titanic and what happened.

This is a slender volume that reviews why juries give money, why juries hold back money and the current 'tech' on how to increase damages. He has also included sample outlines for opnening statements, closing arguments, and how to structure the case. I've had it for about a year and every case I work up, I flip through and review the good qualities and danger aspects of the case. This is the most useful book I have in structuring a case and setting a discovery plan. Whenever I speak at seminars or conferences I always push this book.

The book assumes that you are from a Commonwealth country (read: Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and to a lessor extent, Canada) because everything is compared with the broad Commonwealh culture. If you don't understand much of the Commonwealth culture (such as cricket) you may comfortably skip the entire culture section.Another thing is that some descriptions are incorrect. For example, it claimed that New Yorkers had ties \\"back to the UK\\" during the American War of Independence. In reality there was no country called the United Kingdom until 1801, well after the end of the war.So my advice: try another travel guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these guys","review":"I had the chance to see GBS last year in Fort Lauderdale.

And by political she meant that it would cause no social harm or risk of being ostracized. I respect her opinion, but I just know that is not a true statement.I think the reason we dont share our stories more often is that there is such a risk, especially in the Christian crowd, of facing these judgements once people know some of the choices we have made.Reading the previous review on here, I totally agree that there are so many valuable stories waiting to be heard, but it seemed for me that this DVD didnt invite me to share mine with anyone new.

I just read the most recent reviews of this book and was astounded by those who called Rubin 'whiny.' I think they miss the point. Losing weight, for most people- is not easy. In fact for many of us, it's the hardest thing we've ever had to do, and if we were to accurately document the process as Rubin did- it would naturally reflect that pain. It's not a perfect 1-2-3 book on how easy weight loss can be! If that's what you're hoping for- this book may not be for you.However, if what you're looking for is to know that you're not alone, that your pain and fear through this process is not unusual, that you're not the only one who sits in front of the tv stuffing chips down your throat (to be followed by ice cream) with tears streaming down your face...well then give this book a whirl.

It is a badly structured tale of one whiny woman who refuses get help for her eating disorder, somehow thinking that dieting will help. She loses some weight at first, but then spirals back into disordered eating, gains it back and never comes back out.The worst thing (in terms of the writing) is that she admits to tacking falsely-hopeful endings on her magazine articles about weight-loss, and then tacks on the same kind of ending to this book.Sorry, Courtney, the book makes poor reading because there was no real development to your story.

Some of it is enlightening, and it did explain her process (which can at times be interesting), but for the most part it struck me as neurotic and extremely redundant. She also doesn't take much responsibility for her own physicality.

There was no definitive list of what would fit and what wouldn't.I chose this because reviewers mentioned that it had a large gap that could fit a spoiler.At least for my 2010 Dodge Avenger RT, this worked perfectly.It holds the bikes on securely, and it's easy to put on and take off.It doesn't hold the tire out so far that it wont scuff up your bumper, but I was expecting that. If you are expecting it to hold your bike out far enough away to not scuff your bumper, you probably want a different type of rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating.","review":"This rack is very easy to mount, however, getting a bike up there is very difficult, not to mention 2 bikes. Very tight fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent bike rack","review":"I bought this rack for my 2000 honda civic and it fits great. I have a diamond back mountain bike which has the cables under the top frame and the hard palstic broke my clip for one of the cales. Lesson learned. I went to the hardware store and spent a few bucks (less than 10) to modify this rack. I took PVC pipe, cut it in half and secured it over the factory holders, and then added rubber to the inside to soften the ride for my bike. It works great and my bike is more secure when I drive down the street. I am able to hold two full size mountain bike with no issues. My only complaint is that the straps that secure the bike down are plastic and will wear out very soon. I have already made plans to change them to a better system for only a few more dollars. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good inexpensive rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for more than one bike","review":"Have used this model for about six months now, the retaining straps on the top bars slide to the end during longer trips. If you put two bikes on the rack the top bar can bite into the trunk top if you have a sedan and leave a dent. Not meant for heavier bikes or long trips. I have upgraded to the stronger Saris Bones 2 model. Now I can carry two bikes and have no more problems with bikes shifting or loose straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rack for the price","review":"Though probably not the best rack on the market (I cannot say with my limited knowledge of bike racks), this item has served me well on multiple road trips, carrying both one bike and two at once. Mounting the rack was fairly simple and it seems quite sturdy. I was able to access the trunk even with the rack mounted, a definite plus. The plastic latches used to secure the bikes do not appear very strong, but they held very well under stress. One minor complaint regards those latches: one detached slightly from its anchor on the rack in such a way that it (and the bike) could slide along the rack bar away from the designated groove. I was able to repair the issue but if it happened once, it could happen again. In any case, I am for the most part satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Functional","review":"My old bike rack was a cheap Allen model that only had one set of straps. Because of this, the lighter end of the bike rack would often lift up while in transit. This bike rack has the benefit of two sets of straps, so the bikes are much more secure. The plastic clip-in tie downs are nice, too.My only thought is that, if you have the money to spend, get the three bike model, even if you're only transporting two. It is my understanding that the three bike model has an extra set of straps that eliminate shaking and wobbling even more (yes, when carrying two bikes, there is still some wobble when traveling at highway speeds). Also, it is a challenge to tie in both mine and my girlfriend's bikes, so longer rails would be nicer (because of the geometry of her bike, my handlebars hit in to her pannier rack, and I can't easily get the top tube to sit in the holders). Of course, if you're just transporting two road bikes without wide handlebars, you probably won't have a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical No More","review":"We had a bike rack a few years ago that attached to the trunk of our Saturn. I don't remember the brand, only that it was so difficult to use that we only used it a few times.Now living in the Desert Southwest, we've gotten more into biking and were looking for a rack for our Toyota Prius. We went to sporting goods stores and bike stores only to be told that nothing they had would fit. We did some Internet research and found the Saris. The price was right and the reviews were positive. I was skeptical but we figured we'd try it because we hadn't found any other options.Well, I've got to tell you that even the very first time we used it, we took only 10 minutes to get two bikes hooked on (and they STAYED on even at highway speeds).This is a NICE rack. Thanks to all those who reviewed it previously and helped me overcome my skepticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit over spoiler","review":"My vehicle is a 99 Toyota Camry with a spoiler. At first, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not the rack was going to fit around the spoiler. However when I put it on it was about a perfect fit! Despite the fact that the rack only has 4 straps (2 upper and 2 lower), it is very steady.With one bike attached, the rack handled very well, keeping the speed under 45 mph. Unfortunately, when I took it out to speeds of about 60, I noticed the bike doing a rocking motion. This was probably due to wind turbulence, so I would advise avoiding highways unless you use additional tie-downs for the bike. I also noticed that my bike had a slight tendency to slide back and forth in the brackets when turning.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the functionality and stability. I recommend it to any bike rider/mountain biker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for highway driving","review":"I just got back from a trip from Vermont and spent much of my time pulling over to the side of the highway to reattach the plastic straps to keep the bike in place. At higher speeds (many of the highways have a 65 mph speed limit) the wind resistance on the bike caused it to go practically horizontal while in motion. Eventually the plastic strap would detach and the bike was precariously hanging off the rack. I only had one bike on it so I doubled the plastic straps on the bike and used an additional strap to tie down the wheel and frame. That was moderately successful. I stopped in Boston to visit a friend, bought a new Allen two bike rack and tossed this one. The Allen rack had ample strap slack to wrap up the frame and wheels so the bike did not budge when I drove back. Additionally, the Allen rack keeps the bike closer to the car, which I think helped with wind resistance.If you're driving local, this will work fine. For highway driving, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"This bike rack is very poorly designed. I tried hauling 2 bikes for a 3 hour trip and the rack would not stayed flat against my car; it kept tilting. I ended up pulling off and going into REI to buy a Yakima that is the same type of rack. The Yakima never budged for the remainder of the trip. The problem with the rack is that it does not have side stabilizers only top and bottom. I thought that all racks of this type had side, top and bottom stabilizers. It may be okay for one light weight bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Let Down","review":"My son picked this out for his birthday and anxiously waited for over a week to get a booster pack.

The results of the introduction of Christianity to this group are interesting from the point of view of culture change."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant, in-depth journalism, hated by myth-makers","review":"Ritchie is not an anthropologist, or a missionary, or a tourist, or... Finally, a fascinating portrayal of what a 'primitive' or 'native' people think of all the foreign interlopers. I'm sure this book infuriates a lot of (not all) anthropologists, because it reveals how wrong some renowned anthros were about the Yanomamo people's world view, desires, sexuality, warfare, etc. It also exposes the widespread anthro-myth that missionaries are clumsy culture destroyers, and that 'primitive' people are happy in their spiritism and nakedness until ruined by vile, western, kill-joy religion. Here is the story of what a Yanomamo shaman experienced in his life before and after he met a variety of foreigners (anthropologists, missionaries, ethno- and eco-tourists, miners & loggers, et al.), and what he thought of each. This book parallels many similar stories elsewhere (esp. in the Amazon, in Papua), but this one is especially well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant exploitation of the Yanamamo for religious propaganda","review":"The book is a cheat.

But then meets seductive, sexy married chick (Joan Bennett) with blind ex-painter husband (Charles Bickford). Becomes obsessed with sexy chick (at which point girlfriend becomes almost a cameo in the film, rather than the main character she's set up to be; this is what I mean when I say you don't expect this level of filmmaking in a Renoir movie). Confrontation with husband. Repeat as necessary. You know the drill. I wonder if Renoir just needed the money?

While I dont pretend to understand him, it seems pretty accurate. I have never lost my faith in Tori's brilliant work however, and I must say that 'Scarlet's Walk' is a personal triumph. Her honey voice & her golden piano tones are present here in some of her best work. It's as if 'Little Earthquakes' & 'To Venus And Back' made love. \\"Carbon\\", \\"I Cant See New York\\", & \\"Sweet Sangria\\" are my favorites on the album & rival her earlier (& best) work. \\"Wednesday\\" has a fun, traveling beat which picks up the pace & pushes you on your cross-country journey.

The home-fires are always burning for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"To be honest, I think Tori really lost her audience on her last two albums, neither had that Tori feel to them, that Kate Bush meets Joni Mitchell and slaps her in the face kinda thing, but this album really does make you a fan again. There is a little \\"Choirgirl\\" mixed with a ton of that \\"Strange Little Girls\\" sound (which did let this album down a little), for example \\"Pancake\\", but tracks like \\"I Can't See New York\\" and \\"Taxi Ride\\" (tho that track could of easily fit into that whole \\"Venus\\" sound) do bring this album to life, it's a good thing that the gems on this cd are spread out, it tends to send you to sleep. A lot of dull tracks here, but I still rate this album highly, I really did enjoy the bigger part of this album and the good weighed out the bad for sure. This album is for the die hard fans, not the casual."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk To Remember","review":"A compelling, exotic, sad, yet memorable(and in my opinion, Tori Amos' best) set of songs. It takes a lot of talent for any artist to keep you interested through 18 songs, and over 74 minutes, and Tori, I think, is the only artist capable of doing this. She has this ability to pull you into her dreamscapes. Scarlet's Walk is one of the best albums this year. The only other that rates is Beth Orton's Daybreaker. Confusing, alluring, simply beautiful, with characters full of heart, heartache, love, loss, and depression. Tori Amos will always be the best in my eyes. She is queen of the mysterious. May she reign supreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great","review":"Tori is simply great. every cd of hers is as good if not better than the last. this one is no exception. the lyrics, the melodies and the soul behind each and every song make this worth every penny spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't buy the collectors edition","review":"I am a huge tori fan. this album is beginning to grow on me. track #4 is going to be a big one. the collectors edition comes with some generic little kid stickers, a small plastic lizard, a bunch of cardboard photos, a DVD with literally one big long video and a nice 15 minute commentary from tori. the songs are much busier than her older albums. i wish she would go back to simple, but its growing on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every track sounds the same, good thing its a good sound","review":"A musical diary of Tori's road trip journey through U.S.A. post September 11, this is probably Tori's most ambitious project in terms of lyrical content: essentially she yearns for spiritual salvation but ultimately finding only dissilusionment within the backdrop of countryside America. Scarlet's Walk opts for a 70s rock ballad sound, understated with beautifully layered vocals. While this falls very pleasantly on the ears, one quickly becomes habituated to 18 tracks of the same musical style, and the music is just not quite on par with the epic majesty of her words.Top Cuts: A Sorta Fairytale, Don't Make Me Come To Vegas, Scarlet's Walk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Tori","review":"If you like Tori's early years, you will not like this. It is boring and a real disappointment. Tori can do better and she is getting worse with each album. She is becoming mainstream and her lyrics reflect that. She would rather go platinum than write a song that could change a person's life, like \\"Me and A Gun.\\" I truly wish I could say this CD is good, but my heart and mind say it is the worst one to date. Good concept, poor music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Music Considering It's Tori","review":"This CD reminds me of Tori's \\"To Venus and Back\\" mixed with \\"Under The Pink\\". She rips herself off and does it poorly. This does not mean all of the songs are bad, but the majority are boring and too mainstream for a Tori fan that considers 1991-1996 to be her best years. This is disappointing, considering I have been lisening to her since 1991/1992. I think this may be the last Tori album I will buy. My favorite musician has lost me as a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori is now a Muzak fixture.","review":"Not in the mood nor do I have the liberty to write a dissertation on this CD.Ok, been a Tori fan for over 10 years. Done the shows. Done the obsessive-tori-is-a-god bit. While this CD isn't absolute crap (as SLaG is), it is dull. Boring. Monotonous. It's a 78 minute long song.Maybe I do expect too much. However, I guess I'm spoiled cause Tori did deliver in the past.I'm moving on. Bye bye Tori."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Beyond Words","review":"Tori Amos is truly one of the most talented artists of all time. Although she did have a couple disappointing albums, in Scarlet's Walk, Tori Amos is back.

Un cd remplie démotions et de sensibilité. Elle nous offre encore une foi un disque de grande qualité. Il y a des chansons qui son indispansable pour toute personne qui aime Tori Amos. Comme par exemple \\"I cant't seeNew-York\\" qui est longue de 7 minute et qu'on trouve quelle est trop courte, \\"Pancake\\", \\"Stange\\", \\"Amber Wave\\",\\"Gold Dust\\". Juste pour nommé ceux là car toute les chansons de ce disque sont exellente. Donc encore un exellent disque pour Tori. Un cd indispansable pour tout ceux qui aime Tori Amos.

Every single song is amazing in it's own right - though \\"Gold Dust\\" is one of my faves. I think I like it so much because it reminds me of Under the Pink -- her last couple of albums have been a little louder, a little more of a departure from Tori and her piano. I'm glad to see they're back on SW. I'd suggest this to anyone, particularly if you're looking to try Tori out - start with either this or Under the Pink. And if you get a chance... I saw her live in East Lansing, Michigan, and she is absolutely stunning in concert. This album is a must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tori Ever","review":"Although I have been listening to Tori for a long time, and own all of her albums, this is one of the few CDs where I have no desire to fastforward through any of the tracks. I mostly have bought her albums in the past for the more beautiful and melodic tracks rather than the angry and aggressive ones. The songs on this album convey passionate ideas while not compromising the overall beauty of the music and vocals. A great mix in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have been a huge Tori fan for many years. However, when I listened to this album I was thoroughly disappointed by it. I feel that it is too radio friendly. I would recommend for those of you just getting into Tori to purchase \\"Little Earthquakes\\" as a starter album. If you like it, go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every last song!","review":"I have never had this happen before, and had to write this review as soon as I could to document this strange event. This CD has 18 tracks, and I was so shocked that I LOVED EVERY LAST ONE! I have never had that happen before...there are always two or three songs on a CD that I just can't get into, but this one pleased me from beginning to end and back again. It ranks right up there with Little Earthquakes for me and can't recommend it enough. I hope you will give it a try and that you will enjoy your walk with Scarlet. There is little else to compare and I doubt you will be displeased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I have not listened enough to write an extensive review (it just came out today), but I have listened to the whole thing, and it is perfect.

Don't skip around if you want to get the most out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it","review":"I just bought the CD yesterday and I am so happy right now. I love this music. All the songs are great! You won't be disappointed. It's a CD worth buying!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"There really isn't one Tori Amos album I do not like. And, like all her other albums, there always are a few songs that just stand out and sparkle more than any others. \\"Don't make me come to Vegas\\" , \\"Taxi Ride\\" \\"Amber Waves\\" and \\"a sorta fairytale\\" are these songs. Tori's piano playing has returned in full force after making, in my opinion, a less-piano based but still wonderful album on Choirgirl. There are a lot of songs on here so you can pick and choose which ones you like best. A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great tori amos release","review":"This is the first album of all origianl tori amos album since venus. I liked strange little girls but it's good to hear tori back doing her own music. the music is great, filled with meaning after 9-11. Each song has depth since 9-11, you can tell what tori amos felt like when she maid her road trip across the country shorlty after the event. The dvd is a good companion because it shows the process of hwo tori came up with the music for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very harmonical and intimate","review":"I judge it the best album since Little Earthquakes. Though I indoubtedly love all her other works, yet - Scarlet's Walk is finally that piece of classical Tori that links us to her talent and music. That 'surrounding' voice of her, bosom lyrics, emotional and harmonical piano sound... this album shoots two aims at once - it cheers up and saddens at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The piano has been putting on makeup, not me...not me...","review":"Tori is tori and Scarlet's Walk, as one reviewer stated so well, is still better than 90% of what's out there. Lyrically, she's in top form, great images, shocking, quirky, rough, but the music has her sounding closer to a lounge act than ever before. It's uninspired, repetitive(I keep thinking I've played the song all ready and keep reaching for the CD button). Evidently she was going for that American Landscape atmosphere, I suppose. I think she should spend a little less time on her marketing and more on capturing a musical direction that is on par with her lyrics. What happened on her tour of America? No clubs or punk bars? Just diners and truckstops and that occasional, sinful, wine and cigar bar?(Let's just hope she doesn't hook up with Rod Stewart and do WW 2 music...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music","review":"Tori Amos is my FAVORITE, I think her lyrics express a lot of thing (a mix of things). I already have all her CD albums, everything I discover a new one, there is always a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for another one","review":"This is one of the best albums I own. Period. A lot of people do think she's \\"gone too far\\" with quirky lyrics, either that or they go into the whole \\"she-sold-out\\" routine. That's annoying, since it ALWAYS happens when a musician who was once little-known gets a lot of radio play. Oh well. My favorite is \\"Virginia\\", and the haunting imagery she conjures with the lyrics of that song. My only complaint is the length (too short!). I know it's a long album, but I'm always sad when \\"Gold Dust\\" ends, leaving me wanting to hear the whole story/album again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk of Memories","review":"Tori Amos has once again given us an incredible masterpiece in the form of <b>Scarlet's Walk</b>. Taking us on a journey of 18 songs that formed the basis of the afterthoughts following the September 11 incident. Choice tracks include the lead-off single A Sorta Firytale, Amber Waves, Taxi Ride and Gold Dust. Tori shows great panache on such tracks where her inner angst and exasperation has been relegated to seond priority as she explores greater issues such as finding an American identity.Great album following Bruce Springsteen's The Rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word...","review":"...COHESIVE. Oh mercy, I believe this album might actually define cohesive. Possibly I'm disproportionately enamored of music that recalls the American experience/essence, or possibly this is just a really freaking amazing album. Likely a little of both.Not since the Doors, L.A Woman, have I come across an LP that fits together as well as Scarlets walk. Although she's kind enough to include a little map detail in the CD jacket, you don't need it. The music takes you to those places whether through stunning lyrics--the kind that strike something deep within in you, though you can't always immediately pinpoint the reason--or regionally inspired melodies. It's music to drive to, think over, mull about and, untimately, collapse to in recognition of Amos' sheer genius. Yay for Tori."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlet's Walk","review":"Scarlet's Walk being Amos 7th studio album and her 2002 release was a major hit for Amos and peaked at #7 in the Billboard 200. Songs that standout on this album are \\"A Sorta Fairytale\\", \\"Taxi Ride\\" and \\"Don't Make Me Come to Vegas\\". The booklet is filled with many nice pictures of Ms Amos and it all the lyrics are included along with a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary.","review":"Slowly but surely, Tori Amos is making me rethink what I thought I knew about talent.As an agnostic, I'd always figured that genetics plus hard work could ultimately explain just about any artistic accomplishment. I'm not so sure anymore. In fact, I'm half convinced that Tori is either a Good Space Alien (in the same way that Dick Cheney is a Bad Space Alien), or someone sent to us directly from the Almighty himself to make us question everything anew, or maybe both.Spiritual speculation aside, though, _Scarlet's Walk_ is a stunner any way you slice it. Its generous 74 minutes and 18 songs leave plenty of room for you to not like a few things -- personally, I tend to skip tracks 7-9 -- and still get more than your money's worth.You and I *are* worthy of _Scarlet's Walk_. But perhaps just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Fan, never buying another Tori record","review":"I've been a fan of Tori Amos since the early nineties. I recently bought Scarlet's Walk because I figured she deserved one last chance after the travesty that was Strange Little Girls. Although it pains me to say it, this album is just boring. The tone rarely changes, the production makes her voice sound muffled and her lyrics are a shadow of her former albums. If you feel like paying 25.00 for some cool stickers, then buy this album. But if you're looking for Tori Amos, dig deep into your cd pile and put Boys for Pele in the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not forth it","review":"So very empty.

Her lyrics are horrible and her voice, which used to be good, is so groggy. Tori tries to be different but she just ends up being kooky. Check out some of her lyrics or interviews to see what I mean. Tori should have packed it in after To Venus and Back, but no! We're going to be subjected to her nonsense for years to come. Scarlet's Walk has a few good tracks (A Sorta Fairytale, Carbon & Virginia) but the rest is terrible. Give it up, Tori! You stopped being good six years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have been a big Tori fan for years but this album is her worst. Her lyrics completely make no sense and most of the songs are unlistenable. She has gotten more an more into esoteric meanings in her songs that only she must understand. Her \\"secret language\\" is annoying and makes for unpleasant listening. This album is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"SW is too much for one sitting","review":"This CD is truly EPIC! And I'm not just talking about the record label, or event he abundance of goodies included in the special edition \\"box\\" edition of the CD. No, the lyrics Amos weaves on the CD are epic, intriguing, multileveled stories that go far beyond a single listening.Many critics are comparing SW to her solo debut--LITTLE EARTHQUAKES--but do not think that SCARLET'S WALK heralds Amos' returns to heart wrenching confessional type honesty that won her so many fans. In her lyrics Amos still guards what feelings and events truly come from her life by using characters such as Scarlet, but this album IS like her debut in the way that the music and lyrics are thought-out and extremely well crafted. Unlike past albums, Amos' lyrics on SCARLET'S WALK avoid being enigmatic (or silly) and are instead lush, rich, and thick with meaning and substance. If you've strayed from Amos in the past this is the CD that will bring you back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gorgeous album from Tori Amos!","review":"I have been a huge Tori fan for a number of years, and I have loved every single one of her albums. This one is no exception. This album is an insight into Tori herself through the eyes of a fictonal woman. I think that listening to this album is the closest you can get to Tori Amos without actually meeting her! The music in this album is by far some of her best work. I, being a pianist for 17 years, have all of her songbooks, so I have experienced her music firsthand (or as close as I can get) and I have to say that these songs climb into your heart, head and soul. Fabulous album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"I have looked for this to be released on cd for as long as I have had a cd player, I wore out two albums and couldn't even find one of the old vinyls.

I loved it as a child and I still love it. Don't know what makes the Bros. 4 sound so good (and this CD sounds amazing, technically speaking). Their voices, their own arrangements - I don't know. I ended up ordering 3 more CDs, each has two Bros. 4 records on it. They all sound good. This is perhaps my favorite one because I played it so much as a child. I listen to them driving to and from work and I must say that I have changed my attitude about being stuck in traffic - don't mind it at all!!!

I like the first album the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal CD","review":"At first when I listened to the 30-sec. song samples, I couldn't really figure out what this CD or for that matter Robinella & The CC Stringband is all about. Yes, I saw the \\"Man Over\\" video and that was cool, but what about the rest of the CD? Well, I finally spent the few bucks and it is really money well spent! And it is an exceptional album--you've got to listen to it several times to get all the details and the most excellent arrangements. Robinella's voice range of course is superbly represented on this CD. Every song is creative with a bluegrass/newgrass and alt-country undertone, supported by fiddles and dobros, etc., but there's also this touch of blues, jazz, cajun and even gospel which spices up the whole CD and makes it an interesting and pleasant musical work of art. And just like the \\"Man Over\\" video brings out, this music is fun and far away from the usual commercial junk. Great job, Robinella & CC SB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most \\"useful tool on the truck\\".","review":"I have had the tool for about a year now and use it very little. It goes through blades like gangbusters unless you are using it in very soft thin material. It will cut drywall fairly well but throws dust around, my customers would kill me. The only use that I make of it now is cutting cement board where I need to make round or curved cuts. This it does fairly well. It will do soft tile, but I prefer an air tool since it has more control.

After buying the high dollar plaster bit, I could only get about 3\\" until it burned the bit up. Not exactly what they advertise for this everything tool. I did try the tool on other materials and found it could only do a good job on drywall (a little more messy than a key hole saw). I think the tool is a rediscovered drywall tool with a nice handle. A case for the tool would have been nice so when I toss it to the side it dosen't get damaged under the building material that I cut with a real saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it NO stars.....","review":"I read a lot of reviews on this tool, some were good, some were bad. So I thought I would give it a try. First of all, it's the loudest tool I've ever heard, my wife told me to turn it off so she could hear her table saw. The main complaint in the reviews I read was that the bits break very easily. I have a lot of experience with tools, I read the directions, went very slowly, let the bit do the work, and after five minutes, SNAP! I took it back in an hour. I was cutting poplar, a super soft wood, about 1/3 inch thick. If it can't cut that, what can it cut? Also, when it was cutting, it cut extremely rough, if would take forever to sand away the rough edges it left. I would recommend a jigsaw as a much better tool. I have never broken a blade on a jigsaw. And it cuts much cleaner. And you can get on for half the price of the rotozip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pattern Cutting","review":"I am really disappointed with this tool when it comes to freehand cutting of a 1/4\\" plywood template.

Many consider these to be perhaps their best works. Pure, beautiful harmonies, as calming as a country stream, and their interplay guitar work is creative and very professional with unique arrangements too. This is a joy to listen to. I have been listening to it for days and have not tired of it. It does feature a wide variety of songs, styles and stories to tell. Even Bob Dylan said their harmony was what he aspired to. They influenced many including The Everly Brothers, Dylan and in the late 1940's were the roots of rockabilly and early rock and roll (Check out later King releases).

We've \\"danced\\" to this CD nearly every day for the past 2 or 3 months. Now, he starts \\"bopping\\" to the music as soon as I hit the \\"play\\" button.

It sounds like the same little girl's voice on all songs. Then after we played it a few times, the layer of vocals was erased! Now, we just have the instrumental version of the songs. Very strange, this has never happened to me before. I guess the monotonous voice problem is solved..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long overdue","review":"Rubel and John have written a superb book calling us back to a theology centered on the mindset and heart of Jesus. The book also calls us to leave our common institutional theology that produces a sectarian mindset. The \\"proposal\\" is that RELATIONSHIPS will become the filter and lens for our discipleship, not institutions. They do a superb job of showing the reader how scripture calls us to this relational theology over and over again. They equally do a great job communicating HOW and WHY we evolved into a people that becameinstitutional motivated in our discipleship.Not everyone will have ears to hear this call to become more Christ centered as opposed to institutional centered. Not everyone had ears 2,000 years ago either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put this book down","review":"I could not put this book down. I kept saying to myself, \\"He is saying what I have been thinking for years.\\" I am tired of the competitiveness all too often in Christianity. \\"I am right and you are wrong, therefore we cannot worship together.\\" Or, \\"I have it figured out.\\" \\"You have love and happiness, but I have truth.\\" This \\"superior\\" thinking drives me crazy and Satan loves it. He loves a divided Jesus following.This book demonstrates how we should all be working together to learn God's will and truth. We do this best together. When we disagree theologically we should continue as brothers and sisters.Can a man striving to know God's will be incorrect and still saved? Well, let's see. Not according to some. But then, what about Jesus' apostles? Were they not wrong in some of their beliefs about Jesus and His coming? Were they lost? God is their judge and our judge. This books formulates a new thinking of peace and unity so we can fight the real enemy, Satan."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT JUST ANOTHER GOOD MOVIE","review":"This movie did so well as \\"The Chaos Experiment\\" they renamed it \\"The Steam Experiment\\" and re-released it. After the original came out, the state of California reacted to the film and made it illegal for Eric Roberts and Val Kilmer to be in a movie together for the greater good of humanity.Val Kilmer shows up at a Grand Rapids newspaper and wants his manifesto published on how global warming is going to destroy the world in 2012. He claims he has 6 people held hostage in a steam bath and they are going to die. The police are called in and the movie swaps back and forth between the steam room and the police interrogation, neither of which has enough drama, acting, or clever script to hold my attention. Once Eve Mauro put her top back on, the movie was over for me. Oh yeah, there is a twist at the end which only makes the movie worse, if that is possible.Doesn't work as a horror, drama, action, or thriller.F-bomb, nudity, a mouthy Italian, and a cop with a pinkie ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes of awful","review":"such great actors in such a terrible movie.

There are so many better movies for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived. Idiotic. Pointless.","review":"I know Kilmer likes offbeat roles, but this one reaches new heights..or depths, as the case may be. His eye twitching and facial contortions vary from ludicrous to absurd.

Do not watch it is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Val, why?","review":"Kilmer and Assante do their best with this oddly written thriller. I don't mean odd in a good way.Zero suspense, poor story-flow, and a laughably bad ending makes me want to one-star the effort. However, Val Kilmer and Armand Assante manage to elevate the production to \\"curious\\". The victim's introduction scene in the steam room will be your challenge; if you can get past that, you won't be too disappointed by the time you suffer the end - you know the letdown potential is fairly high early on.There are several \\"uncomfortable\\" moments which are surely worth something, but there are no shocks for the horror fan, and no neat twists or dialogue for the intellectual thriller crowd.The soundtrack (Don MacDonald) stood out, and Grand Rapids natives will be interested to see home on the big screen. Otherwise this is hard to recommend to anyone but a die hard Kilmer or Assante completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just kept thinking, 'It's going to get better!'","review":"I was wrong. It never got better. Why Val Kilmer and Eric Roberts would sign on to do this movie is completely beyond me.

Like another viewer said I want my two hours of my life back - it is that bad. The plot - well if you could call it that - moronic and makes no sense. I would tell you what the plot was but I honestly don't know. Something about killing people in a steam room to protest global warming.Unbelievable and gratuitous violence. The whole thing is disjointed and stupid.The acting bizarre and terrible.

When I found it on CD on Amazon.com I was really excited. I had never heard or heard of the Make Someone Happy album.

Their big hit, You were on my mind, was a huge American hit. It was not released in the UK, so Crispian St Peters covered it and had an equally huge UK hit with it. They also had a minor American hit with Let's get together.The style of their music was folk-pop, but the two albums here contain songs from a variety of sources. This is obvious from the covers, which include songs from shows as well as pop songs, among them being Tonight, Beyond the sea, My favorite things, Can't help falling in love, Softly as I leave you, Somewhere, Small world, Cast you fate to the wind and Our day will come.If you enjoy sixties folk-pop music, you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing transfer to CD","review":"I own both of these albums on vinyl. Since they were acquired in the 1960's, they show some signs of age and I had hoped that modern audio transfer technology might even improve the original recordings; that is certainly not the case. The Make Someone Happy tracks are the worst--distortion and fuzziness make some tracks almost unpleasant. There just doesn't seem to have been much attention paid to the final product in the transfer process. That's a shame, because We Five has always been one of my favorite groups from that era, and they didn't leave behind a lot of material.

Anyway, their single, \\"Caught in the Rain\\" was very promising. It's just too bad that none of the remaining tracks equal this song, in my opinion. Not even close actually. The sad part for me is that on paper, this band should be much better. The lead singer has a unique voice, and the rhythm section sometimes is very solid. I just didn't hear anything of substance that would make me go out and purchase the CD again. After listening to the album about 1/2 dozen times, I just couldn't take it anymore. Hopefully, Revis will create better riffs and add more bluesy grooves to their songwriting in the future, because they do show a lot of promise.

I was watching the remote cabin for a family on vacation and had recently seen too many Alfred Hitchcock videos. A mood of inner decay, a cold stillness and the fear of malevolent ghosts creeping around inside the house was enhanced by the record.

With more weight than Rasberries by far , more of an American equivalent to Badfinger .

That may be the intended or unintended point of Third, but that is not what attracts me to music. Some of the songs, such as Kizza Me and a few others, seem like a waste of space, and the best song on here, Till the End of the Day, is not even a Big Star song. Also, the inclusion of Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On is completely pointless. There are a few good moments, and the album would have been a lot better if the length had been cut in half. In general, Third has absolutely no direction and is a cult classic simply because it is the product of a crazy, albeit influential, guy in a band on the verge of collapse. By far Big Star's worst album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't hear it","review":"I have seen that some of the reviewers of this, the Third release by Big Star, claim it to be a classic. A dark testimony of a troubled artist flipping the bird to his management and the record industry. I just don't get it. A fan of the first two Big Star releases and no stranger to dark and daunting works by other artists, all I get from this is a feeling that Alex Chilton laughs his heinie off everytime he cashes a royalty check from sales of this album. A collection of unfinished pieces, dirges, fair, but unspectacular covers and unfocused songs, I have tried numerous times to try to get into it's murk without success. It probably does an excellent job of showing the state of the artist at the time, but honestly, how many times do you go back and listen to this if you own it?

They use so many different instruments, they're like a rock orchestra that's traveled around the globe and taken samples from music everywhere. Listening to it is like being transported. It's magical. The lyrics are poetic, sometimes so sweet you wanna cry and sometimes so sad you wanna cry. And Nick Urata's voice is one of my favorites now. It's almost operatic at times, dramatic, romantic, and like an old lover calling you home. The music is very cinematic for sure - grand and gorgeous. I'm so glad to have seen Miss Sunshine - not only because it's such a great film, but because I would never have known of DeVotchKa. And they have brightened my world.

Unfortunately, DeVotchKa is simply not in the same category as these other phenomenal bands. With a few notable exceptions, most of the songs are derivative and lack energy, and frequently consist of too much repetition of simple melodies without adding good counterpoint. If you want something like this that will knock your socks off, get Firewater \\"Get Off the Cross ... We Need the Wood For the Fire\\" or Gogol Bordello \\"Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike\\".

Should they be evil hypocritical secular humanist snobs and turn away a new center for troubled teens? Or should they do the right thing and trust in providence and be welcoming?What do you think?

It's one I will keep in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HOMEY, SMALL TOWN STORY","review":"Cape Light is the kind of place where you'd like to spend some time getting to know its inhabitants and enjoy the scenery. It's a town where people hold secrets and pain in their hearts as well as their secret longings. But it's also about people trying to get through the everyday struggles of living and working together. Of course there are those who rub you wrong, as the case is with Charlie, who is not only running against Emily for Mayor, but is doing so in an underhanded manner. And then there is her mother, Lilian, who is against Emily's sister Jessica, who plans to marry Ben. Lillian thinks that Ben isn't good enough for her daughter. They are characters you might judge at first glance, but come to realize the pain and guilt that compels them to act as they do. Much like real people react to mistakes they've made. This story holds secrets to the way we can respond in a possitive or negative way to our wrong choices and how they affect others.

I agree with one of the reviewers that what happened in the book can be therapeutic for people with their backgrounds (my sister's a psychologist). Overall, it is a good book about two scarred people learning how to trust.The UnCut Series is advertised as a more passionate read than the regular Harlequin Presents. If you are not into sex scenes in your books then please just stick to the regular series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatic","review":"One reviewer went as far as to say that the spanking is \\"healthy\\" in a relationship.Excuse me? Pain is \\"healthy\\" for two people who had a horrific past? Um, no.This was a terrible story with an awfully sadistic point of view. Some people really don't understand how bad bringing that particular thing into play in the bed. For passionate- yet tender-hearted readers, which is what we all are since we're reading Harlequin and not authors like Rachel Kramer Bussel, it's not fun. It's not sexy. It's not \\"healthy.\\"The spanking ruined an entire book. It's extremely unrealistic for people who had traumatic pasts to like this. And I hate that there are some authors who really don't understand that. I've read many books where this has happened, and I wonder, why do these writers think that someone who was abused, or came from a tragic and hurtful past, would actually like a spanking? That's what caused the pain and trauma in the first place!Skip this book. It's just ridiculous, and absolutely unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideal book!","review":"This book is ideal for everyone who loves a bit of spanking in their sex lives, despite having had the most traumatic lives. The heroine has had a rotten life - nearly gangraped as a teenager living in a commune, ignored by her father, and now forced to sell her company to protect its workers, yet she just loves the idea of being punished by the control-freak hero for being a naughty girl, and submitting to everything the hero does to her. He, despite still having nightmares from having been beaten as a child in an orphanage, still really enjoys putting the heroine over his knee and spanking her, both for sex and not sex. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"I am all for very erotic and steamy love scenes and that is why I chose \\"uncut\\" thinking it would be a little more graphic than the usual Harlequin. However, I must agree that the SM overtones are just too much, ESPECIALLY given the fact that the female lead (Lisa) barely escaped from being sexually assaulted by multiple men in a commune when she was younger. Is this the kind of woman (a virgin, no less) who would eagerly offer her naked bottom to her soon-to-be lover so he could \\"punish\\" her by spanking her because she is a \\"naughty girl.\\" Yuck! I am no prude, but this was just too much and not believable given the character's background."},{"rating":"1","title":"More suited to porn than romance","review":"I hated this book. I hated it because it could have been a good book, but for the horrible sex in it. The sex is horrible because it is the sort of sex you would expect to find in a pornographic novel. I knew it would have more sex than usual for a Presents, because it is in the new Uncuts mini series, but I never expected it to have sadomasochistic sex in it. It's mild S&M by pornbook standards, but for a book that is published as a romance, it is way, way out of order. This is the first time I've ever read a Presents that has sexual spanking in it. It's described in considerable detail, all about her sticking her naked bottom up in the air, and her giving throaty cries as he spanks her, and it is disgusting. It may be just what people want to read in pornography, but this book was romance, and that kind of sex has no place in it. I just wish this book had come with a warning about the kind of sexual content, so that I could have avoided it. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meatloaf","review":"Not long enough, of course.

This is a great collection to add to your library if you are a fan of the show. The set is basically as shown; the individual seasons shrink wrapped together. Probably could have packaged it in one large package and saved some resources but not a big deal.I've had this on my wish list for a while now, but spending $150+ for it was holding me back... love the series but that was a bit much. I was delighted when I was able to get this set as one of the deals of the day for around $80 which is a great deal in my opinion.

It is filled with wonderful characters that the reader truly comes to care about and is strongly reminiscent of Anne Tyler's work. And if only there really were an Institute of Affirmation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow & Steady","review":"This book takes some time to get into. I wont say that off the bat you fall in love and can't put it down, at least it wasn't that way for me. The story is about Jenny and her struggles to figure out who she is. She was adopted and never knew her real mother, her parents got divorced when she was young and she is in a marriage that just isn't working. When she is laid off from a banking job she doesn't enjoy her life turns a corner. She starts going to the School of Affirmation and she begins to direct plays. Things in her life get worse before they get better but watching her character as she charges through the garbage of everyday life is amazing. An uplifting novel with a lot of joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upbeat comfy read","review":"Sara Lewis has this great writing style - so immediately immersible, light, funny, and reassuring.

I don't usually read \\"light\\" books...more typically I'm a fan of more heavy, \\"literary\\" stuff. However, I'm glad I discovered this author. Now, I only wish she'd write more, since I've exhausted her supply! There's also something inherently comforting about her writing. I love curling up every night with the familiar characters before I go to sleep. Just a terrific, absorbing read!

Not great literature, but for an easy read, it's substantial enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"I really tried to like this book.

It tried so hard to be so syrupy sweet and good and wholesome, but I just didn't buy into it. I felt absolutely no sympathy for the main character, Jenny, who seemed to stumble through life with no direction just accepting what ever was dished out to her. That her life could miraculously change by attending some classes at a school of affirmations was to me just a little too crackpot to fall for. That it all came to an end in a neat happy little bundle with very little struggle or sacrifice makes this a quick read that you really do not even need to concentrate on. The whole \\"let's put on a play\\" theme reminded me of too many sappy Andy Hardy and Judy Garland movies. I am not a grumpy, cynical person. Rather, I am pretty much happy go lucky all the time but this was too much even for me to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake!

A better value than some of the other similar products like Moroccan Oil, since this seemed to have the same effects for a much cheaper price. It is very fragrant, but it smells good.

Fortunately, I was able to find a good shampoo that repaired my hair and it's organic (Aubrey organic shampoos) I didn't even have the need to use a conditioner. Although, I was able to find a solution for my damaged hair, I wasted my money on this expensive, useless product...I wanted to give it to my mom because it would probably work on her hair but no, I'm not going to run the risk of ruining my mom's beautiful black hair so this jar is going where it belongs...to the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"softens and detangles","review":"This mask is worth it for sure.

It came in the same jar as pictured, so it's not a fake, but it seriously doesn't work. I thought i'd get soft hair, full of moisture, yet this does exactly what any conditioner - regular conditioner - will do. It's the same thing. It makes your hair soft while it's in your hair, but once it's out your hair will frizz and it will be worthless. Will keep searching for a better product that delivers as promised. I think the people who gave this good reviews probably were reviewing it based on how it is in wet hair in the shower, not the after effects. Not worth it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"i brought it for the review","review":"Product left my hair dry and brittle feeling and not easy to comb through....I could have use a drug store brand for a better result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hair Mask I've ever tried","review":"This is the best hair mask I've ever tried before. I am mixed and have very thick, curly dry hair, but the texture is very soft. My problem with hair masks/moisturizers is that they are too heavy and make my hair greasy a day or 2 after using them. But that is not a problem with this product. I use it once or twice a week, and it keeps my hair from getting as dry and brittle on the ends after blow drying and using a flat iron on it. I wasn't expecting much from this product, but I was able to tell a difference by the second and third use. My hair looks much healthier after using it whether it's curly/natural or straight. I even think it might be helping my hair grow better too. The smell is also great too, and does not smell greasy at all. I've definitely found a good staple for my hair care products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This product is amazing!! I highly recommend it!

The first day I used it, it left my hair extremely dry and stringy and not to mention how brassy my hair color looked! I had used it in the shower and left in on for about 10 mins and completely rinsed it out. So the next time I used the conditioner I left it on for about 30-40 mins and rinsed it out but left a little bit in. It did leave my hair extremely soft that time but my hair color still looked really brassy and made my blonde highlights look Bleh :-( Was not really satisfied. One more thing,since I didnt rinse it out completely it left my super straight lifeless, thin hair even more lifeless.

I have very thick, very long hair and I use this about 3-4 times a week after my regular shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and silky smooth. The macadamia oil also helps to keep my scalp in good shape. I normally have a very dry scalp and using this product clears it up. The scent is also very nice, but can be a little overpowering. You don't need to use a lot of product to get great results from this, so even though it is a bit pricey, the jar should last a decent amount of time. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"*Shrug","review":"I really didn't notice a change in my hair after using it. Didn't make it softer or healthy looking.

I picked up some Suave conditioner for $1.72 a bottle at Wal-Mart to do a quick rinse in between washings. Well, I decided to use that conditioner in place of this and when I tell you that I got the EXACT same results I am 100% serious. As a matter of fact, I'd say I even preferred the effects of the Suave conditioner over this. Save your money!

Tells the wondrous story about a man and his railroad, and the amazing adventures involved with building a tunnel through the Rocky Mountains in the 1920s. It reads like some Homer epic. One wishes for a happy ending, but this is no comedy. The hero dies alone and broke, leaving behind a spectacular wealth generator, but not for him. It is a very interesting read, and the story is told by those who lived and died in the epic. One also understands why others, say the Union Pacific crowd, elected to avoid Denver. The story also tells about engineering adventure, getting into impossible situations, and then inventing entirely new concepts to get the job done. As they say, if it were easy, somebody else would have done it already. And and the \\"Front Range\\" challenge, of course, today it would be easy because tunnel boring is rather routine.

Up to the point he sails off in search of the dragons he deals with the aftermath of a war that changed everyone. What was exciting about people has ceased to be exciting, and relationships start collapsing. Then it does get lame as he heads off in search of the land of the dragons.

With the help of friends and family both people try their hardest to impress each other. This book is also a play.I think this is a good book. The reason I like this book is because it is funny and teaches you different Spanish words. It also teaches you that you have to just be yourself and not trying to change yourself.

I found I could mitigate this issue by attaching a bungee cord to it (securing one end with duct tape, although you could drill a hole or remove the plastic cap from the bottom of the square tube as well). By hooking the other end over the top of the drywall it holds the troll in place, so there really is no need for the handle. It acts like the drywall has wheels on it and quite easy to use. I thought of this trick after I lengthened the handle with my welder, and now I don't even use it except to carry it.Other than that, the wheels are a reasonable size for rolling over extension cords and the like, although larger obstacles will stop it. The edge of the carrying section could benefit from being rolled over so there would be no edge that could catch and possibly damage the drywall if misaligned, but that really is a very minor issue indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work well if you are short","review":"I bought this tool to help me haul large sheets of plywood.

Great solo record and good to listen to on a sunny day (regardless of the season)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do your ears a favor and buy this album","review":"If you like Bettie Serveert this will become your favorite of all there albums. If you have yet to hear them start with this one. You will be immediately drawn in and will proceed to purchase the rest of there albums. (palomine, lamprey, dust bunnies) You won't be disappointed.It is great alternative pop. If you ever liked Belly or The Darling Buds or even the Throwing Muses you will embrace Bettie Serveert. Not to say they are anything like any of the aformentioned, but they definitely are in the same vein.It is the one album I have to listen to on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"new sound for the Betties","review":"Another fine album by the Betties. As always, Carol's voice and lyrics are the centerpiece of their sound, but this album experiments with new instrumentation. To my ears it doesn't really do much for the songs, but it's a nice change from the straightforward guitar rock they usually play. If you're a fan of the band (and you probably are or you wouldn't be reading this!) then naturally you need to get the cd! My only complaint is the awful mixing job. Carol's Voice is almost always this huge presence over a little teeny drum kit in the back, and there are super loud wailing guitar licks all over the place. There's also a weird kind of transparency to the sound that isn't very appealing. This band needs a warm recording for its naturally warm sound, but they didn't get it on this one. Compare it to Dust Bunnies and you'll hear the difference. Sorry to rant... it's still a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not original at all.","review":"I found this book to be complete and rather heavy in a class of book that is supposed to be light and airy.

Campbell tries to fulfill his dying wife's wishes by restoring an abandoned building he owns into a reading room. The effort is to help people who live in the depressed community to gain self-respect for themselves. The beauty of the interaction between he and the children, teens and adults is what makes this movie worth the watch. Distrust turns into trust, uniting for a common cause, and unconditional love breathes life into the Reading Room and into it's community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dignity and responsibility in all things a lesson for us all","review":"The wonderful James Earl Jones, I could listen to his voice for ever it reminds me how we should all speak, ie properly.The film is no blockbuster but it shows what decent people do all of the roles are understated, except for the aggresive reverend, but all the more enjoyable for that.How I would love to spend time in that reading room, learning from books and from people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reading Room","review":"We were very dissappointed with this DVD.

The porcelain is very durable, but the creamer got chipped b/c she dropped it on the tile floor in the kitchen...A very good value, as a lot of the other porcelain tea sets are soooo small!! I've been looking for another tea set w/ a comparable size as this one, but have yet to find one... considering the amount I paid for the first one, I am a bit hesitant to spend this much, but I may not have a choice...With this tea set, the cups are actually large enough to hold \\"hot tea\\", and the saucers can hold little snacks...

It's too naive and too superficial. And if you've not read sabermetric articles, don't start with this book.The author developed a few formulas which lead to unexplainable, implausible outcomes, just combining unrelated numbers in a awkawrd manner. He hasn't even adjusted for park effect. So he ranked Larry Walker as one of the best hitters of all time. It's ridiculous.Don't buy this one.

I thought laminate such as Pergo had to be pounded together, frequently disturbing already glued joints until I tried these clamps. My seams are now tighter, my flooring goes down faster, and the work is more satisfying. Use a minimum of two for a narrow layout or four--three across the panels and one side to side--to keep and set tight joints over larger areas. They look a little pricey at first, but once you try them, I think you'll agree that they are the best investment you will make in a laminate tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bassey Flooring Strap Clamp","review":"Outstanding tool.

These straps helped keep our boards together and pretty much eliminated glue pull back or memory. I'm certain that without these clamps my job would not have looked anywhere near as professional.They even helped me close a small gap that opened up hours after the job was completed. I was able to strap one of the clamps down across the entire surface and remove the gap even after we had laid 6 more rows of planks.These are completely worth the money. I only wish I had bought two more, but I was able to balance out the four I purchased and still have a fantastic result.

There are mixed reviews on how many to buy. My floor was 30 feet wide and I bought 8. I wish I would have had 10. I was still able to get everything clamped together, but more would have been better.The clamps have a very long reach and are easy to adjust. They are capable of clamping much harder than you would ever require. They unlock easily and are not a bother when installing the next course since they are so quick to release and adjust. The offset adjustment screw makes setup a breeze - no spacers required, just dial in what you need. Also, when starting out, they help you get everything square. Lay a couple of courses and if you need to , you can turn the adjustment screws to move the flooring (provided of course, you do not have it nailed down or have so much that it is impossible to slide)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How I became a Pirate","review":"I bought this book for my 5 year old grandson who just loves pirates and thought this book the \\"greatest\\".

They're pretty much all bad. They all sound like sheet metal. They all sound like a joke. The only saving graces are The Knoxville Girls, The Country Teasers, and Dan Melchior's group ain't too bad, either.I suppose I'll never understand the injustices in this world, namely why little boys with loud machines get to inflict their noises upon the world, perpetuated by record labels who have absolutely no understanding of what music is. I understand this is supposed to be loud, primal, and violent, but you know something? It was a lot better when Flipper did it.However, if you want to piss off your neighbors, blast this thing.

I really love this and could watch it over and over. I like the way they did the video- it has mixed studio sessions along with live performances and interviews with Janis all sprinkled together throughout. Just listening to Janis talk is very plesant since you get the feeling that she was a hurting sole deep down but extremely intelligent as well. She really knew how to rock a crowd though and all her performances- she gives it her all. Many times after a live performance you see the audience come to their feet and clap.

Even if they remastered these two albums to make them sound good, you might be better off looking for the later Elgart stuff. These albums were recorded in the early to mid 50's. I found the arrangements to be very simplistic, predictable and boring. Don't listen for any piano solos. The Elgarts never used a piano in their recordings. The bass trombone is always evident which I think makes the Elgart sound somewhat distinctive. I've listened to many Elgart albums over the years and I would suggest \\"Great Sound of Les Elgart\\" or \\"Best Band on Campus\\" as alternates. The early Elgart recordings may be OK for dancing but not much for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Show Worst Game","review":"This games is so bad I'll never try to play a game by Pressman or B1 games again.

Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game. However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well. Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work. Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end.

We got stuck on both of the camera puzzles in day 1. It seems that it doesn't matter what you do on the remote, it will just keep failing you over and over. Since our DVD player can be a little flaky from time to time, I tried it in two other players- but that didn't make any difference.

The format of the DVD causes any sort of reaction based game on the disc to be impossible. My girlfriend was ready to throw the remote into the HDTV after playing it for 30 seconds.

After 20 minutes I was frustrated and my wife had given up on it entirely. The game consists of very little reasoning, and mostly following patterns the game flashes on screen that you must, in a variety of frustratingly difficult and poorly-explained ways, input back to the game to move on. If you're not sure what the game wants you to do, there really isn't much you can do besides enter things randomly until you hit upon something by accident. Its incredibly frustrating. The voice acting is quite good though (Keifer Sutherland is here), and the live-action sequences were better than I expected from a DVD boardgame. However, overall this game was a disappointment and it may be some time before I store up a reserve of patience to attempt it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"I too purchased this game thinking it would be excellent, as I am a huge fan of the hit tv show and I had read on the internet that Kiefer Sutherland himself had provided his voice for the game...

After about 3 minutes of gameplay me and my girlfriend were stuck in seemingly impossible tasks, having to use the DVDremote as a 'wanna-be' gaming-console controller....this doesn't work at all (not surprisingly).I am surprised and disseapointed that so much money and effort has been put into such a terrible game. I predict that word will spread and that this will not sell as much as predicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing to say the least","review":"Do not waste your money. I agree with everyone else. The idea of the game is great, but completing some of the missions on the DVD are pretty much impossible. Figuring out the codes are ok, but trying to sneak past a security camera or security laser beams are totally random. The reaction of the green dot (the agent) does not correspond with you hitting the arrow button on the dvd remote. We hit it a lot of different times and the dot moved when it wanted to and it was always into the sight of the camera or security laser beam. No skill, no strategy. Jack Bauer yells at you and makes you feel like an idiot when you can't get it. There's no way, I believe that this game was tested out on anyone. How can they make a game that can't be won, except by random luck. I feel they used the \\"24\\" name and put together a shotty DVD game. And the board is useless. The game was frustrating to say the least. I plan on returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!

Painfully played this game with six 24 fans. As you read in every review the challenges using the remote are arbitrary at best. You basically have to guess at when you are going to decide to move your player. Some of the other challenges are quite good.Why do they have a board with this game? It is only used if you get past the three days and then you get to play the challenges again. Someone who completes several of the challenges gets to enter CTU for the most anti-climatic ending imaginable.If you are a 24 fan, do not buy the game.If you enjoy DVD games, do not buy the game.If you enjoy being frustrated because a game has stupid quirks that no one ever tested, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever!","review":"Do not buy this game. I bought it for my parents for Christmas, and it honestly ruined our Christmas Eve. The main obstacles in the game are controlled by the DVD remote, which is the worst possible tool to use for these games. They are basically impossible because they are designed so poorly. The phrase board game in the title should be put in paranthesis, since the board serves no actual function and is a complete waste. This game is horribly horrible in all facets, and I hope Pressman loses a monumental amount of money by producing this sham of a game since it is a complete rip-off.

This game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right.The mini-games were an exercise in extreme frustration. The problem is that the DVD is not ideal for those mini-games. Whenever you try to move there are only two subsequent animations: the successful one and the unsuccessful one, which made it seem like it was just moving at random. Other than that it seemed like the game was going to be pretty linear, the clue cards contained no useful information, and the board completely superfluous, unless apparently you are masochistic enough to get to the bonus level."},{"rating":"1","title":"mission... impossible","review":"Literally an absurd engineering folly.

With such a concept, we suspected the game would be fun. Oh how wrong we were. At first we thought we just didn't have quick enough fingers to make it past some of the security cameras and to win the minigames. Nope, the game itself just likes to take it's time reacting. We spent the whole \\"24 hours\\" just trying to make it through a couple of the sections, I have no idea how you'd finish the game in the time given. The \\"board\\" isn't even really used and the clues don't help at all, most of the information was given at other points in the game.We played with a friend who has never watched 24. Needless to say, she doesn't ever have a desire to watch the show after this.Jack's on his own to stop these terrorists because as much as we tried to help, we're useless to him (and he certianly let's you know it when time runs out).This game has a mind of it's own, it's like it wants you to fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"This cassette contains all the vocabulary lists of Hebrew Step by Step by Menahem Mansoor(volume 1) plus the two or tree extracts from the book of Genesis that form the last, inductive part of that manual.The speaker also reads some of the examples that appear in the grammatical notes.

I tried the Rotozip on plywood... the bit dulled in about 1/20 of the circumference and then just burned the wood and would not cut anymore. I tried several bits and several materials and had similar results. The ONLY thing the Rotozip is useful for is cutting thin plastic or Sheet Rock. Do not purchase it for anything else!

Just because this movie was written and voiced by Jerry Seinfeld doesn't mean we have to think this movie would be first of all brilliant and second of all funny.

All I found it to be was a bad attempt at comedy with desperate one liners, which strongly resembled the comedy from the last horrible season of Seinfeld's show.

Jerry Seinfeld, who I love, is the main character. Unfortunately, his humor didn't carry the movie for me. He plays a bee who becomes obsessed with the knowledge that humans are taking all their hard made honey. He goes to court and wins all the honey back. As a result, the bees stop working, flowers aren't pollinated, everything on the planet is dying.So what is the moral? Is it wrong to steal others work, is it wrong to sue, is it wrong to relax when all the work has already been done?

I find Seinfeld mildly amusing, but Jerry's voice was actually painful to listen to in this film, and Renee Zellweger's character was nothing more than a squawking schizophrenic mess. The jokes were neither funny nor clever, and aside from the vibrant colors, the movie was exceedingly dull and difficult to watch.

I suggest you watch it under the heading of \\"How far America has declined.\\" I like the part where the bees explicitly blame white people for oppressing them.

It was apparent that no effort was put into the storyline. The first fifteen minutes of the film were promising, but it only went downhill after that. At the beginning, I assumed that it was about the main character's search to find his place in the hive, but everything was blown out of proportion when he started filing a lawsuit. While I understand that the movie is a work of fiction, various parts of the movie are absolutely ridiculous. All of the scenes were unrelated to each other, and the movie as a whole just seemed like a collection of lame bee jokes. Not to mention the voice acting was annoying.

It's not as funny as Shrek, and overall not as good as Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo, but certainly in the better half, comparable to Cars, Ice Age, and Over The Hedge. During the first twenty minutes or so it seemed like it might offer nothing better than a series of Bee jokes, which I see has resulted in some negative reviews here. But the story develops as an allegory for frivolous lawsuits, but it's the bee who brings the frivolous lawsuit here, so it doesn't jump on the Hollywood blame-humans-first bandwagon, which is refreshing. Some of the results are predictable, some funny, but not preachy or trite. There's at least one lawyer joke that had the audience in stitches, along with several other funny jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"B movie","review":"It seems as though they made a list of every bee joke they could think of, and then designed a movie around it. and then, when that didn't make a movie that was long enough, they go into this whole muddled lawsuit thing.

Main character Barry B. Benson was decent, but the \\"cute\\" factor could have been bumped up a few notches. The weird relationship/emotional affair between Zellweger's character and the bee was a little strange and doesn't resolve itself even at the end of the movie when she continues the dependence on Barry as a friend and intellectual/emotional support instead of fixing things with her distant jock of a husband. Two and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow movie","review":"Though the movie intended to be funny, it was pretty shallow. The starring bee of the movie, Barry Benson, finds that he is in love with a human, more specifically, a woman. It became awkward when it became clear that the woman had equal feelings for Barry too. Though the protagonist of the story took action of what he thought was right for himself and the community, he placed the whole bee community and human society down the drain. It was good that he took responsibility of his actions, but it wasn't quite what I expected it to be. Many scenes produced rude remarks and there was a scene about a grandma that was clearly NOT funny. Besides that, the ending of the story seemed rushed and without character. The makers of the film tried too hard to be funny and to create a \\"fantastic movie with morals\\", but it lacked both. It was a very disappointing movie, and I felt I could've done a better job at directing the movie myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Baez Ballad Book","review":"This album was released in the UK on CD some years ago.

The text is appropriate for children, comprehensive but not overly so. What makes Atlas of the Presidents special to me is the Electoral College map of each Presidential election. It breaks out which state voted for whom and which candidate had support in certain areas of the country. Although each Electoral College map of the country is given small attention in the book, they all reflect the historical attitudes of our nation. As the back of the book, it contains a table showing comparative data of each President, and John Kennedy advice to young people seeking the Presidency in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"Sandra Ingerman provides a good overview of Shamanism.

Timothy's voiceshares life all around in a most unique and creative way.Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Things","review":"This book casts a powerful spell. In a few words, the writer spins a delicious, fascinating web of details and facts which make the doings of an old tortoise as gripping as writing can be. Timothy shows us how we look as humans and gives us another way to see the world. His calm, humorous voice gently poses questions about the way men and women treat each other and the way they unthinkingly treat animals. Wildly original, this story is pure pleasure to read. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At a Snail's Pace","review":"I plodded at a tortoiselike pace through this tedious, monotonous work of fiction that sluggishly shares the assumed thoughts of a snobbish tortoise.

I had already read quite a bit about Fenway, the old Huntington Avenue Grounds and the old South End Grounds, but this book added some very interesting pieces of trivia. The author also covers \\"forgotten\\" ballparks and arenas, which were very interesting and new for even an \\"expert\\" like me. ;)The only thing I felt the book lacks is more pictures and photos, especially of the parks and arenas that are now just memories, but that could be more due to lack of information than to a decision not to include them. Overall, I highly recommend this book for any Red Sox, Bruins, Celtics, Patriots or general sports history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"great grill","review":"have had this grill for 8 or 9 years....unbelievable great product. have a 2nd house on miss. river...used almost year round, atleast twice a week...have never had a problem..highly recommend if like charcoal opposed to gas..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill, but high price","review":"My parents purchased this grill recently, and the convenience of the gas ignition counters the argument of first-to-cook from the gas grill crowd. Also, nothing beats the look of the stainless steel surfaces on the cart when you're aiming to combine good looks and great cooking.The inaugural meal was a ham cooked with the optional rotisserie attachment. The coals (natural wood charcoal, of course) were ready very quickly, and the indirect cooking method kept the ham juicy and flavorful. The thermometer in the lid was great for knowing when to add coals or adjust the vents to maintain the temperature without having to constantly lift the lid and lose the heat.After helping prepare the meal and tasting the food afterwards, I was sold. However, the. . . price tag was too high for my wallet, so I purchased the Weber One-Touch Platinum, which was $200 less. . . this would be a 5-star product, but the high price knocks it down a notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Barbie in the world!","review":"This grill provides the best of both worlds.

I cook turkeys at Thanksgiving, burgers, steaks, grilled vegetables, fish, etc and they all turn out great. Just follow the cookbook that comes with the grill. My grill sits outside all year long.

This install was a breeze, box to assembly was approximately 2 hours. The instructions are very straight forward, and the parts are easily identified.

I don't like the smell or taste of lighter fluid in my food...the Performer doesn't disappoint. Imagine using a propane ignition system to only light the coals, then turn it off before you begin to cook your food. It's truly the best of both worlds. In addition, this grill, with its two half-moon-shaped, moveable charcoal grates, offers tremendous flexibility for direct and indirect heating. If you take care of this grill, as I have, it will look and operate like new for many, many years, as mine does. No one believes me when I tell them it's 11 years old. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gray Magic = Steel Magic","review":"This story was also printed as \\"Steel Magic\\" (in \\"The Magic Books\\" ISBN 0-451-16638-8.

They are about an inch larger than described, and our dogs' food seemed lost in them. We will keep them and use them for water, but I don't think they'd work well for dog food except for very large dogs that eat a lot (ours are 50 and 60 lbs. so they're not exactly small dogs).

It seems well made and the finish was good. The fluid used is quite viscous and creates a significant damping effect on the small bubble, for better or worse. The significant flaw of the device is that it has very low sensitivity to tilt. By the time the bubble is noticably off center, the camera is tilted enough to be obviously visible without the level.

Yes it is very articulated and heavily detailed as the description states. But the figure stands much shorter than even the McFarlane Halo 3 Master Chief figures.If you need them....get Megatron or Starscream first. They are much cheaper and you can see the size for yourself.

It's not an academic kind of book, but somehow it reminds me of all the boring English teachers I had in school. Maybe it's the small type and compactness. Perhaps it's the bland layout of the text. The contents are accurate enough, but the tutorial explanations seem ---ironically --- ponderously written and the exercises are really boring. It's cheap enough, I suppose, and if one's writing is in desperate need of help, it might be useful to buy it. Truly though, \\"thirty minutes a day\\" might be me more time than one is willing to put into it. Don't even consider buying it for a normal teen or preteen.

The sweet voice of Don Williams with superb back-up vocals, coupled with haunting lyrics I still recall 30 years later made this an album whose grooves I wore out.

If the author had killed as many enemy soldiers as he did beers, then it is my estimate the war would have been over 2 years earlier. There is no detail in this book. No descriptions of hunting the enemy down. The author makes it sound like his time in Vietnam was one big fraternity party. MANY better sniper books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most intriguing and real books about Vietnam.","review":"I thought that this book was outstanding. It really gave me a feel of what it was like to live the life of a Marine sniper during that turbulent time. The action and suspense will keep you turning the pages. I read the whole book in two days. I couldn't put it down. Mr. Kugler gives the reader a good insight into what it was really like to be over there. Some of the grim realities of war are portrayed better most I have read. I was really moved with how he expressed the bond of brotherhood between himself and his fellow Marines. Anyone who is interested in this type of book must read \\"Dead Center\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - really real","review":"I just finished reading the book this morning having started it yesterday morning. I couldn't put the book down! I love how the author showed the importance of patience and a sense of humor to a sniper. He also clearly showed what would happen to snippers if they weren't patient (which he wasn't on more than one occaision). I liked how the author wasn't afraid to tell of his own mistakes and the mistakes of his buddies. It is sad that the Vietnam Vets weren't treated the way they should have been: with respect and love (like the WWII Vets). I think that this should be required reading for US history students in high school. So the language is a little crude, everybody knows those words by then. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I have to disagree with most everyone here. I was disappointed that there were very few stories that were directly related to sniping. It was an all right book, meaning he did tell his story of what he did during his tour in Veitnam, but not that much seemed to be related to sniping. Joseph T. Wards book \\"Dear Mom\\" was much better. As far as the launguage in the book, I was extremely disappointed. For a person who thinks he is saved and claims Jesus Christ as his Savior, his launguage proves him otherwise. Don't buy this book if you want stories on sniping. But buy this book if it is \\"cool\\" to you if someone cusses. I would say \\"grow up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"i put this book down half way through it. snipers save several lives by the taking of one enemy life. this proffesion is often looked down on by outsiders mainly because of people like this author. by the time i reached half way through this book he seemed to have no respect for life or for god. maybe he did by the end but it wasn't worth finishing. if you want a good book that centers more on the art of sniping, try marine sniper by Charles Henderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"Hard to keep interest, rambled back and forth to much, did read the whole book.

I am amazed that the average online review for this book is 5 stars. I found the description of events to be hard to follow. It was as if this book was written from old journal entries but no attempt was made to make them flow together. Also, the liberal use of expletives as descriptors of situations and thought really took away any literary quality that could've been gleaned from this self agrandizing effort to protray life in the 'Nam. I guess I was spoiled by the book on Carlos Hathcock (another sniper in Viet Nam). Just the same, my sincerest thanks to Mr. Kugler for his contibutions to this country through service to the USMC. Life as a sniper is a terribly dangerous line of work but a necessary one. Thanks for doing a job that gave very little in return for the amount of blood, sweat, and tears put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for the gung ho anticipating the glories of being a foot soldier.","review":"Top notch account of life in Viet Nam without the gloss. Ed tells it like it was. Anyone who wants to be a soldier on the front line as a grunt or a sniper needs to read to gain some knowledge of what to expect before signing on the dotted line.Great job Ed! I liked it so much I plan on giving a copy to each of my two sons for them to read and lear what life in that hell hole was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vietnam Experience","review":"Fascinating book.Some of the other reviews suggest that this book is exciting, and others suggest that it is boring. It is really both, and that is why Dead Center is such a good book. By telling his story so honestly, Ed Kugler helps us to understand a little more about what it was like for young men to train and fight in the Vietnam war. Part of their time was spent in boredom and loneliness. The rest of their time was spent surrounded by fear, combat, and death.This book would not make a good Hollywood script. The Marines described within are not glamourous and witty, and they did not always make smart choices. Again, that is why this is a good book. It really describes what happens when you hand a bunch of very young men rifles and throw them into a war like Vietnam. By reading this book, I gained a deeper understanding of the experience of war, and gained a deeper appreciation for our veterans. Thank you for sharing your story, Mr. Kugler, and thank you for your service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Motivated and Read This Book!","review":"Anne Bruce does it again, this time in the Mighty Manager Series with a book on how to implement the most powerful tools that really motivate employees.

This also applies to the Grimm book from the same editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother.","review":"While I'm sure the stories are great, I can't get past the poor type setting, and cheap paper which is practically newsprint. The words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult. And to make matters worse, the stories are set in a terrible, hard to read font and tight leading. This book is NOT kid-friendly at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Storytime Staple","review":"I had a version of this book when I was a kid and was super excited to be able to share these tales with my own children. There aren't a lot of illustrations for the kids to look at, which I love because it forces my kids to use their imaginations. So this is a book that is best for before bed time reading and is sure to inspire wonderful Dreams! There are very few short stories in this collection. Most of them are very long and the kids will go to sleep before you reach the end. But if you're familiar with the enchanting tale weaving of Andersen, you know as a parent, you will want to finish the stories to satisfy your own curiosities. A must have for any household with Kids. Pages are thin and if you cry on any page is goes through multiple stories...but that definitely adds character to our book! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Censored edition misses the point","review":"The purpose of the classic fairy tale is to give one insight into the inner workings of the human psyche. That is why these stories were passed down orally for generations and painstakingly preserved by the Brothers Grimm.Hans Christian Andersen has watered the stories down and thereby lost the power that they were meant to impart.Try Pantheon's version of Grimm's Fairy Tales instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for young children","review":"I ordered this for my daughter and will be sending it back. It is not \\"fully illustrated.\\" The reading level is designated as ages 9 to 12. I can't imagine anyone in that age group enjoying this book. The stories are wonderful classics, but the illustrations are few and far between. Not a book for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andersen deserves better","review":"It is just sad that publishers like this one are opportunistic and know that just because Andersen is on the cover the book will sell. The translations are rickety and unreadable. And the quality of the book is disappointing. I immediately resold mine and bought another, far superior, volume. Don't get taken for a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Quality","review":"This is a decent collection of tales. All the popular stories are included; however, there are some tales that didn't make much sense.Readability is average. I wouldn't recommend giving this book to a child to read. As for a parent reading this book to his/her child, the overuse of colons, semi-colons, and commas can make for difficult story telling.Overall, if you're looking for a good collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen either just to keep or to read to your child, you may want to pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The translations are terrible!","review":"Skip this one and wait for the new translation of 30 of the best tales coming out from Penguin next month, by the great Tiina Nunnally.

The real bummer is that my SB-600 fell to the ground and now it has a nice crack on its side.I later found out that the steel cold shoe was dislocated from the flash mount.

Harbor Freight has the same staples for less than half the price (and the packaging was adequate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE FLOORING STAPLES!","review":"I opened up the box from amazon to find a vastly smaller box inside that had been damaged and the box of 5,000 staples was busted open and the racks were all broken up into small pieces. This was not as upsetting as the following. I installed a 600 sq ft wide plank maple floor and found out that the orange glue that binds the staples together to form a rack was so thick I ended up taking my thumb and rubbing the rest off of the head of the staple once it was driven into the plank. Those staples that had no so much glue on them eventully had a glue sliver poke up between the planks in rare instances. So I ended up taking a razor knife and cutting them out very carefully as not to scratch the planks. I LOST A LOT OF PRODUCTIVITY ON THIS JOB thinking I was saving money on the price of flooring staples compared to Lowes or Home Depot.

We were able to match the rest of the fixtures by getting these satin nickel hinges. They actually install much easier than the more conventional hinges. They also align very nicely. I feel like the Amazon vendors price was just what I was hoping for. These hinges make my kitchen look beautiful rather than dated like the brass hinges did. The Amerock brand is a quality name in hardware.If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful box. If you didnt please leave a comment.

Block and Tamara S. Block delve into business to business marketing research, describing its component elements and explaining how to apply research techniques. They don't consistently discuss research in the context of the marketing department, so you should probably have an idea of how research fits into your strategy before you open this book. Still, its narrow focus and intense expertise makes it appealing and valuable, if academically written. Block and Block describe how to manage research and find information. They explain how to use customer databases, analytical tools, survey techniques and financial values. This book is not light reading, but we recommend it to anyone interested in or working with marketing research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh neat","review":"Melt-Banana is great, and this album is the greatest.

The soundtrack was excellently in harmony to the movie itself and the narration is inviting andcaptivating to listen to.Overall, this is a high quality 3D movie especially the \\"Features\\" part added to this DVD (even it is in2D); and you will never be tired in watching it multiple times.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie script is so-so but great 3D effects","review":"Like many of these 3D documentaries, the movie script is a little dull, but this movie has the best 3D effects I've seen so far. One of the things that make the 3D effects so good is that the images are very sharp and the 3D separation is very good. Even the hairs on one of the dinosaurs backs was completely sharp in 3D. The Patagonia landscapes are also nice. This is a good way to try out your 3D TV if you just got one. I rented it on Blockbuster, but Amazon has a bigger selection of 3D movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quotes are hard to find but...","review":"Not inside this book.

I rated this 5 stars because it really is the best of their albums, yet, with more variety of songs, but, all of them rock as hard as any earlier album.

It attaches to one of the strap loops on the right side of your SLR-type camera and screws into the tripod hole on the bottom. The grip is comfortable, especially for long shoots, and it allows a sense of confidence that you'll never drop your camera. You can actually relax your finger grip on the camera and the Hakuba keeps it in your hand without falling. Shooting one-handed is possible, but it's best for being always able to hold the camera easily when doing walk-around shooting. I hate shooting without it now.

Who cares if the Roches lost their hard edge they had in the late seventies and early eighties? Artists change and evolve!!! Their fans should learn to do the same. The Roches have never forgotten how to write knock-out songs and to harmonize brilliantly, which is a rare commodity on other 90's albums by artists who, like the Roches, began their recording careers in the late seventies.

This provides useful lessons, as other reviewers note, on public policy and land use, but for me it was more interesting as a uniquely revealing approach to social and economic history. Among other revelations, the book highlights the fact that the popular image of Vermont as a throwback to an idyllic yesteryear is a recent creation promulgated to fuel the state's latest and arguably most successful land use ever -- tourism. The reality has been rather different. The book is easy to read, with pictures and graphics that contribute to the knowledge being conveyed. The overall conception would be worthy of emulation by historians and planners addressing other regions or periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have used the stair wizard on a few projects and I could not be more satisfied with it.

The potential romantic involvement of an investigating officer with a suspect isn't new territory, but the author presents it in a way that draws out the best in the character of Hatcher, the detective.

Between the two, it seemed that there wasn't much more than a physical attraction on Duncan's part and Elise wanting to use Duncan (like she does many others).The story itself had an interesting plot, but the characters just weighed it down and the result for me was very forgettable.The best character in this story was Dee Dee, Duncan's partner.

Both were very well written, and this book, Riccohet, keeps you in suspense throughout - going up and down hills and making U-turns all of the time.If I had to nitpick anything, it was just a tad long in the middle, but picked right up again and took you on yet another journey.I am very much looking forward to Ms. Brown's next book. She is an excellent writer and one of my favorites as I enjoy her writing.Keep up the good writing . . .MarySan Clemente, CA"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Brown's best...","review":"Ricochet may not be the best novel I consider Sandra Brown to have ever written, simply because I haven't read them all. But of the novels that I have read, I place this one right up there at the top. When I start reading a novel and can't put it down for anything other than what I have to, then the novel has me hooked. It's almost disappointing when you spend a whole day reading a novel from one end to the other, then realilzing that you simply wish there was more because it was so good. No need to go into long detail about what the book was about, other reviewers tell that anyway. I've written several reviews over the past few years, and as far as this book is concerned, I guess I'm at a loss for words. How do you go about describing a book that is simply EXCELLENT. My best to Sandra Brown on a job well done. I look forward to reading her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown's ability to write characters is amazing!","review":"Sandra Brown's amazing ability to pen believable and fascinating characters once again saves the day in this latest book. The husband/wife murder plot is a little convoluted and over the top at times and it's sewn up a little too conveniently in the end but by the time you get there, you care about Brown's characters and enjoy their quirks, faults and strengths so much that you can't wait to see what they do next and you don't want to bid them goodbye. I recommend this one heartily. It's better than Chill Factor. It's also nice to see that Brown hasn't forgotten that one of her strengths is being able to weave a dynamic romance into the storyline once again. I think in trying to 'prove' to the world what a good suspense writer she was, that she strayed too far away from romantic angles which she's such a master with. This one is worth the read-check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"A book to bring on your vacation and leave behind. The chief detective has a perpetual hard on for the main suspect and seems to be in a daze because of his infatuation. Lust constitutes the romance part of this story and the twist and turns, well -- ho, hum. I have read better. The prose is plebian."},{"rating":"1","title":"second and last S.B. novel","review":"This is my second Sandra Brown novel and will be my last. I read one that a neighbor loaned me.Fat Tuesday. And have finished my second one Ricochet. Are these thinly disguised romance novels or what? 1st we have the ruggedly handsome detective and the fallen angel who is prostitiing herself for what ever reasons to the big wealthy crook that said detective is out to get. And then at some point the detective and fallen angel end up by or on a river/ bayou/ lake etc. and crew like bunnies.YUCK! this is a romance novel and the 2 I have read are so predictable. But then again I don't read romance novels. If you like \\"real\\" mysteries skip these books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Shoot Me","review":"I got a little over halfway through and I had to stop. I am a big Sandra Brown fan but this reads nothing like her. The plot is juvenille and just plain boring. I kept thinking that even I could write a better book. I found nothing enticing about the characters or what was happening to them. I can't believe this made it past the publisher's desk! Here is what you need to know. There are long, drawn-out conversations and sequences that go into heights of unecessary detail that I have never seen from Sandra Brown before. I found myself in agony trying to get through them, thinking, \\"WHO CARES???\\" This is one of the most SLOW MOVING books I have ever read. I could barely bring myself to pick it up. Do your self a favor and skip this one. Pick up \\"Chill Factor\\" and \\"Where There's Smoke\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unbelievable","review":"I read at least 3 mysteries and/or general fiction each month. I skipped over the last few chapters of this book because the characters and situation were completely unbelievable. The cops would never compromise themselves this way. The primary female character was a perfect barbie-doll, dead-eye shot, topless waitress concubine who's motivation was obscure and actions reprehensible. When I read that \\"she looked wistfully at the little kids on the playground\\" after getting a selfless tubal ligation, I gave up. The novel's climax was ridiculous. I usually like Sandra Brown, but this was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I usually like her books, but this one left me disappointed. The story did not have much meat behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly dull","review":"Sandra Brown's books are usually very engrossing and enjoyable. However, this was the one exception. Except for the opening scene, there was very little in the way of drama or action. It was mainly police interrogations followed by the \\"he said...she said\\" type of stuff. And I grew weary of reading about Detective Hatcher's hard-ons for the victim/suspect (who happens to be married) on every other page. I normally finish a good book within 4-5 days and I had reached the point where I was dreading having to pick this one up. It took two weeks for me to make it only halfway through the book before I decided to put it down for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"I have read all of Sandra Brown books.I was disappointed in this one. I havealmost all of her books in my bookcase,but when I finished this one I gave itaway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big miss","review":"Yuck factor with the personalities of the characters and their choices. Not into the theme that Sandra Brown has taken in a couple of her books - suffering wife needs a real love/lover outside her marriage. The book seemed to drag with the lack of action. Motivation and justification at the end of the book didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable!","review":"Another great book by Sandra Brown--one that grabs you from the beginning and you don't want to put down. This author has a great imagination because her stories, especially the really good ones, take a lot of twists and turns and you never know where you might end up. If you enjoyed this, don't miss Chill Factor, The Witness, The Alibi and Envy, to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Catchy, This Song...","review":"I don't own a lot of pop albums. In fact, I only own BSB's debut album (which is pretty decent). This is because of all the inflated hype and unending criticism that goes around about the pop business. But when I heard \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\" for the first time, I had to get the single. It's very singable. The remix is oookay, but it's not my style. Even if you don't like the Fab 5, this song's worth your two bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy-thriller set in Cuba","review":"Ernesto's Ghost spirits you back to Cuba in the 1970's at the height of the Cold War.

If you're looking for water storage peroxide like I am, do not get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment for some","review":"Obviously some fans have enjoyed this album, so I'm not trying to say it isn't good-- only that it is EXTREMELY different from Martin Swan's first Mouth Music project, which I found brilliant. In my humble opinion, I think that the vocals really hurt the songs-- they don't capture the spirit as Talitha McKenzie did. Also, with the exception of one or two songs, the music is a bit weak and underdeveloped.For those who are wanting to check out Mouth Music for the first time, I'd suggest staying away from this album as it isn't a fair representation of Martin Swan's incredible talents. I'd recommend going for the very first album, Mouth Music, or the newest, Seafaring Man (which is very different than the first, but equally brilliant).Please refrain from saying that my review is unhelpful if you merely disagree with me.

However, the illustrations inside the book are not AT ALL like the ones on the cover. I've returned the book and forgot to check, but I would guess that they are not even by the same artist.

No sounds, no effects, no music...only the voice of the narrator. The narrator is very good, and the stories from Cinderella to Little Red Riding Hood are interesting and attractive for children. But the simple voice of the narrator is not enough to keep children between 3 and 4 interested in stories longer than 10 minutes (all but few are longer than 10 min.). Perfect would be 5 minutes for that age range (3 or 4).Another drawback is the fact that the CDs do not go with a book, so you need to buy a book for each story with pictures suitable for children of 3 or 4. Of course,less problematic are those issues for older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francis Chan-Who is God","review":"This Bible study with Francis Chan is awesome.

No, this \\"thing\\" just glanced and kept non-chalantly walking away.Beyong this film there is nothing more than eyewitness reports. No other evidence that can be produced for scrutiny exists.

The artists tell you they used a pencil, a photograph, and a scanner. They don't tell you how you can get this identical look by buying 12 different products that cost lots of money.

The title story stands on its own as a classic juxtaposition of cosmopolitan worldliness against idyllic innocence, but Wells was never visionary enough to transcend his time, and his scientific suppositions seem quaint by today's standards, especially \\"A Dream of Armageddon\\" which is pretty much a contradiction in terms, even if one accepts the historical constraints on the author. \\"The Lord of the Dynamics\\" is also offensively exploitative even if you allow for the bigotry of the age. There may be some minor typographical errors that the text preparer missed, particularly in \\"The Cone,\\" I am not sure, but if you like the faith in mechanical supremacy that so called classical speculative fiction offers, then you like H.G.

Not to mention the endless list of ingredients for each recipe. The first few chapters made it seem like the recipes would be easy and you could get by without spending a ton of money. Unfortunately, I am a student who works and I want to live a healthy lifestyle, but I think I'll just stick to a vegetarian version of South Beach Phase 2!!! Much more practical.

Unfortunately, it didn't occur to me that my problems could be the result of a soy allergy until later in the year (since I've had a history with bad skin and depression), so I endured almost 8 months of abject misery. Another symptom of this plan seemed to be that I actually gained weight.So, I just want people who undertake this plan to be aware that if you experience weight gain, bad skin and depression, you may have an allergy.

It's hard to pick a favorite song from this album because they're all simply great, but one that gets to me most besides \\"The Love Song\\" would be \\"I Wanna Make You Cry\\".

The CD, \\"Rainbow Man\\", is a must have for any TRUE country music fan. I don't mean those of you who like country to sound like rock and roll, or rap or pop or ANYTHING besides REAL COUNTRY. Jeff's voice does resemble the great Conway Twitty in an amazing way, but for those of us who love him, we will definately say he has a style all his own. I've been fortunate enough to see Jeff and hear him sing 4 times in the last year and had our picture with him in Country Weekly magazine. He has an amazing personality, a strong, sure, masculine voice, and a great career in country music. There's not a bad song on this CD!! My favorite is \\"My Mississippi\\" and \\"Wings of Mama's Prayers\\", but \\"The Love Song\\" will always be special b/c it's the first song I ever heard Jeff sing.

After hearing the album and seeing him appear on the Grand Old Opry, it definitely is his own voice. He has that air about him similar to Elvis and Jerry Lee in his song delivery.

I expect The Morells to record it any day now. His renditions of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Book of Dreams\\" and \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" help remind you why Springsteen really is the King of rock (not that sleazy Presley fellow). While many of the songs sound like they were written in the early 1960s, this CD brings back the joy of music with a contemporary feel. It may sound contradictory, but it's true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja NU","review":"When my friend Dion gave me this cd one morning after breakfast i slipped it in my car player and couldn't believe my ears.Although i didn't grow up to his music i really liked the \\"real\\" sound of this.Radiator is one of my favorites,It was written on the Buddy Holly tour.If VH1 were smart they would do a live concert featuring Dion(like the one with roy orbison)If you like rock & roll you will really enjoy dion's latest contribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"the MAN!","review":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT THIS MAN WHO HAS A VOICE OF VELVET AND STEEL!

Unfortunately, irrespective of however outstanding this movie may be, the English dubbing is so horribly done that it is unwatchable. This is not a matter of preference for high vs low budget or any other highly subjective, qualitative factor, but a simple observation that any reasonable English speaker will likely share. The experience would have been infinitely better had they presented in its native format with subtitles.

It's just a stream of introverted thought. It's like \\"notes from the underground\\" except nothing happens. I love you Camus but give us a break"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Angusty Of Camus","review":"In my humble opinion, after reading all of the works of Albert Camus, I still think that \\"The Fall\\" its one of the best works from him, the angusty and anger of Camus is reflected in the ways of Jean Baptiste, the critics are incrideble, and the plot is simple but with such a bitirness...Such an amazing work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearing the air","review":"It is essential to note that Camus was raised in the Catholic tradition, however widely he distanced himself from it in later life; he was not Jewish as a previous reviewer states, perhaps confusing only in that regard Camus with Elie Wiesel.In all his work, Camus deals with the dilemma posed by the injustices suffered by all humanity. Believing himself faced with the choice between an all-powerful God who allows man's inhumanity to man and a benevolent God who seems powerless to prevent injustice, Camus chose no God at all. I can't agree with him--these two options are not the only possible explanations of injustice--but I respect the courage with which, time and again, Camus confronts us with the question: why do the innocent suffer?In doing so, he is no respecter of persons, nor is Wiesel. Both are or were profoundly moved by injustice in all forms and instances, and each champions the human rights of all people."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusion arose while reading this","review":"I had to read this book for my Lit. class and I'm in 12th grade and I found it very confusing, yet it made me think about what sins I have made. I have never read a Camus piece before, but the whole written in 2nd person thing kinda makes me lose interest in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camus failed with this one","review":"Nobody can deny that camus was a true litterary prize and an intellectual. His essays, the stranger, the plague, and the other books are fantastic. The Fall, however, isn't. The point of view from which the novel is written makes reading tedious and confusing at times, while the message drags along. Camus made great comments on society, but in this book do we really care what he's saying?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for book club discussion","review":"This novel is like a one-man show by a brilliant actor -- material must be excellent to sustain interest. For the most part, it is -- but it loses steam about 2/3 of the way through. Not Camus's best, but very well worth your time. This is an easy and fun book to discuss in a book club that's somewhat philosophically inclined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and personal, if a little \\"schematic\\"","review":"Camus scholars see \\"The Fall\\" as one of the author's most personal works, because the main character is exploring his own dedication to orderly morality and questioning whether hypocrisy is preventable. One scholar (Conor Cruise O'Brien) thinks it's really about Camus coming to terms with Algeria. (Camus once said, in a famous response to Sartre, \\"When asked to choose between justice and my mother, I choose my mother.\\" His mother lived in French Algeria.) Interestingly, \\"The Fall\\" is the only Camus novel set outside Africa-- in foggy Amsterdam, land of carnal lust and moral ambiguity!Very well-crafted mood of unease, very intelligent broodings. It does, however, seem contrived to specifically fit Camus' purpose of moral exploraion, and the characters seem awfully schematic. This might make it a little too didactic for some readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever Written. Period..........","review":"I've been reading some of the reviews for this book and can't believe that there are so many people writing about this book without really understanding it. I have read this book about a dozen times, never read any other book more than once. The first time I read it I thought it was very boring and dry, just two guys talkng in a bar. The second time I thought this Jean-Baptiste guy might be the devil talking.About the sixth time I really understood it. The narrator of the story is the Devil himself (for real). And he was talking not to somebody in the bar, but he was talkng to me personally (for real).This book changed my outlook on life and my actions in life. Just about every word in every sentence has more than one meaning. Does anyone else get this from the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very different from \\"The Stranger\\"","review":"I loved \\"The stranger\\" so much that as soon as I finished reading it, I went out and bought \\"The fall\\" and \\"The Plague\\". I have to say that I am very dissappointed by \\"The fall\\". The idea behind the book is very interesting, but it somehow falls flat and ends up being very boring. The language is profoundly different from that of \\"The stranger\\" which I loved for its concise sentences. \\"The fall\\" is very tedious reading and despite the fact that it is short book, it feels very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls with a thud","review":"This \\"novel\\", if you want to call it that, consists of an ex-lawyer who calls himself a \\"judge-penitent\\" prattling on to a presumably interested (though I can't figure out why) fellow he meets at a bar about his life. I suppose he is confessing, in a way, yet I found his confessions to be full of arrogance and pride even from the beginning, especially concerning his sexual conquests. If I were the listener, I'd try to get away from this blowhard as soon as I could. As a reader, I did manage to finish the book, after all it is fairly short and not particularly difficult. Many people who read this believe that it describes the human condition well, and can see glimpses of themselves in this man. Well, if they look hard enough, most people could see glimpses of themselves in the Unabomber, too. I found this book to be a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sea of insanity with small islands of philosophical drivel","review":"This book was odd in that it kept me awake, but left me in a state of utter boredom. I had to read this book for a high school book report and regret every minute of having to do so. It is virtually impossible to understand and lacks a purpose. It was truly a waste of good paper to even print this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read worth your time","review":"I think this book suffers from its narrative style. The long passages of monologue simply strain the believability of the premise (that of a conversation).That said, this is a fantastic look at human nature and especially, of modern human morality. You will read this hoping no one else has, for they would be able to see into your secret and hidden thoughts. In the end, however, you realize you have been played by the narrator and that all thinking men have the same secret thoughts.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"an experience to be shared by all","review":"Camus is at his best yet again in novel form. The fall is written in the second person narrrative which is something readers do not come across to often. It is basically a novel of self confession which will have you thinking about your own desires, downfalls, and secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion reigns while reading this book.","review":"The Fall was assigned to me for a book report, and while reading it I constantly find myself nodding off.

Clamence believes himself to be a good man, but when his virtue is tested by a call to sacrifice, he retreats to comfort, and realizes he is selfish and \\"fallen\\". He then recognizes that he is guilty and we are all guilty of pretension and ego-driven \\"altrusim\\".Clamence states that the \\"weight of days\\" without the judgment and forgiveness of God is \\"dreadful\\". An excellent existential exploration of Christian symbols and psychology. A \\"must read\\" for Camus fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"No turning back once you enter this revelation of doom!","review":"Even if you are not into Camus, be ready for the lifestyle his character leads: naivety without goals, preconceived intentions nor insights. Reading \\"The Fall\\" is just that: falling through the putrifying, self-serving babble that drags you doggedly to the slimey bottom until you gasp! There's a message in here as cold as the icy river that spawned it.Take deep breaths and let yourself go. Camus, as always, will clearly lead you through the muck"},{"rating":"2","title":"A work which questions the nature of judgement","review":"Camus' work asks on what grounds we judge others and ourselves. A pinnacle of existentialist thought fits the world into the perception of one rather bent individual. Though rather pompous (I'm enlightened and therfore can see the stars) it calls forth a forcefully disengaged view of the social mores which we hold to be commonplace. A must read for lovers of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" or Demian"},{"rating":"2","title":"a book with real intelligence and passion","review":"some people who have commented don't seem to get it. forget about plot....camus is commenting on society through jean baptiste. think philosophical ideals not story line. i really love this book for that reason, he speaks with passion, wit, and intelligence. a true resistance fighter, i admire camus greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good resource on existentialism","review":"I am not an existentialist by any means, but I cannot deny that this is a good piece of literature. Camus had an amazing gift for writing (it is a shame he did all of his writing for existentialism).This book is a monolouge, contrary to what is said by other reviewers, and it is possibly the best written monolouge I have read. However, I did not like how unreliable the character was. You never knew when Camus was actually expressing his views or not. It is not of the same quality as the Plauge or the Stranger, and I did not feel right giving the same score to both of them, so this one only gets a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging","review":"My favorite book for Camus, his style in writing is very provocative, and challenging. Forces you to think of his personality and how that relates to us. He is very detailed and makes you imagine exactly what he is going through.One of those books that you have to stop once in a while and reflect on what message has been communicated. What is the hidden message behind all this, and how would that imply to me...Even if you are not into these kind of books, I believe you should try reading it, quick reading, easy to follow through, and more than anything else enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and disjointed.","review":"I was very disappointed in this album. Normally I thoroughly enjoy the work of Maurice Jarre; however, when I first listened to this soundtrack I thought there must be something wrong with my sound system. The rare moments of beauty, mainly provided by the vocal and instrumental versions of Unchained Melody, are totally overwhelmed by a cacophony of disjointed and irritating sounds. This was especially annoying since the strnge sounds always come after a brief moment of the very soothing love theme from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unchain the melody, PLEASE!","review":"I originally had just wanted a good recording of the Righteous Brothers' \\"Unchained Melody,\\" but purchased GHOST on the basis of several of the rave reviews below. Mssr Jarre is obviously a talented composer, but the two renditions of \\"Unchained Melody\\" are really the only things on the disk that I can stand. The rest of the selections are quite cacophonous and unmelodic; the music works fine on screen to convey tension, fear, dementia, etc., but it's not what I would ever choose to listen to. If you're like me and have a hard time appreciating much of modern \\"classical\\" music, you'd be much better off just buying a Righteous Brothers CD - \\"Unchained Melody\\" really is a slow-dance classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"very mysterious, haunting.","review":"For those who saw 'Ghost', and listened carefully to the score in the background, should have expected to hear just that in this soundtrack.

The next morning the pain was gone and the I could move around with great ease. I have used it for years and it is the best product out there. In the past few years I haven't been able to find it, so I tried a number of different products. They were smelly, greasey and generally did very little for sore or strained muscles. I googled Myoflex and Amazon.com had it! What a relief to know I could still buy it. I bought several tubes just in case. I can't say enough good about this product. It just works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"Got this watering can for one reason, long reach!

The first time I used the pan I oiled it, but noticed that my piece of paper towel turned black. I washed the pan again, oiled it again, more black. I discovered that the lengthwise seam along the raised section of the bottom of the pan was open - I could catch it with my fingernail, and the black was coming from this seam. Later I stopped by Macy's and looked at the same pan and discovered the same open seam. It looks like Cuisinart is selling a defective item on a large scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan is defective","review":"The pan looked great and is nice and heavy; however, exactly like another reviewer said, there is an unsealed seam in the bottom of the pan that gives off black stuff even after multiple washings.

I always wanted a deeper pan to make lasagna in. The pan is heavy and deep and the handles are convenient. I was excited to use it for the first time and was extremely disappointed in the pans cooking performance. Lasagna, that i usually cook in other pans, took over 2 hours.

Some of the levels are impossible and it seems like you have to restart 50 times before you can finally pass the level. How am I supposed to catch a guy throwing explosives out of the back when he never slows down enough so you can run him off the road? The cops seem to be difficult. You can be going full speed and the cops can still ram you from the back and send you flying into a building. I personally didn't think it was very fun. Now if you could walk into the buildings and explore a little more than pavement, it would be fun.

How wrong I was , well the game looks better but what does that say nothing there seems to be a framerate of 20 fps they have ruined the game i loved. how they could put this pile of crap out i cant understand a high speed chase seems to be all to slow, this is becomeing all to common, good game then a bad game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player of games","review":"I purchased three of these for two young men.

Even since then, I couldn't play driver 2 without thinking of how much better a game was out there, that you could do a thousand times more in. Of course, you have to get a ps2 to play gta 3, but trust me, it's worth it. Especially since gta vice city is coming out soon. Ps2 is definately the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea bad Game","review":"OK kids here is the Real Don Steal. Remember in the first game when you got to LA and it was always raining. Remember how hard it was to drive the car and how much the Frame rate slowwed down due to the increase in activity on the screen i.e. more than 3 cars with in 10 feet of yours. Well sit down and buckle up cause the entire game of Driver 2 is like that. I played this game and when I put the controller down all I could say was WOW 32 bits have reached their limits.

Driver remained my favorite PlayStation game until Driver 2 was released. This game has great graphics for a PS game, and gameplay is the best. Major improvements over the original are much more variety of cars, you can now get out of your car and take something else when yours is in too bad of shape (even something like a school bus or an armored car!), new cities with on/off ramps and curved roads, and some very fun 2-player modes like capture the flag. There are all kinds of missions, like following criminals without getting close enough to expose yourself or far enough away to lose him, and just getting somewhere in time to save your buddy. The cities are also very realistic, and there is real traffic. Even the cops strategise a lot to try to run you off the road. .... Although this is a great game, parents should be concerned about the violence in some of the between-play cutscenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Playstation Game I Have Ever Played!","review":"I really enjoyed Driver 1, but Driver 2 is the best game I've ever played.

The bad news is that the graphics are just as bad on the PS2. The good news is that the control might be just a tad better. I did not notice any substantial control differences compared to the original Driver (which I also own and could do side by side comparisons to). My personal jury is still out on buying this one, but the experience was not as bad as the PS-based reviewers suggest.

Roughly a third of the levels (almost all of the chase levels) are ludicrously difficult without remarkable skills, and the \\"tail the suspect\\" levels are boring and easy. You'll often replay the same level over and over again (they really can be difficult), and between each replay you have to wait for the level to load and watch a long intro.

Indeed, i would like to see a game that essentially combines a Driver type game with a flight simulator, providing a more thorough 'life' simulation. At any rate, I feel that Driver 2 was a rather sloppy release. The graphics are not very sharp, the popup makes it very hard to see what is not so far ahead of you. Many of the missions are so difficult, that I had to attempt them 20 or 30 times before I was lucky enough to finish them. Needless to say, I still have not gotten to Rio or Vegas... what they really lack here, I believe, is a setting for difficulty levels. The game is perpetually on 'Extreme'. Personally, I like a game to be challenging, as well as fun. I do not find Driver 2 to be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Driver 1 is one of my all time favorite games so of course I went out and bought Driver 2 as soon as it came out. When I played it I couldn't believe that this was made by the same company that made the first outstanding game. The graphics are hardly impressive, the control is loose, the speed is sluggish and it's just not a user friendly game. At some points you end up hating the game because you have to restart so much each time you fail a mission. They made this game extremely hard. My friend is a gaming fanatic. He plays games all day everyday. He's an expert at them. But even he couldn't get past the first disc of this game. We've both given up. Now, if I'm going to play Driver 2 it's just for the free drives around the cities.

Very much the style, if not the level of Ken Burns documentaries. Julie Andrews is the hostess who is very proficient. The early episodes are pretty good, but by the end it is very commericial, pro-Disney (did they underwrite this?), modern Times Square ad for NYC tourism. I wish there were less movie clips, but we have to be glad to have anything. But, if you want passion, see \\"Broadway: The Golden Age,\\" which I saw in a movie theater and comes out on DVD soon. That one's the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give My Regards to Broadway","review":"If you enjoy documentaries, you will enjoy this one, especially if you enjoy musicals.

Also a great companion to this collection is the audio compilation that is also available."},{"rating":"2","title":"THOROUGH AND INFORMED","review":"This documentary spectacular succeeds marvelously within the limitations of the PBS program. Inevitably, segments in the history of musical theater have been streamlined and/or eliminated in order to work within less than six hours.

Also, I know so many others have said it as well, but way too many movie clips and you never knew what you were looking at. People were not identified, etc. But, I applaud them for taking the time to make it and for putting it all down. Still better to have this than not to have done it.NOTE: I thoroughly enjoyed the extra interview footage. It is actually more entertaining and enlightening than the actual series.

I actually would prefer to hear the stories of the film \\"Broadway: The Golden Age\\" over the numerous movie clips of Broadway shows adapted by Hollywood. If you want movie clips see the Michael Feinstein Hollywood PBS series, which was wonderful. This one is a first-class production, very classy, but oddly enough it does not keep your interest the way the much more \\"shoestring\\" Golden Age film does.

This means the final hour covers 1980 to the present which (ironically) is a period when many shows were video-taped for TV and for the Broadway archive.I hope this set is a success and will prompt more in depth looks at some of today's creators. A full 2-hour show could be devoted to Kander & Ebb, another to Andrew Lloyd Webber, still another to Stephen Sondheim. Get these people now while (except for Fred Ebb) they are still around and active in the theatre.The Rodgers and Hammerstein shows were well covered in a 1980 PBS special hosted by Mary Martin..and THAT one should be exhumed and released on DVD.Still, what IS here is well assembled and presented but even with the 3-hours of bonus material, it still only scratches the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Grandmas","review":"There are 390 pages in this book and the main couple only gets 'romantic' on page 345.

This book reads as though my grandmother was telling it to me - it's a grandma romance. One of the main romantic characters in the book is a curmudgenly old guy age 87. Not romantic, not sexy, not something very appealing to read about. The characters are sedate, the action is slim to none, the characters are boring, the plot is weak, and the writing is drab and just... oldish. This book has no staying power - it doesn't involve you or make you want to remember the characters afterwards.

I learned volumes of new information about the car and the market it was supposed to conquer.Take note, however, that this is not a technical manual (nor is it intended to be) and only has a limited section about how to live with a SD1.

Contrary to the beliefs of the other reviewers, I found the music to be boring and unimaginative. To stand out in the over-crowded sea of Christmas albums, an artist needs to perform with a moving-passion or musical ingenuity, neither of which are represented in this album. In fact, the album is at times so cookie cutter, I swear I could hear the metronome ticking in the background. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guaranteed to make a Scrooge out of you","review":"In recent years I've found myself growing unaccountably grouchy as Christmas approaches. Finally, I figured out the problem: my wife played this CD. The Roches have only one volume, loud. They make no effort to blend their voices. They don't always stay on key. They don't try to capture the spirit of any of their songs, singing everything in the same top-of-the-lungs way. Listening to this CD is like nothing so much as being in attendance during the third hour of a kid's birthday party, when the kids are hitting the wall with sugar and fatigue and the screams grow out of control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fresh","review":"I got this CD over five years ago, and I can barely wait 'til Thanksgiving to start playing it.

You can't match the Roches for sincerity and harmony. An original song, 'Star of Wonder', is the most powerful modern Christmas tune that I have ever heard... coalescing the entire dilemma of Christmas to a simple, beautiful, moving lament. The other songs range from the humorous to the sublime. Any Christmas music list should start and end with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Best","review":"In a previous review of another recording, I had called this my second favorite Christmas album. This year (2004) after another dozen plays, it's topped my charts. There are so many reasons to enjoy this very different Christmas record -- way beyond the usual 10 tired songs, inspired fresh arrangements of songs you've heard too many (dull) times before, a very deep excursion into obscure music you've haven't heard too often, humor and joy, and a thoroughly unique approach. Who else would attempt a Handel chorus with just three voices? Only The Roches.It was a joy reading all the other reviews and seeing that we've become quite a community of people who can't have Christmas without The Roches. I have also given away many copies of this CD, and I now find myself becoming quite suspicious of anyone who doesn't 'get it.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"The ink will not stick to a photo!

At my shop, that was normally $4.99/yard, but they had a sale on it for $2.99/yard. I could have bout FIVE of these for that price, but instead I got batting and table clips and still came out ahead.Thank GOODNESS their quality control is terrible, because I can return it to Amazon for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome black jack and Texas hold'em table cover","review":"I love this table cover. I use it weekly and have had no issues with it. It is thick enough to allow aggressive betting i.e. throwing chips across the table and not make much noise or scratch the table. However, there are some fuzz balls that have appeared, but I have expected that since it is made of felt. I don't find that a problem, where others may.Overall, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to use a table they already have but don't want to scratch it or buy a card table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well and Will Wash","review":"Glad I bought it. The felt top is much more attractive to my blackjack \\"customers\\" than an empty table top.There will be felt lint coming up though, so that's annoying, but not game-breaking.Also, I just machine washed and dried it, and it seems fine.

Vista rated its performance 5.9 wich is the same as my other system (3 x Seagate BARRACUDA ES-7200.1 320GB Hard Drive, RAID 5 setup) which is strange. My RAID 5 setup theoritically should be faster and so this Maxtor (single disk) should be rated less than my RAID 5 setup. I don't why but I don't trust Vista hardware rating. For example a RADEON 2600XT 512MB in single card or Crossfire setup, Vista rated the gaming performance the same (5.4) for both setup.The maxtor HDD is a very good buy comparing to Barracuda however My Barracuda RAID 5 setup (3 disks)is more quiet than the maxtor (Single disk).

Her mom only lets her perform in church. Orphelia's idol Madame Merrita comes to town. Mandame Merrita is keeping her eye out for talented kids.

I have been a Jarrett fan since the Koln days and had eagerly anticipated (and feared)this release. I put it away after one listen and then went back after several months. No change, unfortunately.In recent years Mr. Jarrett has taken to exploring the far fringes of diatonic, chromatic and every other ic of harmony. I'm not sure to what end but it seems more for self gratification than to offer his fans and jazz fans something a bit more palatible than Radiance. Being challenged by jazz music is worthwhile and listeners of Cecil Taylor and Andrew Hill can certainly feel rewarded by music that is both eclectic and appealing. But on Radiance, Jarrett finds combinations of silence and atonality that seem to speak only to him and the \\"art critics\\" who will forever praise everything he issues. And while I can't stomach the retro jazz genre in general, I wish that Keith Jarrett would get a bit nostalgic for Koln."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey. We're your audience.

I think it is flawed in concept. We all know that, for the most part, Jarrett did some preparation for his best solo concerts and improvised on themes. This idea of sitting down with nothing and just playing: That might be an interesting exercise for the musician, but it come close to being an insult to a paying audience (attending a concert or buying a recording.)

To insinuate that He created mankind knowing that this would be their lot, makes Him out to be a monster worse than anything the world has seen.A thorough study of the scriptures in their original language will prove that the punishment mentioned throughout the Bible is not \\"eternal\\" and it's end result will be in drawing ALL mankind back to the Father. \\"IF I be lifted up, I will draw ALL men unto me\\".This book, in my humble opinion, is a disgrace and portrays Satan as a successful foe to the Creator of mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven vs Hell","review":"Had read 3 books on Heaven and wanteda good book that revealed Hell.

Others are \\"Pigs in the Parlor\\" and \\"He Came to Set the Captives Free\\" by Dr. Rebecca Brown. They are some good backups."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW","review":"I have read a lot of books on the revelation of Hell. I have heard a lot of sermons on its existence, but nothing had prepared me for what I was about to read between the covers of this book \\"A Divine Revelation of Hell.\\"The author, over a period of forty days, is given visions of hell and the people who are trapped there for eternity. I cannot begin to tell you the horrors that she saw and reported, but if you really want to know what is there, this is the book for you.However, I will warn you, she is faithful to reporting exactly what she has seen and if I were you, I would prepare myself before I opened the pages of this book ,because if what she is saying is true, and I believe it is,than we all must reevaluate our very existence and motives in this life before it is too late.A very good read that I hope will reach many so they will turn to Jesus and never have to be trapped in this place we call Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Is Real","review":"I have read this book and believe what was written. Many people get visions, also we have to remember we are in the last days so the Lord will chose who ever he wants to show what he want us to see. This book is a warning to all both sinners & saints.We all have our free will, so we either believe it or not.If in doubt, pray before & after reading this book as I did.God Bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought","review":"For those of you who say this book is not of God, maybe the truth is that you know that it is true and cannot accept it. Maybe that is because you prefer to live by comfortable rules, etc. God never said following him would always be comfortable. I find this book to be a reminder of all the things God promises to those who choose not to follow Him, and also for those who choose Him, choose life. For those of you who are not sure, at least read the book and then make your own decision. Baxter tells you in the beginning of the book to balance what you are reading with scripture (scripture references are in the back of the book) and the leading of the Holy Spirit. She never claimed to see God...only that God showed her things she was to share with all of us.I hope you will choose to read this book, and choose life through Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a must read for all Christains.

Those who choose not to believe what hell is all about have only themselves to blame when they find themselves in hell. You will have all eternity to think about what you read and chose to ignore. Please, for not only God's sake but for your own, do not let satan fool you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I give it negative stars?","review":"I'm not sure whether the author is delusional or what, but the book reads like a poorly-written scare tactic. I can't help but think that if it were really divinely inspired God would have helped her to write a more readable and more believable book. Instead we have an unbelievable account, full of absurd gunk.If you are a Christian, don't waste your time with this book! It doesn't have the ring of truth to it. She claims that Jesus wanted her to describe Hell for us so that we would realize it is a real place and that we don't want to go there! I find it highly suspicious that she came out with \\"A Divine Revelation of Heaven\\" shortly after this book. Was Jesus equally concerned that we needed to know that Heaven is a good place?Don't waste your time and money on this book! Jesus' message is one of Love, not one of fear. I refuse to believe that Jesus has to resort to scaring us into following him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Divine Raping of Dante","review":"Basically she took Dante's Inferno and dumbed it down into simple Christian cliches and slogans. I feel bad for the Italian poet. It's a good thing he is not around to see this abomination.I too had a revelation while reading this book. Personally, I would rather go to the Hell that Baxter describes. Why?.... because if Heaven is filled with Christians like her, THAT WOULD BE MY HELL!!! I would definitely prefer an eternity of getting pitchforked in the butt than be around those people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baxter plays a childish prank by claiming Divine Revelation","review":"There are useful accounts of encounters with Christ that lead tovery uplifting and eye opening truths about our reality.I find it offensive that Baxter claims that this book is an account of Divine Revelation guided by the Lord Himself. Not the first time People have done this sort of thing.\\"Dante's Inferno\\" as a fiction has more substance than this fibber. I catagorize this with the story-telling of alien abductees."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK ON HELL!! tour hell and meet its occupants...","review":"The is the most detailed book on hell i've ever seen. Pits, cells, demons,fire, worms, outer darkness, hell's belly, jaws, heart,... Mary Baxter is blessed to witness more of hell than any other person alive today - and i'm so blessed to see it thru her eyes. Moreover, Jesus himself is the tour guide, and he has a message for all presumptuos people, even Christians who think they're on safe ground - repent while there is still the chance. This book is full of surprises and hard to put down. My wife loves this book - it convicts, and amplifies scripture.You will feel the urgency of sharing the gospel....I believe salvation is a contract - Jesus did his part, we have to do ours (believe and be faithful - still by his grace and power of course). Saving faith means obedience. The apostles kept reminding us to be careful.Indeed, narrow is the path that leads to life. Be sure you're walking on the right road, and never fall away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh Out Loud FUNNY!!!","review":"This woman should team up with Steven Spielberg & write HORROR! Read it with a group of friends at a drinking party between shots of Tequila!!!The woman is a CHURCH OF GOD pastor! Ever visit one of those churches? Not very high IQ levels & incredibly guillible people. They also believe women who wear pants go to hell, women who wear jewelry go to hell, women who cut their hair go to hell. They go into ecstatic hysterical possessions \\"of the spirit\\" and roll around on the floor and scream. Some of them in the more rural mountain cultures pass rattlesnakes around.Nuff said!! This book is about as fun to read as stepping in dog dukey!!! Be very drunk if you want to enjoy reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend this book","review":"This book is not a good purchase. However sincere the author may be, it contains questionable material. I would not recommend this reading to anyone. I don't know the author or her intentions, but I find it hard to believe that Jesus gave this vision to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book scared me.","review":"The author shares with us her experiences where Jesus takes her and shows her hell. And in this hell she finds verification of everything she has ever believed in. She finds all of the types of people that she is against burning for eternity. The only thing that I believe of this book is that the author believes she experienced these things. What scares me the most is how many people take these experiences seriously as truth. I do not recommend this book unless someone either wants to reinforce their viewpoint that the Christian way is the only way and all others will burn for eternity or if they have a strong stomach for terror and want to understand the fears that are used to cause people to enter cults."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Divine Revelation of Hell","review":"The book was in excellent shape. I purchased it for myself. The book arrived at the time it was due. I received a nice book for a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining","review":"This is typical pentecostal stuff. This book certainly caught my attention.I think this type of story appeals to people who suffer from low self-esteem that are easily persuaded by this nonsense.It reminds me of the snake oil salesman who tries to scare you into buying his product.I would encourage anyone who reads this book and others by this author, that they read what the Bible says on the topic of heaven and hell.Remember the apostal Paul was caught up to the third heavens and wasn't permitted to speak of what he experienced. I believe the Bible only gives us a small glimpse of what is beyond the grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary, Mary Why You Buggin'?","review":"Remember the rich man in the Book of Luke in the Holy Bible? He was in hell and wanted God to let him come back to earth to warn his brothers not to come to hell. Jesus told him that if they wouldn't listen to HIM (Jesus), what makes the rich man think that the people would listen to him (the rich man)? God would not allow the man to return to earth from hell. Jesus Christ is the only person who went to hell and returned to earth. No other man or woman has done this EVER! If Mary Baxter says that she went to hell and return to earth to tell it, then she is a LIAR and a FALSE PROPHETESS. And ALL liars shall have their part in the lake of fire.WAKE UP people! Do not be deceived. We are in the last days and time is short. READ THE BIBLE FOR YOURSELF because only God can give the understanding and revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timely Message","review":"The existance of Hell is not to be toyed with as to its existance. God has revealed it to us in His Word (the Bible), it wont suddenly go away for those who dont believe in it.How strange it is that most people cry for justice in this world, but when God acts in justice they cry \\"FOUL\\". We all will be judged, no escaping there. For those who cry once saved always saved I think you had better read more carefully God's Word. We clearly need to endure unto the end, and Praise God, He will keep us from falling, but the question is will we let Him. Please note that GOD IS LOVE, to know what LOVE really is we must know GOD. Perfect LOVE cannot exist without justice being done. Perfect Love does not enforce us to believe in Jesus Christ or follow Him, but perfect LOVE surely warns us of the alternative. We have no Luvy Duvy God (somehow loving that which is good and bad).We only have this life to choose in.I know whom I choose, I know Jesus and want no other.John Brumby"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Stephen King?","review":"This book, if to believed should be read by every Christian. If these things were truly revealed by God, we as a Christan community need to read this and work together to bring this message to the unsaved.

This book is not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe that Hell was a terrible place and she confirms.","review":"The book is a real eye-opener and anyone that read it, should realize that hell is not a place they would want to spend eternity.

There is no where in the Bible that states Jesus would come for any person of this day and age, to do any of the things she has stated in this book. So people that agrees with this book should go to their bible, and find any scriptures that backs up the story of this book. Also, read 2 Peter 2:1-3; v10,11 & 13, at least, and see what these verses say. I would even dare to say she must have been having a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close.... But no Cigar","review":"Having read Divine Revelations of Hell by Mary Baxter as well as The Demon Chronicles, by Louie Orduna all I can say is these Hell travelers must have taken differnt busses to their respective destinations. Orduna's trip was exciting and interesting to no end. Mary's was a real sleeper. This leads one to believe that either one or the other was dreaming, or that Hell has differnt bus stops labled economy and first class. I say this to Mary....\\"If you have the time read Orduna's book. It will give you something to remember !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Satisfactory, eye-opening read, but falls short.","review":"This book was fairly good. I think Mary Kay Baxter does a good job and she's doing a good thing wanting to convert people to Christianity. Things that happen in this book, though, what with worms, etc. gets repetitive. How many times can you read about a person picking worms from their skeleton, or dingy-gray souls trapped inside their skeletons before it becomes less and less of a shock and boring? Personally, I feel that the book is good, though a little far-fetched at times. Being a Christian myself, I can't DISPROVE what she says, put I also can't say a word of this has any truth to it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly False","review":"I do not doubt that Mary K Baxter had some sort of revelation, but it was not from the Lord. This book has some interesting stuff in it, and some things, if read by themselves could be considered edifying, however, this book is laced with much false doctrine. I would have given this book 0 stars if it were possible. Sadly, many Christians who are bored with their faith and immature sucked into this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible check","review":"Somebody with an open heart will know deep within him/her that hell is real. You can feel the sincerity of Mary as she pleads for people to receive Jesus in their hearts and escape the horrors of everything she has seen and experienced. People don't get to heaven by their good works, neither do they land in hell because they did not commit a crime. Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ's work at calvary. It's in the bible. And it's repeated many times in the book. False prophets will draw people away from Christ. This book draws somebody to Christ. They are drawn to repentance. Do yourself a favor, read this book and make sure you check the verse references in the bible and you will know that nothing is made up."},{"rating":"1","title":"JESUS WARNED US ABOUT MARY K.

I believe she was given these visions...it's up to all of us weather we believe it or not. So be it. It sounds all too real to me and I know that I do not want to go to the Lake of Fire...who would?

A close study of Gods word, and Mary's word will reveal discrepancies. A number of reviews are available on the web which go into great detail about these discrepancies.

That will get you thinking...if your a thinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it isn't real","review":"I admonish anyone who desires to know more about God and hell and Heaven to save your money and buy a bible instead of this book. I don't intend to judge Ms. Baxter's motives, but I question the truth of it. In fact, Jesus already told us in Luke chapter 16 \\"They have Moses and the prophets.\\" He then went on to indicate that if the people on earth would not believe Moses and the prophets, they certainly will not believe one who rose from the dead. Now if Jesus already said that in His Word, why would He waste His time picking someone for a \\"special assingment,\\" someone alive, who alleges to have a vision? God is not a god of idling His time away. Beside, since Jesus' Word is true, He doesn't need us to prove it. Use your money wisely and buy a Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a phenominal read!","review":"Don't be skiddish. Go ahead and read this.

It took me a few years to conclude that it was all her fertile imagination. I agree with another review posted here that asserts that the \\"Jesus\\" of Baxter's so-called \\"revelation\\" bears little to no resemblance to the Jesus of the Bible or traditional church teaching. I think this \\"revelation\\" can be safely ignored. As a telling side-note, has anyone else noticed her \\"A Divine Revelation of...\\" series of books? Looks like she started herself a franchise along the lines of \\"Chicken Soup For The (fill in the blank) Soul\\"!! Sounds like money might be the big revelation here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Head of the Warning","review":"How strange it is that 30% of people reject not only this book, but they reject in the same proportion the \\"Bible\\" and as well \\"Heaven Is So Real\\".These people just do not like the Jesus and the God of the Bible. And the more strange is the fact that those who declare that they do believe the Bible, they just seem to read it with blinkers on their eyes. They seem to just cut out those disturbing passages that they do not like and say they were for another time and another day.But today Jesus is the same Jesus that the Bible declares, God is the same God that the Bible declares and we need to take warning that believers also come under judgment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Divine Revelation of Hell","review":"Very interesting and eye-opening of the author's trip to Hell with Jesus.

It say's their down there because they didn't give a poor person money, and the other person didn't bail out his brother. You don't get to Heaven by good deeds. Even though they were Christians. As a Christian myself, I did some investigating, and she's using scare-tactics to convert people to Chrisianity. And only Jesus and that person can do that.

I was so disgusted with what I was reading I found myself surprised that anyone would publish this. I did however, find I could not put it down, mostly because I was experiencing what I can only hope was righteous anger, (Be angry and sin not). Mary Baxter has twisted the loving Lord Jesus into some monster I don't recognize from Scripture, or my own experience as a child of the King. Just because someone says \\"God took me to Hell to warn others\\", doesn't make it true. The experiences she writes about make her sound more loving and righteous than our Lord. GOD does NOT bring people to Hell to witness the events. Scripture warns us to turn from unbelief and belief unto life...but NOWHERE has anyone been given a guided tour; not even the apostle Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interesting book!","review":"However,this one should be placed in the Religous Fiction Section. I could not help but be amazed at her discription of how Jesus quieted the damned,tormented souls in hell by saying \\"Peace\\". Peace!

I know hell is scary, I am a born-again christain, and read the Bible daily. I believe if she is trying to reach the unsaved, she went about it the wrong way. This book would only look like a bad horror novel to the non-believer. The entire book is not backed by scripture, and she is comparing herself and experiences to some Biblical people like John. The Bible is whole, and she is writing about visions and things never revealed to John in the book of Revelations. She writes that Jesus revealed secrets to her, but not to share these with the reader at this time. What is that? God is mysterious, but He provided us with all we need to know about receiving salvation.

How can they rejoice when they think that 75% of this failed god foresaken is going to be tormented forever in hell. Tell me how in the HELL that strengthens their faith and makes them \\"happy\\"?

Unless of course, you are addicted to reading about other people's pain & hopelessness. There are surprises in every chapter, & not pleasant ones, at that. If you think you are holy, this will make you take a 2nd look at yourself. If you're not a believer, it will give you something to think about.

I wish that everyone (including every wicked person) to go to heaven. I really do. But I have to accept what reality is. It does us no good to say or wish there is no hell, if there is a hell.Through Mary Baxter's book, and many other visions, we know that there is a hell. Even without ANY of these visions, we know from Jesus' own words, that there is indeed a hell. If we do not believe there is a hell, I hope people will earnestly seek the truth about it. When we seek God with an objective, truthful heart, He will answer us. Maybe not with a thunderbolt, but He will show and teach us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening and realistic account of hell","review":"This is the first book on hell that I ever read and it is shocking and terrifying. This book set me free and opened my eyes to the TRUTH and delivered me from foolish thinking and spiritual deception and brought me from DARKNESS into LIGHT.It also made me aware of the reality of hell and what a terrible place of eternal suffering it is.It is important for people to read a divine revelation of hell and get BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD (a spiritual change)and get their names written in the lamb\`s book of life or they will be cast into the lake of fire.The judgement seat of christ is where saved believers will get judged for their works and get their rewards in heaven from Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question, please?","review":"I find it quite interesting that for anyone that opposes the book, individual reviewers who favor the book often condemn the critics as if they were denying and blaspheming God Himself! Are MKB's personal writings on a par with \\"inerrant Scripture\\" or with God Himself? And at what point does this become a form of idolatry?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deluded or a liar","review":"Mary K. Baxter is either seriously deluded or a liar. Unfortunately this and her other books will delude others. Her divine revelations are nothing more then fantasyland and they are far away from what the bible says. The story of the begger Lazarus and the rich man gives us clues to the domain of torments (hell). Ms Baxter has her souls in pits of fire or locked up in cages or being tortured in a \\"fun centre\\". She even claims that Jesus left her in Hell alone to suffer. I am sorry but our Saviour would not do that to any of HIS children. She also claims that she was sick for some time after. Again any encounter with the Lord Jesus would not leave His children sick but actually the opposite - revitalized.If you are a new Christian then keep away. If you are a mature Christian who wants to do research and use these books for comparisons then fine but be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVEN OR HELL? A CHOICE","review":"I recommend reading \\"A Divine Revelation of Hell\\" for Christians and non-Christians. It is scriptually based and enlightening for those who believe, and those who do not believe there is a Hell. If you believe there's no Heaven or Hell, or that only Heaven exists and NO Hell, this is a book you might want to read. Especially, if you don't believe Jesus nor Satan is real. It might shed some light on this subject for you. It's written by Mary K. Baxter, a woman who says she has been to Hell and back \\"literally\\" and has seen and felt the horrors of this place called Hell. I believe once you start reading this book you won't be able to put it down until you have completed it, and you might be the better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"delusional paranoid schitzophrenic has a nightmare.","review":"What a joke. hahaha. Makes the world a more interesting place though that people actually believe in this. Where would we be in life without comedy? I got a good laugh from it, which is the only reason I read it in the first place. It would make a fantastic script for a horror movie with a bit of editing. I think the only place Mary went to during the night was back to the kitchen for a top up of wine. This woman is a psychopath trying to make her millions, or else a deluded psychotic.5 star people, you are BRAINWASHED."},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman needs help.","review":"This book truly disgusted me.

It doesn't get any more corrupt than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discern the spirits of delusion in biblical knowledge!","review":"The reason that this book is totally false is due to two points.First, in this book the author inserted that in the past Jesus repeatedly had undertaken the death of cross and resurrection to save people. what a ridiculous! It's the most funny testimony I've ever read.The Bible proclamed that Jesus was crucified on the cross and risen from dead \\"once and forever for our salvation.\\" I wondered whether or not she really had ever read the Bible entirely. I'm sure that demons used her for their show.Second, accordint to this book, believers may lost their salvation. Alas! It is very sad that Such a opinion will have influence on readers. Christians'salvation is forever because calling of God is irrecocable. If believers'salvation can be lost, it makes God imperfect.Don't purcase this book! Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Propaganda!","review":"Basically, there are two groups of people who go to hell: homosexuals and non-Christians. As one can see, this book reeks with evangelical, born-agian Christian claptrap. I give it two stars instead of one star because the book was very descriptive. Gee, the levels of hell in this book almost remind me of another book which describes hell in a similar manner. Try Dante's \\"Inferno\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Christian book ever written","review":"This tripe deserves not even a \\"1\\". A \\"0\\" would even be too nice. \\"A Divine Revelation of Hell\\" has only one salient use: kindling for a fireplace. Better yet, torch it in a bonfire.This garbage shouldn't even recieve a \\"-5\\". To use this book to scrub oil off a mechanic shop floor would be an insult to the oil AND the mechanic shop floor.It is obvious to even well-educated children that Baxter is mentally ill and a paranoid delusional scizophrenic. This is fear served up as faith, insanity served up as inspiration. Actually, I guess it COULD be used to line a gerbil cage. I guess the book DOES have another use.Now, Mary, just calm down and have a nice cup of cocoa and maybe some depressants. You need to calm down and actually study the Scriptures rather than believe what your mommy/daddy/preacherman taught you, ok? Shhhhh....it's OK, Mary. Shhhhhhhhhhh........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscriptural, repetitive, and possible confusing.","review":"The main question the Gospel Book Club asked was \\"Why?\\" Why would Jesus have to take a person through what Mary K. Baxter went through when He has already given us His Word? Why would Mary K. be so tormented during the day, when it was Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who was supposedly giving her this revelation? Why was much of the book, and her 40-day tour, so repetitive? Why did she list the Scriptures at the end of the book, when it was at the end where she recommended that we read the Scriptures as we read the book? Examples of areas that we felt could not be verified with Scripture were the jail-like holding cells for some of the lost souls, Hell's shape as a body, and the babies' heaven.The Gospel Book Club believes this book could possibly confuse new Christians or those who are not sure of what they believe or how they believe it. While we didn't doubt that Ms. Baxter went through \\"something,\\"we questioned the \\"divinity\\" of her revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"TICK TOCK PEOPLE TIME IS NOT LONG","review":"I have read this book at three different times of my life.In Luke 16:19-31 this is not a parable.

So 10 years later I am buying it again!!The first time I heard Lydia and Exene's spoken word was on The Home Alive Cd which was to benefit Mia Zapata from the Gits. Rude Hieroglyphics is far the best spoken word I have ever heard. I saw Lydia 4 years ago doing her spoken word in New Orleans at the now defunct Shim Sham club..it was great!! I think she was aggravated with me and my friend because we were the only prissy looking girls there and we were laughing at all the goth people who kept on giving us evil stares.

Of the Friarsgate books, I have read the first, second and fourth. The second leaving me a bit dissapointed, but this books rocks. A wonderful story of a young girl comming into her own and the men who love her. The addition of her cousin Tom Cambridge adds not only levity, but a family for the heroin. Very nicely written. I didn't want to put it down. Keep them comming Ms. Small. An avid reader and fan!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I hate to say it, but this book was a huge disappointment to me. I always look forward to anything new from Ms. Small and I was excited to start reading this one. A few pages into it and I could tell that this was going to be a big yawn. I find myself actually skipping pages of the book just to reach the end. I hope that her next book can recapture some of the magic that was in her previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose Queen Is She?","review":"I am so tired of reading that Bertrice Small is the \\"Queen of Romance\\" that I could puke.

I greatly enjoyed Skye O'Malley. This book was right up their with Skye O'Malley. Once again we have a strong willed heroine. She attracts the eyes of the King of England as well as a few other men in the novel. I enjoyed reading the history and couldn't wait to read what would happen next to Rosamund. I was also extremely happy with the character of her second husband. He saw her nasty uncle for what he was and helped shape Rosamund into the fiery determined lady that she became. BRAVO!!I also loved the character of her cousin Thomas Bolton. He added alot of humor to the book. The only thing that I grew tired of was the constant explanation of the food. I got tired of reading about capons and rabbit meat.I cannot wait to read the second installment in this new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better than her last few books","review":"This is still no Kadin or Skye O'Malley but at least this book is a little better than her last few. Same formula...young heiress finds true love, said true love dies, heiress goes to court shags a King, goes home takes a lover. The most exciting part of this book was the last few pages when the Scots man comes after Rosamund...but then you get put off until the next book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired out","review":"There is nothing new under the sun with Bertice Small. Maybe her sex scenes are a little less spicy than in her past work, but that's about it. This book is like a weak repeat of Bertice Small's past work.I really disliked the ending - I don't like the fact that there's going to be a sequel to ROSAMUND hitting me on the head! I presume Logan Hepburn will be the hero of the second installment, which is nice, but do I want to buy the second installment?? Not if it reads like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to the standard of her other books","review":"I have read most of Ms Small's books, starting from Skye O'Malley and the whole saga, Skye's legacy and the others too. \\"Rosamund\\" is more like a fanciful bit of English history book, where much of what is written there were mentioned in her other books too. Quite boring compared to her other books, and quite predictable. Now there's supposed to be two more of these? I can only hope them to be more spicy and saucy with an element of surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not too spectacular","review":"John William's lesser known score is interesting, but it doesn't have the same quality as some of his later compositions. His main title is wonderful, it seems almost like a homage to Bernard Hermann. For Gillian is also nice and playful. However, most of the other tracks are uneven. They simply don't contain any memorable material. Also, the music isn't all too scary, despite it being made for a horror/thriller. Some fans may also be turned off by some of the 70's synthesizer incorperations. I recommend that you see this movie to evaluate his score, before purchasing. You never know, it may be what you have been looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first album","review":".After all these years, this is still one of my favourite Fogelberg albums. It has a nice freshness to it, and a delicacy that's lacking later on. It's neatly produced too, better in fact, than many of his later albums, and packed with memorable, rather melancholy tunes. Odd that he should make this sound so melancholy at the tender age of twenty one.The quality of the songs is obvious, and now Alison Krauss has recorded a new version of \\"Stars\\", this album rears its head once again for a bit of recognition, fully deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG CD....CD IS NOT AS DESCRIBED!!","review":"BEWARE BUYERS...THIS IS NOT THE JAPANESE PRESSING issue.

It's a beautiful song about not wanting to wake up. \\"It's going to be a day, there is really no way to say no to the morning.\\" Unfortunately, the cd doesn't seem to do justice to any of Dan's work.

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. I do recommend II over I simply because the tanks it features seem to me a more feasible size for someone just getting started, or someone short on space. The fact is that, while the small tanks in Book II are gorgeous, they can't compare with the larger aquaqscapes in Book I. So, if you only get one Nature Aquarium World book, get Book I.

Morphine have a style of their own, that\`s undeniable, yet this release is too depressing, tiresome and unengaging. The peculiar use of sax in their songs is one of the band\`s trademarks, still I think they overuse it and the result ends up being repetitive and forgettable. \\"Yes\\" combines indie rock, blues, lo-fi and jazz in a somewhat innovative way, Mark Sandman\`s voice is interesting and strong and the band is professional, yet this album is average as a whole. The filler songs outweight the good moments, delivering an uneven record.Not the best around."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing","review":"After hearing the song \\"Hanging on the Curtain,\\" I decided to check out this band that I had never heard of.

Start with the quintessential ingredients: words and music. They are there in spades, poetry and musicianship. They also complement each other; nothing disjointed here.

In other words, it should have read \\"For anyone else who wants his written communications to be more powerful and professional.\\" If you don't like to use he because of political correctness, you can always say anyone else who wants his or her.

My only complaint, if I could call it such, is that the chairs are quite tall when folded, making a choice for storage space a bit of a problem, but considering how amazing they are to sit on, I can give them a 5-star rating with no problem!

I notice the seats are getting stained from the rain, etc. I have not scrubbed them but I'm pretty sure some of it is not coming out. But what I find most troubling is ants. Apparently there are small openings in the seat and an ant colony has taken up residence. They use the seat as their patio and the inside as their colony home.

And come to think of it, hers is not a singular voice---it is an amalgam of voices, distinct, ever-changing but never conflicting. This song is a perfect ballad for her. The lyrics and music are heartwarming yet powerful. The reviewer from Hawthorne, NJ hit the mark! No one can describe it better than s/he did.I haven't heard the song played on the air, however. Am I in the wrong city or tuned in to the wrong stations? Pop/Top 40 radio stations, deejays, hello!???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Alert","review":"This is easily the most forgettable song in Donna Summer's musical catalog. In a career full of high peaks and low valleys, you would think the singer would have learned a thing or two about selecting her material. Unfortunately, the cliched lyrics and overblown style in which the song is rendered leaves little to admire.

As I finished up the last few drops from my plastic bottle..I almost cried. There is nothing at all wrong with my tap drinking water, why I have believed this bottled \\"poison\\" is better for me?I see the beautiful Butterfly fish, swimming in their ocean home and OUR plastic water bottle floating by.It makes my heart hurt.

Amazon made things right so I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome documentary!","review":"Before my husband and I watched this movie, we never thought twice about buying a bottle of water. We recycle, but many people don't and it's alarming how much of that plastic gets into our tap water supply, lakes, rivers and streams and of course the oceans. The fish bite them and pieces get stuck in their mouth or intestines and they end up dying. And for the smaller pieces that don't kill the fish, well what happens when we catch and eat them? I don't want that toxic plastic in my body. Plastic takes over 20 years or long to bio-degrade. A real eye opener for those who don't care about the enviroment and the rest of us that do."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"this opened my eyes to what goes on, with are life source WATER and how big companies are putting our planet at risk,SHAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to get off the Bottle!!","review":"This film needs to spread in a fast and viral way in order for a change to occur!! I was astounded at so many huge nuggets of information contained here - not only the price of bottled water being more expensive than the cost of gasoline - but what major bottling companies are doing around our country to small rural towns by depleting their water supply. Taking free water from the ground or the tap, bottling it in toxic plastic products that have proven records of containing cancer inducing agents and charging more for this than gasoline - just blows me away.Water is FREE people - it is our gift from the planet as a natural resource. Let's not harm ourselves, our kids, our neighbors or our planet any longer. Share this film with everyone you know - I just saw it in the tiny town I live in and really am inspired to help it become more widely available so we can clean up our oceans, landfills and save money in our pockets moving forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tapped Up","review":"Saw this at a film festival and immediately bought it. It changed my life. I have not purchased or drunk out of a plastic water bottle since.The movie covers the subject more thoroughly than others--from who is stealing our water to the quality and safety of the water we are BUYING in plastic bottles, and the pollution. I showed it to the local high school and they removed their water bottle vending machines. I have ordered 2 more to pass around to friends. Well worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly eye-opening","review":"I thought I knew everything they were going to tell me when I started this movie, and it turns out I couldn't have been more wrong.

I hate the three to four years between his normal albums.Thanks Chris...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I debated whether or not to review this album because after all it's just a CD, but if you don't have extra cash - go for something else. I love Chris Isaak's music, but this album has non of the qualitites that make him special. His covers of Christmas standards are lifeless with none of the guitar playing or vocalese that he's known for. On the few songs where he does incorporate the pathos he's know for, he quickly crosses the line between singing the blues and singing dirges. If you want something that truely celebrates Christmas, try Brian Setzer. You cannot go wrong with a rockabilly renditionof the Nutcracker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Surprise!","review":"People Magazine rated this Christmas CD 3 1/2 stars so I ran out and picked it up. I was pleasantly surprised by the easy blend of music and voice. A little bit country, a little bit rockabilly, a little bit traditional with a dash of cajun and easy listening coolness that will make this disk one of my favorites for the holidays. I urge anyone to buy this pleasant surprise turned out by Chris Isaak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Yet!","review":"This is the best Christmas album I have heard so far in a very long time. The range of songs will delight many from old to young. His original songs are incrediable and capture the essence of the season. This is one cd you should not miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so different from modern christmas albums","review":"Chris Isaak is unique. I love his style but when I was given this album as a present by someone who had fallen in love with it, I was incredulous. I'm a Bing-and-Frank girl at the holidays (even though I'm pretty young!) so I thought it wasn't my style. It is fantastic. Every song is good but my two favorites are his rendition of Pretty Paper and a song he penned himself, Brightest Star. The latter song is actually about Christ(!). It is sweet and beautiful and has become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Christmas CD....Highly Recommended","review":"This is an instant classic. Some of the best renditions of the classics we all know and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is one of the best I've heard by any artist. Add this to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas album ever... period!","review":"Like many people, I usually cringe when I have to listen to almost any \\"Christmas Album\\"... especially those put out by mainstream artists. However, this effort from Chris Isaak has changed that in an insant! Not only are many of his versions of the classics the best I've ever heard, the 5 originals he penned for this release are astoundingly good! My only regret is that I didn't know about this release before Christmas. However, this is so good that I can imagine listening & enjoying it well after the holiday season is over. As for the person who gave this CD 1 star, I can only think of a couple of possible explanations: 1) They had a little bit too much eggnog, 2) They hate Chris Isaak because he stole their gf/bf at one of his concert, 3) It was meant as a joke. Seriously, comparing Stevie Nix voice favorably to Isaak's? Come on... you must be joking:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas Isaak style!","review":"I bought this album to add to my growing collection of Chris Isaak CDs. It was September, so it was a little early for Christmas music - or so I thought. I am enjoying the album so much it is Christmas in October! I love Chris's treatment of the old Christmas standards (Blue Christmas and Pretty Paper are awesome), and love his original stuff even more. Washington Square is hauntingly beautiful, and my favorite is Christmas on TV -it's a rockabilly hoot! This is a must have for Chris Isaak fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended indeed","review":"I love this cd and listen to it out of season too.!

Times were changing and tastes in morality and music were in a state of flux. Whereas the official James Bond film series stayed mainstream, CASINO ROYALE definitely seemed like an entry in the pop culture of those times and this album really captures that madcap nature right in the midst of all those goings-on. You can listen to this CD and find that this is where it still happens. \\"The Look of Love\\" is so poetically erotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic --been looking for this for years","review":"This movie has always been one of my favorites!

A pleasant \\"blast from the past\\" listen to all the various Burt Bacharach themes. Like all soundtracks, some cuts are gems (\\"Casino Roayle Theme\\", \\"Flying Saucer\\"), others are just Ok (\\"Torture of the Mind\\", etc.). Let's face it - if you love the movie, you'll love the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Soundtrack Album","review":"It's Burt Bacharach and Herb Albert! Good quality recording. Gave it a 4 ONLY because was VERY disappointed that did not include the ending credits song with singing. Had to down load that song separately from iTunes. I'd say the album is worth the $14.99 paid. Maybe worth the $30.00 some are selling it it for IF you have the massively disposable income. IN no way is it worth the $50.00 to $99.00 I saw also offered. UNLESS you have a family member dying and their final wish is to listen to that album just one...last...time. In that case and only that case is it worth the higher price.

Proficient, yes; able to play a guitar solo, yes; able to put even the most insomniac music fan to sleep -- unfortunately, yes.

Alice hates New Zealand, and more, she has a stepfather. She struggles to find out who her true father was, for she looks like Len,her stepfather, but how can that be? Her mother claims that her father was killed during the war, but why had she never met her father's parents? Mrs.Fairchild then says, \\"It's a wise father that knows his own child,\\" and Alice has to find out who her father was, and, more importantly, who she is. I loved this book because it offers wonderful insight into a girl's struggles to grasp a situation that's out of her control and find out who she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"good music--CDRom doesn't play","review":"As a fan of early PF (pre-Dark Side, and most definitely, pre-The Wall), I was excited to find this CD/CD-Rom. The music was great -- a nice illustration of the talents of Sid Barrett before illness derailed his career. However, the CD-Rom has no way to start without a command to download QuickTime 3.0. I already had a more advanced version, but had no choice but to download 3.0. After restarting the CD-Rom, I simply got another message to download QuickTime 3.0, with no way to play the CD-Rom.

This particular double cd is comprised mainly of their classics rerecorded in 1999. Plus 4 tracks from a rare 1994 ep. I was hooked from the opening medley throught the end. Steve Knightley's passionate singing will draw you in. And Phil Beer's multi-instrumental wizardry will amaze you.

My daughter (14 yrs)used this for about two weeks for softball practice. The top of the tee that holds the ball cracked and eventually fell off. We have been using the remaining part of the tube to support the ball after I trimmed it with a knife and supported it with some heavy duty duct tape. I'll have to purchase a new one soon. The return on this item is such that it will cost me to return it and I don't want a replacement. Overall the tee appeared to be a good design, the base is well weighted, but the rubber just isn't durable. If you have a small child just starting out this might be ok, but I think I'd try another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Overview","review":"Micale's and Lerner's anthology of essays on the historical development of the concept of trauma in the modern age is a superb addition to the literature. Beginning with the editors' introduction and throughout all of the individual pieces in the book, the authors display a command of the field and a depth of knowledge about trauma in history that is hard to find anywhere else. The essays are exceptionally well written, and cover an interesting array of subjects, from more traditional histories of \\"shell shock\\" as a precursor to traumatic psychological injury to the less frequently examined historical origins of the concept of sexual trauma. Despite the expense of the volume, it is well worth adding to the shelf for anyone (academics, professionals, and lay reader alike) interested in understanding the historical underpinnings of the burgeoning field of trauma studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Family Values Epic","review":"In the fine tradition of Chinese movies, lost on US film-makers, is \\"The Road Home.\\" Tender, endearing, moving, filled with hope, sorrow, and togetherness the film is crafted to depict life's passage and future. Yet, for all of this, how can you argue with the added value of China's most outstanding young female star today in Zhang Ziyi? Painstaking attention to the finest details and most poignant Mandarin Chinese dialog.

Don't bother renting, just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shining Star Emerges","review":"For generations, filmgoers have used the phrase \\"Betty Davis Eyes\\" to describe the ineluctable power that a charismatic actress can wield over an audience. With this film, we have seen the launching of the phenomenon that will one day be call \\"Zhang Zi Yi Eyes.\\" With a vividness reminiscent of Deborah Winger in \\"Terms of Endearment\\" Zhang embodies all the hopes, yearnings and passion that young village girls have learned not to express openly. She can say it only with her eyes, and she does. This is a simple tale, but one that holds the viewer, because it talks of things that are most vital -- literally the future of two people whose love for each other never wavers, and whose belief in their future binds them tightly. The atmosphere is real, the action is genuine and the emotions are ones to which we can all relate. This was the beginning of what has become a great career and makes it abundantly clear why Zhang has become such a huge star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe bad reviews","review":"\\"Arthur Wong\\" and \\"A Customer\\" gave the movie bad reviews (one star).

Being a fan of Chinese and Japanese cinema, The road home is another masterpiece collection from Zhang yimou. Its a basic story about relationship, parent, love, stubborness, tradition and belief. The movie is in both black and white during the present and in colour during the flashback , where the bulk of the main story is. The cinematography is visually stunning depicting the forest and the steppes of northern China. The acting is superb esp. from Zhang yiyi and the rest of the cast are admirable.The love story is touching...hard to find nowadays. But what really touches me the most is when the aging mother recalls her youth and her stubborness in old age which reminds me so much of my own mother that i cried. The scene of the long, funeral march in the snowstorm is sad, haunting and touching. Musical score is ethereal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"THE ROAD HOME is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time!

When you are watching it it takes forever and there is also this 30 min. snooze of an intro he takes explaining the background for the lovestory between his parents. Goodness gracious do something! Zhang zi-yi does a great job of prancing about in her pigtails, but I too am flabbergasted as to how his parents ever fell in love. Unbelievably, they said like two words to each other before deciding they loved each other. i dont call that a great love story, I call it a 3rd grade lunch recess fling."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't fit the Sunbeam!","review":"I'm upset about the fact they have the belt labeled for the Sunbeam and it's NOT, it''s much to large and drops off.

Why wouldGund Sesame Street Cookie Monster 12\\" Plushbe bigger thanGund Sesame Street Elmo 13\\" Plushbeats me, but thats the way it is.My toddler loves this toy, I'm sure yours will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not soft","review":"I bought Ernie for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She is a huge sesame street fan and I already had the Gund Elmo, who we were very pleased with on the quality. I have to say I was a little dissapointed with Ernie. He's not as soft as Elmo and seems more like hugging a canvas material. All in all, my daughter is happy, so that is what's most important."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Bert!!!","review":"Its not easy to find a Bert doll.Ernie is everywhere,but not Bert.My son got so excited when we finally found a match for his Ernie doll!!!!The toy is made well and is easy to throw in the wash when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly as pictured, smaller than expected.","review":"When Bert arrived, my son was thrilled! Finally, his Ernie has his best friend Bert! The only issue with this Bert, which doesn't matter to my son at all is that Bert is very thin compared to what was expected. However, the quality is top notch, it's just the Bert's lanky-ness in this case makes him seem small. Also, in the picture, his mouth is closed, the Bert we got was with his mouth open (but that looks better in my opinion). Keeping these things in mind, I would purchase this again for my son as it is so hard to find a Bert in the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the bird","review":"awesome bird and my daughter enjoys the presence of this big yellow big bird yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah"},{"rating":"2","title":"So soft!","review":"This was a great addition to my cookie theme gift to my future sister-in-law. She loves cookie monster and they even wrapped the eyes in special paper to prevent scratching (I think?). Either way, she loved it when she saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Count von Count lovers!","review":"The count is my 2 year old's favorite Sesame Street character, but it is very hard to find any toys or products featuring him, so we were excited to get him this doll. He is always asking my husband and I to speak through the doll like a puppet in the count's voice and count with him. :)As expected from Gund, this is a well made toy, but it is a little expensive. Amazon actually has this doll cheaper than anywhere else I've seen it where it is more like $30. Most of the Gund Sesame Street dolls this size are about $15. Why would they charge twice as much for The Count? I understand that there is a lot of detail in this doll but TWICE AS MUCH? That being said, if you or your child love Count von Count, this is the one to splurge on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy","review":"A soft, cuddly toy that is the perfect size and likeness. Love this squishy little toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is only 9 inches tall.","review":"This Oscar the Grouch by Gund is only 9\\" tall, not 12 inches as indicated in the product description. Very disappointed, we had ordered it to use with some other puppets and it is the wrong scale so back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"oscar the grouch","review":"I love Oscar the Grouch -- He is a nice looking one, but he doesn't talk, but it's ok. My grandson loves him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice product, poor delivery","review":"This product was just what I was looking for: it's a friendly looking Big Bird, good size, and soft and plush. The problem is that it arrived from Bealls,(which I had never used before), DIRTY! It took a while to arrive, also. I won't use Bealls again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Count","review":"My granddaughter who watches the count on a DVD carried The Count around for days after I gave it to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Cookie Monster Kid","review":"This is one of the cutest stuffed toys I have ever seen and, even though the kid we are talking about is an adult, she does love cookies and thought this would be a fun reminder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bird meets expectations.","review":"Big bird arrived as descibed in excellent condition.
