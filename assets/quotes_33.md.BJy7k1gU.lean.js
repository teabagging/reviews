This project on their new record label has taken the gospel field by storm. Their unique style of quartet gospel is unbelievable. The soft yet gravely vocals of George Dean perfectly contrast the diamond sharp background vocals. Songs such as \\"Wait On The Lord\\", \\"It's Not Enough\\", and \\"It's Just A Matter of Time\\" are sure to be favorites for years to come. If you love great quartet singing this is absolutely the one for you. Lead singer George Dean is a good friend of the newest quartet sensation Lee Williams of the Spiritual Q.C.'s. Williams guest leads on the soul stirring version of \\"It's Just A Matter of Time\\". Each song is arranged perfectly making listening to this CD a joy. The smooth transition from one song to another also maintains the \\"Live\\" feel of the recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"They murdered the story!","review":"Forget the first-person-viewpoint-camera nonsense, the REAL crime here is that Steve Fisher and Robert Montgomery hacked up and destroyed one of Raymond Chandler's best novels. By wasting a vast amount of money and talent on this vile travesty, they made \\"The Lady In The Lake\\" toxic and unfilmable for years, and Chandler's story -- unlike Fisher's ghastly mangling of it -- is eminently deserving of being made into a movie. The team that did \\"L.A. Confidential\\" would be excellent candidates, and I'd really like to see someone of the caliber of Kevin Spacey as Marlowe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daring. Unique. Unwatchable.","review":"Robert Montgomery's subjective camera version of Raymond Chandler's novel, one must assume, was met with the universal consensus: \\"Well...now we all know that doesn't work.\\" With the hardworking cast addressing the camera as if it's Philip Marlowe, you feel like you're watching a 90-minute series of screen tests. The stunt would be laughable if it weren't so dull.The guys on the commentary refer to this as noir, and I hardly think so as half the movie's as MGM sun dappled as an Andy Hardy picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady in the Lake - Movie with a gimmic","review":"Lady in the Lake is a movie with a gimmick. The movie is an early experiment with virtual reality, \\"You are the detective, you see what he sees!\\" The camera acts as the main character moving around the set and talking to the other actors. The effect is similar to playing \\"Doom\\" but without the rocket launcher. I hope this idea looked better on paper then it worked in practice.Lloyd Nolan and Audry Meadows do their best as the villains but even they can't save this ultra low-budget movie.Suggestions: 1) For fun count the number of times the camera pans down to show you Robert Montgomery's hand pushing a door bell. 2) Never watch this movie after viewing \\"Murder my Sweet.\\" The let-down is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the people who liked this movie smoking?","review":"Worst. Performances. Ever. (I am including the various school plays my children performed in. In fact, there is many a six-year old Turnip in \\"Mr. Farmer's Garden\\" who could have taught Audrey Totter a thing or two about natural human behavior.)And the subjective camera? It could not have been less effective. For one (and only one . . the list of why it didn't work is much longer) thing, the angles were all much too narrow; the actual human eye sees about 15 feet more to each periphery than the \\"subjective\\" camera, which means that we didn't see anything like what \\"Marlowe\\" saw, unless he had a serious vision disorder.The only difference in quality between this and \\"PLan 9 from Outerspace\\" is the amount of money this cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must to Avoid","review":"I'm giving this film one star because I can't give it fewer -- the Amazon servers won't let me. This is possibly the worst detective film ever. My big fear is that someone unfamiliar with Film Noir and/or Raymond Chandler will see this and think that this is what it's all about. The objective camera \\"experiment\\" is fun for about 30 seconds -- long enough to realize Robert Montgomery dosen't have what it takes to play Phillip Marlowe. From there it's downhill. \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" is my favorite Chandler novel...it deserved so much better than this.If you happen to have this film and 1945's brilliant Dick Powell film \\"Murder My Sweet,\\" I'd advise you to watch \\"Murder\\" twice instead of watching them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor version of a Chandler classic","review":"This film is not anywhere near a faithful rendition of Raymond Chandler's novel. The alterations are quite gratuitous.This film becomes a run of the mill potboiler, any sensitivity, any depth are completely lost.Character personalities are butchered - especially that of Adrienne Fromsett.The weary knight in a rumpled trenchcoat, Marlowe emmerges as a smug bully.I stopped watching after about twenty minutes because I found it a waste of my time.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall show how Raymond Chandler should be filmed.Please read the book - Raymond Chandler and Philip Marlowe both deserve far better than this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"prom dress","review":"Prom DRESS Written by Larl Littke -Stephanie Lee.Prom Dresss is a very good book.

The advice is all useful, but it's not worth the price and the style is a little goofy for what I expected to be a more professional book.The technical interview questions are atrocious. As others have commented, the \\"easy\\" questions are useful (e.g. how do you indicate comments?) and some of the solutions to the \\"hard\\" questions are incorrect (e.g. they try to illustrate a common C pointer bug in correctly written code).The book just lacks content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Interview Guide","review":"This is another good book in the Job Interview series from Rampant. As with the other books, this book gives both the employer and the candidate guidance in areas such as work experience, personal appearance and education.The questions that are provided in the book give a good base for the employer to ask the candidate.

Instrumentally, I was delighted with their sound. I love the pipes, the guitar, drums, fiddle, the whole musical package. I only gave it a 4-star rating, though, because the vocals really left me wanting. I didn't find any real power or character to them and kept hoping for another, more passionate voice, more along the lines of Canada's Glengarry Bhoys or Hadrian's Wall. A very polished, self-assured sound to the music, though, will certainly compel me to buy another of their albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Wolfstone","review":"Great musicians, top notch production. This cd has a more atmospheric sound to it than their past cd's. The vocals add to the moody flavor of the sound.But make no mistake, these guys can still rock, and do on this cd.

About 1/5th into the book, two main characters meet: Bill Dunnigan and Father Paul.

Also, I can't stand how many problems some books put in the back of the chapters. 150 problems is way to many to be useful for anything.I also read the preface (or intro), and it ticked me off. Pretty much obvious scheming to make more editions that are the same as the earlier editions except useless new flashy pictures.Then there is another thing.

Fans often speak of August 93 or December of 97 as important periods in the band's evolution. December of 1995 is without a doubt one of those periods. This slice of history shows the band in wonderful form. The second disc alone features thoughtful and direct jamming with legit segues from song to song. The mix of the soundboard has a bit more crowd than I would expect, but it still is an incredibly clean recording of a fantastic show. It's obvious why the members of the band chose this show, it's everything December 1995 was all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice choices","review":"The second part of this concert has been one of the most popular recordings from the band's '95 tour since it emerged in trading circles.

This makes me think that Serena is GOSSIP GIRL since she could've wrote her admissions essay and said that she did this Gossip Girl website and that's a pretty cool thing so the colleges let her in. But really-- will Blair and Yale ever be resolved. And what about Blair and Nate? I don't see them happily ever after cuz of Blair's insecurities and controlling behavior.

While Ms. Cook's biography reveals many insights into Mrs. Roosevelt's private and public lives, certain of the author's own subjective opinions color what information is missing or has been destroyed regarding this wonderful first lady; these opinions are certainly open to debate. Overall, though, the book inspires all to pursue dreams, to grow throughout a lifetime, to change to fit the times and the needs of one's world. Eleanor's own education about living provides a basis from which to begin living life to the fullest. It is this hope and fortitude that Ms. Cook best captures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A biography that will tempt you to pursue your dreams.","review":"I just finished reading \\"Eleanor Roosevelt 1889-1934\\" by Blanche Wiesner Cooke. The book reads like a novel, with the pulse of a newborn. Cooke writes in my opinion, an honest, biography of great depth (This ain't no Kitty Kelly). A sad little girl, in a dysfunction family (sound familiar) who becomes one of the worlds most notable people,if not women. The author captures the essence of Eleanor by sharing letters and page turning relationships. You will be introduced to a cast of characters second to none and feel as though you have stepped back in time. For those of you who are native New Yorkers you will be pleased to find an abandance of NYC history along with the the people who built the city and funded it from Henry Street Settlement to private industry. This book will broaden those who lack a political mind and maybe even educate you on the way. So get yourself a pot of tea and a good light. This book is long (500pp) but oh so neccessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A renewed appreciation for the power of political activism","review":"Although I am a product of the 1960's and 1970's, I have lost sight of the importance and power of activism in our culture. I once had a passion to fight for the rights of others less privilieged or for those who can not fight for themselves. This book stirred in me a passion that I have long forgotten! How great a woman was Eleanor Roosevelt! How important her contribution to human rights and the survival of the American way! Blanche Weisen Cook has written an account of Eleanor Roosevelt that is moving, realistic and powerful. It has renewed my interest in political causes and the incredible need for activism. A must read for women of all generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Work","review":"Blanche Wieson Cook has done a wonderful job on this biography. It is informative, thorough, captivating - but most importantly, she portrays Eleanor Roosevelt not as a legend but as a complex human being with extraordinary accomplishments.

I can't wait to read Volume II!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserably bad","review":"Eleanor Roosevelt is truly a fascinating character, but this book is absolutely painful to read.

But my goodness! The level of violence was really surprising! It seemed the Tin Woodman's only role was to hack things (primarily animals) to pieces. NOT for the faint-hearted/animal lover, and definitely NOT for children. In addition, there was simply no character development, nothing that made me really care, unlike the film.

I have recently tiled my only bathroom, this was made easy with the Fluid Master, I removed the toilet several time to prep subfloor, then measure and cut tile, then the placement on grouting of tile. With the reusable Fluid Master this was done fast easy and no wax to deal with. I would have to have purchased 3 wax ring if I was using the old school way. The other remedy was that my flooring was raised with the thickness of the tiles, with the Fluid Master the self-adjusting system I didn't have to worry about raising my plumbing. (NO LEAKS) I have removed my toilet several time, and it takes minutes to remove and install. If I had more bathrooms I would use the product on all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far great luck","review":"I hate the wax rings so for the last few years I have been installing these-in my own homes-3 times.

In fact, the book should be quite accessible to high schoolers, although it helps to know a little 18th and 19th century European history. There are plenty of summaries here, so I won't waste time with that. Tolstoy makes the mistake of including too many main characters, which is the largest contributing factor to the length. There are essentially six main characters, one of these being the war. Tolstoy must divert attention to too many places and hence War and Peace is more dilluted than Anna Karennina. Anna is a better book and I would recommend that to be read before War and Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Translated this Book!","review":"Can't decide whether to purchase this book because no translator is listed.

I also then took regular peanut butter from the pantry, and put that on a plate with the Reese's. I then handed it out to 6 family members and asked them to identify what one was Reese's Peanut Butter and the Skippy. No one could tell the difference. I think either Reese's is either just scamming us to make money, or they don't want to put out the actual peanut butter in the cups, as we all would be eating that with chocolate rather than buying the cups.

All interesting lines in the plot were quickly dropped in favor of a happy, happy, ending. Gee. just like real life. I know some people like that sort of happy sweet perfect ending after no conflict, but I was so disappointed after all the good reviews. if the author could just have made the book so much as fifty more pages and actually had something happen to the characters it would be so worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"$18.00 for \\"Burn on Demand\\"?????","review":"You don't need me to tell you this 70's western featuring Lee Marvin is worth seeing, but please don't pay $18.00 for a product that should be $3.00. If the studio is too cheap to give it real release, then don't insult us with a ridiculously high price. I refuse to pay more than $5.00 for ANY movie that is \\"burn on demand\\" and won't pay more than $3.00 for something as obscure as this.The studios have been swimming in our money for years. They need to understand that they will not be receiving a steady level of profits forever and cannot bilk us at every turn every time some idiot in marketing thinks up a new way to rip us off.

But in particular, I want to talk about \\"Thunder Road.\\" If you're new to Bruce, and you've never heard this song...well, if you don't buy this CD, maybe buy the three-disc set...buy something with this song on it. I saw Bruce last summer(I'm only 25, so I wasn't around back in the day) and when he played Thunder Road, which I was so excited to belt out at the top of my lungs, I just sat in my chair with tears running down my face. It is, quite simply, the most beautiful thing in the world. That's all there is to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I Was There","review":"I wasn't even born yet when this album came out, but it reaches my soul in ways I never thought possible. I first got into Springsteen this summer after seeing him in concert in NJ, so I bought this, which is one of my favorite five CDs. \\"Thunder Road\\" is in heavy rotation in my CD player because of the driving melody and the lyrics that make me wish I had lived some other life. \\"Jungleland\\" is an experience in itself; it could stand alone as an individual album. If you have any inclination to buy any Springsteen album, this is the one. Every song strikes a chord; you want to pretend that you're some rock-n-roller slumming around in Asbury Park listening to Springsteen's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stirring rock and roll experience","review":"This is an inspiring, stirring effort by the Boss. Every song is packed with power and emotional resonance. From the adventurous \\"Thunder Road,\\" to the West Side Story like \\"Jungleland,\\" every song seems to be able to grab your heartstrings. \\"She's the One\\", the title track, \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungleland are all tremendous, but really, every moment of every song is great. This is probably the best album by the Boss, which isn't an easy decision to make because so many of them are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunnel of dreams","review":"It's very hard to pick out just one Springsteen album among all the greats.But if I had to,I would have chosen \\"Born To Run\\" Why? Because it contents everything you connect Bruce with. He get's in the car and drives down \\"Thunder Road\\" chasing his dreams,he's got his back against the wall in \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\",he steps in to the \\"Night\\",and he's hiding on the \\"Backstreets\\".He is,to put it short,\\"Born To Run\\".When you combine these lyrics with the most tender and soulful rock'n roll to date,you end up with one of the most significant albums in the history of rock'n roll.Melissa Etheridge once said that no-one can make you dream like Bruce Springsteen can.She's probably right,and I guess some of us will stay inside that tunnel of dreams forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say?","review":"Truly, what can I say? There are many reviews and I'm sure that they can say all and more of what I can. What I really have to say is that if you are a fan of Bruce from Born In The USA, be prepared. This album is very different than BITUSA. More upbeat and all. I am not telling you to not get this album. BY ALL MEANS, GET THIS YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!! But, be ready to listen to it again. It takes a while to catch (did for me anyway). When it does, though, you'll be listening to Thunder Road and Night repeatedly.

Romanticism and rock n' roll are fused and alive in this song.\\"Wendy let me in ... Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims and strap your hands 'cross my engines\\" is just one of the most eloquent verses of poetry ever uttered from a man's mouth. \\"I want to know if love is wild, babe, I want to know if love is real\\" just shows that Bruce is not a Man but a force of Nature.If one could pick the greatest rock n' roll song ever, perhaps this would be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruuuuuuuuce!","review":"This is probably my most favorite of All Things Bruce. I remember clearly when the album first came out. I loved it. I still love it. I first saw Bruce on stage in Tampa when he was just a scrawny little fellow with a lot of hair jammed under a little knit cap. He and big old Clarence blew me away. Absolutely nothing has changed since then. They have a wonderful sound and Bad Scooter has plenty of true things to say.

But daggone, \\"Born To Run\\" is one of the 10 best albums ever recorded.And that's what this site is really all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly stupendous...","review":"This is an album that can surely hold its own with any released over the past half-century, ever since rock-n-roll was in its infancy. Everything about it seems to have been said in other reviews, so I'll make this brief.There is barely a weak moment on this album, and any perceieved weakness is only in comparison to the rest of the songs on the album. The best songs on the album (Jungleland, Thunder Road, and the title track) are timeless classics (to use a tired cliche) that will be listened to for years to come, and even the weaker ones would be amongst the highlights of a lesser album.Not much else really needs to be said about this album; if you have even the slightest interest in classic rock, or rock music in general, this is a must have album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soul of Rock and Roll lives on...","review":"Two songs from this album -- Thunder Road and the title track -- have simply the best lyrics of any rock songs, ever. When sung with Springsteen's voice, they become epics that so successfully captured the yearning to escape to a new American dream while the old one was rusting away. These songs remain Springsteen's finest work today, and should be in every collection.As an aside, both Thunder Road and Born to Run were actually taught as part of my college Poetry textbook. They more than held their own against Sylvia Plath, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect rock album!","review":"This is it, the best rock album in the world. Every song is a classic. There's so much atmosphere in these songs that it's unbelievable. I first heard this album a few years ago, when I was in my early twenties and trying to find out where I should go with my life.This album is for any guy who's idea of heaven is a cold beer, a great girl, and a the need to get away. It's absolutely perfect.Highly Recommened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Never was a big Springsteen fan, never will be. He can't sing, his music is boring.

Sorry Bruce, no sympathy here, and don't see the big rave on the 30th aniversary edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failing the test of time?","review":"Time can be a cruel mistress, indeed. Lyrically, these cuts remain vital. I'm not sure the same can be said for \\"the wall of sound\\" music, however. \\"Best Rock Album of All Time\\"? In its day, perhaps, but that day has passed. Though not nearly as highly praised, Springsteen's \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" will, I believe, provide a more lasting legacy of his undeniable talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal","review":"I have been amazed by Bruce Springsteen's popularity ever since I purchased this album amidst all of the hype that swirled around him. Let's critique Bruce and the E. Street band:Has anyone ever heard Steve Van Zandt's guitar? I love him in the Soprano's and his cool radio gig, but he might as well not even plug in. The whole band sounds like Meat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell. Overproduced, mini operas tied together by a piano. The big man plays the same solo over and over. Bruce's voice is not what I would call a pretty thing to listen to either. Very limited vocal range. He screams more than he sings. I must be in the minority, but this sounds to me like corporate rock at its worst, heck, I would much rather listen to Southside Johnny or even Bon Jovi over this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really a big album?","review":"I decided to venture beyond the artists I usually listen to (U2, Nicki Minage, alternative, etc.) So I picked up Born to Run thinking that this was a slice of true americana that certainly would not disappoint. I was wrong. This album was literally hurtful to my ears. I put it on in the car and my wife immediately turned it down and said \\"who the hell is this?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand what the commotion is about","review":"Seriously, people, if you really gave this album five stars, you need to sit down with your therapist. I mean, Bruce was a Democrat and all, but his music was pretty cliched and trite. Simple minded music for simple minded people. To tell the truth, \\"Born to Run\\" is even worse than \\"Born in the USA.\\" For REAL music, get the latest by Madonna: her sensational \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Springsteen at his best","review":"I had heard the song \\"Born To Run\\" for the first time ,after buying the greatest hits album of the boss ,a year ago. Instantly, I realized it was one of the best I've ever listened to. It kept playing in my head for days, so I decided I'd better go and buy the whole \\"ancient\\" album.And so I did. Ever since ,this is one of my all times favorites CDs. I listen to the songs as often as once a week ,not wanting to really stop. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to get to know a great performer, composer and writer.All of my matured years I've yearned to discover new superb songs and singers . My revelation of Bruce Springsteen music is one of my best self-discoveries yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-around awesome album","review":"This album is so good that the only bad review of it didn't even mention the music - it just blasted Springsteen for his politics. There is not a weak song on this album - every song is great. This CD is a must-have not only for Springsteen fans but for anyone who likes music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that saved the world from disco","review":"One of if not the best albums of all times. If not for Bruce Springsteen and his Born to Run album we would be living in a world full of bell bottoms and retarded music. Springsteen single handedly grabed disco by the neck and crushed it into nothing with a little help from the E Street Band. Right from the start of the album it is a rollercoaster ride full of love, dreams, broken hearts, faith, and taking chances. The incrediable Thunder Road all the way to the electrifing end of Jungle Land. Any music fan that doesn't own this album is not a music fan in my opinion, a collection without Born To Run just isn't a collection. Don't you run back inside darling, run out and by this album and if you already have it go out and buy it on record or just go buy one for your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Rock Album, Period","review":"\\"Tryin' to learn to walk like the heros We thought we had to be...\\"This album captures all the best rock has to offer -- joy, escape, longing, loss, redemption.

As I did I asked myself if indeed it DID still stand the test of time, or as our friend in Winnipeg suggested, is it \\"failing the test of time?\\"My conclusion is a simple, but profound YES! This CD STILL kicks a**!And yes, it IS the best rock record ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I don't really have much to add on to what has already been said about this album. I'm just gonna re-confirm it. Yes, it's one of the greatest albums of all-tim. Yes, the poetry is unreal. Bruce Springsteen's skills to tell stories is also unreal. The drumming and keyboarding is less showboaty here than in the previous albums. More evident in this album than the other previous ones, Springsteen also really flexes his romantic poetry muscles. This album rules. The album cover rules (except Clarence Clemons on the sax is cut out). I have it as my desktop wallpaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The single best Rock album ever!","review":"I bought this CD a couple of years ago when i was in my last year of high school and as i put it on after a long hard day and lay on the floor, I realized that this single album was probably going to be the greatest rock album that I would ever listen to. It had Everything! I love Jungleland, i think it's insane to make a record like that..and Born to Run brings out all the adrenalin in you, Thunderoads is a teenage highway classic and Meeting across the river reflects his sad poignant, while slightly jazzy overtones... A classic all in all. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album- But New Release Out","review":"Don't buy this unless you are cheap or are not a big Brice fan. Buy the more expensive remastered box set instead.

I love the bigger than life styles, the way moves flow from panel to panel and the artwork in general. From a looks perspective, this comic doesn't disappoint. However, the storyline is truly wretched. Kung fu comics don't have the deepest plots, but even no plot would be worse than this BAD plot. The writing is awful, there are huge plot holes and the characters have the maturity of 3 year olds. If you want to read a much better comic, read The Storm Riders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky and pointless!","review":"This movie was barely above atrocious. The movie is based on a play by Christopher Marlowe. The play, Edward II, is very good! This movie does not do it justice. It is very tacky and poorly made. The first thing a viewer is forced to watch is an unnecessary love scene between two men. The movie itself is not set in any one time period. It is confusing to try and figure out where the characters are, or when they are. The acting is terrible as well. It is more like a soap opera then a movie based on a great literary accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp lcd tv","review":"The picture is clear with no distortion when viewed head-on.

Mark Doll and company have written one of the few books that make the case for establishing true security procedures as part of a bottom line business strategy. This is not a book about what might happen, it's a book about what IS happening right now and what business leaders need to do to prepare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A second great release/cd","review":"As a musician myself, I've heard a lot of grunge/alternative pop bands and these guys really stick out in a good way. There are few bands that have great melodic lines as Athenaeum does; their vocals are also unique for a band in their category. I've seen reviews stating the tunes on this cd are too simple; this is only half true. All popular music is somewhat simple, but this band is so unique they've created their own niche in the music industry whether anyone realizes it or not. After hearing \\"What I Didn't Know\\" (from Radiance) for the first time, I could see the writing potential of this band. I still don't understand why they don't get more airplay in the Pittsburgh area; they are more deserving of it. This new cd is not disappointing but is a great response to the first. It is somewhat different than the first cd, which is a good quality in today's music scene. I'm definitely looking forward to a third cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Good Songs, Couple Lacking","review":"Having followed the guys since I was in high school in North Carolina, I'm always excited about a new Athenaeum album.This one's good songs are very good. \\"Frozen in Time,\\" \\"Plurabelle,\\" and \\"Comfort\\" are excellent, catchy radio songs and it amazes me that it hasn't seen more airplay.Some of the other songs lack, though, and that's what keeps it from being a 5.Hopefully they get another shot at a major label release. I really think they're right there and ready to make \\"the leap.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong cover","review":"Anyone is wants to review their sophomore album is looking in the wrong place. This is their 1995 indie label debut that is long out of print. The cover is green with orange type. It contains many of Radiance's tracks in their early infancy, back when they were only 3 members strong. A definite must have if you can find it. A highlight being an early version of \\"Away\\" with different fretwork in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album surprisingly....SUCKS","review":"I absolutely loved RADIANCE, and picked up the latest album the morning it came out. I figured after three years they would have come up with something pretty rocking. As it turns out this is the most bland album I have ever heard. There is not a single song I wanted to listen to again aside from the radio-release \\"Comfort.\\"Gone is the rock-edge of their previous effort, and it has been overtaken by constant bluthering of the lead singer's voice, which gets old. Also, the lyrics on this album need some serious work.All in all, a very disappointing effort from a band that desperately needed a good album to get them recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd i have","review":"athenaeum is like the best band i have heard in a long timethere lyrics are just amazing and vocals are wonderfuli got alot of ppl to buy this cd and they where not disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blowed away","review":"I picked this book up because it was part of a summer reading program and did not know what to expect. Surprise, I could not put it down. Thru books and movies we sometimes see the actions of the criminally insane but this story shows what is going on inside the mind. The thought precedes the deed, and what a tangeled web of thought does this Spider weave. A dark dirty spiral into total distortion."},{"rating":"1","title":"'To be awake is to be available to torment' -McGrath.","review":"The quote above accurately reflects my feelings about this book, for McGrath put me to sleep on more than one occasion.I can't decide which was worse: the listless, rambling descriptions (often of the most trivial details) or the dialogue, which came like bread heels -- stale and far apart. The miserable tedium of the entire novel can be avoided by reading the succinct little synopsis on the back cover: boy kills mother by mistake, blames father, is institutionalized, and becomes ever more delusional; this summary literally explains it all, and its brevity is highly preferable to the novel itself.A completely unremarkable and maddeningly pointless foray into ... madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"It really is the best of their music. Made for a great stucking stuffer under $10. We love their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of this CD. I am a big collector of Greatest Hits and adding this one to my collection is just a bonus especially if you enjoy the 90's alternative rock genre.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD...A must Buy!","review":"Collective Soul has put out amazing songs, but most of them are not recognized to people that do not follow the band. This album is a great compilation of their hits and saved me the time of burning a cd of their greatest hits for myself. The only flaw to this cd is the fact that there is only 13 songs. Obviously, collective soul used a great deal of thought to which songs to put in but i think that it would've been better off if there were about 16-17 songs rather than 13. But its an excellent cd and i definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good, but could have been better","review":"Before I begin, I must say I am a HUGE CS fan. I love every one of their cds and usually have all of them in my stereos at any given time. I was very excited for the greatest hits cd and, essentially, I am happy with it. I really enjoy the new songs Energy and Homecoming because they go back to the guitar rock CS is so great at. While I am not surprised to see Heavy, Run, Shine, Precious Declaration, The world I know and December, I was very surprised to see Forgiveness and Listen make the cut. I find CS has so many better hits that I think outshine those two songs. The saving grace for this cd is the inclusion of She Said which is my absolute favorite song and I got so sick of having to forward to it as a hidden track on Dosage. I really would like to have the original version, however. Anyhow, I give it 4 stars because afterall it is CS and I couldn't give the band anything less. I just think they overlooked a few other songs that should have been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection","review":"This is a nice collection of songs.

Lucky for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got the 7even Year Itch","review":"Collective Soul's Greatest Hits CD, 7even Year Itch, is an album I recommend to everyone. It is an album full of energy. The songs are packed full of guitar solos and the lyrics fit well with the music.The album includes classic songs such as, December, Gel, The World I Know, and Run. There are also a few songs that aren't on there other albums that I like as well. Why Pt. 2 is my favorite on the album, mostly because of how well the guitar is played throughout the song. Forgiveness is another great song on the album that isn't on any others and it shows a little softer side of Collective Soul's talent.I believe this album has a variety of songs, from pretty heavy rock songs to mellow-sounding ones. I suggest you check this album out. It is a great album that almost everyone is bound to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better greatest hits albums","review":"I have gotten several \\"hits\\" albums that I found less than impressive.

The 2 new songs \\"Energy\\" and \\"Next Homecoming\\" are great hard rock songs! This is the CD to be released before the recent departure of lead guitarist Ross Childress. I am a bit disappointed in the choice of songs on this CD. \\"Forgiveness\\" should have been replaced by an actual hit of theirs \\"Where The River Flows\\". But overall, the CD has a good flow, and will be in my CD changer for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS...","review":"I gave this album 5 stars, becuase all of the songs on it are amazing! But don't waste your money on this, instead, buy every Collective Soul album. That way, you won't miss out on their other great songs that aren't on this CD. The two new tracks are great. But if this is the only Collective Soul CD you buy, you're missing out on a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"collective soul, best of","review":"I listened to this cd once and put it away. It did not have the songs/music on it that I had hoped and the songs were boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had only heard one song by CS and really liked it, December. There is nothing even close to the sound and feel of that song on the rest of this boring album. I don't understand what anybody is raving about if this is the best CS can produce. To those expecting adult/progressive/alternative: forget it! This is pure made-for-the-masses commercial junk food. Give me chance to unload this turkey to someone that can appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collective Soul=Under-rated","review":"Most people don't think of Collective Soul when they think of great rock bands during the last 7 years. But unlike most bands who toss you a new album every three years, Collective Soul cranks out the music early and often. This collection does the band justice and yet doesn't at the same time. Some of the selections are odd, such as She Said, which is actually a hidden track on an earlier album. Plus, the songs don't seem to contain the same volume. Shine, taken from their first album, is recorded much lower than the other songs on the disc. You would think they would go back and correct that, but they didn't.Aside from that, the two new songs on the album are flat-out good. Overall, Colective Soul fans should pick up this album even if it's just for the new songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dramas at the hospital...","review":"All of us have passed through the medical system at one point or another.

The Man With the Guitar mix is horrible. None of the remixes like the PSB(PetShopBoys) remix & Paul Oakenfold remix have any diva house, big room, progressive/trance, circuit, disco modern,or peak hour sound. Just terrible. All the remixes are under 7 minutes. The PSB & Paul Oakenfold are really just dubs that sound like an early AM club mix. Something a club would play at 6 am in the morning while people r coming down from drugs. The Paul Oakenfold is very repetitious with \\"i heard it all before\\" vocals throughout with hardly any verses song or chorus song. I have to say the album version Sorry is by far the best track on this maxi single. This single doesn't have the Let it Be Here remix Vocal Edit like on the 2track import single of Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dumbkuff of a whopper should fall off a gondola and drown","review":"Is it me or is Madonut, the dumbkuff whopper from Italy who defected to Enga...the UK, trapped in 1979.

I needed it to cover my wheel as the bottom was rubbing away so this not only protects my wheel but it also looks nice. The original wheel/ interior is grey, so this doesn't clash much. The yellow bow-ties clash a little, but they make sense.I would've given this five stars if it weren't for fit and build quality. The fit was pretty tight, but I imagine that's normal of all wheel covers. On the positive side it does grip the wheel very well so I'm not worried about my grip on the wheel. The build quality was fine, but there were a couple of loose threads and it didn't feel as if there was much care in where the stitching ended up. Still a good quality product, just not 5-star worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevy Vortec Wheel Cover","review":"Great Product, Protects the Steering Wheel finish, took some getting used to, I like the feel.

It's much too silly due to the insanely bad acting, ridiculous music and Chuck's very annoying street sidekick.The demon was well over the top, especially with the weird-looking eyes. The only thing I can remember him by are his long nails, which look like goat hooves and are rather nasty.But if you want to see Chuck Norris kick some a** - even if it doesn't work too well on a demon that never injures - then watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in Hellraiser series, but no extra scenes","review":"For those of you looking for the \\"Kirsty's room scene\\" and the \\"surgery room scene,\\" do not buy this video.

Esp his goofy eyes, and at one point i thought his contacts were in wrong. He looked retarded. Chuck's sidekick was an annoying black guy, who constantly complained bout food and the heat. I give this 2 stars. It was watchable, but neame in a bad guy role? Watch his macgyver roles and youll see what I mean. Besides, norris owned him.

The end result after listening to this CD release 3 times is these two guys are talented and make a supreme combination. Their belief in God shines through the lyrics that they both penned. Their love of God is heard through their music. These two lads are talented and it is a pleasure to listen to this CD. This is not mindless sounds but beautiful chemistry.I enjoyed the songs of 'Give It All Away', When I Open My Eyes', 'Broken World' and 'Persistance'. But all the songs are good and the messages are about our relationship with God and how he loves us and comes to us in need. Beautiful album indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Amazing CD. They definitely put their emotions into this song and said the words I've wanted to say for a long time.

This is totally incorrect. The first one, \\"Grinding Into Emptiness\\" was a pairing of members of FLA and Klinik (from Belgium) on Chicago's legendary Wax Trax label and much more minimalist and experimental in tone, and my own favourite is still \\"Response Frequency,\\" which never got a domestic release and has a very sinister element to it.

No but i can compare it with My chemical romances latest one the black parade,not the gretest album but will keep you listening for at least about halve a year. Now my favorite song onthe record has to be My World becuase of the strong Vocals and some amazing Guitar. The drums through out are strong and the bass is powerful.

I can't even comment on a few songs because all of the songs sound the same. The music is the same and every song is about partying. People give the bubblegum popsters crap about not having meaningful songs and yet they praise bands like the Donnas? That's ridiculous. And I saw the Donnas perform on Saturday Night Live, and they were twice as boring. Brett Anderson (lead singer) doesn't sound that great live. Her voice is bland and uninspired.You should only get this CD if you want mindless background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN\\"T SOUND LIKE THE DONNAS! MORE LIKE HOLE.","review":"Gone are the catchy clap along type songs blasting boys and being out of money or haveing a curfew , this album is the worst album released this year. I love the Donnas and the first 4 cds are worth going out of your way to buy. This is horrible and it sounds like Hole. Hole is great at being Hole. The Donnas are good being The Donnas. If it wasn't broke they shouldn't have fixed it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH","review":"I bought a couple of The Donnas CDs and I deeply regret it. The musicianship is incredibly poor and the vocals are the same on each song and on each CD: monotone. It's almost like the singer is reading the lyrics. I guess I'm spoiled, having been exposed to women with true vocal ability; women that front bands like Elis, Dreamside, The Cranberries, Concrete Blonde. As a female singer/musician myself it is painful to listen to this band. I hoped their musicianship and vocal stamina/range would improve or evolve from one CD to the next but sadly I was disappointed. Their music is devoid of riffs and hooks. Even for \\"punk\\" the delivery is high school level at best. If you want good punk or alt, buy Hole's CDs. (Courtney can at least play and sing.)It makes me sad because with a little effort, The Donnas could probably evolve into a great all girl band. IF THEY WANTED TO. I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leez!!!","review":"This is an obvious ... 80's big hair rock but worse, if that's possible.

I also considered all this album has to offer: Donna A.'s low voice, the lyrics, and the guitar playing. You can certainly tell Donna A.'s voice apart from the new female singers. Also, the Donnas bash while having fun. It's refreshing when so many lyrics on albums are Alanis-like bitter or wallowing in pity. Finally, the guitar playing is very intense. So, only one star was subtracted for the sameness. Definitely spend some nights with The Donnas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk's Princesses showoff","review":"The Donnas new album is not only well written and well played. The new album is fun as hell, the kind of album you could put in at a party and keep everyone happy. From the new single Take it off you can only get a little bit of The Donnas freedom of life. Do yourself a favor and buy the album and you won't regret it. Full of awesome punk riffs and kickin drums this album is as exciting as their last ones. The Donnas definitely came to put their name on the top of the girl punk list where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I don't know what that one guy's talking about....I'm listening to it on my computer's Cd drive right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnas spend the night","review":"This is one of their best albums ever! if you have never heard the donnas, i am telling you to get this cd! they are the best band ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love the Donnas","review":"For 4 years, I've been waiting for the day I'd see a Donnas video playing on MTV. The first time I saw \\"Take It Off\\" I couldn't believe it. I ran out and bought Spend the Night and listened to it nonstop for about a week. I'm still listening to it, and I'm still not bored with it. The Donnas, plainly put, rock. They're the best girl rock band of our time, and they certainly are better the most guys out there. From Donna R.'s mind-blowing guitar solos to Donna A.'s belting voice, I was not let down at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good cd","review":"its a great CD.

As a 30 year old, it takes alot to get me excited musically now. The Donnas at first accomplished that. Not only by thier swagger, but in your face rockin' style. That was at first. I also loved to see women rock.After having the record for six months. A few observations.- great style, although lack of diversity and depth is glaring. Really really hurts the record.- songs almost all the same tempo- the sexual themes get boring after awhileSo after having alot of excitement at first now this disc is resigned to my CD carousel. I haven't played it in two months.Seems they have become the MTV darlings which isn't such a great thing. Music industry hype has grated on me since the days of Nirvana.Overall, interesting band. However, time has revealed Spend The Night to not be as exciting as I once thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is copy-protected.","review":"I'm a Donnas fan, and like this album quite a bit, but was disappointed that the audio CD is copy-protected. The back cover of the CD case includes a small \\"cp\\" logo, along with a very small \\"copy protected\\" caption. The CD would not load at all in my iMac running OS 10.2. Great music, but caveat emptor. I think Atlantic did them a disservice by doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to it!","review":"This album really truely rocks.

With a classic sound of rock like audiovent, and a \\"girl\\" version to song writing such as Blink 182 (& even Weezer), I was so glad I bought this CD.Further more, the song writing is not all that serious, however just like any other music fan, I became to appreciate rock such as that. Such as parts: \\"You we're hot til you took off your shirt\\" or \\"she doesn't look like she's much fun\\". It's just \\"fun\\" rock, that's the only word I can find within this moment.So main review, this CD rocks, it's just non-stop rock in addition with KILLER gutair solo's. And singing with attitude.

I was bored with no other music so I've tried to listen through the CD several times, and I have.This is low quality music. I give it 2 stars because one or two of the songs are ok, but the rest makes me think that the donnas are only popular because they are 4 women, and that's fairly novel. Musically they are incredibly monotonous, and not very skilled. Almost to a one, all of their songs sound the same. Here is the basic recipe:Fast hard drums + simple chords blasted out on the guitar + the lead singer doing her best impression of a real vocalist = any song on this CD.If they got one thing right on this CD, it's that their music is incredibly generic, and almost a perfect distillation of soulless rock. Their music is white noise, and terribly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Girl Band","review":"if i could i'd give this cd a 2.5 but i can't so i rounded down.i bought this cd because i heard some good things about the donnas and thought \\"take it off\\" was a good song. also, there aren't many girls that make it big in the rock industry today. i felt they would be worth a try so i bought the cd, took it home, listened to it, but was disappointed.in my opinion, the songs are too short and lack in substance. most of them are between 2 to 3 minutes long. i just didn't find anything special or great in the songs. the donnas are just a mediocre girl band. they just aren't all that. i read a review saying that this was their best album yet. if that's true then i wouldn't recommend their other albums either.i don't want to hear stupid songs that have no point. just because the lyrics of a song rhyme, doesn't mean it's good. this cd was a waste of my money. i hope the donnas come up with better material than this. when will their be a great girl band?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! One of my impulse buys pays off!","review":"I bought this disc with just hearing the single, \\"Take it Off\\". I just assumed the rest of the album would be good. It is! This is the first Donna album I've purchased, and to tell you the truth, the first time I've ever heard of them was on last week's Saturday Night Live! They rocked the house, and I thought to myself, \\"These chicks have talent.\\" Their hip, raunchy, 80's style is out of this world!1) It's On the Rocks - 9/102) Take it off - 10/103) Who Invited You - 10/104) All Messed Up - 8/105) Dirty Denim - 8/106) You wanna get me high - 8/107) I Don't Care (So There) - 9/108) Pass it around - 10/109) Too Bad About Your Girl - 9/1010) Not the One - 10/1011) Please Don't Tease - 7/1012) Take Me to the Backset - 10/1013) 5 O'Clock in the Morning - 10/10The only thing that bugs me about \\"Spend the Night\\" is that all the songs sound somewhat similar. But, whatever.BUY THIS DISC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geez, You guys have the Donnas all wrong","review":"I've known about the Donnas since 1999. They were known then to be \\"young female Ramones\\". Most of their fans were punk/ indie rock fans. They were almost kitchy. Then last week I saw them on MTV! What a shock. It's like seeing Henry Rollins play cameos in movies. But its good they are getting more well known and I hope they become famous and foster change. But please don't compare them to either Kiss, hair metal bands or god forbid TRL stuff. I guess they are pretty enough to be on TRL, but they definitely come from a more thoughtful background, but they do rock. By the way, donna means \\"woman\\" in Italian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Move","review":"The Donnas have moved from Lookout! to Atlantic and gained a lot of attention in the process, but it is well deserved. SPEND THE NIGHT is a big step forward from the already fantastic power that we heard with TURN 21. It sounds like Brett (Donna A.) has really started polishing her singing style. She sings with a more mature sound, fuller tone, and larger range than heard in earlier albums, while still retaining her no nonsense cool. Allison (Donna R.) drives the guitar sound all the way through the album and lets it rip in \\"5 O' Clock in the Morning.\\" SPEND THE NIGHT is a rockin' album but the best way to hear The Donnas is of course live. If this album doesn't get you going then you're lying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Chicks and Hot Licks you can't beat it","review":"Spend the Night by the Donnas is one of the best CD's to come out this year. These ladies can really rock with both looks and licks that kill. This album takes me back to better days when bands like Poison, Great White, Motley Crue, and Bon Jovi rules the charts. It's so great to hear a rock album made after 1991 with guitar lines and solos that sound as if they took more than 2 seconds to write. I'm pretty sure that the only reason The Donnas are classified as a punk act is because Atlantic Records is scared to market a rock and roll band in 2002. Big props go out to these girls you really rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"more lame pop-rock crap","review":"remember joan jett? remember the go go's well these are the new girls in town who think they're doing something new and creative but not really doing nothing but following trends from 30 years ago the best rock group is Parliament-Funkadelic hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Immature Rock","review":"Sure they're cute, but musically this band has a long way to go. The band is hard sounding yet they lack any originality and maturity. Their popularity it seems stems more from the fact that they are young women playing aggressive rock, which is the bastion of male groups. If they were guys, really nobody would give them a second glance. Geez, you can find thousands of bands who sound just like them, which isn't saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

I listen to CD's on my laptop constantly. I'm now tempted to fire up Bearshare or Limewire just to get the .mp3 ripped tracks, since I already paid for this piece of crap CD.Don't get me wrong - the Donnas rock, and I love the music, except I couldn't even HEAR the music on this CD, even though I paid for it!

Understandably, formulas are necessary to be mathematically concise, but he could at least spend time discussing them. Now I could forgive him his obtuse explanations if I had a set of practice problems to work with, but there are none. I wasn't even aware of the calculation errors until I read the other reviews, so this only lowers my esteem for the author.Now to be fair, I haven't gotten to many of the later topics, so it's possible the book will get better.

One time, he just looks her in the eye and touches her arm like a gentleman, and she gets all riled up.

It only took about three days to get my teeth as white as a piece of blank paper. by the seventh day, my teeth were glowing. Before i got these trays, however, i read other reviews that talked about stinging of the teeth and white spotting. In my experience, there was a bit of a tingling sensation but it was nothing painful or long lasting. Also, the bleach on the tray did leak down to my gum one time and it did create a white spot, but that is nothing to worry about because it is perfectly normal, it doesnt hurt, and it goes away within the hour.

The trays were flimsy, would not stay in place, and the whitening liquid foamed into my mouth. It was a very unconfortable and unpleasant experience, and I could not tolerate the trays beyond 20 min (suggested time was 45 min). This was disappointing because I had hoped for an improvement over the typical strips. The price was also high for a product that will now go into the garbage. I think I will go back to the strips and avoid Aquafresh products in general after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The gel in the trays does not stay in place.

My upper teeth whitened slightly (mind you, my teeth were not even very yellow or discolored to begin with), but it did not whiten my bottom teeth at all, at least not noticeably enough. Also, the gel always stayed in the upper tray, but always leaked out of the bottom tray which is why I think it didn't work.

However, today I had an interesting experience that I hadn't had before. My gums were burning while I had them on. I took them off early (after only 25 minutes) because I couldn't take the burning anymore. When I took them off I looked in the mirror and my bottom gums were sore, swolen, and WHITER than my teeth!

My first impression: these are so much better than Crest White Strips! With the strips, the gel would oose out, make my mouth foamy, slip around all over, and made my teeth hurt very badly. The trays don't oose and they stay in place very well. I'm not sure about the sensitivity yet, I'm sure there will be some, but I am using Sensodyne so I am hoping that will help as well as doing right before I go to sleep so hopefully any pain will be gone by the time I wake up.

Gel makes your gums white... whiter than your teeth ;) for approx. half an hour after taking trays off. Then you can see a bit of bleeding.

It was very hard for me to get an even distribution and now I have very noticeable white spots along the line where most of the gel sits at the bottom of the tray.

The trays don't even cover my average size canine teeth, so the bottoms are more discolored then the whitened tops now.My wife is also using the product too, and shared with me that she is experiencing the same burning and skin peeling.I will be calling the company!

In fact all I use is aquafresh toothpaste. When I got these trays, I was excited. Their website along with their commercials portrayed a seamless and easy non-messy application of this product. Boy is that deceiving. Not only can you not talk with the trays in your mouth but the gel literally spills all over the place once in your mouth. It's not disgusting but annoying. It is however pretty effective if you can deal with the mess. I certainly would not buy this products as it is messy. Two stars for the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crest White Strips are much better","review":"It's like a giant step backwards. The \\"trays\\" are like primitive white strips.

I tried these.I've also tried the white strips.I've also tried hydrogen peroxide (which just so happens to be the main ingredient in most whitening products).Out off all of them, the hydrogen peroxide works the best. 5 minutes a day swishing the generic store-brand 3% stuff around my mouth and within 2 days, my teeth are MUCH whiter than they were. Now if I'd quite smoking, they'd actually stay that way.But seriously. These things are really uncomfortable if you don't have totally straight teeth and they feel like they'd be a tight squeeze even on totally straight teeth. I'd avoid them.And besides... <2 dollars for hydrogen peroxide... over 30 for these!? No-brainer I'm telling you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum. Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product!","review":"I read all the reviews, good and bad. And decided to try the product anyway. The negetive reviews were right.

He had tried the Crest Whitestrips but hated the taste and he could never get them to stay on his teeth properly. So here is the simple review:1. Whitening: The trays definitely made an improvement in the color of his teeth. They are whiter and brighter.2. Taste: He said the taste was ok and was significantly better than the Crest Whitestrips.3. Fit: He thought the trays were much better for keeping them on his teeth but not convenient for talking.Overall he enjoyed his experience with the White Trays but the gel did not go all the way up to the gum line, so he does have some residual yellowing but he said he would use them again. He did experience the gel dripping out the back of the trays the way some others have reviewed this product.In the end, we would buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Burned\\" my gums","review":"After user #1 I was REALLY impressed.

After about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and I thought something must be wrong so I took them out. My gums were bleached white!I was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour. However, there was some lingering damage done that, while not severe, is annoying (there is still a slight bit of bleeding). I have perfectly healthy gums so I was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums.My advice, if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well","review":"Originally purchased white trays from local drug store.

I also did not like the way my gums felt afterward. They were sore and one time the white tray bleached them and my gums were burning. It was quite painful, actually. I would not recommend these.

The second day, I was having trouble eating with the sores in my mouth and when I used it, I would rate the pain at a 7 out of 10 with more sores. The third day, I tried it again because the package said that discomfort would be normal... this did NOT seem normal. I just about had it. I put my finger to one of the sores and it popped! Gross!

Once I get them in place I cannot release the pressure on my teeth at all or they slip, some of the gel comes out into my mouth, and they are not as effective. Also, I have receding gums and these trays do not even come close to covering all of the length of my teeth. They are also VERY short��they only cover the front teeth and do not reach very far around to the sides.Despite all that, my teeth do appear to be whiter, but they are unpleasant to use.

I had been using Crest whitestrips but they just were not doing the job, so I figured I'd try my luck with the Aquafresh trays despite the poor reviews. I must say I am pleasantly surprised. I experienced absolutely none of the uncomfortable effects that others reported, and I am shocked at how white my teeth got after even the first use. I have a feeling that because I have used many whiteners over the years (including custom dental trays from my dentist before over the counter whiteners became popular)my teeth and gums are less sensitive than most people's. I would definitely recommend the Aquafresh trays, but perhaps not for a first timer. I think you should probably work your way up to them, maybe by using whitestrips first. The only reason I did not give them five stars is that a couple of the bottom trays did not fit as well as the tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've tried many different whitening items in the past, and I must say these are the worst! While the gel actually does whiten a bit, it is impossible to apply evenly over the teeth. The thick, ropey gel did not spread like it was supposed to, resulting in uneven coverage and spotting, and the trays did not fit my teeth at all. The old fashioned, dip in boiling water clunky trays are much better than these. Save your money--get Crest Whitestrips instead.

I had to hold my jaw in a very awkward position to keep the trays in place for the necessary time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"It whitened my teeth a little but not to the extent advertised. And it was very messy! You have to leave the trays on for an hour, so if you want to do it make sure you have no one you need to talk to and that the phones are off the hook. Its very inconvient and it sortof irritated my gums. Also its very foamy, so like I said, messy. Goodluck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"The trays are flimsy/poorly cut vinyl plastic. They barely cover the top section of your teeth and will not stay in place. Pretty pissed I spent $25 on this. Do yourself a favor and stick to the Crest strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!","review":"These are my fave!! Great price and cannot find in the store. You will love em too. My dentist always says I have \\"above average white teeth\\" and I drink coffee everyday!! Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY! Not worth the low price!","review":"Absolutely awful. The worst whitener I've ever used. I got 20 minutes into the first tray and nearly died from the pain. The goo is too firm and doesn't spread evenly, so it just pools and collects unevenly on the teeth and gums. The flimsy little tray does not conform to your teeth and just causes more problems.In the past I've used Crest as well as Rembrandt, both with decent results. I think from now on I'll stick with Crest. It's very expensive but worth EVERY penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design!","review":"Cheap and flimsy. I cannot imagine how they could not come up with a better design. I think they put more thought into the packaging than into the product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"This product is really difficult to use! I've used crest whitestrips and these trays are more difficult. The product shifts in the mouth and I've wasted like half of my trays. I'm going to try to get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this product, it will be the worst 45 minutes of your day. If I even saw these at the dollar store I wouldn't buy them. First of all the trays don't fit right, I can't imagine they will fit anyone right unless you are the one they molded them after. Second, the gel that is in them oozes out and into the back of your throat causing you to swallow it quite often, it's awful and gross. The other thing is, don't even think of talking with these in, because they will come loose and once again the gross gel will ooze out. I'm very disappointed that Aquafresh would put their name on these. I have found the best whitening product is the Rembrandt strips, they stay on your teeth and you can talk with them in, they stay on better than the crest whitestrips, although with both, I think you will get the same result."},{"rating":"1","title":"white trays","review":"the trays were easy but if your teeth are not perfect the trays do not work. Top trays fit fine but bottom didn't work because my bottom teeth are crooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"white teeth","review":"only for those people with no crowns or bonding on teeth...it will only work on natural tooth enamel, Too bad they don't tell you that before purchasing!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Crest Whitestrips","review":"These Aquafresh trays are a waste of money. They are very uncomfortable and hard to keep on your teeth and the gel does not spread through the tray...you still have clumps of unused gel in the tray after your 45 minutes are up. I personally like the crest whitestrips 100% better. I only tried these because they are new but would never buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Engineered Product","review":"I have no idea how effective the gel is because I cannot even get the trays to stay in place around my teeth, especially the lower one. Did they actually test these trays on human subjects before going to market? This is the worst teeth whitener product I have ever used, including the generic versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aquafresh White Trays","review":"This is really the first product review I've ever done and the reason I'm doing it is because this product is just awful. Expensive, too. You have to use the toothpaste for up to two weeks to insure against sensitivity. However, the flimsy \\"trays\\" don't stay on your teeth long enough to warrant the toothpaste. As another reviewer said, you have to keep your teeth clamped together to avoid the trays popping out, and the gel is disgusting. I don't know if they whiten or not, because no way can I keep these in for up to 45 minutes. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BURNED MY GUMS!","review":"The first two-three days were fine but day four, the trays burned my gums white and in one spot, brown! It hurts. Plus, the whitening isn't as a great as Crest. The trays also aren't large enough for long teeth and they don't whiten the backs of teeth; only the front. Coloring on the back of teeth and affect the color seen by people when you smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH! Cracked my tooth???","review":"I just used the trays for the first time and at about 15 minutes I had such a sharp pain happen that I spit out the trays (and the gross gel) into my hands and had to go rinse my mouth out.Upon checking my teeth to see what happened I noticed a BIG crack running down the entirety of my front left tooth. It doesn't really hurt anymore and it doesn't feel like it's on the surface, but it wasn't there before I used this.You can bet that I'm calling the company on monday and that I'm going to go get this checked out by a dentist."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewww...","review":"these taste terrible, they don't form to your teeth, the gel is too solid to get into all the right places. i had chunks of slimy gel floating around in my mouth, and the bottom tray never stayed in place. i'll stick to crest whitestrips from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money","review":"They are a waste of time and money. They put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth. After a week, my teeth are the same color as when I started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend the money","review":"This product does not whiten like I expected and the trays are awkward and not maliable enough to conform correctly to your teeth. Also, the gel doesn't hit every spot so the tops of my teeth aren't the same color as the base. And when you're done with it it leaves big chunks of gel in your mouth that made me gag. I also had to search all over for how long to leave them in...it's not on the instruction insert but on the box in tiny little letters.Instead of these go with Crest Professional Whitestrips. You can't get them in stores--I could only find them online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced, and poorly designed trays","review":"For the price of this product, the design of the disposable trays are weak. The trays don't cover the majority of your teeth, and the bottom trays are even smaller in size. If your mouth is the size of a kid, they may work fine. But I would not buy this product again, and I'm applying for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad.....","review":"I really, I mean REALLY, wanted to like these. I love the concept, but the trays are very flimsy and don't make anything like a \\"custom\\" fit. A lot of the product came out from the back and the sides. I just got too grossed out thinking of what I was swallowing! I gave it two stars though, because the gel did whiten pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"I bought this product because, in comparison to most whitening products, it seemed relatively quick and easy. I sincerely regret my purchase. The trays do not fit properly. They try to flop around in your mouth, the gel comes out and it does not taste that great. The worst part is that this product \\"burned\\" my gums and gave me terrible teeth sensitivity - which I have never had prior to using this product. The product does whiten. However, I have a very tiny mouth and the product only whitened half of each tooth! It looks ridiculous. I plan on going to the dentist and getting professional whitening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I have used a lot of different tooth whiteners since they have become easily available over-the-counter several years ago. I am by far the least impressed the Aquafresh White Trays. I have chemical burns on my gums, the gel slides out as I wear them and I inevitably swallow at least some of it, which makes my stomach hurt, and I cannot move my mouth at all while using them (the recommended time to leave them on is 30-45 minutes) or the bottom tray slides off. I have seen noticeable whitening of my teeth with this product, but no more than with other products I have used in the past. I will not purchase this particular product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes your GUMS white","review":"This product made part of my gums white and puffy after wearing the trays for 20 minutes. I have healthy gums overall, so I guess they are \\"sensitive\\". The whiteness has subsided after about 30 minutes but I will not use this product again. Be careful and if your gums sting, remove the trays and rinse. Better yet -- don't get this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too painful to use","review":"I used this product for two days. The first day wasn't painful at all, but I was nauseated after using it for the maxiumum length of 45 minutes. The second day I noticed some discomfort about half way through that same amount of time. By the end of the 45 minutes that second day, I was nauseated again, one of my front teeth hurt badly, and my gums and lips were chemically burned to the point that I had blisters that took three days to heal. I'm too afraid to put them in again.I did notice my top teeth were slightly whiter, but it did nothing for my bottom teeth. I originally purchased this product over others because I thought the trays might cover more teeth than the others (instead of just the front four), but this wasn't the case. Not only did they not cover more teeth, they also did not reach to the top of the teeth they were supposed to cover. So they are short both in width and in height. Overall, I have to say it was a terrible waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whittener","review":"The Aquafresh trays only reach the top half of teeth and they are too flimsy. If they would cover the entire tooth I think this would be a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly Awkward experience","review":"I did read reviews half good half bad but i didn't think it was THIS bad. The trays honestly refuse to stay in place. It took 2 tries for me to get them to stay in my mouth (by clenching my jaw for the 45 minutes of horror) To notice that after all of the gel slips and slides around (and out of the tray) that only HALF of my teeth were whiter after every use. Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don't look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don't eat after i use the trays. Over all I've gotten alo't more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurt my teeth and gums","review":"These white strips had hurt my teeth and made my gums white. The trays also weren't very well fitting. I discontinued using them after 3 uses. After those 3 uses I really didn't see a noticeable change in the color of my teeth either. I think in the future I will look into getting them professionally whitened and lay off of the coffee and soda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I got this product because I like the tray idea for teeth whitening and it was horrible. I put it on like any other teeth whitening products and the gel started seeping out of the trays. Instead of staying in the tray, it started dripping into my mouth making me gag. I thought it was just me so I made my husband try it. Pretty soon, he was gagging too. Not a good product and I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design that won't stay on your teeth","review":"This product is poorly designed. The trays are flimsy such that they generally will not stay in place. The gel is meant to be pushed against your teeth so that the trays and gel will always cover the surface of your teeth, but this mechanism does not work. The gel is not adhesive enough to stay in place. You will often find clumps of it come out the edges, forcing you to either swallow it or risk losing the entire tray when trying to spit the gel out. Perhaps the intensity of the gel would work better than that of competitor's white strips, but since the gel rarely stays on, it's impossible to tell. I will go back to strips and stay away from these trays. It was a true waste of money and I regret having tried what I thought would be more like a professional teeth-whitening kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expired?","review":"I did not see the \\"expires 8/11 GOOD UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST\\" note until just now and I ordered this item a week or so ago. I plan on returning it as soon as I get it. The note is not anywhere on the selling page. Also, I'm not guaranteed to receive this item until the middle of September."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Underwhelmed","review":"I realize everyone's teeth - and tastes - are different, but I was not blown away by this product. After using it as directed for seven days, I'd say my teeth are a teeny bit brighter but not really noticeably \\"whiter.\\" I think if they made this a 10 day regimen, it would be satisfactory. As it is, I think I'll try another round of whitening with another brand. On the plus side, the trays are pretty easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, don't believe the negativity","review":"I used these trays and was very happy with them and they worked well (note: you are not going to get movie star white teeth using this product - that's why celebs spend thousands of dollars). Some reviewers have stated that using these trays hurt their teeth and/or gums. I felt no pain at all and I used them 7 days straight, but if you have sensitive teeth you might want to use them every other day.Tips:-- Put in trays when you are not moving around a lot.-- When you put in the trays, massage them over your teeth to spread the whitening paste.-- To prevent excessive salivating.....lay down on sofa or couch with your head leaned back and watch a TV program. This will greatly stop you from salivating which will move the trays around.Hope this helps, I really liked this product and signed up for the Amazon Subscriptions 6 month plan which offers discount on units."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work!","review":"I decided to buy this product before i read the reviews. In my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind. There is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place. The first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard. I havent had the problem since.I noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days. My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly. The pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem.All in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one. I was truly surprised at how well they worked. I will be purchasing these in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The trays must have been molded for a 5 year old.

The greatest film comedian of them all has often been criticised for sentimentality(particularly by English critics, who view sentiment as a failing rather than as life-enhancing). In this movie they may have a point. Of his full length features it is the only weak one until the decline into Limelight, King in New York et al.The address below might indicate I'm English. Forget it, I'm Irish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute But Unfunny","review":"City Lights tries to turn pathos into comedy, or is it the other way round? Well, the pathos does seem to work because of the trick of letting the heroine be blind (at first), and therefore she doesn't know that her love is a tramp. But there is very little to laugh about in the film.Admitted: Chaplin is a great film maker, kind of very visual. But he simply is not funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A one-man virtuoso performance ...","review":"Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation, the beloved Tramp...

The film's highlights are the hilarious boxing match and, of course, the justifiably famous ending where the Little Tramp encounters the flower girl after she has regained her sight. It's hard not to be moved by this closing scene.

That, alone, is an incredible feat. But the book is not user friendly. It is written in encyclopedic form. It is written in descriptive (old style) notation. It is hard to follow the lines of notation, as little guidence is given to the reader if he is in the main variation or a subvariation.In order to squeeze in as many words as possible, the book is extremely dense in terms of presentation. There is hardly any blank space in the margins of this book. It's a forboding book to study from.That being said, it's an excellent book. However, McKay has republished this book recently (2004). The new edition is revised by GM Pal Benko, an authority on endgames. The notation is updated from descriptive to algebraic.

I often find myself singing the chants while I'm at work or whatnot, too.The only thing that really bothers me is track #6, Goddess Medley.

There are a multitude of LARGE, successful, multinational CHRISTIAN based companies he could have reviewed his book. If you don't think his review sources were poor choices go watch the documentary Psychopath.

I found his definitions of the qualities of integrity spot on.

Players are in high form here, keeping the compelling repetition informed and brisk for anyone interested in the opposite side of your typical jam band. Here the esteemed math-rock compatriots get to flex their considerable self-conscious chops, ushering in the band's renewed interest in the faltering genre. Hopefully these impressive, though essentially glorified, compositional outings will continue to refine and focus both band and fans alike as the obligatory LP hopefully looms around the corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vegan Book for Non-Vegans","review":"Mr. Vishny seems to me to be the type who would be comfortable writing on just about any subject, but it is obvious that he is passionate about health.

I actually bought it for her because she wanted to co-sleep but was nervous about it. I thought this would calm her fears. But she found it inconvenient and only used it a few times.She passed it on to me when I got pregnant, and I tried to use it, but my baby didn't like it. She preferred to be on the bed, right next to me, so that's how we did it, and still do. My baby is 18 months old now, and we love co-sleeping, and don't have any concerns about the safety of doing it the old fashioned way.If this thing will encourage anyone to co-sleep, then by all means, go for it! Just because it didn't work for us doesn't mean it isn't a great idea.

Phish really clicked at this concert and it is definately my favorite of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"odd choice ? You decide !","review":"Excellent recording of this show. Alpine Valley has always been the most impressive venue to see live acts in the summertime, especially PHISH. As all previous years, Phish sold out this Saturday show and really drew an even larger crowd of Pholks to the lots. As far as Summer 2000 Phish, goes, this show was pretty ho-hum. The only Llama of the tour was the only real surprise from the first set. The Heavy Things set two opener can be heard to disappoint the crowd, but the Piper follow up is the absolute cherry of the whole show. It is one of those moments that keeps people coming back for 50 shows or more. The only Horse and Silent in the Morning of the tour are near the end of the set. The only Suzy Greenberg is part of the encore (ho-hum short version) and the obligatory Tweezer Reprise closes the show with a bash. All in all, great release from Phish, but why release the 2000 stuff that everybody already has on CD???????????? !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"midnight voyage","review":"This recording of Hariprasad is epitomal for his clear full sound as well as densely textured style.

This DVD comes close to capturing their show but has some serious limitations. Picture quality is great, but why must we suffer a jump cut every one to two seconds? Does the director feel this is necessary to maintain our interest? Just when you start to enjoy a scene, you're off to see a super close up of someone or whole hall shot. They should of left the spinning camera zooms back in the sixties. Very distracting. The sound is fair with a somewhat muddy drum and bass mix. And the guests? I can see Eddie Vedder, but Bryan Adams???? Why butcher Who classics just to drag in more guests? Ugh! The band is 5 stars. The DVD missed, it's a 2. A band of this quality deserves more.

They played with much more energy and looked like they enjoyed it more than the \\"82\\" tour when they made their final farewell video in Toronto. I always thought I'd never see the real Who because of the loss of Keith, but Zak Starkey really shines in this concert and as a result the others seem to come to life. Pete's cranking the guitar, Roger screaming as hard as his voice will let him after 35 years and lets not forget John \\" 5:15 \\" Solo awesome!!!!

Krutch,... and this band was a pleasant surprise. They sound like christian godsmack, if it is ok to say that. The vocalist is incredible... better than Jon Sumrall from Kutless. His voice is unique and just beautiful. The guitarist has good talent and plays some pretty mean leads. The best songs are Venom(7) Personal Renaissance(6) and Sing till the Song Sings You(13). The Enemy in Me is also a great song. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes Kutless, or Skillet, or any Christian rock band.

Various hand-drums are the most prominent instruments, along with guitars, keybords, and occasional horns or strings. The singing varies in quality. But overall it holds up well after repeated listenings. The lyrics, by Starhawk and others, are very rich, and give a strong ecological twist to \\"Earth-Based Spirituality.\\"For Pagans of any stripe, this is a five-star CD.

And that made all the difference. Unlike their first cd which is not only filled with wayne static's repetitve vocals and guitar lines but also their original guitarists very intricate and stylized guitar skills, Machine can only offer too much of the same thing.

What this leaves people with is a cd that is easily forgetable and hard to stay awake through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Let Down","review":"I really liked Wisconsin Death Trip, but this disc is just bad. The creativity of Wisconsin Death Trip was the only thing that kept my mind off of the fact that there is very little talent involved in the music. When I first heard \\"Sweat of the Bud\\" I almost fell of my chair. I had never heard anything like it before. Dissapointingly, Waynes vocals on Machine are dull and boring. Tripp and Wayne's guitar riffs are just plain horrible. They are distorted beyond the max, and its impossible to decipher one from another because they sound so much alike. Every song sounds almost exactly alike, unlike most of Wisconsin Death Trip. This is a classic example of a band showing creative and/or original promise on their debut, but killing all that potential with their sophmore release.

The only song that I found to be remotly good is..\\"this is not\\" but the rest of them just blow. I will always be a Static-x fan cuz I love Wayne but I will not support this new CD that they have let me and alot of other people down on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'll tell you, I expected a lot better from Static-X.

Well, when I first listened to \\"Machine\\", I was disappointed right off the bat. \\"Get to the Gone\\", \\"Ostego Undead\\", \\"This is Not\\", and \\"Burn to Burn\\" sound like Wayne Static is trying to make Static-X sound like Ministry for the new generation, with repetitive drum loops and uninspired lyrics that really bring \\"Machine\\" down a whole lot. \\"Black & White\\" and \\"S*** in a Bag\\" are pretty good, but all in all \\"Machine\\" is a disappointing album that I was really looking forward to. I only hope the boys in Static-X can rebound from this, because they are a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not like their first","review":"Yes, this is a pretty good album. When I got this I had not yet heard their first. This one is different as it's not as techno as the first album. For instance, in the first one there is all these weird playbacks, like in \\"I'm With Stupid.\\"This is a great CD though, and the best song is song 1-2. I was pretty conrnfused when I put this into my CD player and heard country music. Anyway, get it, it's surprising and fun to listen too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Is this the same band that wrote \\"Bled for Days\\" and \\"Love Dump?\\" This CD is just a bunch of heavy industrial tracks that go nowhere and do nothing. I used to consider Static X better than Spineshank, but there is better music on The Height of Callousness than on Machine. If you're just getting into Static X, get Wisconson Death Trip. Otherwise, try anything by Fear Factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could have done a lot better","review":"Static-X is an awesome band but I dont know what happened this time.The CD isn't all that bad but they really lost their touch in this one.They are screaming without anything in mind.It seems like they made this one in 2 days.Some songs that really disapointed me were \\"Get to the Gone\\",\\"This is Not\\",\\"Cold\\",and \\"Burn to Burn\\".I used to be a big Static-X fan but since I bought this one I dont know if they are gonna keep going downhill from here or if they can get back their style.I think much less of them now.I don't recommend this to any of those Static fans out there just wait tell their next one comes out and we'll see how that turns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets pretend this never happened....","review":"What the hell happened between Death Trip and Machine?! I know that they have a new guitarist and all, but why was this album such a let down? Death Trip was one of my favorite albums of all time,and I was one on the biggest Static X fan around but even I though Machine was horrible. It seems lifeless and dull compared to the older album. First off the songs sound like they were rushed and that there were not alot of thought put into them. Wayne's vocals were at one level the whole album (there were no variation from low to high like there was in Death Trip). I hope that Static X is not a one album trick pony, and I hope they put more thought and effort into album #3."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best metal albums of the year","review":"I like MACHINE alittle more than DEATH TRIP. Machine's music is straight ahead in your face powerful metal music. The album starts off with a surprise with a mexican style ranchera song as the intro to the album, that alone is pleasant surprise. GET TO THE GONE, PERMANENCE, BLACK AND WHITE, THIS IS NOT, OTSEGO UNDEAD are just great songs that show Static-X is a band to watch. MACHINE is filled with great song after song, no filler material here. This CD might just be one of the best metal releases this year, and in my opinion there have been some great ones already. This album actually rates 4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"what can i say","review":"i like em, this cd may not be as good as the last one, but its like nice, i luv the sound, its got that static feel, heh i do not know, if you like the first one, and luv the sound you will like this one, or not, i like it. its growing on me like all things, fun stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Industiral For Dance Clubs","review":"Static-X's first album was alot better than this. ''This is not'' sounds harsh and sort of industrial with the mechanical beats. ''Black and white'' has the spacey effects and sounds alienish which your average alien or robot might buy thisalbum. The song ''cold'' has cool guitaring and I liked it butthis is not very good which the songs have too many electronic gadgets and Wayne sounds like a robot talking and what happened to his howlings.

I'm so happy to find such energy in nowadays metal music. I love Wayne's hair, besides...\\"Machine\\" is fast and marciless - guitar riffs are rhytmized (I love the drummer's performance - the way he uses base drums proves lot of leg-training), samples are nicely hidden behind the guitar tones. My favorite tracks are \\"get to the gone\\" (fast and very, very heavy, sounds like sepultura's \\"Subtraction\\" mixed with our polish Vader :)), and \\"burn to burn\\" , which contains a powerful dose of electronics mixed with guitar leads.What else should I say ?Static X is very dynamic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as WDT but still good","review":"Machine starts off with the head scratchingly unfitting polka intro that explodes into Static X's heaviest song to date, Get To the Gone. Amazingly when you listen to these 2 side by side it seems completly logical....scaryAnyways Machine lives up to many expectations and shows us that Static X is not a one hit wonder like oh so many nu metal bands. The electronics used in the album are less industrial like but seem to be more out of the techno genre. This isn't really bad because it creates a distinctive sound for this album. Wayne seems to have matured a little as a vocalist too. Another good thing is that the drumming is leagues ahead of WDT's. The bad things start out with the guitars, less heavy but more techniqually sound. Bad to some good to others I guess.All in all this is a great buy for any Industrial metal fan. Best tracks are...Get To the Gone, Black and White, This is Not, and Cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes!!","review":"Static-x rawks so much..I was so excited when i got the cd..because i loved the last one. These guys are just unreal! The music is hard..fast..and you just can't stop listening to it. I can't wait until they tour. I have seen them live before..and they rawk just as much.

WDT was so good! This is just ok.","review":"I was a big fan of Wisconsin Death Trip. I think that's one of the best CD's ever put out. The music, art, and overall feel had an high tech, semi industrial, almost anime style to it. It was smart and edgy, but most of all it was unusual. Static-X had a sound like no other, and it was good. So then what happens? They lose Koichi, and hire Tripp Rex Eisen. Now I don't know where they found this guy, but you can tell he's such a nice guy when he thanks Koichi for leaving the band. Yeah, real sweetheart. I hope someone reminds him not to let the door hit him on the way out, because Koichi's absence seems to be the reason the whole uniqueness of the band is gone.This CD is ok. Not great. Just average. I liked a few songs quite a lot, such as This is Not and Get to the Gone. These sounded like they fit in with WDT. The rest is just kind of like the average metal band. Don't we have enough one hit wonders out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can only listen to the same album so many times....","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am not anti-Static-X, I enjoyed their debut album very much and was anxious to hear this. I figured after an album like that there was room for much more improvement, so I was very eager to hear what the new Static-X sounded like. Wait a second... \\"New\\" Static-X? Is it really \\"new?\\" You be the judge. To me, this whole CD is just a rehash of Wisconsin Death Trip and offers nothing new to the listener. I suggest you skip this CD, unless (for some odd reason) you are a die-hard fan. Instead check out some Ministry and White Zombie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Static-x:Machine","review":"Static-x's follow up album to Wisconsin Death Trip is called Machine.It has 12 songs,and 5 of them i like.(\\"Get To The Gone\\",\\"Black And White\\",\\"This Is Not\\",\\"Cold\\",& \\"Structural Defect\\".)It has a new guitar player (Tripp Edsen;from Dope) and is way heavier than the last.You should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring.","review":"Does nothing to live up to their rep established by 'Wisconsin Death Trip'.

LONG LIVE METAL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for the upset soul","review":"I have had this CD for a little over a month now, and it has only left my CD player twice. It is loud, strong, and has messages of hope for the untamed listener.

I seriously recommend this CD to all who prefer it a little louder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great...","review":"Ok...I had never heard of Static-X until the FVT. I liked Black and White. The problem with the cd is that nothing else is good on this. This Is Not is good also but this is really weird music. Go out and get Drowning Pool or Puddle of Mudd or download Black and White."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beautiful country of Romania","review":"I live in a piece of paradise. Romania, a country in Eastern Europe, welcomes all its visitors with great landscapes, great habits, and friendly people, to make you feel just like home.

Great tall mountains, green hills, the wonderful Black Sea and also one of the most appreciated places in Europe, the awesome Danube Delta.Combine all these incredible landscapes with the rich and praisefull history of our people, or with the exciting and well known myth of Dracula, and you get the picture of a country that's really awesome in all aspects.So what do all these things have to do with Static-X's Machine?

Go buy the \\"Queen of the Damned\\" soundtrack.The song \\"cold\\" is cool, a little understated, very vampire-like. Not true of the rest of the CD. The folks who keep rating this disc so high must like the other music, which is hyper-tempo, uncomplicated guitar n' drums layered with screaming. I don't think anyone would deny that. The question is, why do they have fans? Of course, almost everything has some fans... the issue is, for most people, would the phrase \\"one-hit-wonder\\" be used to describe this CD? I think any disc which has one acceptable song, and a lot of songs which are significantly worse, constitutes, at minimum, a 'one-hit-recording'.Just make sure you've heard some of the other songs on the disc, besides \\"cold,\\" before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machine","review":"Static-X new album,its good but not as good as their 1st..The lyrics are not very good,sometimes they don't make since...They rock hard though and is worth a purchase,if you like electronic metal..I enjoyed it.Rock on!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The energy never stops...!","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Static-X, their first CD hit me hard--and their next one does just that, but takes you into a deep dark place where everyone forgets they have.

This is one of the worst cds in my collection, I am incredibly dissapointed with the way Wayne uses his voice on this album compared to WDT. He sounds like he's trying to be a some kind of hardcore singer instead of sticking to the way he used to sing. I guess maybe since he plays guitar on it, it takes away from his singing but never the less I am going to be very skeptical when another cd of theirs hits the shelves. This cd sounds exactly how record companies and big MTV think metal should sound and it dissapoints me that Static-X couldn't be original twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"of the highest quality from the (...) department!","review":"This album is the (...) worst album i have ever heard.

A lay reader will come out none the wiser after reading the chapters on complex numbers and groups. Just dressing up powerful general ideas in vague, mystifying, and allusive prose serves no purpose. For instance (p.81) he refers to the heart-breaking charm of complex analysis. Yeah, so? These statements don't edify a lay reader. The same can be said for the discussion of Lie groups (pp. 100-101).A mathematician on the other hand, will find the book redundant, and annoying -- both for its inaccuracies and general, loose vagueness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egregious historical error.","review":"Just for the record, Paul Dirac was British, not French as asserted by Berlinski on page 8. Dirac was born in Bristol and held the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge and built the mathematical foundation for quantum electrodynamics. Dirac has been written about extensively. It is amazing that a book that purports to be \\"a short history of mathematics\\" doesn't have anyone checking facts, proof reading, or editing. One loses interest after encountering a major flub so early in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"passive-aggressive math?","review":"I've never come across such a work or author before. This author is plainly venting his passive-aggressive tendencies in this less than enlightening work. It took me until page 108 to finally figure what he's up to.There he puts Euclid's axioms in such a format as to be quite deliberately obscure. Then two pages later he suddenly jumps to measuring angles in radians, though he's never done it before and makes no statement that he's doing so. If you are not already ahead of him, you are lost. So it goes with the rest of the book. Meanwhile Berlinski stands to the side saying, \\"What did I do? What did I do? Oh, well, perhaps you should read something simpler if you cannot follow me.\\"Berlinski is plainly a person of wit and intelligence. Alas, he's allowed another side of his persona to pop up here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically Garbage","review":"This book irritated me so much that I'm going to just rant and abandon any hope of writing a 'helpful' review. I picked the book up on a remainder table for $1, and I clearly paid too much. Berlinski doesn't appear to know any more than a smattering of mathematical history (or math for that matter), but he dearly loves to hear himself talk as if he does. His flowery, grandiloquent delivery style accomplishes nothing remotely useful. An example from Chapter two: \\"Not until the twentieth century would mathematics and logic, having for so long exchanged their moist breath (sic), fuse ecstatically into the single subject of mathematical logic.\\" Come on - \\"moist breath\\"?, \\"fuse ecstatically\\"? Nothing is being accomplished here except for the author going on a linguistic ego trip.

There is some good information, but nothing so extraordinary that it merits the work you have to go through to glean it.

Some subjects are just difficult and some students and some readers just lack the intellectual wherewithal to understand.This problem is made worse when teachers and writers like Berlinski not only undertake a difficult task but add to their burdens and those of their students by taking on one final task, convincing the reader or student just how very smart the teacher or author is.Too often in Infinite Ascent the author goes off on metaphorical tangents which seem little more than ego driven side trips to impress the reader with the brilliance of the author. That he is well read and literate, I have no doubt. I just wish he would put more effort into a better explanation of metamathematics.

On A High, track 6, would have to be the most radio friendly tune on the cd, and is quite fun. Another \\"story\\" is told in \\"Magazines,\\" and this song is superbly drawn out, and may be the best on the album.

Sorry, Alan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maureen's Drivel","review":"I picked up this book as I am a great admirer of Alan Rickman's career and was sorely disappointed within the first paragraph. The technique, if that's what the jerky, scattered smattering of unrelated sentences and half formed ideas can be called, resembled nothing close to a decent flow or form. In one sentence the author makes a point blank statement then, in the next, proceeds to contradict it in a way that makes me believe she was oblivious to the first statement.Not only is her writing style appallingly primitive (and no amount of the thirteen letter words she seemed fond of sprinkling through out the text can hid that fact)but the voice she used to recant this cobbling of rumors and third hand reports bears all the resemblance of a jilted lover.This mockery was written seemingly without respect for the person but rather as a way to make a profit off of a talented man who prefers to not exploit himself the way this hack seemed to have no qualms in doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're a Fan, DON'T!!!!!","review":"If you are truly a fan of Alan Rickman's -- or just interested in him as a wonderful actor -- run, don't walk, AWAY from this offensive drivel!I am not even going to dignify this tripe with a lengthy review...even a NEGATIVE one (and, if you haven't guessed by now, this IS a negative review).

The man grew up in a rough area of Tulsa, Oklahoma without a fatherly figure. His mother and grandmother instilled some positive attributes. However, John faced many troubles growing up and his brothers had a mixed influence on him.However, John Starks perservered from a troubled youth stocking shelves in Safeway to an NBA All Star. John overcame many obstacles in the NBA and earned the respect of many of his peers in spite of a few overzealous actions on his part.What really comes accross in this book(and from listening to John speak in person) is the that Mr. Starks has turned into quite an articulate and intelligent young man. He sets a good example as a USBL coach and certainly would be a good candidate to coach in the NBA. John's strong work ethic will indeed carry him to much further success.A good read even for Chicago Bull, Miami Heat and Indiana Pacer fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about a great man","review":"john starks was my idol growing up. Before he came to the knicks they were very mediocre. As he says in the book his rise coincided with the knicks title contension throughout the 90's. The book was very good and gave great insight into the man before his career. I was shocked when i read that he used to sell drugs and had been in jail. i followed everything about him back in the day and i remember never hearing about his father so it surprised me to hear that he met his father a couple times. anyway i lived and died with starks the dunk was this city's highest high and 2-18 well u do the math. i recommend this book to anyone who loved a good underdog story about a man with a heart as big as the big apple"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments by a satisfied reader","review":"Scholarly and credible.

This whole collection gets all of the necessary cuts needed for any The Doors fan (ie Light My Fire, Break on Through to the Other Side, and Touch Me) and also some lesser hits that any fan can enjoy as well (ie My Eyes Have Seen You). This collection encompasses their entire career very well. My only pet peeve about this collection is that it is a bit pricey... if you're not looking at how much material you get. It's a good buy considering the fact that you're getting 34 tracks for $23. Perfect for any newcomer to the Doors, or those of us who just want their greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aside from a Box Set, this is their Best Compilation album","review":"Although there have been many recent greatest hits albums. Only \\"The Doors Legacy\\" is complete with original remasters of their best. And, here is the clincher: This is a completely uncensored Album. I can count 5 or 6 Doors songs on this Two CD set that have small additions. One example of the additions: in the song \\"The End\\" there is about 30 seconds more material. All in all a great investment.WARNING: The new additions do make at least two of their songs PG-13 rated, if you are a parent buying this for a pre teen, I reccomend screening \\"Break on Through to the other Side\\" and \\"The End\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star On The Greed Principle....","review":"\\"Absolute Best Of\\", \\"Best Of The Doors\\", \\"Doors Box Set\\", \\"Essential Rarities\\", \\"Greatest Hits\\", \\"Thirteen\\", \\"Very Best Of The Doors\\"...hum that's at least 7 \\"best of\\" compilations from a band who only made 6 studio albums with the great Jim Morrison.

By the way, I don't think that these compilations are \\"THE BEST\\", as if lacks better and important tunes. It's better to spend more and have the original six albums.By the way, I only have an old tape of \\"Full Circle\\" and I have never heard or seen \\"Other Voices\\".

Hell this is all you need unless you enjoy their live CD's. Ive heard the 1985 release of Best of and this blows that compilation away as far as sound quality. This new set sounds so crisp. The volume has been set up a notch, also the instruments and vocals sound great. I actually don't mind listening to them on older releases im not too picky on sound when it comes to this band since the songs are trippy remastered or not. I gave this five stars for the sound and articles that are in the booklet. You get all the hit songs on two discs songs like: The End my personal fav song, Light my Fire, Moonlight Drive, Riders on the Storm,Hello I Love you and alot more.

Highly recommended along with American Prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be updated","review":"In 2006, for the 40th anniversary of the Doors' first album, all their albums were re-mixed and speed corrected (the first album, constituting the first eight tracks on disc one, was 3.5% slow). This version features both the slower versions of first album tracks, and the old mixes. It should be updated.In addition to the re-mixes and speed corrections, this album also needs to get rid of the \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" track at the end. That was put here in order to get die-hard fans who have all this material to buy this album. The only part of the song that really works is \\"Not to Touch the Earth,\\" which was released on \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" and is included here, earlier in the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio is clipped","review":"I should start off saying that I love The Doors, and this is a fine compilation. The main problem is that all of the tracks are distorted and clipped. I work in the audio industry and was able to get in contact with Bruce Botnick the recording engineer who did the original tracks and this remastered version. He said that this recording was from digital transfers that were made in the late 80s. He said the original two track analog masters were lost, so he had to use these clipped digital transfers! But he had the original analog 4-track masters and was working on remixes with pristine sound quality. These are currently available on various releases, such as the Doors of Perception Box Set, so I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"The lead singer's song delivery is quite mopey. The keyboard solos are rather pedestrian, but was way ahead of it's time, it's match for match with \\"free jazz\\" and japanese noise. The guitarist is quite talented and to be honest, the rest of the band weighs down his true potential. The song \\"Riders in the Storm\\" is a good Exhibit A on why a band should not record whilst taking barbituates."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELP 1965","review":"great year. i was 8 years old. a fun movie with great songs. very enjoyable to watch. one little flaw. the 2 DVD's kept falling off the cheap foam sprockets. i had to place the discs in seperate covers.

His bad acting ruined this movie for me. In the original version of Help, Mr. Starr had a cow in his room so he could drink warm milk. I'm glad they edited out that scene because it was not even remotely funny.Apart from Mr. Starr's acting, George Harrison delivers a tremendous performance. I think it's hilarious when George Harrison is skiing with a top hat on his head.Also, the title track is superb.If the producers can edit out all of the scenes with Ringo Starr, this will by a 5-star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"help??","review":"I apologize to the beatles fans, I said no story in this film and the film had no sense at all.

This was little more than a poorly written 96 minute music video. On a deeper level it is said to have reflected the growing despair that the Beatles felt as their career(s) took over their lives. In any event, it comes across as forced, a hastily written script that gave the Beatles another go at the silver screen. A Hard Day's Night was much better; it rocks while this one reeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy, Music, The Beatles... how can you go wrong?","review":"This is a hilarous movie. Fans of A Hard Day's Night and Monty Python will love this movie. This outrageous movie is abstract and funny. But, of course the main point of this movie is to see the Beatles, and see them we do. A friend of mine complains \\"this plot is as thin as a piece of paper!\\"..........I have never seen a person miss the point of anything so much in my entire life. As if anybody cares about the plot, that is actually what makes the movie so funny, the plot doesn't matter! To top off this wacky adventure is plenty of great Beatles music. This movie is so enjoyable in every way. This is a great feel-good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Beatles films","review":"Help! is probably my favorite of the Beatles movies.

There's not enough music (or at least their good music) in the movie and the silliness just takes control and causes the movie to hit the ground at 500 miles per hour.A much better movie is Hard Days' Night. It's silly too, but the music overrides most of it and makes it a pleasure to watch.It looks like about 15 people tried to write this mess. Are there funny parts? Yes. Is some of the music good? Yes. Is it worth renting? Probably.But, don't buy it.

It came packaged with \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and several other Beatle discs (though not Let It Be/Yellow Submarine). I agree that the aspect ratio is a bit odd. However, the Criterion Laserdisc version should be as close to perfect as it can get. The Criterion LD version of \\"AHDN\\" is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I'm a big Beatles fan and I saw Help in the theaters when it was first released. I don't remember my reaction to it much, but I'm sure I loved it since it was such a thrill to see the Beatles in any circumstance. Of course, the music was great, even though it was lip-synched. I rented Help recently and I have to tell you, I couldn't even finish watching it. It's a horrible movie. The attempts at humor fall flat and the Beatle just seem too old to be acting like such immature goofballs.

However, this being said, I thought the movie, \\"Help!\\" wasn't very good. It was a combination music video of the The Beatles performing their various songs in different locations and a movie about a group of evil religious zealots trying to steal one of Ringo's rings.\\"Help!\\" is a really artsy film, where we see crazy, unrealistic antics happening repeatedly by all the cast members. The acting is bad in this film and the storyline is silly throughout. The music, costuming & make-up are the only redeeming features in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help me if you can, I'm feeling fleeced","review":"Another cynical ploy by the major releasing studios to exploit boomer nostaglia (I'm surprised no one has observed the proximity of the release date of this opus to the holidays...)I already have my copy of the newly remastered \\"Help!\\".

Both films were beautifully filmed and scored. \\"Help\\" had the addition of color and a fantastic little fantasy which, obviously, was helped along with some of the handier drugs of the day. It is truly a marvelous film and a great remembrance of the \\"joys\\" of that time. The smiles are adorable, the songs are great, and the \\"Ode to Joy\\" is so appropriate. My 3 nieces have been watching it now for about 25 years when they visit and always ask to see it again. It's a family tradition. Buy it. You'll like it. If you don't, watch it again.

I think it's rather funny on how Professor Foot, Algernon, and the Eastern thugs try to get the ring from Ringo. The songs are very good too.

When it was first released, the british critics & press panned it and with good reason.It is absolutely a nonsense film and everyone who is a big Beatles fan so there is no bias here.The only good thing is the music. Buy it, if you re a die hard fans only!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Help!' - but nothing can help it","review":"Sadly, one of my favourite Beatles albums (replete with strong melodic pop) contains the 'soundtrack' to an extremely disappointing cinematographic effort.After the innocent charm of 'Hard Day's Night', hopes were high that director Richard Lester would create another classic Beatles film.But everyone tried too hard, or perhaps, not hard enough. Lacklustre performances from the Beatles themselves (were they really interested?) and the stellar English supporting cast, a flimsy and laboured story, and an embarrassingly unfunny script leaves little to enjoy.For a slice (albeit a contrived one) of early 1960s Beatles life, watch 'Hard Day's Night'. Everything else, until the revealing documentary 'Let It Be' (when will it be released?) that bookended their career was a regrettable waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad dvd","review":"Rec'd this DVD in May (2010) It stopped playing in August.

Firstly, the original aspect ratio must have been FS because this 16:9 version often decapitates the band member at the top of the frame, as well as one of the opening credits. I guess \\"restored\\" means different things to different people. Secondly, the DTS sound is absolutely incredible. The music has never sounded this good. I'd repurchase the Beatles' catalog in DTS if it were available. As silly and juvenile as the movie is, the music makes it a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles at their Best!","review":"The Beatle's made this movie stupendous!

We sat down and watched it together -- what a hoot!It's definitely slap-stick humor with a thin story line tying the music together, which doesn't sound very positive, but it's funny. We are still referencing scenes in the movie to this day and we watched it about eight weeks ago.

It's back!","review":"I waited for a long time to get this DVD, not wanting to get a bootleg copy or pay a ridiculous mark-up on a copy someone wanted to flip. I saw this movie in a theatre in Biloxi, Mississippi in 1965 and thought it was hilarious at the time. The remastering is first rate and it was a joy to see it again. It's the kind of movie you have to listen to in order to catch all the dry humor. Of course, the album songs are true Beatles, and have a sound all their own. I know I'll watch it many times and I'm glad it's now in my video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS good as I remember,only with WAY better sound","review":"If you were around when this first hit the screen, you'll know what I mean.

I have perused a number of weight training books and this one, I feel, is one of the best. While most books go through weight training exercises utilizing equipment available only at a gym, this book uses only dumbells and a mat---perfect for an inexpensive home workout!!! I love the fact that the book presents a set workout (complete with pictures) and a diet menu for every day of the 3 weeks that your body is transformed. It also includes a weekly grocery shopping list of foods that are included in the daily menus. I definitely feel more toned and trim after 2 weeks. While I have yet to weigh myself, many people have commented that I look as though I've lost some weight. Yeah me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wanted to look a little better!","review":"I first found this at the library, and decided I needed it for \\"the long term\\", so purchased on Amazon.com.

Why didn't I do this earlier????The biggest plus - no expensive excercise equipment to buy, to take up space in my home. Dumb Bells are all you need. WOW - how refreshing.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different side of Phish","review":"This show is definately not for the average Phan. It is a whole different side of Phish that some people may be unable to appreciate. The Fukuoka Jams and the Twist Jam are full of keyboard oddities and intriguing sound effects. They are great explorations that could only have been pulled off in Japan. The Back on the Train and 2001 songs are well executed. If you already have a bunch of Phish albums, I suggest buying this one, because it is interesting to listen to and differs from many of their other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing non-tabloid journalistic look at rock","review":"Mark Rodgers and Andre Augustine shed a fresh new perspective on the world of rock music. They don't paint a glossy picture of these people. The author shows us that these people are not that different than the rest of us. They just have a different, and in some ways, more dangerous job than the rest of us. As a huge fan of rock music from a young age, I often wondered what it would be like to live on the \\"other side\\" of the fence. Mark and Andre allow the reader to live there, even for just a short period of time. For anyone who is a fan of rock music, this is a must read. You will definitely appreciate your musical roots after reading Guardian of the Gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast paced read with a strong narrative","review":"With a title like \\"Guardian of the Gods,\\" some rock fans might expect a cheesy expose'. But this book, by Andre Augustine and Mark Rodgers, turns out to be much more than that. Written in a concise, yet descriptive manner, this book shows that it's called *show business* for a reason. It takes a lot of sweat, blood and immense preparation to bring a rock and roll tour to your town. And keeping both the fans and the musicians safe is a daunting task. But according to Mark Rodgers, there is no one more prepared to do that than Andre Augustine, a former New York Jet who started out watching over legendary rappers Run-D.M.C. and N.W.A and who eventually became the glue that kept the 1996 KISS Reunion Tour together. Anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes of a music tour should pick up a copy of \\"Guardian of the Gods.\\" Very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful period children's book","review":"I have two copies of this wonderful book, one is signed by the author! She was a dear friend of my grandmother's. I find the whole book, from the binding to the story to the illustrations to be truly charming.

One day, her beloved little girl owner comes down with the measles, so she can't come out and play. So what does Susie do? She writes her a letter!

If you have read Beelzebub or Remarkable Men then there really is no need to waste your time lumbering through what can only be described as disjointed and stuttering translation. Perhaps the worst translation ever - which is saying alot considering Penguin's long lineage of word butchery. If you must read this - learn French and read the original or skip to the last third of the Penguin version. The last third is really the only information worth reading in either language. The first 100 or so pages has Gurdjieff is a rather false humility trying to matter a factly self grandize his life and work. Not the last taste of his remarkable ideas and life that you want on your lips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diamond in the rough","review":"Another uncompleted master work! - where have we encountered this before? Plato's Timaeus, Edmund Spenser's Faeire Queene, James Joyce's projected (and unwritten) fourth major volume after Finnegans Wake, Joseph Campbell's Atlas of World Mythology... Are we detecting a pattern here - that authors procrastinate? Nevertheless, though \\"incomplete\\" this book is important reading for anyone interested in the Gurdjieff Work. For example, Gurdjieff gives a representative psychological exercise:Pay attention to your right hand. Lay it flat. Begin to count to ten with one finger, while you observe the emotional state of a second finger, while simultaneously observing the physical sensations of a third. (What exactly *is* the emotional state of a finger, I still ask myself.)The book's biography is interesting but Meetings with Remarkable Men is better in that regard, and Views from the Real World covers more psychological ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished","review":"The reason why this book is incomplete is because Gurdjieff did not want his teaching to continue after his death. He understood that he did not prepare anyone that was trustworthy enough to carry it on. Groups that are in existance today are a testament to his worst fears. Gurdjieff was a very great man. Unfortunatelly those that are continuing the work against Gurdjieff's wishes are destroying and shaming this man's reputation. Stay away from anyone that claims to be the direct pupils of Gurdjieff or making any other ridicolous claims. Read these books as a legacy to Gurdjieff and what once was. I've heard of some people joining today's groups with the hope of finding a light at the end of the tunnel, that light turned out to be an oncoming train."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, You Won't Find It Here","review":"Back when the Third Series was hard to come by, people imagined --- based on rumor and hype, not the least of which from Gurdjieff himself -- that this volume would contain Gurdjieff's most significant teachings. You know, the stuff that SERIOUS and ADVANCED students of esoterica, like you, were looking for. The powerful methods that would enable you to do or be whatever it is you think you ought to do or be, other than what you already are (anything but that!) Well, keep looking, because the Third Series is pretty tame. No secrets. No mind-blowing methods. You won't be able to kill a yak at fifty paces after you read it. You'll just be back looking for that one book that will save you the trouble of self-remembering, not expressing negative emotions, etc., etc. Better to read Beelzebub's Tales that third time. Yeah, that'll do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One must 'see' to understand","review":"This book, as all of Gurdjieff's works, are meant to make you 'think'. There are a many great gems in this book. However, like a great 4th Way teacher, he doesn't just hand them out like candy. You have to have the eyes to 'see'.This book answered many questions for me, it was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Many of the tracks are severely marred by the presence of a high pitched whistle of the kind that induces tinnitus & this makes it difficult to appreciate the more subtle elements of the music which are, sadly, too brief. There is probably just enough good material for one CD. When I purchased the recording I had hoped to hear sounds that could not have been produced in any other way but this was not the case. Perhaps, as the insert notes assert, the machine might have performed better if subjected to an overhaul & it may be that the machine does not respond well to the scratchy images used. Since the machine scans the artwork linearly, it does not even come close to producing a sound that would be comparable to grasping the image as a whole in the fashion propounded by Gysin & Bourroughs. While this is asking too much of a machine with no artificial intelligence, I feel it is also asking too much to pay for the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"John: The Gospel of Belief","review":"The book \\"John The Gospel of Belief \\" is more important then many of the watered down messages given these in many Churches today.

Dylan McDermott gives an excellent performance as a writer who isn't going anywhere. Fate decrees he's to \\"live\\" in a house he's supposed to be selling, a house which was the scene of a brutal mass murder. Enter Tom Sizemore, equally impressive, as a strange, neurotic young man who claims to be the manager of a local grocery store. McDermott and Sizemore strike up a tenuous relationship, and as the movie unfolds, we're expecting some startling revelations...which never come to fruition. Is Sizemore the killer? Or is he just a lonely man looking for companionship? Add an icily cold performance by a young Sharon Stone as McDermott's bitchy editor and you have the ingredients for a tidy little thriller. But no souffle here folks. All the ingredients don't come together and you're left wondering just what you've spent 90 minutes with.Recommended only for the two male performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Happy Child: Changing the Heart of Education","review":"The Happy Child: Changing the Heart of Education book was listed at a fair price and arrived in a timely fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a neat concept!","review":"The nice thing about a compilation album is that you're pretty much sure to find some songs that suit your taste.

We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in!

The characters are so engaging you are captured from the first few pages. It takes place in the 10th century, when most of the world is experiencing the dark ages. Superstition, poverty and the black plague prevail. The seat of world knowledge is in Persia (Iran) and the young man protagonist is so driven to get real medical training he impersonates a traveling Jew on his trek from England to Persia. His experiences along the way are both interesting and engaging and the world he encounters is strange, exciting and profound.I would recommend \\"The Physician\\" to anyone who likes a great story and loves historical fiction.

I wished the book just went on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I have just finished reading \\"The Physician\\". I started reading it and although it is a 600+ page book I could not stop. Mr. Gordon writing style makes the reader walk on the hero's shoes.

It is impossible to forget : the travelling with Barber, the journey to Ispahan, the encounter with Mary, the contacts with the Shah and all it is implications.

It follows the life of a 1000 A.D. englishman who strives to become a physician. The best physicians are taught at a medical school in persia - but the school won't accept a christian. Therefore, he learns the ways of the Jews, and through this disguise he travels to Persia and becomes a Physician.The author does his best to capture 1000 A. D life in both Europe and Persia/Middle East. The book constantly shows the turmoil between christian/jewish/muslim friction, as well as the science vs religion aspect.Excellent read, difficult to put down. On occasion you may roll your eyes, but trust me - this is one of the better books I've read in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"Terrific read; couldn't put it down.

Raised by a travelling barber-surgeon, Rob J. decides to be a great physician. Problem: the best medical school is located in Persia. Problem: they don't much like Catholics in Persia. Solution: Rob J. masquerades as a Jew in order to attend the school. Through the seven or eight years he spends in Persia, Rob J. falls in love, gets married, has kids, gets some really great friends, meets up with the Shah, nearly gets killed, and discovers appendicitis. This book isn't gory despite its medical scenes, and is actually a really interested read if you like reading about long-time-agos or medical lore. Though most things I've read that have taken place that long ago are really difficult to read, this one wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Thsi book is my absolute favourite - its been about ten years since I read it but it is still vivid in my mind. I love the scope of the story - travelling from poor London, around the English countryside, then a massive journey to Persia and back. The story covers the beliefs of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The main character is driven in his pursuit of understanding of the human body and how to heal its ills. I have read the other books in the trilogy, but this is by far the best.

From that difficult and at the same time exciting beginning, the protagonist, Cole, goes on to travel the known world in his successful pursuit of medical training.By the end of this great novel, you will be eagerly anticipating reading \\"Shaman\\" the second part of this enthralling three novel series.

It's how to USE that word that is important to language students -- Professor Haugen's dictionary does a great job in handling issues of stress and inflection.I say again; absolutely invest in this dictionary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"I am in the process of translating a book written entirely in Norwegian and published in 1934 and this dictionary has been a lifesaver. It covers Bokml and Nynorsk and gives a brief, interesting history of the changes the language has undergone. Superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs reciprocity","review":"This book is EXCELLENT, however it lacks one thing: an English-Norwegian part. The one-sided aspect of this dictionary limits its use extremely for people like myself trying to learn the language!

It effectively covers BOTH varieties of modern Norwegian--Bokmal ['Book-talk'] and Nynorsk ['People-talk]. It does work only ONE way of course=>it defines Norwegian words in English, it does NOT define English words in Norwegian--for that, you'll need an English dictionary written by a Norwegisn. But if you're seriously studying Norwegian, this IS absolutely the book you NEED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norwegian-English Dictionary","review":"This Dictionary is complete and clearly defines the two languages of Bokmal and Nynorsk.

His focus on a colonial doctor as protagonist provides an interesting and different viewpoint on the battle. The protrayal of the British Officers including Howe and Clinton made them look to be more interested in their misstresses than the war. Perhaps that was historical.The climatic battle scene is first rate. Clinton's statement to console Howe after the destruction of his grenadiers that, \\"London does not count the bodies, just the victories\\" was very memorable.A good read but lacks that last bit of sparkle to get a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Great stuff.

I can see Wynonna crossing over onto other charts with this gem. Wy offers a bit of oldies with the remake of Burnin Love, we get a new sample of WY and Namoi singing together again, a bit of gospel and some deep soul searching tunes. Wynonna almost didn't make this cd I am sure glad she did three years with out new Wynonna music was something awful. I recommend this cd very highly you will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"WYNONNA = GREAT SOULFUL SINGER!!!","review":"In concert, Wynonna is a stunning soulful singer with no limitations!! Finally this broad scope is happening in the recording studio and all the better for us fans!! Wynonna is a classic voice who sings with a great deal of passion and a must-see concert experience that I have had the pleasure of experiencing numerous times and this is the real deal!! Originally this collection was going to be a really broad departure for Wynonna but scaled back to include old country feelings~still a step forward!!

Wy is simply amazing. Way to go Wy on another #1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wy back like never before!!!","review":"What a way to come back after 3 years!! Wy is back, this is a must have besides her 1st two (Wynonna, Tell Me Why). Although this is hyped up as Wynonna coming back to country music, you can't help but feel that Wy's cutting edge and rockin' country is going to be too much for the cookie cutter, bad lyrics, bad music, bad singing country radio. Wynonna does what she does best, rock with a country flair. You will not believe the heart she puts into Foreigner's \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", it's even better than the original. Her duet with Mama Naomi, entitle \\"Flies on the Butter\\" will absolutely take you back in time and fill you with nostalgia for a simpler time.I can't go through all of the songs but FOLKS, I tell you this is a must buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wy Has Never Sounded Better","review":"I have been a Wy fan for 20 years.

I loved this album the first time I heard it from song #1 through #14. This album shows not only good production, good song choice but truly shows Wynonna's powerful voice. This album has plenty of fast tempo songs as well as beautiful ballads. The Judd's FLIES ON THE BUTTER is just magnificent. I didn't find one song I wanted to pass over on this latest collection of songs. I always knew Wy had staying power but she just needed a little time! I highly recommend this album! My girlfriend who doesn't like country music likes it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Great Album!","review":"What can I say! Another great album from Wynonna. I've always loved her music.

There is wonderful mix of songs on this CD to truly show Wy's wonderful talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Wynonna, why .....?????????????","review":"Talk about being a dissenting voice : this marks the beginning of the end for me. I think she has one of the great original voices of the 20th century, a magnificent instrument honed through years of singing. But what I hear here is hubris (def. overbearing pride or presumption; arrogance). I find most of this album unlistenable. And hubris stems from a deep-seated emotional wound.I don't know what it is. All I know is that the incredibly sensitive singer of \\"She Is His Only Need\\" and \\"All Of That Love From Here\\" (to name two of my favorites) is not singing on this album.On a good note, the nuanced banjo playing of John Willis is the perfect counterpoint on \\"What The World Needs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted the ENTIRE Nardo Cd!.","review":"Her work with Nardo Micheal Walden is amazing, and sadly the complete cd planned didn't happen (WY choose to go back to Nashville...BIG mistake)Wy...Country don't feel women... unless your lap dancing Shania or \\"GOOD girl\\" Martina, COuntry radio will continue to pass your amazing talents!

The remaining flavors (one each) were: anise oil, clove oil, spearmint oil (also useless). The only true variety ones were bubble gum, cherry, root beer, butterscotch, Bavarian cream, grape, strawberry, raspberry, lemon, and cran-raspberry.

The Erdman and Ostriker editions at least attempt to give you what Blake wrote. Insofar as, in the illuminated works, the punctuation was Blake's own and not that of a drunken compositor, that seems an important consideration.(I went with the Erdman; the Penguin's notes are better in many ways, glosses rather than commentary, but Penguin books are so damn shoddy these days, & the Erdman is published as a book that'll bear some reading without falling apart. Look at the old 2dhand Penguins in used-book shops; few of today's Penguins will survive so long, I fear.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming in size and content - overused and heavily marked book","review":"This was my first William Blake book. First and foremost, the book was almost falling apart as it was so used and marked and written on the margins all over by the person before me and also the paper seemed old. This book should not have been sold. I think the previous owner wanted to let it go and did not know how as he had, it seems, a strong relationship with this book over the years. I could not look in it as it was overwhelming. I donated it to the local library.Also, I don't think this is a right book for someone who wants to be introduced to Blake and his poetry. That was another thing. But if the book was new, then I could have returned it. But it was not worth to spend more money to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding on many levels!","review":"This is truely a charming book. We love it! It is good for children of all ages.

This is the third counting book in the same genre by Jennifer Ward and Kenneth J. Spengler. The original, \\"Way Out In the Desert\\" and their most recent, \\"Somewhere In The Ocean\\" (personal favorite) are visually fun and young children quickly learn their numbers along with a little bit of nature's information. Young boys will especially love this counting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"My son and I came across this book in the public library.

This volume remains the best, basic introduction to the scope of the vast literature and how it developed over several hundred years. Collins takes just enough of a close-up to intrigue those who want to know more, but not overwhelm those who are just beginning.As I was doing my initial research on what became my own \\"Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now\\" (1999) this book was a steady guide.I'd also highly recommend Collins'Between Athens and Jerusalem: Jewish Identity in the Hellenistic Diaspora (The Biblical Resource Series)as well as hisJewish Wisdom in the Hellenistic Age (Old Testament Library).

After indtroducing us to the life of the rich, faboulus, and over privledged we have to have it sink it. Honestly the book was really good but filler.

And for lack of better words, this is a horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"relatively decent. a bit on the wild side.","review":"I found this book hard to read; or at least hard to read the entirity of it. I ended up skipping everything inside, with the exception of the chapters that featured Nate and Blair. Neither Dan or Vannessa can hold my interest, and Nate's 'girlfriend' is actually quite psycho. I could barely focus during the book, it didn't hold my interest like the majority of the other books did. I wouldn't reccomend it, unless you want to read every book in the Gossip Girl series. The vacation the gang takes is rather crazy, but why am i not surprised? Serena ends up naked, alone, and in the snow. Leaving Nate to find her and warm her back up. Blair almost loses it (again) to brother of Serena, Erik.throw in a gay snowboarding team, and Chuck - and you've got yourself a mediocre novel with crazy sub-plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable!","review":"I cannot believe how most people thought that this book was a bad read! If you enjoy the Gossip Girl series than this book is no exception. This books leads to the question that is burning in our minds \\"are Blair + Nate going to get back together?\\" and leads to the inevibilaty of the end.

This is the fifth book out of gossip girl and alot of things in this book are so bad that I have to skip alot of pages. I don't care about Dan and Vanessa anymore. Too boring and even worse when Vanessa's parents show up. Nate's girl friend is too retarded and too unbelievable to believe, and the gay snowboarding team? Are you kidding me? Why does Chuck of all guys become gay all of a sudden? It doesn't make any sense! I hate the character Rusty and I really hate Jenny. Snooping on her boyfriend like that all the time and that's all that happens with her in this book. Jennys friend Elise and Dan kiss. That was really stupid.

As such, the book, while generally accessible, is at a somewhat more advanced level than most of his other, more popular works. However, the extra intellectual effort required is well worth it, as the essays in this volume \\"tie up the loose ends.\\" The result is a convincing, deeply satisfying interpretation of the nature and scope of human knowledge, the extent and limits of science, and the proper place of theology as what Polkinghorne calls science's \\"cousin under the skin.\\" Perhaps the major achievement of the book is its demonstration of how both science and theology, despite postmodernist skepticism to the contrary, are fundamentally rational in character.

Several ridiculous plot lines converge at the strip club Exotica, and the only memorable moments in the film happen here, and I don't say that because of the strippers. The sound through most of the movie is awful, very hushed, forcing you to turn the volume up so loud that when the boom mike actually does pick up some of the characters' lines, you're sure to go deaf. Instead of coming across as an artsy film, it comes across as a jumbled mix of images and mumbled lines.

This is one of those \\"delicatessen\\" movies that a few people judge as good because some \\"real\\" reviewers (were they drunk?) judged as good,There isn't really anything interesting about it and there isn't anything that keeps you from wanting to watch it to the end (besides the question: when does this movie get cool?), so don't waste your time and money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Silly - Watch it as a Comedy","review":"Body Double was silly, but at least it delivered on some visceral thrills. This movie is one of the most wildly overrated films I've seen. Despite the implied advertising, there is not a single sexy scene in the entire movie. All of the characters are laughably moronic, filled with self-pity and timid perversity. The plot plods along in a coy, self-important way that may drive your thumb to crush the fast forward button. The ending purports to resolve a great mystery, but it delivers only a whimpering anti-climax. If you're looking for a sexy drama, try Dangerous Liaisons, or even Hot Spot or Swann in Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this trash","review":"I was browsing movies on Amazon looking for something new and different to watch, using customer reviews to decide if it might be worth my time or not. When the movie started, I already knew this one was a mistake. I sat through the whole thing (another mistake) and in the end I felt very cheated out of a buck and a couple hours of my life I could of spent doing something else.The acting, characters, script, and plot were pathetic. The climatic ending that people keep mentioning wasn't a big deal at all. This movie was not artistic as some claim. It wasn't thrilling or suspenseful. It was just a bad attempt at a bad story with bad actors.

The characters all act like philosophers by that everything they say is analytical coupled with music. The speed at which they talk is horrendously slow. About 60 percent of the movie is music and facial expressions and 40 percent is dialogue. It has the feel of Lolita but don't confuse it with that fine film. The stripper in this movie is decent but not that great. She doesn't say much but then again that can be said of all characters. ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy to burn in my woodstove","review":"This movie was atrocious.

Why in the world would you omit such a large part of the music content from this soundtrack unless you were just too cheap to pay the extra royalties involved.

It is the story of a seemingly happily married couple whose marriage breaks down on each end. He has an affair, and she becomes involved in religion, something he as an athieist cannot embrace. The story is told with a light and humorous tone, yet all along St. John makes us think about the temporariness of our lives, how seemingly permanent things can change based on seemingly meaningless events. The characters are humorous, all sort of exaggerations, at times, of people we all know.If you are looking for something light, but would like to think a bit, I recommend this book. It is entertaining and easy to read, yet still thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I picked up this book because The Wall Street Journal gave it a good review. I'm not sure why. It's a very short 230 pages, and can be read in a couple of hours; it has a very light tone, almost flippant in the handling of the main character's affair. Serious subject, light tone - they don't often go well together, and they don't here. There are issues that are brought up (religion, for instance) that are not explored to the depth they deserve. The author is British, and those unfamiliar with English culture will surely be confused at certain social references (for example, the subject of the parish jumble is mentioned several times). Also, the author has an annoying way of starting chapters with dialogue that is not attributed to specific characters, forcing the reader to backtrack once a character is identified to find who said what. Perhaps I'm too used to the gravity of the Oprah line of novels, because I didn't like the fact that I didn't take anything away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Boy- Stephen Houston, TX","review":"First Boy by Gary Schmidt was a good book. It is exciting and I would recommend it to many teenagers. However, the only setback would be that the story has been told to many times. If you like the classic story of a boy who finds out he is famous, almost like in Harry Potter, then this book is for you. Although it is a common storyline, Schmidt can still make it interesting, and tells the story very well. He adds excitement and uses many aspects, such as the fact that the boy does not want to be famous, to make it more original. The book is fun because Cooper, the main character grew up as a farm child, and before his adventure had never left his home state of New Hampshire. Cooper just wants to be left alone on his farm but with the huge scandal around him it is very hard. It is fun to see the worlds of big-city politics and rural farms collide. Even though the predictable storyline, the book is fun and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film needs to come to dvd","review":"Great caper flick is many good things .

I'm from Peru and I expected a sharp, original account. Instead, I learned lots about the author and her struggles with my country. I understand her frustrations but in the end I felt that she simply realized that Peru is not Berkeley or Manhattan. It's too bad she didn't capture good things such as people's resourcefulness or sense of humor. I also got lost between different sections. Too bad. I know that many gringos will enjoy this. Peruvians will dislike it, even those who fight against violence and inequality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking coherence","review":"I read this book in anticipation of an upcoming trip to Peru. I hoped to gain some historical and cultural perspective to help me understand and appreciate the country. My goals were not met. Instead, I learned about injustice, corruption, prejudice, violence,and poverty. While I understand that these problems are real I didn't understand them in light of the history and development of the country of Peru. The author provides accounts of interviews and experiences in a haphazard manner with little contextual background or effort to pull them together in a coherent way. So, if your goals are similar to mine I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"Disappointing, to say the least! Within the first couple of pages, I found mis-transcribed words, e.g. for \\"comment\\", this book represents both syllables as having the same vowel sound.

Otherwise we're very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning about instruments","review":"I recently bought this book because I had wanted to teach my preschoolers about the different instruments. This book works for preschoolers on up to about 3rd grade. The tracks go along with sections in the book that are specific to that part of the music and the animal it portrays. The text can be modified to meet your needs and the language was just right for my 3 and 4 year olds who soon were able to catch on to the instruments they were hearing. Later when I put the CD on for them they would stop and yell out the animal or instrument they were hearing. I am glad to have this in my collection for future classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but confusing","review":"I think it is a lovely book, and the cd is wonderful, but completely confusing. The track numbers are off, and maybe worse than I know... There are 15 pieces for the Carnival, not 14 like it's listed in the book.... and the rest of the songs aren't even mentioned in the book, so I have no idea what they are.

And since she is just barely learning to read, the large, colorful illustrations helped her follow along by herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good classical music book w/CD for youngsters","review":"Completely enjoyed by our 2 year old and his parents. Pictures are absolutely beautiful. Having the CD is useful. Each of the 14 tracks has a beautifully illustrated 2 page spread, which makes it easy to follow the music - the book and music work very well together. The text, which is written in a perfectly simple and direct and short manner so as to render it very useful, helps the listener focus on different aspects of the music and appreciate the music by putting it in terms we could understand more easily (e.g. for the Lion's March - \\"the strings are playing the lion's marching tune as he walks...Sometimes he roars loudly. Can you hear the pianos playing the lion's roar?\\") Our toddler loves classical music but this is a great choice for any child or adult. The entire package - the CD, the format of the book, the pictures and the text - really make this a great way of experiencing the music and just a plain good old story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the best books I have seen on Saint Sans' Carnival of the Animals.

But when it comes to small spaces, it seems any home will do even if it's 3000 square feet. \\"Small spaces\\" is obvious a relative concept, depending on what you're used to. To me, a small space is any home which has a decided lack of closets, or storage areas. Bedrooms are small and difficult to make functional; children have no basement to play in, the kitchen has a puny eating area, etc. There wasn't a single picture in this book which impressed or inspired me.To show readers pictures of homes which appear large, airy, and identical to any home found in any design magazine, is just not useful at all. I highly recommend Taunton Press' Storage Idea Book - it is inspirational and jam packed with great visuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Photos, But Difficult Reading","review":"I gave this 4 stars on the wealth of large, colorful photos and the ideas you can get from those.Had to knock off one star for the difficulty of reading the text. Sentences 25 to 35 words long are difficult to digest (and I have a masters degree). The photo captions are grouped together, forcing the eye to jump back and forth trying to see what is being described. Even the picture captions are such dense text that they require re-reading to figure out what the author is saying. By page 100, I'd abandoned the text and just examined the photos.There are some great ideas to be gleaned from this book. I liked the sliding mirror that revealed a television inset into a bedroom wall. Also great was the hidden storage in stair treads. It's too bad that the text just didn't flow well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betty Boop Seat Covers","review":"I was hoping for better quality. They don't fit well and the material isn't of very good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful","review":"The Sat II Math Flash is a great way to get prepared for the Sat II Math 1 and 2. Two of the tests are included, which really helps to study. I really liked the format of the book. I scored a 780 on the math practice test thanks to this great study aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"With a title like \\"Symphonic Impressions of Oman,\\" I was expecting to hear some Middle Eastern sounds mixed into symphony orchestra renderings. Instead, it just sounds like generic symphony orchestra music, like any 19th century orchestral work. It's okay as far as that goes, but if you're looking for Middle Eastern flavors, I suggest Claude Chalhoub's album instead. It's not full symphony, but at least it's instrumental violin-led tracks that do have a Middle Eastern flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"I thought this CD would have some Omani traditional music blended in symphonic music, it was not. Neither \\"impressions\\" of Oman were in this CD nor middleeastern music for that matter. So do not be decieved by the titile, this is a UK orchestra with no Omani or arabic tone to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I was in hopes that this would be worth while watching, but it's pretty bad all around.Bad acting.(English/Japanese versions.)Bad animation which reminds me of crappy U.S. cartoons.(no offense intended to Bugs show and friends here)I bought it because I am a captain Harlock fan. But, he was portrayed very badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Beatle","review":"This film has no involvement, musically or otherwise from the Beatles, except for archival newsreel footage. The idea is that its director will turn ex reporter Ruth Anson's idea to re-connect with Paul McCartney after he made a facetious marriage proposal to her during an interview decades ago into a joke on Anson's age, desperation and \\"out of it-ness\\". Supposedly Anson is in on the joke but it seems more like she was too deeply invested in the project and too fearful of not seeming like a good sport to withdraw when it took that change in direction. The positive reviews on this site must have come from people involved in the project. The film is tedious and boring. It is never ever funny and it is despicably mean. To try to ameliorate its cruelty by claiming it to be a mockumentary is a futile and transparent gesture. There is absolutely nothing here for fans of the Beatles, music or film. A complete and utterly vile undertaking that should never have seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!","review":"The only thing worth seeing was the 15 second interview footage where Paul replies \\"only if you marry me\\" after being asked if he has any plans to marry. My husband is a diehard Beatles fan and was very excited to get this. He loves anything Beatles or Beatle related and very rarely dislikes songs, documentaries, cover groups etc. However, even he was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Californio Testimonies","review":"As someone very interested in Califonia colonial history, I was anxious to read this book. To learn the historical perspective of the Californios was of particular interest to me. Although the book quotes heavily from various testimonials of early Californios (such as Coronel, Vallejo, Lugo, etc.), it contains much not from the Californios. The author shares much of her feminist, anti-church, politically correct, anti-colonial, and marxist views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me...?","review":"I found this book to be relentlessly wretched: An endless stream of negativity as an abusive 'mother' lies to and disappoints her children, exposing them to pain and danger. The payoff of Angel overcoming a bad situation was not impressive enough to warrant the emotional meat-grinder you have to go through to get there. \\"Engaging\\" in the same way that rubber-necking a fatal car wreck is 'engaging'(for those to whom it is). \\"Bad\\" should not be mistaken for \\"deep.\\" I don't care what awards it has won, be willing to admit this emperor has no clothes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my tirade on cover art","review":"OK, you would think that Katherine Paterson is famous enough to get decent cover art on her books.

Is the story line a bit difficult to believe? Sure, but who cares! The sexual tension is electric. The heroine is mouth-wateringly delicious as she is manipulated from one embarrasing predicament to another by her merciless, very dominant, and very aroused neighbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled.

I am returning it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi-Quality Sound Bytes...","review":"If what you're looking for is a collection of really well-recorded clips of a single chorus of each of 48 great big band tunes - this is the CD for you. Tragically, I failed to read the reviews before purchasing this item, and the \\"track\\" list led me to believe I was getting the whole thing -- shame on me. As always with Enoch Light, the quality of the performances and of the recording are exceptional. Unfortunately, there's only enough to whet your appetite; it certainly didn't accomplish my intended replacement for vinyl recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I highly recommend this seller.","review":"I bought this cd which as it turns out was only short excerpts of songs.The seller was contacted and immediately refunded my money. \\"Just keep the cd.\\" he advised.Well, I tossed the thing.

Unfortunately, this book - with the same title as the audio course, and denoted as being the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" no less, seems to contain about 10% (maybe less) of the audio program content.

I would not suggest using this type of wine rack unless you anchor it to the wall. There are 4 easy anchor points to contend with. It is preassembled and easy to install. It comes complete with the mounting hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap & Unstable","review":"Very disappointed. Very cheap construction - this thing must have cost a few dollars to build. Wobbly and unstable. Unattractive. And you really have to screw it into the wall to use it. I'm not trusting my wine to this, definitely not at this price. This is the first thing I'll ever return to Amazon after 100's of orders - the first time reviews have led me astray."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts, not response from customer service","review":"I was unable to use the rack, so i can't comment on its effectiveness.

We got it fast and was exactly what he needed for a college class."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for die-hard Paxton fans","review":"Are you the type of Bill Paxton fan (like myself) who admires the actor so much that you are driven to see movies like \\"Thunderbirds\\" and \\"Spy Kids 2\\" simply because he is in them? If so, then you will definitely want to check out this amateurish anthology flick, which features Paxton as a nutjob who preys on weak college students to find a place to live. It's not exactly Paxton at his finest, but then, he's got fairly terrible material to work with, so you can't fault him too much.The premise is that customers at a Virtual Reality psychology clinic have nightmares while they are undergoing whatever procedure they are undergoing. Possibly this is based on a comic book, as someone is holding a comic named \\"Future Shock\\" during a short behind-the-scenes in the special features. Does it matter? No. This is a bad movie no matter where its sources lie.Paxton fanatics, check it out. Everyone else, donate the money you were going to spend to charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Paxton Rocks!","review":"Sometimes Bill Paxton accepts suckie-movie roles obviously for the big-studio paycheck (such as Disney's dreadful \\"MIGHTY JOE YOUNG\\" or the painfully bad \\"MORNING STAR\\"). But occassionally Paxton appears in really cutting edge entertainment just for the craft (i.e. \\"NEAR DARK\\") and is this case \\"FUTURE SHOCK.\\" Granted, some viewers might not like the three-part structure of this independent thriller. But for pure entertainment, you can't find better than Paxton's super-dark and hilarious turn as the demented ROOMMATE. This is really classic stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hammock Bag","review":"Even though a hammock bag is a necessity to help preserve your hammock, this one fails due to the fact that you have to stuff the hammock in from the end. I was hesitant to purchase this item as a better design would be a side entry with zipper and even a shoulder strap to carry. It is very difficult to insert and even remove the hammock from the bag (especially since the weight of the hanging rings and chain is at the mid point at the bag and falls to the bottom)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Textbook, In great condition!","review":"This book came in a very timely manner and was just what I was looking for; great condition, no dogears, the spine was intake, and all the pages were in the book.

They might have omitted 1 or 2 and i can't think of which ones they are. Ohh, the video You Could Be Mine is not here, and thats a crying shame because it's a cool vid flick. Anyway, all their epics from Illusion CD's are here. November Rain, Estranged, and Don't Cry among other videos from both those albums. Patience from Lies and Sine I Don't Have You from the Spag. Incident are also included. But the real keepers are their most awesome videos off of Appetite. Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child of Mine and Paradise City are worth owning alone. They all bring back fond, bittersweet memories of what metal and videos were like in the Rockin' 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very cool","review":"This video is totally awesome. It has the best of GN'R all squished onto this nice little video. It has 13 of the videos, from \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to \\"Patience\\" to \\"Since I Don't have You\\" and just about everything in between.

The sound is just horrible, unbearable.The sound is too harsh, contains a lot of treble, it seems like it's over-compressed or something, and then they have raised the high frequencies.

All I could say was, \\"Boys, finish your pancakes, we have a nasty review to write\\". And that is what I am presently doing.

It has videos from their early days of their debut album \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" all the way up to their album \\"The Spaghetti Incident\\". You can also see their trilogy of videos which include videos such as \\"Don't cry\\", \\"November Rain\\" and the epic track \\"Estranged\\" and a few rare videos that were barely shown on TV.

Also not a fan of \\"Gaden of Eden\\" in which Axl tries to sing as fast as humanly possible for no apparent reason. Otherwise it's exceptional.If you're reading this you almost certainly view GN'R as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. I'd rate Axl as one of my two favorite male singers/performers. Bruce Dickinson is the only guy I feel can manage to surpass Axl's stunning talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gunners Collection","review":"I've loved this band since the early 1990s, and to have a DVD with virtually all the videos to their greatest songs on it is a must have for my collection.

Axl has a unique and unmistakeable voice while Slash would have to be rated up there as one of the greatest lead guitarists of all time.Long live Guns n' Roses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to my collection","review":"I could give it a 5 star rating but it has only dolby 2.1 stereo sound, i just wish it has a 5.1 or a dts option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection, but no extras","review":"First off, this DVD is a great collection of pretty much all of the Guns'n'Roses videos I remember watching on MTV (and \\"The Garden\\"...which I don't remember ever seeing, but whatever). The videos are as amazing now as they were when I was a kid. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is the only video missing, which I imagine is because it had clips from Terminator 2, and there was probably something about rights. Anyway, the only really disappointing thing about this collection (which it seems is everyone's peeve with this DVD) is that there are absolutely NO extras on this disc. No commentaries, no making-of featurettes, not even a still gallery. Kinda sparse, if you ask me, but you can't argue with Guns 'n' Roses."},{"rating":"2","title":"another must have","review":"Le seul reproche, c'est qu'il n'ont pas rajout�� You could be mine.

It's a shame because I would really like to have these videos on DVD, however I will be returning this 2nd copy and demanding a full refund. If you bought a copy of this DVD and the audio isn't messed up, hang onto it because you're lucky. I did notice after the fact that there are some other reviews from people that had the same problem with their copy. So buy at your own risk.(...): Exchanged once again because refund was refused.

Extremely well written, the book is both educational and entertaining. I'm personally convinced that the market approach advocated by the author must be considered by anyone who is involved in the very serious business of speculation. Clearly this book is a classic.

(doubt doubt doubt doubt....)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of Challenges -- a challenge to use it!","review":"The format of the book is less useful. I was expecting something closer to a Monster Manual but for traps, and I was disappointed. Each \\"challenge\\" is formatted like a mini-encounter rather than a single trap or puzzle explained. Some challenges are 2-3 pages long. I prefer a bit more quick-use format structure so I can just pull out the encounter and plop it into my adventure just like a monster from the Monster Manual. I prefer Traps & Treachery by Fantasy Flight Games which has that type of structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Having leafed through this book at the local bookstore my first impression was that it didn't have much to offer. I was ordering the Monster Manual II and figured I would get this as well to get the free shipping. With the savings in shipping I didn't pay much for this book, but I should have just paid shipping. My first impression was right. Anyone with any imagination at all can come up with stuff as good as this. I have owned the book for a couple of months and haven't used a single thing out of it. If you have ever run a game, or watched a good fantasy movie ( or Indiana Jones for that matter ) you don't need this book.

Even so, I'm still satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to both authors","review":"Based upon listening to this program, I'm not inclined to hear any more of what either guy has to say. Dyer takes the first half - starting with a long, metaphorical story before s-l-o-w-l-y filling out his time to (finally!) state that you need a firmly fixed idea of what you DO want, because concentrating on eliminating negatives in your life only gives them more power/energy from those thoughts.

However, these were the issues I had with this item. The first things is the the netting on the end pocket is very thick (the rope used could be much, much thinner, this thick rope is cumbersome and unnecessary). Also, the spaces between the netting is way too large, anything I put in the pocket, just falls right through onto the floor, such as keys (not a good thing, unreliable pocket). Also, I expected some kind of side pouch/pocket with several little compartments inside, for like a gym card, jewelry or pad lock. There was none. Only the two pockets. The zippered one on one end and the horrible netted pocket on the other side.

Very Pathetic","review":"This is the worst attempt by the people at Oxford. I am a big fan of all of their books and series but this one needs to be redone. The writing by all of the authors is terrible and no detail is given. While it is tough to cover the whole history of the country in one book this one fails miserably. Not only do you not even get a sense of how Italy developed you is left wondering what the point was. It does not leave you wanting more information in a good way but just disappoints. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Separate Essays create confusion","review":"I was very disappointed with this book, because it isa compilation of scholarly articles all written ina verbose convoluted style. The articles do not flow smoothlyand the book is not to be read as a history flowing from one chapter to another. I do not feel this is a useful history of Italy. It is not an easily understood survey, and the writings expect too much previous knowledge of the history of Italy to be appealing to a beginning reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vast subject, great book!","review":"How can anybody really expect to survey the history of Italy in one volume? Arguably, Oxford is one of the few publishers audacious enough to give it a damn good go, and the effort succeeds admirably. This is, from necessity, a densely written but also nicely illustrated book, which spans the entire political, cultural and social history of a turbulent country and its many different peoples and invaders. Holmes is at his best on the Renaissance, particularly on the early decades of sublime art produced before the overblown muscularity of the Sistine Chapel and St Peter's. But this history is not just the story of Caesars and Medici, as are so many others. It traces the complex political development of the country we now know as Italy, which was, after all, in the making for over 2000 years. Highly recommended, even if you only look at the pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"damn im not a freaking historian","review":"Granted, italian history is not one of the easiest histories to understand, but the geniuses at oxford could have done a better job bringing the history down to a level us mere mortals can understand. they talk about the stuff like I have already studied it, like its just a review.

I borrowed this book from my local library, but now intend to buy it so that my children can read it and we can discuss the experiments suggested in the book.

John Paul II was a bad guy - bad organizer, bad administrator, not democratic (not listening to vox populi regarding abortion, contraception and such issues), conservative, and was not considering USA the Most Important Place In The World. The most riduculuous statement was that He didn't issued personal apology for sexual abuses done by American priests.Giving only one star because I am not sure whether it is technically possible to give no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and Complex","review":"This program provides an enlightening and complex view of Pope John Paul II's life in a way that shows his extensive involvement in world affairs... including his integral role in creating & leading the non-violent movement that intensely assisted in the dissolution of the USSR, as well as his role in fighting anti-semitism within the church.Not a simple fluff piece, this is a superb program for really understanding the dynamics of his unbelieveable career. His victories as well as his failures are explored in depth, and the result is the creation of a really well honed complex exploration of one of the greatest men of our time.I highly recommend it to all, and I comment ABC News for assembling such a rich documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of free TV","review":"The material and presentation are decent, but this look at Pope John Paul is basically a ABC free broadcast from quite a while back, transfered to DVD-- and asking for your money. Some of the bonus features are strong (tho, again, rehashed TV), but Diane Sawyer in the Papal Apartments is typical annoying Diane: the focus is all on her, not the Vatican and certainly not John Paul II. A better bet is NBC's DVD, \\"NBC Presents: The Life of Pope John Paul II\\" -- with fresh material created just for DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a biased, negative account of one of the greatest figures of the 20th century - focusing a disproportionate amount of time on the Pope's alleged failings: clergy sex scandal, contraception, ordination of women, refusal to step down for health reasons...

I found it to be totally enchanting. I found Rachel to be a little firecracker--full of spunk. Kristy on the other hand was a quiet, frumpy woman who discovered her sexuality in the arms of her preacher. I felt sorry at first for Rachel's son, Chip, who (in my eyes) appeared to be a small, frail boy looking for love. He found that love and acceptance, after many disagreements, in the arms of his future stepfather, Gabe. I especially liked the epilogue--everyone found happiness at last.All in all, I would heartily recommend this book. This was one of the best books I've read. I could'nt put it down. I stayed up and read halfway into the night. I'm in search of all of SEP's books now. I'm a reader for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twelve years later.......","review":"Even though this book is over twelve years old, in my opinion, it's one of the best romance novels written. We read romance novels because we love our \\"happily ever afters.\\" And SEP delivers the happily ever after, but first she hurts us. Gabe lost his wife and child in a tragic accident and feels unable to love again. Rachel's love for Gabe heals him, but not without some drama. Gabe resents Rachel's son.

She used to write serious, sexy, well-plotted books. Now she writes so-called romantic comedies. Lady Emma and Kenny, are two very superficial people. Add to that,a lack of plot, a lack of sexual tension, and there's nothing for me to enjoy about this book. I can read about Texas in textbooks, or even in SEP's previous books. It may be Avon's fault, but I've bought my last book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read...","review":"I enjoy all of Susan Elizabeth Phillip's books - some more than others. This was one of the \\"others.\\" I enjoyed the story overall, but didn't enjoy the plot as much; it was a little slow-paced for me. I felt the attraction between the hero and heroine, but it didn't sizzle as much as in her other books.

Rachel Stone has to bear the brunt of the townspeople's anger for her deceased husband's transgressions. Gabe Bonner is trying to overcome the loss of his family. These two characters did not come together in the most romantic of ways but it was realistic and unfolded naturally.

She has two US releases, \\"Cactuses\\" and \\"Somebody Else\\", the former being difficult to find. The title single from \\"Somebody Else\\" does sound Madonna-\\"Ray of Light\\"-esque (which is certainly not a bad thing), but is supported by an album full of very good tracks, different in nature, but complementary in style. A very strong vocalist, the feel on this album is in-line with 90's style \\"alternative\\" female artists, without the \\"anger\\". A single pass-thru listen was enough to make me seek out her other albums. Amazon has samples of all tracks on this album you won't be disappointed with a complete listen-thru.

I was spinning and slamming and played on offense alot, so after a ton of begging my Dad finally decided to get me this paddle.Boy what a difference, compared to the stiga and this its a night and day difference. I find my spins more effective and easier to see, my serves and returns are harder to hit back and faster. But the highlight is the slamming capabilities of this beast.

I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. It took a few hours of play before we felt comfortable with these rackets.We haven't tried any of the other $50 range rackets, so maybe they are all this good.

However, I know how much younger children, especially girls, admire the kindergarten superheroes. When I was given this cd to add to my Internet radio show library, I was a bit confused because I didn't know if I would be able to play any of the songs. After listening to the album, my confusion was abated and I have played several of the songs on my show.About half the songs have nothing to do with the television show the album is \\"inspired by\\". Those songs are on the album solely because the musicians are female. The other half of the songs are truly inspired by the television show. The songs I especially enjoyed were:\\"Rocket Candy\\"\\"Buttercup (I'm a Super Girl)\\"\\"Super Secret City of Soundsville Song\\"\\"Powerpunk End Theme\\"The styles of music range from pop, to some rhythm and blues, to some light punk.Overall, this album would make a nice gift for any Powerpuff Girls fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the videos from Plastilina Mosh !","review":"This is one fantastic DVD, the commentary from the band is hilarious!

I wouldn't miss a Jane Jeffry mystery novel, but this is something that even a fan like myself can pass on. This book is lacking in plot and concentrates too much on the gardening. The mystery is mentioned in the beginning, and seems to falter off as the story slowly wears on. With a few mentions every twenty pages or so, the mystery seems to be forgotten.

I hated every track on here. To me it's just noise, better than other noise bands, but still noise. I wouldn't even call this stuff metal. I'm sure some who like the first release will still like this, it is weird and somewhat unique sounding, but for me it's just creative noise. The members of this band also managed to aid in making Extol lame as well, Extol became lame after Undeceived and got worse with each release. You could probably even consider The Kiss, the Hope a screamo album, it's certainly lousy enough to qualify. I advise anyone who liked the first album to listen to this one before buying it first, you may be disappointed and it always sucks wasting money on a dud album (such as this). To sum it up, this album sounds like 3 talented guys got high on multiple drugs and recorded the jam session.

Vivie is convienced her mother could have made a better choice for herself than prostitution. Mrs. Warren has kept Vivie out of the brothels all of her life and gave her the best in education and up bring. But even though she has done all of that Vivie is not content on being there any longer with her mother. End the end Vivie leaves her mother and Mrs. Warren holds her self together unappoligic for anything she has done. This play was a great example of how women had two choices at the time the play was set in marriage or prostitution which were both forms of slavery. Shaw knew how hard it was for women in society and wanted more for them, than just mother hood and marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insight","review":"This is a play, the characters are good, the reaction to the profession would probably be the same today, the book makes a wonderful discussion topic and it's a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"As other reviewers have said, the secondary characters are better developed and mean more to the reader than the two main characters. I found myself more interested in the story of Estelline and Ruth than Dani and Grace.The writing style is also average. It doesn't take much thought to read this, but I guess sometimes you're in the mood for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this solid, entertaining story. The best books both show you a world you aren't familiar with and yet make you identify and sympathize with the characters. Lori Lake succeeds on both counts. As a gay man, I haven't read a lot of lesbian fiction and Ricochet in Time makes me think I need to read more. Let me see, however, that I even hesitate to classify this book as \\"lesbian\\" fiction. It's simply fiction and damned good fiction at that.It's especially difficult for a writer to get a reader to sympathize with a prickly main character, yet I was rooting for Dani all the way. And the supporting cast is terrific as well, a circle of friends I'd like to know. Pick this book up and I guarantee you won't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I liked Gun Shy very much, but this book isn't up to that standard, at all. The early relationship (Meg and Dani) is not well developed or believable, although the relationship between Dani and Grace is much better. I found the main characters somewhat shallow and unremarkable, especially compared to the secondary characters. The ending is very unrealistic. Other reviewers seem to be focusing on the hate crimes aspect of the book. I didn't feel that the topic was handled very well. I continue to be interested in this author's works, but this book was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your formula romance","review":"this is a very sweet and affecting novel about a young woman's complicated mending-process, following a hate-crime that is like the externalization of the deep psychic traumas that have shadowed her since high school. Dani is a tough and vulnerable heroine, and her unanticipated rescuers, if a bit too good to be true (but they have to be, to get through Dani's defenses) are so completely defined, with such a wealth of ambient detail, that they're totally irresistible. The political message is gracefully folded into the people story, and the love-story really grows on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided and stilted relationship","review":"I found myself more interested in the supporting characters (Estelline and Ruth) than Dani. Understandably Dani has closed off her heart and person after the cruel loss of her lover by a vicious homophobic attack. Into her world of pain and emptiness comes a compassionate nurse, Grace, who Dani reluctantly turns to as a companion more than a girlfriend.In fact Dani seems to relate better to Grace's Aunt and partner than she does to Grace as she becomes a part of Estelline and Ruth's family.While Ms. Lake did a great job portraying the devastating effects of a dynsfunctional childhood and homophobia carried to the max; the interaction between Dani and Grace is flat. Grace becomes a plot ploy to introduce the aunt and her companion who are the true role models in this story. While Dani does once again regains her inner strength and asserts her sexuality, her relationship with Grace is left wanting. This story has its riveting moments, but overall it is uneven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping for better","review":"The story seemed promising. The writing seemed decent if not outstanding. The characters had potential. But something went wrong.The characters turned out to be wooden and never developed beyond the surface. After awhile, the dialogue became boring and trite. The story meanders on with frequent pointless details.Maybe my expectations were just too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must for Star Trek fans!","review":"It's funny to read the other reviews and that the swing slows down. Our experience has been just the opposite - that the swing has 2 speeds: stop and warp 9! (Thank goodness for the safety harness!)

I used it anyway, even though it would often stop swinging, and when my son was old enough to move his head and lean over, his head banged on the metal railing holding the swing.

So many devices take batteries, it's expensive and bad for the environment. The AC also charges an internal rechargeable battery so you have the option of running the unit on DC if not near a power source. Lacks the option to recline seat and no head support for wobbly new born heads. Rolling up blankets and placing on each side of the head aids in support and having the child sit on a blanket keeps him higher so that his head stays back and his chin does not end up in his chest. Improvement needed here from Fisher. Nice option that mobile animals swing out of the way when entering and exiting the child, would be nice if mobile would go a little lower, small children are oblivious that it's there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Long","review":"I bought this becuase it seemed to be everything I wanted. Great price, multi-speed, the ability to plug into an outlet. Unfortunately, its ability to swing began degrading after the first week, and now barely moves (its been in use periodically for a about 1 month). I will say it did put her to sleep pretty well, but her head would flop over (I also didnt realize it reclined until reading these reviews... which is not the swings fault). Anyway, I'm returning the swing to Target fior a refund since it no longer swings. May look into a graco or the FisherPrice 3 stage swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 4 days","review":"This swing is such a great idea, but unfortunately it really is not well built. The design is well conceived, but the craftsmanship is shoddy. I first noticed as I assembled it that the plastic used to build it was flimsy and cheap. After only 4 days of use on the lowest speeds (I have a preemie, so he really doesn't require that much out of the motor) the swing literally stopped working on any of the six settings. After reading other reviews of fisher price swings, I would not recommend this manufacturer to any one; it appears that they simply don't make quality products, however creative their ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Function, Okay Looks","review":"The songs are nice. I'm glad there is volume control. And I am over the moon that it doesn't require batteries! I've used it with two babies now, and it was a winner with both. Just wish it has more attractive to the adult eye. But the kids seemed fine with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third and winning swing for us!","review":"This is the last swing I will buy. It has won over a Graco that was too fast and the motor burned after a week, and a Cosco that was cheap and only one speed worked. It has gentle swinging that doesn't go too high, the plug in feature is great and we haven't zapped the motor, it's a lot easier to get our baby in and out than the others, it's very quiet, and the blue color is very tame to fit our decor. I feel confident our baby isn't getting motion sickness in this swing. So far, so good and I hope this swing keeps up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Brief Sun\\" A Review","review":"In his beautifully crafted book \\"The Brief Sun\\" Robert Ambros tells the story of 16 year old Andrzej and his companions in a Northern Siberian labor camp in 1941, and beyond. Mr. Ambros has the unique gift of describing his characters fully formed. The reader can almost see them, touch them, and understand the motives for their actions, as well as get into their minds. That is the mark of a true story teller! In spite of the pathos of the era, his matter-of-fact telling of the story makes it an easy to read book. His descriptions of fear, cold, hunger, loss, guilt and immense sorrow are offset by tales of the closest cameraderie, the desolation and beauty of the various landscapes Andrzej encounters, and the hunger for, and finding of first love. This story, told with passion, is rich in historical detail, and should become required reading in every modern history class. I highly recommend it to anyone, today and in the future!Mr. Ambros is a surgical pathologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy","review":"An absolutely amazing novel. A wonderful mix of historical fact with a thrilling tale. A movie should be made of this incredible journey.

This will be staying on my shelves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and enjoyable","review":"I think I can add very little to the reviews already submitted on this work. That said, I do have one additional observation. If you are familiar with Dr. Lienhard's radio program, you have a taste of what is in store in this book. However, freed from the constraints of time that radio necessarily places, Dr. Lienhard is able to draw broader conclusions and connections among his many subject matter. As a result, anyone expecting to read simple transcripts of the radio program is in for something else. Ideas developed separately in different radio essays are allowed to mingle and merge; to cross-pollenate and create a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. It requires greater commitment from the reader, but the experience is more rewarding for it. While the ideas can sometimes be difficult to follow, this book is a marvelous glimpse of the mind at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look like a printed book, but a b/w photocopy","review":"I bought this Bible for an elderly person that can't read english, so I was very excited about the book. It took around 10 days to arrive. When I opened the box I realized that is not a regular printed book, is more like a photocopy (not very good quality) from an old Book, so is little bit hard to read, even more for an elderly one. I bought it from Barnes & Noble, when I went to the store to return it, they told me that they can't refund my money in Store, so I had to sent it again via UPS (B&N paid for the Shipping), and wait more time to get the money back, so it was a very long time for a book that was not really useful for the person that need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOCK OF THE BUSHVELD","review":"A great old story, with beautiful African scenery and although this is an old film, it is still credible by today's filming standards.

Other factors revolve around the platoon, as supernatural elements and independent warriors.Meanwhile, some of the soldiers under Greg Merrick, including Merrick himself, are beginning to question their motives and beliefs, doubting the role of the Coalition's rigid views.By now, the reader knows most of the characters, and can compare how they've changed from the beginning of the story.

You can still see the images on the board although the pictures aren't as dark as when first done you can still see the picture. I have noticed as well if you write a message (ie. Your child's name) the letters don't erase well at all. It is very time consuming to remove the images and messages from the board.

I don't recommend reading any of this series, starting with The Sacred Stones, because you will have to know what else happens and you will end up speed reading (or skimming,in my case) to an unfulfilling ending only to find there is another and another and another book in the series!

It describes that women \\"as sexual beings are by far superior,\\" because of how multi-orgasmic, and more errogenous they are. That the male orgasm is a pitiful 5-second experience that renders him exhausted. That the French call this exhaustion the little death. Almost every gay man I met has said that although he is gay, he has had positive sexual experiences with a woman.

Wreck also portrays the frustration of Alfred Perlman who was put in charge of operating the property and when he tried to operate, he was hamstrung by ex Pennsy executives put in key positions of the railroad he was supposed to run while Stuart Saunders did what he did best, deal with politicians. The cancer of this railroad's bankruptcy soon spread to its neighbors and led to the creation of Conrail with many former Penn Central executives still in charge. In the book, the reader will find out why the \\"merger\\" was really the takeover of the Central that Al Perlman said it was and how the company got looted by David Bevan and his Penphil cronies.

Granted, it did have it's funny moments, but it's definitely a guy-flick, since they paid more attention to how the actors looked than whether or not they can act.I must admit, the ending was cute, but the movie consisted of far too many Kevin Smith movie references (Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) that were way too obvious.

Despite most of the story happening inside a pool shop, the actors didn't seem very comfortable with pool cues.

As such it is an excellent reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite Books on the Dead Sea Scrolls","review":"Boccaccini has pulled together a theory of the origins of the Dead Sea Scroll sectarians and how they fit into the Jewish culture historically.

This book includes some the latest research on the subject, from the most well known Journals.

Since it is small (removed the red ball in the dump bed) in size, apprx. 4\\"x6\\") he actually can grab hold of it and pull it up his chest. I can place it beside him when he is laying in his crib and he almost can flip over to grab it. I also purchased the front end loader and the cement truck and he loves them just as much.

The overall construction is very cheap and flimsy, the rings and the ball-attachments for them are not well made, and most importantly, while the central part does appear to be made of stainless steel, the spring-loaded latch on the inside has been very poorly constructed (not machined, appears to have been pressed somehow).The latch/slide on my wife's broke within two weeks.

The author, an English journalist, assayed to visit and patronize brothels across the globe.Not terribly titillating, as I recall, and of interest only to those in a particular frame of mind, the book is decently written and has its moments. ...The author mostly reports his observations and experiences in a dispassionate and slightly wide-eyed manner, although he allows a little pathos through when the women voice it.An oddity that may not be for everyone's bookshelf...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, horror & comedy mix like oil & water","review":"An absolutely dumb \\"teen horror comedy\\" in which two dorky losers in a old Chevrolet station wagon tangle with some psycho dude in a \\"monster truck\\" that looks like a tank with wheels. For horror & comedy to work right one must do something different than this, the horror & gore is too over-the-top to be in anything that thinks it's a comedy, and while maybe this will bring laughter to anyone with an IQ less than a dust bunny, most folks will probably find this just as repugnant as I did. Chortle with glee at a bar full of amputees, and giggle hysterically at a guy that has a tire rut through his chest as he laments that he won't be able to **** his sister.

As they drive thru an eerie town full a people mysteriously missing arms and legs, they discover the truth of why a madman in a converted monster truck has been following them and terrorizing them. The macabre and sinister plot thickens when they pick up a beautiful young girl with a few secrets of her own.

This movie is simply insulting to all who watch it, not just your self-respecting horror fans. This movie is poorly written and directed. It feels as though the director really has no clue about horror movies. This is clearly demonstrated in the fact that he ripped off so many great horror flicks, but mentions none of them in the commentary. If you are a true fan of horror movies this will be of no interest to you. If you, on the otherhand, think I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine were cinematic masterpieces then by all means rent or buy this movie. Why anyone would give this movie more than one star (if it were an option I would have given it \\"0\\") is beyond me. Maybe friends and relatives of the cast and crew (those poor souls).

The acting in this movie sucks something awful and the screenplay is ridiculous...it is what it is folks and this movie is one big joke. They really laid an egg with this garbage.

After that point, the exercises at the end of each chapter get considerably more difficult. Up until that point, the assignable problems and the sample problems in each chapter are very similar in terms of difficulty. Once chapter 5 begins, the sample problems in the text are completely useless as for deriving the differential equations necessary to solve the assignable problems. The only sample problems given in chapter 5 and beyond are real simple \\"plug and chug\\" type examples compared to the difficult problems at the end of the chapters. It's like showing someone how 2x4s can be nailed together and then asking someone to build a skyscraper. No fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible, especially for those new to nuclear engineering","review":"There are only 1 or 2 books that I have wanted to burn more than this one. The chapters seem reasonable when reading through them; however, when you attempt to solve the problems at the end of the chapter you realize that the chapter you just read was useless. After realizing this, you look for sample problems, which there are very few of and they rarely seem to help. The problems at the end of the chapter are often poorly worded and the author wants you to take leaps and bounds to make assumptions to solve problems. It is annoying and not at all intuitive. Even my professor has admitted that the book sucks and that he will be looking for a new book to teach from. Maybe this book wouldn't seem so bad if I had taken nuclear physics first, but I'm not sure if that would really help. Please do not buy this book, it will only reinforce the publisher's desire to sell it and not replace it with something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Text","review":"As the prior reviewer stated, this book is awful. Saying that the book is full of typos isn't even a correct statement; saying that the book is bloated beyond belief of typos would be more correct. What's even worse, is that the same editions of the book have DIFFERENT typos. For example, my classmate would have an error in say, Fick's Law of Diffusion for One-Speed Neutrons, but my book would have the equation listed perfectly. And they would be the EXACT same edition of the book! It's ridulous.

I've also found that I start singing these songs when I'm in a good mood. The Weepies know how to write a song. I love the ideas of how happiness can't be taken from you, how you can be happy when you know what you want, how you become somebody loved, and how you can get pulled into someone else's rain storms.

All the basics (loading film, lenses, aperture, flash, etc.) are covered nicely and the photo examples in the book are great. They're small, but this is a pocket guide after all. I agree with one reviewer who said that the book should be updated. Despite that, you can't really go wrong having this book in the camera bag to use as a quick reference when shooting in the field. It's a solid little guide that would go together nicely with one of Kodak's bigger guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Indispensable Pocket Reference","review":"This little book tucks right into my camera bag, so it's easy to take along on photo outings.

This is true but there's a lot more, too. There are universal themes that apply to any ethnic group: young people who are born into a strict culture but want to see more of life, conflicts between the generations, what constitutes friendship, the relationship of head to heart, the place of silence.The film achieves a nice balance, I think, between presenting the ideological concepts and the simple human events. The cast is first rate; the two fathers and the two sons are all splendid.I'm not sure why I couldn't assign five stars to the film. Maybe just because it was so male-dominated that the sparkle that comes with more interaction between the sexes was lacking. Towards the end I felt it began to drag and I was happy to see it resolved. All in all, it's a very fine film, one that most anyone would enjoy. Good for children, too although the real young ones may get antsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliant book, movie adaptation suffers from poor characterization","review":"The novel of the Chosen is wonderful, but I can never get through watching more than a few minutes of this movie because of the actors chosen for Danny and his own father. Reuven is okay, and his father is well cast, but Danny is really poorly played. In the book, Danny is haunted by the secrets he is keeping, of his current activities and the hope of his future life. In the movie, Danny appears so self satisfied and complacent, he is annoying rather than compelling and his portrayal makes me wince. I wish they would remake this movie with a different cast. And in addition, too many of the important points of the book have been left out, and other things brought in that seem irrelevant. And yes, I understand Potok was a consultant on this movie, but I still think they got it wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen","review":"An execellent movie about Jewish immigrants, and how they tried to 'assimilate' and those who opposed it. Being Jewish myself, I think it is neither or, but trying to keep your 'roots' while also 'fit in' in the American society. For Jews born here, it becomes different, and it's always up to the previous generations to educate their kids in Jewish traditions. As society evolves, also the Jewish, we have to evaluate those traditions that are distinctive Jewish and those who in a way are old-fashioned and therefore have no real purpose in todays society.Well played and the characters come really 'live' through in their struggle.

Every song sounds identical and the overall sound is just weird. You can download this album for free on his site. I'm glad that is what I did. I do see why he is GIVING it away though. Go buy the \\"She Must and Shall Go Free\\" album. It's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the voice synthesizing?","review":"Big fan of Derek Webb, especially his Caedmon's Call years and She Must & Shall Go Free. There are some gems on this album, but why the synthesizing of his voice? I don't remember that appearing on his previous albums. There are only a handful of songs on Mockingbird without it. To me it smacks of an artist feeling that their voice is not strong enough to stand on its own. And Webb's voice CAN. It just distracts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Heard revisited?","review":"So I mourned the passing of Mark Heard more than a few years ago now and I feared would not hear another lyrically prophetic voice like this: a man with a deep faith who felt the weight of his calling, a man who maybe worried too much, a man concerned with \\"telling the truth without selling the truth\\" - but then here it is: the newest CD by Derek Webb -- Mockingbird.In this new offering, Derek Webb continues to wave a similar spiritual banner.

Highly recommend Derek Webb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy 'message' songs","review":"Derek Webb is one of my favorite Christian singers and I have loved his work since early Caedmon's Call. Mockingbird is Derek's 3rd solo album and is arguably his strongest 'message' album with standout songs A New Law, A King And A Kingdom and my favorite song is Rich Young Ruler, which is based on Luke 18:18-24. What an amazing reminder of our calling as Christians to give up our earthly desires and follow only Jesus.This album was available free for a limited time during Derek's unique promotion, [...], and I'm so glad many people have gotten the chance to be blessed by Derek's music. If you like folk acoustic rock like John Lennon, Toad the Wet Sprocket and Jack Johnson or Shaun Groves, Todd Agnew and Caedmon's Call, you'll love Derek Webb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great message ... Lousy music!","review":"Bold, daring, fearless in communciating Biblical truth ... that's the spirit and power of this album. Derek's message is right on target, and needs to be heard by America's conservative Republican pseudo-Christians, who conveniently leave out any concern for the poor in their theology. Yet, the album's appeal is limited by the frankly low-quality music. The songs are poorly constructed, overly repetitive, and not helped at all by Derek's grating, hoarse voice that trails through them.

As one reviewer has said, I believe he's arguably the John Steinbeck of Iceland. His works convey an atmosphere, setting, society, and culture that is like nothing else in the literature that most Westerners are familiar with. Whenever I want to take a break from reading novels by the most well-known and widely read authors of world literature (such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, etc.), I delve into the world of Halldor Laxness. I wish this author's status as a modern pioneer of contemporary literature was more acknowledged and recognized in the U.S. Just like Iceland's sagas, Halldor's Laxness are works to be treasured for its novel originality, fresh insight on common themes, and distinct style and literary beauty. On my list this is my 3rd most favorite Halldor Laxness novel (#1 is World Light, #2 is Independent People). Buy it, borrow it, read it, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable epic novel by a master of language.","review":"I admit to being a bit of a nut about Halldor Laxness, and \\"Iceland's Bell\\" is my favorite of his major novels.

The whole PC thing is just insane, and watching this exagerrated expression poke fun at it is bliss.PCU should be required veiwing for all those going into college. Protests, special interest groups, meat chucking, and a very ticked off senior class all come down on the shoulders of a pre-frosh whose scoping out the school. He meets up with the right guys and fights the system. Beautiful.At least do yourself a favor and watch it once.

PCU doesn't bother to give us any memorable characters or plot. No one has a major part in this movie. Think about it: Tom,the new preppy freshman,after a promising start where his orientation goes horribly wrong, virtually disappears except to be chased. Jeremy Pivens, playing John Belushi's Animal House character, gives a weak John Belushi-style speech rallying his housemates but doesn't have much else to do. David Spade appears from time to time in the thankless role of fraternity snob villain but its hard to feel menaced by such a snide, toothless twerp.

The guitar tone is almost perfect on this album. I love the fact that Pink Cream 69 makes this kind of music on their own terms. Vocally, this is so easy to listen to. Often times, singers from Europe have heavy accents that distract the listener from the great music. But not the case here, its well produced and well mixed. Other bands should take a lesson or two from these guys, because they do everything right.

When I found out they had a gig in town, I rushed to catch up with their latest and bought this and \\"In our gun\\" (which I won't review here, but like much less).I was so disappointed on first listen - it seemed smooth and bland, lacking all that gravelly quirkiness I enjoyed on BIO - but I gave it some time, and after about 3 times through I suddenly found myself getting hooked, first by one track then another, and now I'm thoroughly addicted. The songs turn out to be sufficiently well-crafted to stand up to many more listens. Yes, they are accessible, sing-along stuff, but there's some depth to most of the arrangements too.I agree with most of Peter Shermeta's analysis, although I'm surprised he's so down on \\"Chasing Ghosts With Alcohol\\" which I like just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pot luck of the best kind.","review":"This band is schizophrenic. The sooner you accept that, the happier you will be. Gomez has enough talent to cover 3 different genres of music in one album, and they do that over and over. I do admit, I do get frustrated at wanting to hear a specific flavor of tune, and getting hit with another. But the other flavor may be something I would never pick up and listen to, so here I at least have a version from a band I already like.Do I wish they would focus their sound, yes. Are they doing anything wrong, not really. The music is good, and they are playing on point so who knows what the future will bring this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does Gomez want to be?","review":"I came in on the Gomez bandwagon at the time of In Our Gun. Wow what a rocking album that is. I bought an older disc (Liquid Skin) and a couple of newer ones. I have to say they are all over the map. In Shopping Trolley, they're half rock/experimental and half country & western. In How We Operate, they're gone full tilt C&W; AND I DON'T LIKE IT. If you're into C&W;, give it a try - seems OK but I DON'T LIKE C&W.;I'm afraid to check out their newest, Five Men in a Hut."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"Same as the first reviewer I have been a huge fan since Bring it On. In our Gun was different than the first 2 but was a great album, Slipt the difference was good, not great and I have to say after listening to the new album twice I have no desire to listen to it again. Even Split the Difference made me want to listen to it over and over, I completely wore out every almbum they put out previously, this one will remain on the shelf. It just doesn't have any feeling. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is Gomez and I have always loved them."},{"rating":"2","title":"First timer to Gomez and Loving Them!","review":"I found Gomez on emusic.com and saw that \\"How We Operate\\" was top download, so I went for it after sampling the songs. My boyfriend, who is a long-time Gomez fan, immediately thought \\"Notice\\" was too much of a departure from their previous work. That song has since become one of my favorites on the album. The tunes are catchy and not too fluffy. They make me feel bouncy, pensive, and moved all in the course of an hour. This is one album I can listen to over and over and not get sick of. It's got mass appeal and is music that could get lost in the background of a party and that's why some people don't like it, but it resonates with me and I am stoked to have discovered them finally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operation complete","review":"There are a few of the songs that are played on WFUV NY, which made me buy the CD.

It is the same DVD as \\"Nickelback FRAGILE THIS SIDE UP\\", which was horrible because music plays all through it and it is not Nickelback and you can't hear when they do show Chad Kroeger speaking cause there is music playing over it.

Overall, it is reliable and helpful. It is fairly compact and easy to carry around, the road atlas is accurate, the pictures are great, and the descriptions are helpful. Things are changing so fast in Beijing that it is difficult for many of these guides to remain current year to year, and even then information on restaurants and other attractions often change before the guides are even published. A few places list therein were no longer in business, but overall it was reliable. I was able to use this to guide me to some places I might not have considered otherwise, and it gave a good overview of many of the attractions a new visitor to Beijing would want to see. I brought along a couple of other guides as well, including \\"Top 10 Beijing,\\" which was also helpful. I find that one guide is never enough, so I always get a few.

This is one of the very few books of photographs dedicated solely to images taken with a Holga camera. Unfortunately this collection of images is too disjointed. Content-wise the pictures cover a wide range from landscapes, to urban scenes, to people snapshots. Most are color, a few black and white. And although this collection is by a professional photographer, I have seen more interesting and cohesive image galleries of Holga photographs on the internet. Another downside is the physical production of the book. The book is a very flimsy softcover (with an unusual, weak binding) that doesn't seem like it will last very long. I would recommend this only to Holga collector's who must own *everything* Holga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huckabee has no right....","review":"Being from Arkansas and from the Jonesboro area I wanted to read the book that my governor wrote about \\"Kids who kill\\". The book was an ok read but I still do not think he has any right to say anything on this topic. Did anyone know that after the Westside School shootings our esteemed governor would not put off a family vacation out of the country? one of the, if not the most tragic event to ever happen in Arkansas and he goes on a vacation with the family? He had the audacity to write this book after that? When he was questioned about how he feels about making money from a tragedy he quipped \\"My kids have got to go to college\\" Man of integrity? no way. He is also very unpopular in the state right now even by members of his own party and if he wasn't term limited he would not win again. He does have presidential aspirations but does not have a chance at the nomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent must-read book following the Colo. shootings","review":"Mike Huckabee has produced a masterful book that is certainly valuable following the recent Colorado shootings.

Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee, cruelly exploits several tragic events to promote his personal agenda. He grabs our attention by quoting headlines from various school attacks and quickly shifts into an attack on homosexuals, feminists, unions, gun control legislation, non-Christian religions and anyone else that does not share his fundimentism views. The book is filled with fragments of quotes and statements from sources both real and mythical. While it contains a few gems of wisdom it consists mainly of derogatory ramblings condemning a majority the citizens of the United States of America.I read this book very carefully because I perceive it to be a resume to impress the extreme fundamentalists of the Christian Coalition and that I will soon see Mr. Huckabee's name in national politics probably seeking office as president of the United States of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippocrite","review":"Mr Huckabee is an expert on kids who kill because he has raised one in his son David Huckabee.

Culture must gather itself around these three areas, faith, family and work.Fine expose on the topic.

When he's not interviewing notorious self-aggrandizing liars (at least from the NYHC scene), he's worming his way into the history of a scene with which he had a marginal relationship, at best. I can just see this dweeb going through the stacks of flyers he's kept in his room at his parents' house all these years from shows he was probably too scared to actually go to or went to but never left the safety of the corners. Assuming the people he \\"interviewed\\" weren't as big liars as the guys from NYC, there are some interesting facts and anecdotes.

From the front cover to the last page it is packed with the stories and history of the american hardcore movement from 80-86. using interviews from many of the integral members of that scene this book hits hard with its facts. the only real problem with it is that doesnt delve deeply into the influnece of the earlier punk movement upon the american hardcore scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Read","review":"Others have ripped the editing of this book and I'd have to agree.

I've found it very helpful as a new fan of this music. In particular, the american hardcore discography at the end of the book is quite useful. One other thing that blows about this book is the lack of an index.

It was full of bias and opinions, focused more on violence then the positive aspects of hardcore, trashed punkers and made them look like idiots, completely trashed New York hardcore, and on top of that there were many spelling and grammatical errors. He also made it seem like the band he was a rodie for, \\"No Trend\\" were hardcore ledgends. Past the bias, the interviews were pretty interesting, and the book has some really intense pictures, but if you wanna know the history of hardcore, skip this. Read \\"Dance of Days\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly biased","review":"This author thinks everyone should take his opinion as gold.

However, this tale about onions concentrates on greed as motivation for commerce. Salt begins with a ninny who doesn't want to work, and then the hero wants a good reputation and chooses wisdom and work. The funny ending of Onions induces the reader to laugh at another's misfortune. The images are graphic. Businessmen or merchants are modeled as people who shouldn't be kindhearted or generous. 2 stars because it is an okay read.

The few figures that seemed pertaining will carry you somewhat.Bad: Sample problems are too few and not illustrative or instructive.

According to this expansion, one gets a +7 instead of a +5 and discovers that 1000-hp undead happened to be lurking around the corner instead of 10-hp ones. Epic becomes ordinary.The concept of constructed epic spells is interesting, although the mechanics expose weaknesses of the d20 skills system. Many of the monsters have interesting back stories that should be taken as examples of how to create ultimate villain creatures rather than as a shopping list for super-dungeons. And fans of Greyhawk/Forgotten Realms will be interested in seeing the d20 translation of their most famous inhabitants.For contrast, I'd recommend the 2nd edition Dark Sun version of this book (Dragon Kings), which extended high level characters in unexpected and interesting ways and actually added depth to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite buy.","review":"People criticize this book for offering too much power to PC's.

If you're a DM and you can't seem to challenge your PC's enough, the book has ideas and scenarios for epic campaigns. The feats spells and regular magic items are all very good, but only a few of the artifacts are worthwhile to find. The skill uses are a little strange, but you're dealing with characters of godlike power, so that's to be expected.

The book starts with an introduction from Michael Novak which ends with a Polish prayer to JPII: \\" May he live a hundred years\\".The book analyzes Wojtyla's thought by first examining his early writings and methodology. In the latter sections he talks about his habilitation thesis and his Lublin Lectrues. In the methodology section he explains his mix of phenomenology with Thomistic thought and does an excellent section that highlights some of the critiques of Wojtyla at the time Wojtyla published and explained his work, The Acting Person.After Kupczak examines Wojtyla's writings and method he concentrates on Wojtyla's thought on consciousness and efficacy as well as transcedence and intergration.

They changed their name to Wargasm after a dispute with another band (so I heard).These guys play fast, complex music. The guitar riffs are amazing. The singing is kind of flat but then again, people used to complain about Metallica's vocals, too. \\"Revenge\\" and \\"Bullets & Blades\\" are some of the best loud, angry songs you'll hear. \\"Undead\\" is one of the fastest outside of Slayer. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expanded paperback version coming!","review":"It looks like FANTAGRAPHICS wants to do a paperback printing of this book. There will be additional stories (mainly ATLAS, if things go as planned)and problems with some of the coloring will be rectified. When the book was done, some of the cleaning-up and recoloring of the art was done by hands other than Greg's. Their skills varied, leading to a different look to some of the stories. They didn't hang together, appearance-wise, as well as they should have. Sadowski will be redoing the stories that came out too dark or colored poorly or not done to his exacting specifications, so the look of the stories in the book will be more cohesive. Combined with the advances in graphic software, there should be a big improvement evident.Then we can look forward to B KRIGSTEIN: VOLUME TWO.

They had my head spinning with the yin-yang that was \\"Life Won't Wait\\" followed by \\"Rancid 2k\\". But here it became clear what they were after. Listening to this album, it sounds like they took the aformentioned albums and smashed them together, the result being almost an hour of creative music with much more focus than thier last two releases.I am surprised by what a closed-minded conservative mindset many of these \\"punks\\" carry around with them. They sold out b/c Tim hangs out with some tool from a crappy band? Who cares? That effects the music how?They sold out b/c they are on MTV? Do you remember that \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Ruby Soho\\" were 'buzz clips'?If you think they suck now b/c thier sound changed...

I heard the group r spliting up and this is not a good way to finsih it. It shows that Tim Armstrong really is a sell-out.

The cd had 1 good song its no fall back down. just download the song indestructible off the web and u've got the whole cd 1 good song. Rancid 2000 was awsome hard fast punk like it should be. I had high hopes for Indestructible the only thing indestructible is Tim's ego. unless he can prove me wrong wit ha new kick as Rancid cd in the next few years. All their other cds were good tho they life wont wait cd was the crappiest other than this.

While I was a little disappointed seeing \\"Fall Back Down\\" had been released as a single, when I got the album it was far from disappointing. The album has alot of keyboards courtesy of Mr. Brett G., founder of Epitaph, guitarist for Bad Religion, producer of Rancid's album, punk legend...The cd has a slightly different sound, and some songs such as \\"Back Against the Wall\\", Tim sings with almost a hip-hop inspired style. I highly reccommend the cd for a veteran Rancid fan, but if you're just getting into them, I suggest picking up \\"..And Out Come the Wolves.\\"-See ya in the pit"},{"rating":"1","title":"rancid sucks (now)","review":"i blame Tim. i feel that the demise started with that crap, the transplants. it makes me sad that they have sold their souls to satan. and to top it off they have that FU#% Benji from good charlotte. i want to know what happened. jus know that it went from_ operation ivy to new found glory. it's a shame cause matt has skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid may have lost it!","review":"This is one of the worst cd's i have ever heard in my life.

We then looked at the Lyric sheet to make sure that they did not by accident slip up and put the wrong cd in the case.

I don't think they can do anything to fix the situation except maybe break up. The band is just horrible and i don't know what can be done.

With this album, Rancid proves that they are one of the best modern punk bands out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've Gone and Done It Again!","review":"This is an unbelievable album! It has not left my player since I've received it in the mail. For a die-hard Rancid fan like me, this was just what I needed.

If you are a fan of Rancid or punk rock in general, DO NOT MISS THIS RECORD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rancid will be Rancid","review":"A really good album for those guys. While the 2000 self-titled album was a true punk record, this is more of a punk-rock record if you know what I mean. This record is more along the lines of \\"And out come the wolves\\" than the 2000 self-titled album. There's a little more keaboard on this album and they come back with a little ska in some songs. While this doesn't sound like a pop-punk album to me it'll surely please the younger mtv kids more. The guys never changed their style so they still sound a 100% RANCID. There are suprises as well (Arrested in Shanghai)for example will surprise most punkers out there... A great album, Rancid proved once again that they are one of best..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"Rancid has struck again with their sixth studio effort to date, and i love it. this album has a classic Rancid feel to it as well as pushing some new ground. thats the beauty of Rancid: they aren't your typical 3 chord punk band; they're a 3 chord punk band that are truely great musicians and that have grown as songwriters over the years. many people seem to think Rancid has sold out by switching to Warner Bro's label, but if you look at the album it was still released under hellcat. apperently they just turned to Warner for additional support. even so, signing with a major record label or making money doesn't make you a sellout. changing your style to make money makes you a sellout. Rancid have always been true to themselves, their fans and their music, and thats what makes Indestructable a lovely addition to any Rancid fans collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASSSSEEEEE","review":"After listening to this cd, its ok. Its a much softer and poppier then their last albums. I personally love their older stuff, but once i saw their video on MTV, the thing that Rancid stood against all these years, was pathetic. Especially with Benji(GOOD CHARLOTTE) and Kelly Osborne in it,that made me almost puck. I went in my closet and threw all my rancid shirts away. Betrayed by one of the bands that has shown me the way of what punk was.What a spit in the face by some of our idiols. Im going to go puck now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parental Advisory","review":"This isn't really a review. I just wanted to point out that this CD comes with a Parental Advisory for Explicit Content.

The songs sounded too much like the Transplants, which is a band that I do not care for at all. I personally thought this album was very overrated. There was too many poppy songs, and not enough songs that sounded like their older stuff.Another thing thats overrated is Matt Freeman's bass playing. I play the bass for a high school jazz band, so I actually know how to play. I'm not saying Freeman is by any means bad or average - in fact, he's quite good, but some people say he's the best bassist ever. Obviously these people have never heard Flea of the Chilli Peppers, or Steve Harris of Iron Maiden (greatest band EVER).Skip this one and go straight for ...And Out Come the Wolves or Let's Go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Rancid Album","review":"Awesome, awesome, awesome cd!!Everyone should pick this one up...it is definately worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"This CD is Rancid's most recent release, and it is definetely one of their best CDs. Rancid are one of the only Punk bands that stick to the original sounds of older classic Punk bands, like The Clash and The Ramones. Tim Armstrong's vocals kick ass. My favorite song on this CD is definetely \\"Spirit of '87\\". The guitars and vocals on that song are awesome. \\"Django\\" is also a cool song. Other good songs are \\"Red Hot Moon\\", \\"Indestructable\\", \\"Start Now\\", \\"Travis Bickle\\", \\"Tropical London\\", \\"Roadblock\\", and \\"Ghost Band\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"huh?","review":"I don't know why people are saying this is a bad album, Indestructible isn't any different to rancid's other albums. Musically i would say it's one of the bands better albums mixing the stong melodies of Out come the Wolves with the harder edged riffs of Rancid(2000). Anyone saying rancid has gone pop-punk obviously has not listened to the album. Indestructible is as essential as any of the bands other output."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from one of the best","review":"No need to mention all of the stuff Tim Armstrong had to go through before and while recording this album, its already been said. For me, it would seem that his dealings with his ex-wife and label changing etc., helped result in a great Rancid album. One that I can play in front of non Rancid fans, and one that the hardcores can still appreciate (regardless of what fake/new Rancid fans will tell you). Indestructable, Fall Back Down, Memphis, and Tropical London are highlights, but the rest is worth the price as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"POP RANCID...","review":"Ok, INDESTRUCTIBLE is the last RANCID breath...By this time already, you can hear a much more POP sound...Hardcore masterpieces like the RANCID debut, LET's GO and even the RANCID before this are totally in the past...Besides some real pop songs there's some RANCID's GEMS likes OUT OF CONTROL, DJANGO, GHOSTBAND and TROPICAL LONDON...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want Originality","review":"You have nothing to lose by buying this CD but your money.We've heard these songs from Rancid a million times before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrating a decade of lovely filth","review":"Tim & co still have ability to hit that nail thru the chin. biggest kudos: tribute to Joe Strummer; skag's a way of life for some; enough pol refs w/out being too righteous.

Tim has a vast majority of the vocals on this. I would have liked more Lars in there. I didn't hear any lead vocals from Matt. There is no real theme to this album like their past few. It's got several songs that sound like they belong on Life Won't Wait, a few from their previous release, and a few more from Let's Go or And Out Come The Wolves. Best tracks...Idestructible (1), Arrested in Shanghai (8), Spirit of '87 (11), and Otherside (19).

The songs are catchy and have easily relatable lyrics so you think they're good. The band doesn't care about their fans or their reviews; this is obvious because no band who actually cares about their fans releases singles. Singles are just ploys to make money and gain publicity.

Full of catchy hooks and shout-along chouruses, this one is bound to sell well, but Rancid's \\"punk cred\\" is history. A few of these songs, such as the title track \\"Indestructible\\" and \\"Out of Control\\" still evoke the furious energy of Rancid's first two releases, but most of the album goes for a Clash-meets-Reel Big Fish sort of groove. Lot's of radio air-time, but long time fans will be sorely disapointed. Where \\"Out Come the Wolves\\" felt like a natural maturing of style on the part of Rancid, \\"Indestructible\\" simply feels forced. If you enjoyed \\"Let's Go\\", or anything from this outfit's original incarnation, Op Ivy, you'd do well to steer clear of this one. In the meantime, some newer arrivals to the scene, such as Anti-Flag, look like a much better place to spend your music dollar.

But when this came out.... Matt Freeman.... Tim Armstrong... my favorite musicians...*shudder.In conclusion you shouldn't get this album.

It's interesting in the details of gay life in less liberal times, and the quirkyness of its characters. Orton is a self-destructive enfant-terrible of British arts in the 60's, and we are often fascinated to see how someone like this tears through the lives of those who care about him, while creating great, or at least popular, art with apparently little effort.

Then toward the end there is a girl that they are tring to stop from killing herself and it seems that it is just kind of out of place.

After reading SW, I wasn't sure I wanted to read another Hoag book. It wasn't very good. Fortunately, I did pick up \\"Dust to Dust\\" and much to my surprise and delight, I couldn't put it down. I should have known. I've enjoyed all of Hoag's suspense books, and shouldn't have been led astray by one blip on the screen. \\"Dust to Dust\\" is an unpredictable page turner which begs to be finished. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Interesting as Previous Books","review":"Was somewhat disappointing. The premise was very good but the character development was weak. Too many characters with not enough development of any. When I was finished, I felt unsatisfied and wondered about many loose ends. Felt as though I was reading a John Sanford (who I love) but not at either his level of excellence or at Hoag's level either. I would suggest waiting for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as some of her other books","review":"Out of all the Hoag novels I've read, this one is my least favorite. It's very slow-moving and very difficult to get into. The two main characters, Nikki Liska and Sam Kovac occasionally have humorous comments, but are mostly annoying. This book is more mystery than suspense and there is not enough action to keep the reader hooked. I would recommend reading a different book by her, such as A Thin Dark Line (this one is everything Dust to Dust is not--fast paced, romantic, with great characters). Also I would definitely say that Tami Hoag's books are not good for anyone under 16--they contain graphic sex scenes, violence, a lot of swearing, and a lot of sexual innuendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of suspence ... boring","review":"This was my first reading of Ms Hoags and she was recommended by my son . To me the book didn't hold my interest and was boring from start but I gave it fair chance by forcing myself to read to page 130 , To me there was no suspence and her details were just to drawn out and detective Kovac reminded me of the old columbo (Peter Faulk ) detective on TV ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish","review":"I am a big Tami Hoag fan, but this was not one of her best, in my opinion. My mother an I, faithfully, have read every one of her books and enjoyed most of them. This book has taken two minor characters in her last book, Kovac and Liska, and made them the main characters in this book. The mystery is uninteresting. The thing that we like about Hoags books is the mystery laced with romance. There is no romance in this book. I did'nt care about the detectives or the crime. It is obvious that Ms. Hoag wants to be taken more seriously as a detective/crime novelist, but she needs to remember who has made her famous and who her fans are. This is not what we are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew! A page turner!","review":"This certainly gets your thought processes going.

Her description of Det. Kovak, for example, was so descriptive that I could actually smell old stale cigarettes on him whenever his name was mentioned.My only complaint is that she gave us a bit too much of the cliffhanger in the middle of the book instead of saving the best for last.

Basiclly all it is is talk and personally I would have skipped the first 32 chapters(there are like 34 or 35) So I guess if you like boring, ocasional excitment, and well if ya like to figure the book out before the auther reveals the ending then by all means read it but if your looking for something a little more exciting read anything else but this.

I have never been so disappointed in an author's work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her bailiwick","review":"While the basic plot is solid, for some reason the author seems to have been (uncharacteristically) aiming for gritty, super-hard-boiled characters in this book, so much so that it interferes with the telling of the tale. For example, several characters' smoking habits are covered in excruciating detail, and Sam and Nikki have such jaded world views that you almost stop pulling for them, and retreat to the role of observer instead of participant in the story. In other words, Ms. Hoag's usual sense of humor is conspicuously absent in this one, and I ended the book feeling depressed and let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dust to Dust","review":"Intense character development and intricate sub-plots that were woven effectively to create an introspective view of human interaction with all of the subtle nuances that make a believable story.

I eventually called for an update and got a \\"It will ship in 7-10 days\\" reply. So I waited another two weeks. I finally called again and was told it was out of stock and they just ordered it the day before. (Remember this was more than a week after it was supposed to be shipped.)

It barely works and you have to turn the volume way up on the stereo to even hear it, even then there is a lot of static.

There is no structure, the acting is horrible, there is no sense of drama, and there's a continuity error in the first shot. I want to know whos nephew got to direct this film.

As has been noted by another, the sister repeatedly calls the brother's hat dumb and says it makes the boy look stupid. The boy ultimately accepts this critique. Might children say these things? Yes. Do we teach them to say them? No.I found the language bloated. Blocks of text that were repeated for effect were too long; rather than function as refrain, the repeats just bore. Couple that with the absence of any meter or rhythm in the language, and this book both offended and bored me.The clumsy writing left me thinking fondly of some of the elegant writing out there (Harold and the Purple Crayon comes to mind), and also refreshing my appreciation for books like The Runaway Bunny and The Very Hungry Caterpillar, both of which use repetition as an effective story tool.There are many better works out there for your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSING TRACKS","review":"this cd is missing the song\\"line and sinker\\" by billy talent amongst others.i think u need to recheck the cd and make sure u got it all.u r also missing tracks from the eurotrip soundtrack like the chemical brothers.RECHECK YOUR STUFF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack, I Hate MTV","review":"Congrats, MTV has successfully marketed one of the few things that I enjoy.

It doesn't resort to /deus ex machina/ to solve every problem. (Granted, it has a measure of that.) It actually lets the good guys suffer--and wrestle with that suffering. (Robin Hardy's _Annals of Lystra_ series is similar in that respect.)

Watch it only in 5 minute segments or your brain may explode."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the THESIS?","review":"First of all, the expert philosophers they use are actually theologians or bible scholars. Second, these scholars are defining postmodernism as a suspicion of all absolute truth claims. Then the brothers in the documentary begin to disparage the church and state that they believe a church is not needed. A post-modernistic view, a worldview of individualism.On to the editing and the quality of the movie. Why use cameramen that cannot keep the camera steady? Then have to edit the film as the movie Seven to cover up those mistakes?This is a shoddy movie at best. Very one sided and for those that praise it, either you are related to the film makers or you truly believe the lies that have been fed to you.

Lately, it has been getting difficult to find locally as fewer and fewer stores carry Playboy. If they do carry magazines for adults, it's almost always the hardcore stuff (not the tastefully done stuff, either). I read Playboy because of its balance of well-written and informative articles, great jokes, outstanding fiction, style, and the most beautiful women on Earth. I saw the offer that Amazon had on a subscription to my favorite magazine and couldn't resist. The first issue was supposed to arrive sometime between mid-November and mid-December (December or January issue), but I received the November issue.

Major celebrities don't pose for it; the ones who do are of the \\"Oh, I remember her\\" variety, the interviews aren't revelatory, and \\"The PLAYBOY Forum\\" has been supplanted by The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, et al. \\"Grapevine\\" is a pathetic collection of six-month old paparazzi nipple-slip photos, the fiction is just OK, and the fashion pages are nothing compared to what you'll find in Details or Nylon Guys.Personally I'm also tired of seeing Marilyn Monroe pop up in almost every issue. I get that Hef has never gotten over her but I'm sure most of today's male readership just don't care.I'm something of a traditionalist.

The books is composed of three main stories, each one is like a miniature slasher movie but with a couple of \\"slasher slayers\\" thrown in to the mix to aid the unfortunate targets of these undead serial killers. The idea is very interesting, especially if you're a fan of the 80's style hack and slash horror flicks. The characters are interesting, the artwork is great, there's a good amount of violence in usual slasher movie fashion. If you like horror comics, check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very satisfying read on Kindle","review":"This was the first comic I downloaded to the Kindle Fire I got for Christmas, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I didn't realize it lacked the panel view feature, and if any book could benefit from it this one could. The art and the story are pretty good, with a fun and campy 80's slasher movie kind of story line, and the kind of art you would expect to see in Image books like Spawn. But the way the panels are laid out makes it a very difficult read on a Kindle screen. Lots of zooming required. So if they ever upgrade it with the panel view feature, it might be fantastic. Until then, you might want spend the extra couple bucks to stick with the old school paperback version for a more enjoyable reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I like good erotica as much as the next person but this is a complete and utter waste of time.Translated from Italian, this is short and to the point, much like those pornos that get started within 3 seconds of the doorbell ringing.

I am NOT saying the girl doesnt have a voice, just saying that there are more talented people in the same category. It's kinda like... why get Walmart chocolate when u can get Godiva? Why get a Kelly Clarkson CD when you can buy Mariah or Whitney? I suggest you look around and look for real francophone divas like Liane Foly, Maurane, Native, and the French Cds by Celine Dion.

And while there's nothing in particular that is terrible about this album, it is surprising how the lack of anything very good can make something so bad.So if you're looking for good French pop, try Keren Ann or Autour de Lucie for a more etherial sound, Lise Boyer (from Qu��bec) for a more pop sound, or Jeanne Cherhal for a singer/songwriter sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty.....","review":"I don't like Star academy,and i don't really like the way this album was made...I think the people, who have left reviews before,is from her Fan club,because there is a lot of lies...For example: one said that Nolwenn Leroy is a big star in Europe,that's so untrue,and another says that she is \\"the voice\\",but she is not...There is others artists who are so much better than her,for example:Alanis Morissette,Emiliana torrini,and in France you have Patricia Kaas,Camille,Sandrine Kiberlain......etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"not convinving.....","review":"i live in france and i have a serious disease, i was thinking that buying this CD would heal me......but i'm still sick...her music and her voice does not appease me...The CD is really formated,this girl is not an artist,she has chosen her songs on a computer and she recorded the CD in only one month...for god's sake ,don't buy it...and listen to real artists just like ray charles or ��lodie fr��g�� (a french singer)....and one more detail,she is not a star in france!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed that the right word....","review":"Disappointed that the right word to express how this new singer is...That's true that she brings nothing new and that she is not so exceptionnal,but there is just one thing positive on this album and it's a song from Lara Fabian \\"in��vitablement\\",Lara Fabian , what an artist!!!

Luckily there has been a great new set of textbooks produced by CeLCAR and Georgetown U. Press called:Tajiki: An Elementary Textbook. There are two textbooks in the set, as of now it seems that Amazon only sells the first textbook. (Hopefully they'll start selling the other soon.) I think the Georgetown Textbook is the place to start learning Tajiki.This textbook I find a little dense, though after some study of Tajiki I think this would be a good textbook. However, I think an even bigger flaw of the book is that it does not have audio. And audio is oh-so-important when learning any language. Thus I think this is a good follow-up textbook for Tajiki, but not the place to start.One really good things about this book is that it covers some differences between the dialects of Tajiki."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Strokes","review":"Originally, I purchased these totally by mistake. I like the creamy flow of Prismacolor regular colored pencils for the work I do. And, that's just it. What effect do you want to create in your art? I only used these for detail, fine line work and embellishing. They are so hard that yes, they are virtually pediment (not eraseable). I find they also gouge deep into the paper so you have to use paper or canvas that holds up under pressure. I use them so rarely that my small set will last for years, that's because of the hardness too. Of all my art supplies, they are a very limited and specific use tool. For your style, they might be an inspiration.Other great \\"soft\\" colored pencils are regular Prismacolor (you can get open stock - one at a time, at Michaels and try them out), Derwent and Dick Blick has their own brand, very inexpensive with colors that the other Artist brands don't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they used to be.","review":"for overpriced products, I expect top value.

At the time our teacher did emphasize that these were not to be sharpened in a standard sharpener because it would destroy the tip. We were instructed then to use a razor or exacto knife to make a point, and then a piece of sand paper-like stuff to make it finer.However I bought the Prismacolor pencil sharpener along with this. And when the pencils arrived after the sharpener I noticed that inside the box was a leaflet with a picture of the sharpener in it, the implication being that it would work with the pencils. Since then I have destroyed at least one pencil because the sharpener simply breaks the lead every single time no matter how gentle you try to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"AAA","review":"got this for my daughter who is an anime artist. she asked for prisma because of the great pigment in these pencils."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality pencils","review":"Didn't come sharpened.

Branagh reciting the phone book would be poetry to me. The little girl does a fabulous job. How she enchants Branagh into thinking that kids are probably not that bad after all, and the inevitable confrontation between him and the child's mother over the dancing lessons beautifully illustrated the difficulties of an over-protective parent vs another who sees only the child's open spirit, and will to try despite a physically challenged condition.

We love it. The curtain is made of waterproof material as opposed to vinyl which adds a nice elegance. It has magnets/weights in the bottom of the curtain to keep it inside the shower base - one on each end (it would be even nicer if it had another magnet in the middle but this doesn't really seem to cause a problem). We had this question about the weights and couldn't find an answer to it until the product arrived in the mail. If I buy another one, I will go with the one with the clear panel (\\"window\\") in the upper half for convenience. I wish the color choices weren't so limited. We are very satisfied with this product and are considering buying a second one for the kids bathroom tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good shower curtain","review":"The plus points of this shower curtain are that it does not have hooks. That makes it more durable than ones with hooks that tend to tear around the sockets of hooks over a period of time. Especially, in a household with children (picture them swinging from and pulling the curtains) it goes a long way towards increasing the durability of shower curtains.The one minus point that I have noticed is that it is not fungus-resistant, so over a period of a few days expect stains towards the bottom of the curtain.

Honestly, each track sounds so much like the others that it seems like one very long song. I played the CD for my daughter once, then donated it to my local library.

Jose Ferrer gives a strong, emotionally controlled performance as the crippled artist who is unable to accept love in his life. A large part of the film centres on his relationship with a streetwalker tiringly overplayed by Colette Marchand. Not a great deal of time is actually spent in the Moulin Rouge, which is unfortunate since it may have injected some needed life into the story. The film left me cold. Toulouse-Lautrec had a very difficult personality (at least as portrayed in this film), making him a hard character to relate to, and there wasn't enough spectacle or life in the story to at least hold on to. I wish I could add to the raves about this film, but for me it was a very unsatisfying viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD version requested!","review":"This film is a wonderful minor classic: great atmosphere, solid production values, and certainly well-acted.

Hopkins shares entertaining stories, and also concentrates on Elvis' music. Music that was so important it changed the world. So if you are looking just for lurid stories, most of which have been proven to be false, this probably isn't the book for you. If you are looking for an even-handed book that shows Elvis as the greatest entertainer ever, but still as human as the rest of us, I highly recommend this one.

I was skeptical because I had tried $300 custom orthotics with no success, and these were so simple and inexpensive. However, I am happy to say that I am now able to walk for an hour without any pain! The only issue I had with these at first is that they do raise your foot and push it forward in your shoe.

These hard heel cups work by molding the heel is such a way to put fat or cushion in the heel. The tuli cups work by providing the cushion in the cup itself. Both sets of cups worked great. No problem with fit (Size 11 1/2) with either. The hard cups are a little easier to work with.

Aside from obviously high quality, non-formulaic songwriting and dazzling technical skills, the thing that has always impressed me the most about Steve is that every note he plays, even in very rapid passages, is articulated like a word in a sentence. That is, there are no notes that are merely \\"played,\\" but rather are \\"spoken\\" in terms of phrasing, rhythm, dynamics, attack, tone, etc. As a guitarist of 20+ years, I can tell you that it is exhausting to play even a slow passage of Steve Vai music because of this. Each note must be worked individually. Of course the DVD also shows us again what a great entertainer and showman Vai can be. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a note","review":"STEVE VAI was the one that produced and edit the video! he said it in the documentary. obviously he was having a lil too much fun with the effects. next time hire a professional crew to tape, AND a professional to edit.if the camera work had been great, i would watch this dvd atleast 5 times a day. since it's so awful, i'll just watch it by listening a few times a month or whenever i feel like listening to steve.one thing i notice, it's hard to listen to steve's song if you're not really listening to it with a critical ear. It's not the type of music where you pop it into the cd player and just bug out, you have to really sit and listen to the difficulty and style to really enjoy it. it's not the type of music for cars or outdoor. it has to be you and the cd player, in your room, alone, turn it up really loud, and just let it amaze you."},{"rating":"1","title":"steve vai, showman or musician?","review":"The reason I bought this DVD is because I love, really love the \\"Alive in an Ultra World\\" album. The diference is that on that album Steve was focused on getting the songs right. On this DVD Steve is too concerned on entertaining the audience and showing off for the DVD, compromising the interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of talent","review":"No doubt, Vai is blessed with ability. Mind blowing speed and tricks out the wazoo. But that doesn't equal music. These songs SUCK. He's a forty something playing and acting like a teenager..I felt embarressed for him and the boys most of the time...Go buy some Robert Fripp dvd's or Stevie Ray...they're better for your teeth..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"Whilst the musicianship is of a high standard as expected from Vai (well he has been playing long enough), the music itself is unexcitable and actually boring to listen to. Tony Macalpine has released some awesome material in the past and it is a shame they couldn't play a few of his tracks because they played a track off Billy Sheen's diabolical solo album. Steve Vai's costume changes and light effects were simply ridiculous and this new guitar prodigy Dave Weiner just sucked. The camera work is all over the place and it makes the concert as annoying as **** to follow. The additional material is plain stupid as they are basically messing around like kids and trying to be funny which doesn't work. So overall I wouldn't waste your money on this, unless you live in a cave and only know of Vai's guitar work, and nobody else because as far as I am concerned this shoddy package is just a load of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"One watch was enough.","review":"Steve Vai's performance as a guitarist is okay. But the set-up in this concert is crap. The camera moves all over the place like the holder is having a fit. Dave Weiner as an new guitarist is nothing special. Not a Paul Gilbert, Jason Becker or Ritchie Kotzen, if you know whata mean. Tony Macalpine has opted to forget his solo career and now work as a background monkey for Vai and play the keyboards whilst Vai does the show as the grinder. Billy Sheen looks like he;s aged 30 years since the DLR days and sucks. The extra disc to this concert is crap. Overall this pile of trash is absolute and utter crap. Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VAI is AMAZN!!!!","review":"I used to rate vai OK types.

Same old music from Steve (lots of P&W tunes which are the only good ones anyway), same old eighties chops, the same boring tapped pentatonics. Very cheap production, terrible stage, the worst I have ever seen, cheap post production effects, bad lights shows, histerical camera works. Futile, completly unuseful and boring special contents, the second cd is perfect to use as a frisbee. Do I say more? The only plus, a great rhythmn section is involved Sheehan, Donati. Steve's gone, he ran out of ideas, like Yngwie and Joe too. He did remarkable things in the past but we all know time passes. He's old and boring for the most part in this dvd too (which however is a really poorly and cheaply produced show). Next guy please."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST DVD FROM THE BEST GUITARIST","review":"This DVD was so long in the making that I really expected it to rule the world. I've seen half a dozen Vai concerts and every one of them was amazing, he's truly one of the most gifted guitarists alive, EVER.Pity then, that his live DVD SUCKS. The music is great but you won't know because you're too distracted by the choppy editing, amateurish production effects, and frenetic... ARGH! I really can't believe he released this like it is. I wanted to be able to really watch the show and take it all in but I just DON'T ENJOY WATCHING THIS DVD. It hurts. I want to turn it off.Buy a Frank Zappa DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH of the (not so) \\"SPECIAL\\" video effects!!!","review":"Like \\"I.

I'm not sure there is a better value anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply breathtaking","review":"I actually went to this show, and bought the DVD as soon as it came out -- and I was not at all disappointed. Masterful guitar work, superb tones and effects use, awesome songwriting -- it is flawless in my opinion.

It can be clunky and hard to get the can in place, and the blade doesn't always cut clean. It really isn't much of a step-up from my generic hand-operated can opener.It's my own fault for making an impulse buy like that. I really should have read the reviews. Chock it up to lesson learned, and the knowledge that the name \\"Cuisinart\\" on the package doesn't guarantee a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Opener","review":"This small appliances it's very nice for eyes, very functionaly and easy to use.Pros: - good size- good can support- good LokingCons: - the finished are little weak, and past the time loose your shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"This is by far the worst can opener I've used.

Cheaply made and useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I purchased a NEW Cuisinart Can Opener from an Amazon.com seller a few weeks ago. I think I've used it 6 - 7 times to open soup cans. The can opener is junk. It would take 5 minutes or more to open the can if I was lucky. It first tore the paper off the soup can, then it took me many times to try and line it up so the blade was actually hitting the top of the can. Worst can opener I have ever bought. I'm very dissapointed in Cuisinart. And most of it is made of plastic painted to look like brush chrome. I just bought a Hamilton Beach can opener. It's a much better product with lots of metal parts, easy to use, opens the cans quickly and quiet. The blade lines up instantly to the top of the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Ours broke apart after about 2 years. It's made of cheap plastic and just painted chrome, it's hard to get many average cans to align properly (this was an annoying problem the whole time), and I would not buy it again nor recommend it. Not worth the price and not well built. Try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"I choose this because of who it was made by and the reviews I read. I liked the appearance. Wish it would have been metal and not plastic though/but they don't make things like that anymore.

(only had a couple mths)"},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to open a can","review":"The can opener does not work on cans we have tried to open. I am considering returning it. The cutting blade would not penetrate a small can of mushrooms. Then when we did the blade to penetrate a larger can of beef broth, we had to hold the top lever down firmly, and help the can rotate on the opener, Not what I would consider a top of the line product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted a good can opener got a bad one","review":"Not a high priced can opener, but not a cheap one either. I usually am a middle of the road kinda guy usually finding adequate quality in the mid range price bracket.I used to have respect for the name \\"Cuisinart\\" so I forked out the few extra bucks to upgrade from the last can opener that was worthless and didn't work. I was hoping that with the name backing it I would be satisfied, and I am not hard to get along with. Well shortly after purchasing it, it became more and more difficult to get the can to align correctly to open the can. It did not always hold the can properly, sometimes dropping it and making a mess. Then it began to make a grinding sound that got worse and worse till I just couldn't stand it any more, so in the trash with you. Can't anybody make a decent can opener at a reasonable price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst can opener I've ever owned","review":"You're definitely paying extra for the Cuisinart name, and I'm suprised they'd put it on something so poorly designed. I was expecting more given their reputation. It's plastic, light, and not very stable. It's VERY difficult to get the can to mesh with the cutter blade ... it usually takes me three tries. The cutter arm is held on with a tiny T-shaped piece of plastic that splits easily (ask me how I know). And to top it all off, it yanks the top up and splashes food around when it's done. Don't bother ... I wish I hadn't. I feel like I've been taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment...","review":"1.

This is not a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total POS !","review":"This is the worst POS for a can opener that I have EVER seen! It lasted almost ONE WEEK before it fell apart. It's CRIMINAL in my opinion to ever sell something this shoddy in design, workmanship and inferior construction.The first week the opener sort of opened cans OK but not great. By the second week the cutter head was wearing out and would not even hold the can, let alone open it.ABSOLUTE JUNK IMNHO.I can't believe Cuisinart would even place their name on this Chinese CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst can opener I ever bought","review":"Openning a dog food can is nearly impossible without at least 6 or 7 tries to get the blade to catch.

I could have lived with the splashing of the can's contents after the abrupt end of it's opening, but the re-positioning it time and time again just to get it to connect correctly in order to open a can is ridiculous. Most times, it begins turning around the can, and you're thinking it's your lucky day!....just to find out that it never made the actual cut into the can!I bought a .99 hand can opener last week as back-up, just to be sure I wouldn't be stranded on Thanksgiving day without the ability to open a can, should this one have decided not to work at all!Funny, I own cheapie can-openers in the past that worked for many years.

It was the only clock in the house with the proper time after a black-out, and the dual alarms with weekday/weekend settings were great. But just last night, after having it for two years, it stopped working. After messing around with switches and such, I found that putting the \\"dimmer\\" to the high setting was the only way it worked, and the numbers were barely visible. The bottom was _burning_ up, like a Sony laptop battery. I thought it was going to start a fire, so I just unplugged it. I was late to work this morning, and have to go buy a new alarm on the way home . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but poor quality","review":"I really liked this clock at first; it sets itself automatically when you plug it in, it recovers after power outages, and it has nice flexible alarm settings. (By the way Theresa, weekend alarms can be turned on by holding the Alarm 1/2 button and pressing Alarm Mode).However, after just 3 months the clock began acting erraticly; the display segments periodically fail and some buttons no longer work. Needless to say this impairs the usability. It is disappointing that a clock marketed as being so \\"high-tech\\" would fail so quickly, and I will not buy from Emerson Research again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Stinks - Good Clock","review":"The AM radio is awful.

Since these are NOT Atomic and are pre programmed on a memory chip they can no longer change to the new time. Now three weeks later, after changing the time manually, we were waken up 1 hour early when it reset to the old DST and made the time 1 hour later. This, or the opposite, will always happen twice a year! It becomes a manual clock that will always default to the wrong time, during the new DST timetable, or when unplugged or after a power outage! If you need to get to work on time bring this clock back or throw it out! so far they are offering no support for these problems. Unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clock","review":"The clock does everything it says it going to do. The dials are easy to read and easy to set the alrms.

Thus, with this clock, we are required to reset the clock whenever DST goes in or out. I bought it for the power failure reset feature (not the DST feature).I purchased this clock because it has \\"Smart Set.\\" I guess it's not too smart if I need to reset it when we don't even observe DST. Why wouldn't you have a \\"non-DST\\" time zone in the unit? Luckily I can return this unit easily. Great concept, just a tad weak in your execution--don't they ever give this to a consumer to try before they market it??."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but if the basics don't work.....","review":"I bought this clock knowing that emerson had a bad rep. But I figured I'd give them a shot and spend 7 more dollars on a new \\"high-tech\\" alarm clock than a decent everyday sony for $13. The features would be great and my complaints could be overlooked but I shouldn't have to overlook flaws in a product that I spent my hard earned money for.I bought the clock yesterday and plugged it in for the first time today. It cycled through its' time setting phase and set the propper time day and year (yay!). But today is thursday and the clock insists that 8/31/06 is a sunday. My other complaint is that straight out of the box one of the led segments are dead. what kind of quality control lets this happen, obviously to a number of people (other reviewers)?I sincerely wanted to like this clock but I now have a bad taste in my mouth called Emerson Research."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, decent alarm clock radio, nice features","review":"My mom was actually the first to purchase this radio.

So when My birthday came along, she bought me one. Unfortunately, the factory battery was dead in my radio, but I replaced it and the clock keeps time, and resets itself when tested. great alarm features, 2 alarms able to set them for different days of the week if preferred. Note, these are not atomic clocks, if the battery dies completely without being replaced, the clock will reset to 1200. These were set at the factory, and the little lithium battery (2430) keeps them active. I like the clock, works well, and the radio is decent as well. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!

Also the Buzzer is VERY soft and has no volume setting for it. If you put the alarm across the room from your bed you'll probably not hear it let alone wake up from it!This is the worst alarm clock I've ever had!

I know they didn't foresee such a change but the changes forces me to buy a new clock if I want to have a working self setting clock?

I do wish there were other works published by this author, because I would surely buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but Agiri doesn't deliver.","review":"Agiri's story, which begins in West Virginia and migrates to New Haven--with occasional excursions to other places--starts from a good idea (the ultimate in Victorian restrictions: male-male relationships), but then doesn't go further. Agiri seems to have traded quality for quantity, and while her story is enjoyable and relaxing in a boring Sunday-afternoon kind of way, we never see her characters developed: they each have their own \\"history,\\" but their development in the story (if any) is plainly linear. The story seems to move slowly and with no clear direction, but ironically it still remains highly predictable. This is not a novel which Forster, as one of the reviews on the book's jacket claims, would have written. Agiri's attempt was noble, and her details of a Victorian New England are well-based, but she fails to grab all the elements she's amassed and deliver a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reader in flight","review":"This really is an awful book - the worst sort of airless female fantasy about homosexual men. It's quite elegantly written, but deeply pornographic, not in the number and fervour of its sexual descriptions, but in its lack of anything else: this is all the author wants to write about. The scene is the sheerest fantasy: a version of 19th-century Yale in which no student has any interest whatever in the opposite sex.The author's role model seems to have been Mary Renault, whose wonderful book The Charioteer receives an oblique kind of tribute in the final pages. Read The Charioteer instead, or again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Gem!","review":"This is one of my favourite books, which I revisit often to reread most of the scenes.

Contacted WalMart and Phillips both, with no satisfaction from either. Phillips was hard to contact, and when I finally got through to someone, their only solution was to sell me a reconditioned one. I had a service technician look at it, and he could find nothing, but we fought it for four years, mostly trying to just ignore it.

I found it on my mother's bookshelves and, knowing that she read principally for enjoyment, I wondered why the professor had assigned it. I found it on first reading a fascinating account of a trial and of small town life, and a welcome change from the dry texts we had been studying. Later, when I came to practice law in a small town myself, I realized that Cozzens has captured better than any author I ever have read the \\"taste\\" of real law practice. I have read it several times and recommend it to any literate person."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best portrait of law practice in American fiction","review":"No American novel portrays better what it is like to practice law. Even though many, if not most, of the details of practice have changed in the 60-odd years since this was written, the book still gives a wonderfully accurate sense of what it is like to be in trial, think through legal issues, and deal with other lawyers. (It is hard to believe--but nonetheless true--that the author was not a lawyer.) In addition, the depiction of a fairly ordinary murder trial is neatly interwoven with the story of how a somewhat arrogant young lawyer takes an important step or two toward maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant description of a trial and its participants","review":"This is the book that a trial lawyer (me) can give to his friends who want to know \\"what's it like?\\" In addition to capturing the terror and boredom of a trial, Cozzens evokes small town New England as well as anyone I've ever read. His flawed and believable characters wrestle realistically with moral and ethical dilemmas.Cozzens also shines in \\"Guard of Honor\\" and \\"By Love Posessed.\\" I don't know why he has fallen out of favor. His style may be too dense for modern, short attention spans. Their loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of a trial","review":"This is a solid, intelligent novel centering around a murder trial. Abner Coates is an assistant DA, and this is his first murder case. Cozzens isn't anything if not thorough, and the legal proceedings in all their details unfold impressively. Anyone interested in courtroom procedurals will find much to savor here (including the somewhat surprising verdict). In addition to the murder trial, there are other legal matters intertwined in the story, the most interesting being a case involving a schoolteacher who had some of his students pose nude for him. Coates's relationship with Bonnie Drummond, a woman he's been dating, is also explored. Cozzens writes with sureness and authority, sometimes so much so that the prose (and thus the characters) can seem bloodless at times. But his commanding and sturdy narrative skills are a pleasure to experience, and the feeling one has at the end is that the book couldn't have been made any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"First modern novel on lawyers--before Grisham!","review":"This is a fine and thoughtful novel--good English,very important topic, very human maturing lawyer who learns that the noble citizens are too often unjust and that some of the \\"bad guys\\" often are seeking to be just. Some important passages will only be fully understood by lawyers. I had been told that Anatomy of a Murder (late 60's) was the first pre-Grisham book. It is a fine book and made a good movie. The Just and the Unjust (40's) is, I think, clearly better--the law, the lawyers, the reality, and the humanism of many lawyers. I hope Amazon can resurrect ths book, at least for some.Herb BeningtonVienna VAage 78 and growing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed Information on Many Hindu Goddesses","review":"David Kinsley's work is always thorough - this book is no exception.

Reading the book provides inspiration, motivation and practical techniques for achieving balanced success in life and business. Some of the vignettes are poignient while others are somewhat blase.

This one stands out because it is a collection of stories or essays written by many different successful or famous people. If you've read books by Napoleon Hill, and many others, and found them to be long, drawn out, and going into excrutiating detail (even though they are also excellent), you'll find this book quite refreshing as each author has 2 or 3 pages to make his point.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the three Aeron books, and I was thrilled to find this one. . . until I read it. I did finish reading it, although it was a struggle. I found that the amount of violence and vengeance was almost palpable as I was reading. I found it disturbing to say the least. It was definitely not of the calibre of Patricia Kennealy's Keltiad series, and it tainted my view of her earlier works.

The characters are underdeveloped and shallow. There is a \\"waiting\\" for action which is predictable when it finally comes. A catharsis for the author? I miss the Keltia I have come to enjoy, richly developed, emotionally meaningful. Ms. Keneally does a disservice to her \\"bard\\" Morric Douglas by keeping his character remote and distant. I grew tired of the anger, which almost seemed undeserved based on the shallowness of the character she was avenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read, not like her earlier work...","review":"I feel for Kennealy-Morrison, I really do. But I must agree with other reviewers here that this book is far below the quality of her earlier work. I loved the original Copper Crown series, they were vivid and engaging. This book is so obviously and painfully autobiographical that it's quite hard to read.I sympathize with what she's been through. And I know writers are supposed to \\"write what you know\\". But this was too much for most of us, we don't want to share this stuff. Let Jim go Patricia, and get on with your life.

I have to agree that the characters and plot lines are poorly developed, but my biggest disappointment with this novel was the underlying tone of racism. The motivations behind the expulsion of the \\"Incomers\\" truly bothered and concerned me. I would definitely recommend against this being your first Kennealy-Morrison read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A synopsis of a novel, not the novel itself.","review":"Lack of dialogue, more 'telling' than 'showing', rushed pacing, and overuse of authorial intrusions make this book a disappointment to loyal readers of Patricia Kennealy-Morrison. 'Blackmantle' might have been an epic series stretched out along two or three books, but even having to wait for those books would have been preferable to reading what amounts to a several hundred page synopsis of the novel(s) the author should have written. If you want vintage Kennealy-Morrison, stick with 'The Copper Crown', 'The Throne of Scone', or 'The Silver Branch'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after Arthur & Aeron","review":"My 1st experience with Ms. Kennealy's writing was the \\"Aeron\\" trilogy, starting with The Copper Crown - truly excellent in my opinion, as was The \\"Arthur\\" trilogy. Suffice to say that Blackmantle was a severe disappointment. Athyn's development was disjointed, the obsession with revenge & torture unappealing and plot meandering. Morric appeared as a paper thin entity not a consort; the other characters also lacked depth enough to be anything but pale scenery. I found myself scanning, not reading, hoping vainly that the plot would improve. This book doesn't have much in common with its predecessors or the Keltia previously described /created. Skip this book and read Copper Crown or The Hawk's Gray Feather as an introduction to Keltia. Hopefully Ms. Kennealy will regain her previous focus in future \\"Keltia\\" installments and put aside the disappointing diatribe shown in Blackmantle."},{"rating":"1","title":"get hooked on the others of the keltiad not this","review":"I have read all of the Keltiad produced to dae and found this one very disappointing. If you are new to Patricia's work start in one of her other books. Black Mantal gives some more background to characters we meet in Aeryn and Arthur's trilogies; however, the characterization in this book is incredibly weak. Start with The Copper Crown or another one of the books of the Keltiad and return to this book later so you aren't so terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paging Mr. Dickens.","review":"Well, I only read this book to keep up with the rest of the Keltiad, so some of the background detail was Ok.I will point out one howler, Athyn's much loved stepfather was one of the hated Incomers. At least she waited until he died before she tried to slaughter the rest.And as for her love life, I'm reminded of Mr. Dick in _David Copperfield_ He couldn't keep King Charles' head out of his writings, Kennealy-Morrisson is obsessing about Jim Morrisson. Give it up. He's DEAD. Personnally if it was that great a romance, he would have made it a legal(civil) marriage a LOT sooner.He was as big a twit as any of the rest of us can be even when we're not strung out on our drug of choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women of Power, Women of Class","review":"Lush prose of relentless originality makes Blackmantle, like its Author, a force to be reckoned with. Here are characters of fortitude in a culture where magic, honor, and high Love nurture the extraordinary in the mortal spirit. Blackmantle --like the other books of Keltia-- transcends its subjects and mere life in the kind of writing that changes lives.With this book, Kennealy-Morrison continues the work of her late husband (universally loved, high-impact Jim Morrison of The Doors) by challenging her audience. She inspires identity and creativity, demanding and encouraging the best of the human spirit. Bravo, Morrisons. We hear you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Entertaining and Surprising","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent with this easy to read work.

The album wasn't what I was expecting at all. I was hoping for a couple of girls playing their instruments and singing some bluegrass, but instead I got an overproduced and souless album.

For me these reviews are about the confusion about the place of this book in literature (a confusion which is correctly noted by these thoughtful reviewers) but I think they will make more sense if we quote Agee himself on his book:\\"It is simply an effort to use words in such a way that they will tell as much as I want to and can make them tell of a thing which has happened and which, of course, you have no other way of knowing. It is in some degree worth your knowing what you can, not because you have any interest in me but simply as the small part it is of human experience in general. It is one way of telling the truth: the only way possible of telling the kind of truth I am here most interested to tell.\\"Like Finnegans Wake, this book is a never ending adventure in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"I have no idea how this book got such a reputation as a classic. Agee writes that he is afraid that he will not be able to appropriately capture everything that he is witnessing, and that was a valid concern on his part; the text is overwrought and verbose to the point of being unreadable. Four hundred and some pages of unreadable, really.On the other hand, the photographs by Walker Evans are spectacular. I would rather have seen the whole story of these tenant families in Evan's stunning black and white than wade through James Agee's tedious prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read.","review":"I see no redeeming social value to Agee's poorly written, disjointed, and condescending dribble. He befriends a few weak and troubled families and projects them upon a whole people and then manages to betray the families and their trust in him even to the point of rifling through their meager possessions. I doubt that they would have done the same to him. If this is an American classic, I pity this country and those who judge its literature.

So much so that I ordered a second pair. But when they arrived, the new pair was at least one size wider and at least a half size longer. I could see just by eyeballing them that the shoes were much too wide. And when I held the right shoe up to the right shoe of my old pair of Jupiters, the difference was even more apparent. In addition, the leather in my old pair was shiny outside and soft and lovely on the inside. The new pair was dull, dull, dull; and I could not tell whether the inside was leather or some sort of leather-look-a-like product. The degradation in materials and quality control between the earlier pair purchased and this one was amazing.

Mike Patton has basically always been able to surround himself with some of the greatest musicans in the market. I can not recall a time when he has truly let down, although some of his cds are not the most, listenable (mike patton adult themes for voice). If you're a Mike Patton fan you will love this album. The production seems much cleaner, and the samples (children's toys and cartoons) mixed with the atmospheric sounds add a wonderfully unique and comedic aspect to the album.

Suspended Animation is a strange beast, closer to the debut Fantoma's album yet very different - happier, more sadistic.What makes Mike Patton projects so good is that he is more than happy to slice and dice the most amazing sound scapes with impunity, much to the annoyance of the listener. Like always there are some real gems buried in the album, bits you wished went on and were developed but are sacrificed - for the greater good though. That's the beauty of Suspended Animation.This album won't appeal to everyone, and it will take a number of times to grow on most listeners. Not a five star album to be realistic, but a damn good one. Far less mainstream than Mr. Pattons recent General Patton vs. The Xecutioners but just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"sheer nihilistic crap","review":"Any old fool could put this garbage together.

But, being a fan of Mike Patton's from his days with Faith No More, and upon reading the great reviews the album has been getting, I was curious to see what the fuss was about. I must say I'm very disappointed. Granted, there are some interesting moments and Dave Lombardo does an incredible job, but the whole thing leaves me a little perplexed to say the least.Some of it reminded me of the \\"interludes\\" on Frank Zappa's Sheik Yerbouti album while the rest, to me, sounded like a bunch of kids learning their instruments while jamming and trying to come up with good ideas for songs. Other parts sounded like listening to a CD while your finger is on the fast forward button. The interesting moments are just that, moments.

I read this book in high school in the mid 60s, and in my small Iowa town, where no Jews live, I became familiar with a minority that had borne unspeakable horror. Mr. Vrba was a teenage Slovak Jew that was deported from his country. In a series of almost miraculous events, he was able to secret himself and escape after nearly 3 years in this death camp. This book is blunt and gripping in its reality, and yet I felt that it was probably worse than he reported. It gave me a morbid awareness, that these unspeakable acts should never be forgotten (or forgiven)in the hope that in the telling they will never recur.

Unitl that time (the 1960s) the Holocaust was an abstract event that happened before my birth. Verba's characterization of the events leading to his experiences in Auschwitz, the details of the life and deaths within the camp, and the personalities of the people, both prisoners and guards he interacted with MADE me aware of the darkest chapter in human history, and started me on a life avocation.

I think if I had to sum up a review in one sentence, it would be: I don't get it! Crazy Horse in Heaven is hard to follow. I really didn't like the writing style. It kinda had no rythm to it, just sort of plowing along without any real end in sight. The bits of poetry were pretty good. All in all, I'd say pass on this one. Not worth the price.

By the cover you would think this was a movie season that was about horses. This is not a movie!!! It is a dvd that talks about horses and rodeos and such. The reason I thought it was a movie and not a 'talking about rodeos and what horses are best for this type of thing' was because it said: \\"Go behind the scenes to see just what it takes to make a barrel racing horse, a performing horse, a trail riding horse and even a police horse! Interviews with trainers, handlers, riders, and owners provide an up close and personal look at the various roles of this beautiful and majestic animal.\\" So I thought that those would just be behind the scenes things but it is in fact what this dvd is.

It is a captivating book that is part history and part (probably the biggest part) fiction centered around an historic figure. I imagine old Hugh did go through very similar experiences during his time in hell. This book gives a great depiction of what life probably was like for a mountain man in the early 1800s. It reminds me of the sheer luxuries we all take for granted in every day life compared to those who lived before us. Hugh Glass is portrayed as a determined man who was about as tough as any creature on the planet could be. I imagine he was.

No really moving feeling here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Weakest","review":"This is very disapointing to me, because Kimball got me hooked on trance with ICU Session 1. But this album is different it's progressive, not that prog is bad but this album [...]. There's only a few good songs and they were on albums from last year. I think Kimball is leaning towards this type of progressive due to the success of Tiesto and Ferry Corsten. But his attempt is a sad one. People say Generation 2000 is his best, but i think that it [...] too. I saw Kimball in August and even his performance was disapointing, i mean it was being advertised on the radio and it was over sold so the floor was filled with non-dancing nerds. I waited for the chance to see him live since the first time i heard ICU Session1, but it seems he's lost his love for music. It appears that he only loves the money now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, going home...","review":"I'd like to point out, for the record, the Progressive style is not new territory for Kimball Collins. As someone that grew up dancing to Kimball's sets every Saturday night at Ahzz in Orlando I can tell you Kimball's roots are in Progressive House. Only when he signed on with ICU did he display the NRG version of K.C. So, maybe the frenetic trance thing was just a phase (I hope) and the tracks on display here are Kimball returning home.This CD is the real deal. The thing, for me, that Kimball is returning to is a pure fun kind of beat. Kimball's mixing is flawless, as always, and one of the things I like most about his style is that he balances euphoric melodies and vocals without letting go of the driving basslines. Lastly, while many DJs have tried to create a dark side to the sound, Kimball has never let go of the positive energy that is a central theme of the music. Here's to you Kimball, glad to see you're on the path back to the old skool...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pretty much worthless compilation!","review":"Has anyone noticed lately that Kansas is totally going mad with every sort of compilation?

Just go out and buy LEFTOVERTURE, MASQUE, MONILITH, KANSAS, and POINT OF KNOW RETURN (POKR should have gotten at least four tracks because it's the greatest album that they've ever made, but instead they give it one lousy track). Just go out and buy the whole albums that these tracks come from. Believe me they are ultra superb albums and some of these tracks from them are the wrong ones to include. \\"It Takes A Woman's Love\\" shouldn't have been included because it's not classic Kansas to me.

While I willadmit that I have only a passing acquaintance with the Pine Ridgereservation, I do keep abreast of Indian Country politics, and itseems to me that both Native American political leaders, and the USgovernment have become a lot more sophisticated in their dealing witheach other over the past 10 years or so.A poor premise can stillmake a good book, however, if it is well written.

The writing was skillful and the insights into character were interesting, but I thought the subject matter leaned too far to the depressed side of life with characters whose burdens were much too heavy to share the same book. Men didn't come off very well at all. This is not a short story collection you pick up to be entertained, however, it could provoke lots of discussion and thoughtful conversation.

The intimacy in the book made me want things to work out for Jenny and Lizzie. There were just enough suspenseful twists in the plot that I couldn't stop until I'd finished reading the whole book. My poor little dog had to wait until I got to pauses in the action for me to take her for her walks! Now I want to see what other works Ms Applewater has written will interest me.

It's gold plated connectors should provide a superior contact and I've had absolutely no issues with this one.

Starting with 'Luces no belicas' strong intro, followed by 'arrepentimiento' showing us a more electronic sound. Then we have beautiful balads such as 'milagro' and 'micorazon'. and, finally 'amanece' which in my opinion would be the masterpiece of the album; slowy grows with valenzuela's soft voice, gives you the chills, leaves you thinking. it's an album to enjoy. definitively worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this battery hog","review":"I purchased the camera over a year ago and have been living (don't ask me why) with dismal battery life problems since day one.

I liked how the features were well layed out and easy to use. An overall pretty basic digital camera without all those extra features you probably dont need unless you're a professional photographer. The only things I didnt like about this camera was 1. It goes thru batterys way to fast. So I recommend either buying rechargeable batterys or those expensive longer life batterys. 2.

My older Olympus 3.5MP camera produced better images than the A700.Although I read some of the reviews and the overall rating for this camera was low, I was still inclined to pick it up based on the camera specs and the low price.

However, I found out that the wheel slips on carpet a lot and therefore does not rotate as much it should. The result is no popping. I found a nice little trick to solve the problem. The reason for slipping is the smooth wheels on this toy. So to increase friction with carpet or floor, I put two rubber bands (those friendship bands that you put in your wrist) on both wheels.

Even adults have a hard time getting it to roll rather than slide. We remedied this issue by tightly wrapping a few rubber bands around the circumference of the wheels to create traction. It works great now and my son loves it. The old ones were made better, though. The toy is definitely worth the $15 paid.

Wrong... the twins are terrified of this toy. They would literally startle/jump when they hear the popping noise. They have so far refused to have anything to do with it. They aren't typically timid or noise sensitive in most situations. The popping sound is very loud and sudden, so I can see how it can be anxiety provoking for a 1 year old unless it is used in a place with high background noise. Luckily it is a cheap item so I will hold on to it in hopes that it will make a good gift for another child some day. I will probably try to reintroduce this toy again in a few months, but seriously... The only thing they are more frightened of is the vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - wheels don't turn","review":"I bought this for my 10 month old.

He was excited when he heard the popping noise as I pushed it around and showed him how it works but for some reason he can't maneuver this toy by himself very well. Even at 11 months he's not able to do it although he walks perfectly on his own. I think it's because the handle is so narrow and the toy is light weight. Also on hardwood floors the wheels don't grip so it doesn't pop but rather just drags across the floor. I would take this back to the store if i could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Birthday Toy","review":"I bought this toy for my nephew's first birthday.

If you want this much zoom, stick with a spotting scope (still need a tripod)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly but excellent","review":"This book looks like it was designed 50 years ago even though it was published in 1997.

I would consider ordering another pair to have a spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly beautiful","review":"I nearly fell out of my chair when I began reading this collection. I then read it cover-to-cover in a single sitting. It is difficult to describe O'Connor's style, simply because it is so infinitely unique. \\"Visceral\\" is a start, but it falsely suggests an explicit rendering of detail and emotion. Rather, the stories are written with an odd, and even ethereal, detachment. Each story surprises and frightens you; and, as you finish one, you find that you must read the next. It is a strange spell. The characters seem so exaggerated, yet palpable and familiar. I do wonder why Flannery O'Connor isn't read more. Her writing is so taut and finely tuned; her stories disturbing, haunting, and ineffably sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Normally I don't give much of a damn about justice, but really....2 stars? All because of some theological issue? Yikes.I'm a fan of Flannery O'Connor's work. I would probably buy \\"The Complete Works\\" first...but this is definitely a good collection. Strange, even somewhat freakish, stories that entertain but more importantly force thought... I respect her use of the \\"grotesque\\"...these stories are not happy tales of joy and love, and they are better because they are not. The darker sides of the stories make the moments of brightness resplendent...the contrast is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cryptic Title","review":"Usually the title of a book gives the reader a clue as to the theme. Here the title describes a physical impossibility, since everything that rises obviously must diverge. Apparently the author received an inspiration for her book from the 19th century French Roman Catholic priest, Pierre Teilhard DeChardin who believed that all human cultures are converging to an Omega Point identified as Christ. Or as he wrote \\"Everything that arises must converge\\". What a difference a one word makes. It is odd that an author would make such an important error in a book title, completely destroying the theme of what otherwise is good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I'm not big on books that discuss racial conflicts, but Flannery O'Connor does so in a way that doesn't glorify either side, instead she admits all faults. She makes the reader aware that flaws aren't found in someone's skin color, but in their thinking. I haven't read many other stories by her, but because of this book she has become one of my favorite authors. Her symbolism is rare nowadays and thought provoking to say the least. I was suprised by the gore and shock in the stories, but loved it nonetheless as I think others who are looking for somehting enlightening to read, but don't have the time for long novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Best Short Story Author","review":"Kurt Vonnegut considers Flannery O'Connor the world's best short story author and I can easily see why. In each of her stories the depression era south is vividly depicted in a unique, concise and impactful style. Each character is uniquely and realistically flawed and the scenerios are almost without exception tragic, and still reading her words is a truly delightful experience. For anyone interested in writing fiction these short stories are great inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt it was not a safe family movie","review":"There were a handful of sexual innuendos that caused me to take this movie off of our approved list.

I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show.As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny.

They have a draw back though, they are not designed for reading in bed or any place where you will be resting the back of you head. Due to the rigid construction allowing for no forward slippage it inhibits head resting; pushing the glasses forward away and off the face. Manufacturer should make a soft band type so these glasses would be useful all round. Still love'm."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice idea, but several drawbacks","review":"The glasses look very cool when they're hanging around your neck. They don't have that \\"old lady\\" look of traditional reading glasses dangling from a chain. I bought them in red, and the color is beautiful, a nice cherry color, not garish. I even had a young security worker at the airport ask me where I got them.However, even if you adjust them to the maximum size they'll only fit you if your head is on the small side and you're not wearing any sort of headgear that could interfere with them; even a ponytail or any sort of fullness in the hair could make the glasses too tight, and then they'll press painfully on your nose, if you can get them on at all. Even if they fit, they might rumple your hairstyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to be able to adjust for bigger heads.","review":"Glasses would be great, but need to be able to adjust for bigger heads.

On my system it spins up the CD burner, then hangs the whole system. You have to force terminate the program to regain control of the system.

Not dark brown but not light tan. So, I was in between a lot with the advice on what colors to purchase.

Therefore the President will always get away with murder. The author is apparently oblivious to this fact.This is why President Ford could pardon President Nixon even though Nixon hadn't been convicted of anything. Nixon could have pardoned himself. Presidential pardon powers are completely unrestricted.

The beginning is electrifying. Imagine being an accidental witness to the death of a woman having sex with the President of the USA. From then on, everything goes straight downhill. The witness, a lifelong burglar, flees the country, but decides to come back at great risk to himself and make the President accountable for his part. More agents become involved - some feel guilty about what they're doing; some feel no remorse at all. More and more innocent people die at the hands of the Secret Service. I personally don't believe two agents would cover up a shooting, even involving a philandering President, without going to their superiors. But that's why fiction is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment with a little irony too","review":"This is a fun book to read. There may be a few too many coincidences, a few trite characters/relationships, and at times it seems it is written for TV or the movies, but the plot is plausible enough to keep it interesting.I would love to know if it is coincidence or if Baldacci has a subtle ironic sense of humor that Luther, a lifelong criminal, has the initials LAW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This was the first book that I have read by Baldacci, but it wasnt long before I was buying all his books.

On to the review -It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight.

It follows with lots of padding--pretentious stuff not relevant to the thriller stuff such as lots of erotic stuff and padding, padding, padding. It loses one star per 100 pages. The final portion becomes a page turner but with still occasional padding. End result: one star out of five.Examples of the nonsense: The chief of staff of the White House (a woman) rapes the unconscious President of the United States! A lieutant of the state police of Virginia forces his way into the White House during a cabinet meeting to deliver court documents.

Absolute Power is gripping and intense. A great Washington novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn the pages","review":"You will keep turning the pages of this book. You will be gripped by the plot. Mr Baldacci has the strenghts of Jeffrey Archer. A superb story teller. However, he also has the same weakness of absurd ignorance of some facts.

But you will not put the book down"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well thought out first novel.","review":"I would definitely have to classify this as a major work fora first novel. The prose is lively, the dialogue terse, andthe plot devilishly believable. It is not hard to read between the very wide lines of the author's absolute loathing of Washington society and the political elite. A feeling which will enamor him to the majority of his American readers. The only problem I had with the novel was the absence of a Vice-President. Surely he would have played a role either in the investigation or in a possible pardon. Especially considering how political that particular office has become. Overall, however, a highly readable and impressive first effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"What really gets me about \\"Absolute Power\\" is that the premise while far-fetched is written so well that you don't question it. Baldacci manages to drive the story at a breakneck pace with highly realized characters and subplots. This is one of the first books in a very long time where I did not know what going to happen until the last page. It's a smart read without making the reader dumb. I recommend this to Grisham, Cornwell and Sandford fans. You really can't do better than this, you will love every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be talented, but the writing needs to be improved","review":"Lots of boring repeatitions in this books. Lot of pages you have to leap frogged through. The plots sometimes twisted very unnaturally and pretentiously. But this writer is somewhat talented due to his legal experience, but definitely not great as J. Grisham. Don't be fooled by your lucky success this time, your fame might be obscured if you fail to improve your writing logic. And most important of all, don't pick J.G. as your role model. If the screenplay had to make a lot of changes, it only means there were two many flaws in the original book, and the movie itself still turned out to be very bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book but don't see the movie.","review":"I'm sure Clint Eastwood acts his heart out as Luther in Absolute Power, but I don't want to see the movie. From the book's first page you are immersed in Luther's private and oddly honorable world of thievery. The author pulls you by the collar through the story and won't let you go, at least not until four-fifths of the way through the book. That's where the biggest shocker of this shock-loaded novel sets in. That's where you pray the movie producer changed the storyline. I don't know if he did, so I'll stick with my memory of Baldacci's compelling writing and leave the film watching to movie buffs"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READ FROM START TO FINISH.

Why the hell not -- the publisher got away with raping the people who bought this dreck, didn't he? Space and time restrictions (plus the fact that I just ate) prevent me from detailing why I found this book so offensive, so we'll just deal with these highly developed characters my fellow reviewers found so appealing -- a combination of inhumanly beautiful billionaires who are also idealistic, crackerjack attorneys. The only thing highly developed about them was their physiques -- his \\"rock hard\\" wrestler's body, her balloon like breasts etc., to which we are treated many descriptions of. How about that thief, who steals ONLY from the rich and then literally gives the booty away? CHECK THE BOOK, I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP.

I was reluctant because I have seen the movie and thought I would be a step ahead every page. I was wrong. As usual, the book is better than the movie.

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Without giving too much away I found myself skimming pages just trying to get to the end and seriously considering giving up on the book all together. I think the main issue is so much time is spent on the villans in the story you begin to genuinely dislike them and I found myself frustrated with having to hear about these characters who were so despicable. I will say it's an easy read and given it is a mystery and there are a few twists and turns (so many that it was a bit cliche) so maybe that will be entertaining for some readers but overall I found it annoying and frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Made","review":"Mommy and baby enjoy this purchase very much.

This book saved me from making a huge mistake by showing me I was trying to \\"reach\\" too far with my first publication project.

It gave a lot of useful tips and pointers as well as information I never thought about. I checked the book out of the library initially, but I want my own copy.This book gives you step by step details on how to enter the publishing field on a tight budget. It gives you an abundance of resources. Some of those include:* Starting out with little cash (and how he did it)* Trade secrets necessary to pick winning publications* How to hire the people you need (at a price you can afford)* How to save money on printing* Reproducible Business FormsThis is a great book to include in your self-publishing library.

Funny, I alway thought the point of a speech was to persuade someone to hold your beliefs. There is bad Science this is bad literature. It teaches nothing but liberal spin to everything in life. One example of a speech in the book even says \\"limit the male population to 20% of the world's total inhabitants.\\" I can not even decipher the point of the speech in 2/3rds of the examples that I have read. In the book there are no speeches by great orators like Williams Jennings Bryan, Lincoln, JFK, Reagen or even Clinton. Instead people such as Sally Miller Gearhart and Janet K. Hughes.

Laying on the floor, she could pull/move it enough to make the roll at the bottom chime, which she loved. I definitely want to get one for her for her first birthday too!

Though Denver can't compare to those seasoned pros, he does a decent job as well. This is a deeply moving, beautifully told story. I have watched it dozens of times, and cried every time. I wore out my home VHS tape and had to buy the video.

They should have stuck to what made their last few albums so great(Long Line of Leavers, 40 Acres, self-titled)--deep, honest, heartfelt songs about the things in life that Christians really struggle with (not just all the spiritual mumbo jumbo, but stuff like issues with dating and friendship; things that even people who aren't Christians can connect with).I'm looking forward to Caedmon's Call's next *real* CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caedmon's Call","review":"I recently went to a Caedmon's Call/Jars of Clay concert with my youth group and absolutely loved them. When I got home, I bought all the cds that they had played songs off of. This cd is awesome & truly captures their words and their meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"Caedmon's Call limits their normally broad range of lyrical topics to one -praise of the God of the universe-, but the music picks up right where 2000's Long Line of Leavers left off. This album stands in brilliant contrast to the lyrically, theologically, and/or musically bland \\"praise\\" music that has characterized the last 30 years of Christian publishing. The songs are enjoyable, substantive, and for the most part, new. This adds up to another great record from one of the best acts in the country today. My favorite track: while the music is catchier on some others, the lyrics to \\"Thy Mercy\\" are the most profound on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theological Depth Anchors A Good Worship CD (Tape)","review":"Cademon's Call theological depth, high view of God, and reflective tendancies have made their \\"regular\\" albums winners. These strengths are magnified in a truly Theocentric worship CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging and rich worship","review":"Although not every song on this album has gripped my heart and kept it, the songs that have are incredibly effective and beautiful. I especially like the two songs sung each by Derek Webb and Danielle Young, (I was a little disapointed that there wasn't more of them) and also the songs written by Josh Moore. Sandra McCracken has written some unusually beautiful melodies. I definitely recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Worship","review":"This CD is different from their previous work in that it is primarily a worship CD. It is a great worship CD! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it left me wanting to hear some of Derek's intellectual lyricism. Of course I know that it would be a little out of place in a worship CD, but you can't blame me for wanting it all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made Crap","review":"I purchased the Skullcandy Lowrider headphones about four months ago in October 2010. I was very careful with them because of the previous reviews. I figured if I treated them extra gently then maybe they wouldn't break. I was so wrong and I am so irritated at myself for not listening to what other people were saying. Last month (Jan 2011), the ear piece on the right side snapped. However, they were still usable. I just couldn't adjust them. Then today (Feb 28, 2011) the top band broke in the middle rendering them absolutely useless unless I find some duct tape and rig it up. Pay attention to the reviews people and save your money. These headphones are absolute crap. Also the sound quality is poor especially if you like bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas! Within 7 days they broke!

Very disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good until they snapped!","review":"My 14 yo daughter liked these very much until they snapped. She used them for 4 months (and is usually very carefully with her things) until the plastic headband broke when she was putting them on. It wasn't the center hinge that broke it was the end of the top headband right after the padding ended. The headphones do seem narrow/tight in the width. My daughter also mentioned that they would start to hurt her ears after wearing them for an extended period of time...after a couple of hours. Skullcandy offers a pretty good sounding warranty on their website. I will try that and let you know what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved them until they broke...","review":"I loved these headphones when I got them. However, the first pair I purchased, they snapped when I put them on my head. Ouch.

Unfortunately I noticed soon after wearing them for extended periods of times that they create a lot of pressure on your temple, making them very uncomfortable for people who are sensitive to that sort of thing. I suppose it is fine for children or petite people, but I am average size and I felt like they clamped onto my head much too tightly to be comfortable.Due to very poor construction the plastic part on the left side snapped in half when I went to put them on. I am always fairly gentle with then and haven't banged them around at all. It's much too late to return the product.So I do NOT recommend these at all. They look great, but feel terrible when you actually wear them and break easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Headphones-- 'Til They Broke 2 Months In","review":"I ordered these on 12/31/09 and on 02/08/10 they snapped when I was putting them on. I only use them at the office and I was not being particularly harsh with them, but they broke at the extender piece. VERY disappointing.Prior to that, they had offered me great sound (by my not-particularly-picky ears) and for the most part comfort, although I occasionally had them fitting a bit too tight after a couple of hours, which was easily fixed by the extender. Which is now broken.Bitter, bitter. This was my first time buying 'nicer' headphones, even if they were on sale. Maybe I should stick to my cheap drugstore headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily breakable","review":"I have bought two of these headphones in six months and both have broken. The second time, I knew I had to be careful and barely pulled them apart and they snapped. The plastic part that moves in and out has no strength what-so-ever. I highly recommend getting something more durable, and I will not be buying anything from skullcandy anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Design Flaw","review":"I purchased these knowing I was getting cheaper headphones than I normally get, but the reviews encouraged me to give them a shot and I didn't want to blow a lot of money. The sound quality itself is perfectly fine. I'm not super picky about the \\"perfect sound\\" all I care about is being able to enjoy my music without noticable flaws. To be honest though I avoid wearing these at all costs and this is where the BIG problem lies. They are extremely flimsy. I understand they are supposed to be portable, but you take them off your head and they fold up in your hands into a mess. They drive me absolutely insane, and I try to use the previous pair with the tearing wire over these. I don't know if mine were just extra loose, but if they are all like this DON'T BUY THEM. I don't know how anyone can use these without feeling constantly annoyed at them folding up all the time/falling off their head."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were broken","review":"They were broken but good and fast seller's service refunding my money back. One of the headphones didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"I love the look of these headphones!

Overall very happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I personally am not one to go for pink either but, I went ahead and took the chance because they were on sale. I'm glad i bought them now because they are amazing. They are worth the price thats for sure, I wouldn't trade them for any other headphones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst headphones","review":"The thing with these headphones is they look really cool. If that's what you're going for then by all means purchase and enjoy them. The problem is the sound quality. If you look at the numbers these headphones have less sound quality than earphones you get from the dollar store. I thought the numbers were wrong when I bought them because of all the really good reviews here on amazon, but when I got them I was surprised at how incredibly horrible they sound. Imagine trying to listen to your music that is broadcast over a radio station that you can tune into right. Horrendous sound quality. If you think they look sooo cool, buy them and take them apart and solder some decent speakers into them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Headphones","review":"Uncomfortable and a bit painful to wear. Sound quality is what I would consider poor but kids and other people who are relatively new for using headphones might say it sound quality is normal. I bought because the other positive reviews but wish I had not. With the list price being $34-$45 I assumed that they would have some quality to them. But it's all cheep plastic hiding behind a brand. If you asked me in a blind test to try out the headphones and asked me what I thought the retail value would be I'd guess $5.I would recommend not purchasing these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Uncomfortable","review":"I had been looking at these headphones for a long time. I'm not usually one to go for flashy, let alone pink, but I took a chance and purchased them because of the price. I was planning on using these headphones purely for their functionality in the dorm room and for my MP3 player. I got them just in time for a 4 hour flight and when I slipped them on to ignore some chatty passengers behind me, I could barely keep them on for 20 minutes. They were not comfortable (perhaps because I have a larger head than most). The padding on the top of the head was minimal and quite hard considering the pressure that the arms create by my temples. The cushion on the ears was fine and the sound quality was good, but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't necessarily recommend these headphones who are sensitive to pressure on their head. These headphones made the rest of my flight excruciating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, awful construction","review":"These headphones have pretty good sound quality and pretty good comfort but the construction is as cheap as you can get. I mean I didn't expect Koss quality for $14 but they broke the second time I wore them - just snapped when I was taking them off. They were a real waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"The headphones looked so cool and functional online but they snapped in half the first week I had them. They are not made for DJ'ing or heavy computer use, I was using them as MP3 headphones and that's when they snapped. Sad times."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"I really truely hate these headphones to the fullest..The Style and oomfort is great, but the sound quallity is horrible and usually I don't write reviews,but this is something that I would like to share to others who would want purchase this. These headphones takes the sound out of the song at first I thought something was wrong with my ipod, but then I realized that I couldn't be. The headphones makes the song sound remixed and kind of scratched can't really explain it, but I wouldn't put a dime in this if I were you. They're very pretty and cool looking, but I bought it for this reason and for incredible and audible sound..The sound is totally trashy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I adore my pink Skullcandy headphones!

Obviously, just not another pink pair :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to ipod ear buds for kids!","review":"My kids got ipods for Christmas and they had a very hard time listening to their music using the ear buds that came with the ipod. We first saw these at Target and were gonna buy them but they were 33.99 and I needed two pairs (one for each girl) so I checked Amazon and was ecstatic to get two of them for less than the cost of one at Target! These new headphones are fantastic! My kids love them and I have to say after trying them on I would like a pair for myself! They are awesome! They are a MUST HAVE for little kids who can't wear the standard ear buds! I highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handles are the weak spot","review":"This is a nice bag. However the handles are the weak point of this bag. Mine are fraying, and tearing, and have almost come apart. The bag itself is in great shape and I take care of it.

Again, I like the bag - but the handles are just not durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-read","review":"For anyone who wants to cut through the lies of 'just wars' and 'global cop' or 'the US supports democracy and freedom,' this book is essential. A long, close look at US foreign policy, based mostly on primary sources (presidential libraries), the book tells in the words of the decision-makers the prejudices guiding these wise men directing the course of 'democracy.' Mussolini, the Shah of Iran, Batista, et al., all 'our' allies despite the fact of democratically-elected governments the US had to push out of the way to make way for the strong-arm despots. Schmitz makes a good case that this was all due to paternalism (those little brown/yellow people aren't ready for democracy; anti-communism (the democratically-elected gov'ts the US replaced with dicators generally desired agrarian reform); and simple racism (see paternalism).They didn't teach me this stuff in school . . .A great bibliography represents long, hard scholarship, and the index makes this a great reference work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"This is not the album to buy.

It has some tracks but net,net it's a flat album that doesn't rise to the occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"C-Pen made short work of longhand!","review":"This pen was easy to work right away. When copying text from magazines, it copied most text well. The only problem was that it mistook letters sometimes, especially h's which became ii's. When I would scan from line to line, I would frequently get gobbily-gook. A readable copy required backtracking through the text to fix obvious problems. A perfect copy would take much longer, almost to the point of not saving time. Sometimes whole lines were missed but I could easily insert them. I would never trust the pen to copy without monitoring because of the loss of lines and the unreadable words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work On Vista 64 Bit!!!!!","review":"I ordered the Ectaco C- Pen 20 for school work, thought it was a great idea. But, after spending 2 days attempting to install it on my Vista 64 bit OS I found out that the c-pen, although physicaly is the same, when it is sold from different companies it works with their own software. So, the ECTACO brand pen does not work on Vista 64 bit and I could not get it to work properly with Vista 32 either, although the tech told me it would if I downloaded updated software: It didn't even with the new software. So I was forced to return the pen. But do not be fooled there are different software manufacturers that all sell the same product: be sure you know your operating system and then find a software that works for it, because the software is not interchangeable between manufacturers... I tried!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Software Compatability","review":"Useful and genererally works BUT the DC needs to be loaded each time the pen is used making it impossible to use on a laptop unless you carry the CD with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ectaco C-Pen 20 Handheld Scanner","review":"Overpriced and overrated, this company website sucks, they're more into selling their new products more so then having a proper support link. I guess once you buy the product they don't give a @### about you. I find this pen scanner to be very awkward and it doesn't ever scan without multiple errors characters. I bought it based on the high rating and in the review section, I don't know what these people find so fascinating about it. But I was very disappointed, for short one-liner scanning it is okay, but any extensive use is frustrating. I scan into Microsoft Word and find it very frustrating. I have had this pen for a while without using it. So is too late to return it now. But I would never buy any products from this company, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well but did not last long.","review":"I purchased the ECOTACO 3.0 pen scanner and worked well. I only used it for scanning the English language. Had the device for 3 months but only used it for 6-8 times for about an hour duration. The light started flickering and device stopped working. Not worth the price if stops working with limited use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company unapproachable","review":"Which one works with Windows 7, 64 bit? Good luck trying to figure that out before purchase. I strongly advise any prospective purchaser to approach the maker and just try get product info before purchases. I found it a total deal-killer. Impossible. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product overall","review":"I have type of various sizes I needed to input quickly into a text document - type size varies from 1/16\\" to 1/4\\" size, short product numbers. The pen works on 1/4\\" high text, but you do have to slow down a little. The smaller and/or darker the text, the quicker you can go and the less errors there are. If you scan too quickly you get gibberish or only a letter or two. Go a little slower and you get most but perhaps only one letter wrong. There is a definate range of speed that you learn to operate within and if you are in that range and the type is at least medium dark, the output is generally completely accurate. If the image is light you're going to have problems. Also, since the light in the pen operates on a pressure switch, you have to lift up the pen on a definate up stroke; otherwise it doesn't output at all. On the whole, well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"The circumference of the pen, where it needs to be held, is so big that its very difficult to hold the pen AND keep pressing a button (right next to where you are holding the pen) every time one needs to scan. The non circular construction of the pen (its flat) makes it even more difficult to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I purchased this after reading a lot of reviews on this product and the competition. While I've only had it a few days, I am pleasantly surprised at how accurately it captures the scanned text. You just have to keep your hand steady and learn not to release preasure until you are at the end of the line. I use it primarily to scan Russian text, which I paste into an online translator. I tried ECTACO's own translation software on a trial basis and found it much inferior to what you can use for free online. The best online translator I have found is \\"IMTRANSLATOR.\\" Keep in mind that none of the electronic translators will provide perfect results, but rather give you a general idea of what is being communicated. The English text that I scanned with the C-Pen was error-free provided I kept a steady hand. I would definitely recommend based on my few days of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Abosolutely Amazing...I was skeptical at first but this pen really does what it says.

It definitely saves me time - scanning words at a much quicker rate than I could type them. It is not always perfect (sometimes struggles with underlined text), and it took some getting used to, but, overall, it is a spectacular little gadget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is truly AMAZING!! I'm impressed!","review":"The pen works really well. The accuracy is right on. I mostly needed it to scan my textbook so it could essentially type my notes for me. it was highly accurate and easily used. I can insert a return when i need to by one simple push of the function button. if you need it to scan text and throw it on your computer with ease this is the pen for you. its worth a try and def worth the money. my one drawback for me is it is NOT compatible with a mac. i have a macbook aluminum running os x and i spent a good amount of time trying to get it up and running and it was a no go. so the good thing was i have parallels and it worked out fine, but since on my parallels i don't have word i have to put it in wordpad then trasnfer it to word.the pen stays connected to the computer.it's extremely easy to use. just point and scan. the button on the tip of one of the legs turns on the light letting you know its scanning.it is really accurate and does what it is supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a grad student, you NEED this pen","review":"This pen has saved me hours, possibly days, of writing and typing, and probably scores of hand cramps as well. It works exceptionally well; almost entirely accurate with just a little bit of practice. True, you have to be tethered to a computer, but for the benefits of the C-PEN, I don't mind taking my laptop to the library with me or sitting next to my desktop if I'm reading at home. It does have accuracy issues with passages that have already been underlined in pen or pencil (which unfortunately, a lot of people tend to do even with library books), but has absolutely no trouble so far with highlighted text. It makes it easy for me to record notes or quotes from books for review later, as I can avoid having to transcribe it by hand it or type it from the get go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed....","review":"If you have plenty of time to retype or edit your work, this item is for you.You have to scan the words from your book very slowly and patiently, and in a particular angle. If you scanned a little bit faster than you're suppose to, you have to retype most of the words on your computer, you can't hardly make up the words that you scanned!I was very frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver","review":"I have been using my C-Pen 20 for 2 weeks now, and I tell you, it's a life saver. Being a postgraduate student and not a fast typist, the C-Pen saved me a LOT of time.. I really wish I had bought it earlier.I noticed a few things:- The quality of the printed text (that you want to scan) affects the accuracy of the pen.- The slower you scan, the higher the accuracy results you get. This especially helps if the quality of the print isn't very good or if the text is very small. Otherwise, you can scan away very fast with very good results.- Hold your pen straight for better results- If you hi-lite the text before scanning it, be sure to use a light colour (e.g, yellow) because darker colours (e.g., blue) affect the accuracy (I was using a dark blue and got an accuracy of 15% only!!)Overall, the pen is very handy. It's accuracy is around 92%, but I'm only a new user and generally the results improve with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of money","review":"I bought the cpen in preparation for graduate school.

A lifelong fan of Maynard and also appreciative of Diane Shuur's talent, I gave the CD an on the spot preview at a local book store and bought the CD on the spot. This is a great CD, intersting, exciting arrangements, relaxed in the groove singing by Shuur and of course one of the wonders of the modern world -Maynard Ferguson. How fortunate we are that he is still recording such quality swinging work at this stage of his career and touring with such a swinging band. Great tunes, great talent, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Swingin' for Schuur","review":"As a fan of Ms. Schuurs's, I was disappointed at the amount of what sounded like screaming she did on this cd.I' m also a fan of Ferguson's and feel that both he and Ms. Schuur were hamstrung by mediocre arrangements.The tunes were just what the doctor ordered for a great album. It sounds ,however, that someone tried to get cute with the beat on most cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schuur Makes Me Wince!","review":"Why did I buy this CD? How do I get my money back?I grew up loving Maynard's sound (Live at Jimmy's is a classic), but these charts with Ms. Schuur are overbearing and at times ridiculous (Besame Mucho & My Romance come to mind immediately). The arrangements are heavy handed and lack the aestheic/sensitive qualities that even with this kind of \\"big band\\" instrumentation can be accomplished successfully.I could go on but won't do to you what was done to my ears.

It may not be fair to compare artists, but Diana Krall's \\"Let's Fall In Love,\\" \\"East Of The Sun & West Of The Moon\\" & \\"Besame Mucho\\" are far superior to what Diane produces here.

Perhaps the thrill of Big Brass is an acquired taste these days. I know people who will happily sit and listen to Korn, but claim that Stan Kenton hurts their ears. But, this is a great old time big band record, big and brassy (gosh Modern Jazz is over 50 years old!) like something Kenton (MF's old boss) might've cooked up if he had a singer with chops like Diane Shuur's. All the \\"screaming\\" is under control and the high notes are all tastfully distributed. Somehow, I suspect that this is the first time that Shuur has had an opportunity to use her 4 octave range to it's fullest, and I hope she continues to work with Maynard Ferguson. He plainly knows how to treat a good singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing...swing...swing","review":"I guess I don't understand some reviewer's definition of \\"screaming\\". Ms. Schuur is singing \\"jazz\\"...not \\"smooth jazz\\", not \\"cabaret\\", not \\"new age\\". I hear nothing that even comes to close to my definition of \\"screaming\\". As a jazz vocalist, Diane Schuur is among the top current singers. Her vocal range and interpretation is astonishing. To the reviewers who have admired her \\"smooth style\\" for a long time I would like to remind them that when she sings most of her up tempo songs...she does move into her upper range. She has always sung this way...perhaps that particular reviewer should listen to her earlier work again. The only thing a would recommend is that Ms. Schuur put an end to groan inducing word plays on her name as titles for her albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for ruining G.I. Joe Devil's Due.

Joe stories when they started killing off all the fan favorite characters. Sure people die in wars, but lets leave that to reality. When I read a comic I want to feel like there is a chance good might win in the end and a hero can't be held back. The writers did a good job of killing off my childhood heroes and turning the great G.I. Joe story started by Larry Hama into something darker and uninspiring. Larry Hama is a great writer and his G.I. Joe is the one I will read. Devil's Due's run of G.I. Joe had some high points early, but soon became pathetic.

This anime is guided more towards the intellectual fans of anime, however I am sure cinema fans of all genres can enjoy the film. It does move slowly at some points, however this is due to the targeted audience and the director's attempt to make the film relate to real-world situtions.

Rather it's about political intrigue and dialogue after diagolue that it left like I was watching a radio-show. Absolutely boring. I didn't care much for the animation either or even the characters. The characters look japanese this time, unlike what we're used to. I guess they want to make the story a more realistic trying to deal with mordern day issues.There's barely any action. I must admit that I couldn't finish the movie because it was way too boring with all the cloak and dagger stuff going on. Likely, I was able to get this from the public library. I would have been upset if I rented this movie. This movie is recommended to hardcore anime fans. Those of you looking for action, humor etc go watch Cowboy Bebop or something like that.

First whats with the plot Herbert West in prison. They should have retitlted this Re-Animator goes to OZ.The laughable special effects: Working with a low budget you can see why this one didn't have state-of-the-art effects but please theres ketchup and strawberry jam that look more realistic than the blood in this movie.and the acting: For a bunch of unknowns these actors can't act only Combs is the good actor and the rest are amateurs.Please Stuart Gordon kill off your series and tell Brian Yuzna to stop directing your movies because you could have made much more with your RE-ANIMATOR series but good ideas don't always go right. This series cannot be RE-ANIMATED by anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is awful, terrible, and has no redeeming value. This is much like the original Reanimator. I loved it! Okay, the acting may have not been Oscar worthy and the plot was kind of stupid, but it had Herbert West up to his experiments again. If you want Gone With the Wind, why even bother reading reviews of this type of film. If you want a camp culture classic with no social value and plenty of gore and pointless shots of the totally unsympathetic heroine's fishnets, this is it! Gotta love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish it was better","review":"I just bought and finished watching Beyond Reanimator. I was expecting to see a more quality movie when I bought this, with cooler deaths, funnier dialog, and a more interesting story. Beyond Reanimator had all the ingredients to make a fantastic movie, I think (it seems apparent) that alot was not planned through, aspects were rushed and not all involved were passionate about creating this movie. If you really love the reanimator series buy it maybe you won't be dissapointed it's only 13 dollars, if you only like the original reanimator you may want to skip even renting this movie. -I sold my copy for six bucks at Coconuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Sequel","review":"Jeffrey Combs returns as the very mad Dr Herbet West is this lame sequel to the original classic. Combs is terrific as usual and deserves a better movie. This one just uses the plot of the original movie but changes the setting to a prison. Gore hounds might enjoy it- but the effect are just ok. The DVD includes a hysterical music video that you have to see to believe.

The original \\"ReAnimator\\" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Redemption!!","review":"Not only is this a horrible sequal but a horrible film. Jeffrey Combs is the ONLY thing that makes this film palatable. Any scene that he is not in is truly boring and contrived. This is like a bad episode of OZ crossed with a horrible straight to video quickie. Just awful...absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior, But Cool","review":"The 3rd in the series, and not nearly as good as the first 2, this one still offers some nutty, over the top performances and most importantly, gore. Don't start with this one and don't expect too much, but if you dig the first two, and want a wee bit more Dr. West, pick this one up used, cheap, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond is a flawed, but sickening gem.","review":"Upon seeing the latest installment of the Re-Animator series, I had to free my mind up a bit. After 13 years of passing time and years of hoping for some continuation, finally we have it! It's sad not to have David Gale (god rest his soul) or Bruce Abbot, but Brian Yuzna has made a better sequel than his own Bride of Re-Animator. There are flaws for sure. Example: Arkham Mass. has the electric chair on death row? And many limitations with shooting in Spain but, the wild tone and hilarious finale are not to be missed. Hopefully House of Re-Animator goes into production soon with the planned Bruce Abbot returning. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"As a huge fan of the first movie, allow me to say what a terrible film this is.Reanimator took an absurd idea and made it work.

Some of those stories come first-hand, while others seem to be tall tales. Even on a quick read, I was able to spot various factual inaccuracies, concerning names, dates, and units of the park and forest.Some of the most astounding stories may be accurate but stretch credibility in my mind.

The leprechaun loses a lot when he doesnt rhyme! this movie had a lot of potential if the writers had fun with the dialogue but it was a chore to watch. there were a few golden moments but for the most art this movie belongs in the toilet. the crummy part is that it had a great deal of potential. In one part the lep gets hit by a cop and responds \\"you punch like a lass!!!\\" thats the leprechaun I love and those lines were few and far between. the writers need to let their minds run wild and suspend disbelief to make a good movie. makeup was the only area that was better than in previous movies. if you miss this installment of the leprechaun series youre not missing much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"leprechaun back 2 the hood","review":"this item is not worth the price its really not a good movie. the first leprechaun is the best and do recommend that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre chapter could have been better","review":"Mediocre describes this laughable direct-to-video with the Leprechaun going back to the hood and starting a killing spree looking for his gold. Basically a remake to Leprechaun in the Hood with terrible special effects and bad acting but this movie is so inept and hilarious its almost as absurd as Leprechaun 4 and this funniest parts are when the Leprechaun jams a bong in a man's stomach and when he rips a cop's leg off while wanting to fight. Watch only once or twice but stick with parts 1,2,3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking hilarious","review":"I've not seen the first Hood movie, so I can't compare it to this one, but I've seen Leprechaun 1-3, and I can't help but love that nasty, evil little leprechaun. No matter what movie he is in, no matter how bad said movie is, the Leprechaun always stands out. The actor who plays him does such a great job, it's as if the role had been MADE for him.This installment is scary and funny. So many hood stereotypes are made fun of/spoofed, and the scene where the Leprechaun is sharing a bong with one of the guys is absolutely hysterical, especially when how he's all so mellow at first and ready to just chill and have fun, but he kills the guy when he wants his gold. The bit with the policeman is also hysterical, and I have to say, this is one of the funniest Leprechaun movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare to \\"In The Hood\\"","review":"Leprachaun 5: In the hood, was a cult classic. Mostly because of its political incorectness and chemistry between the main characters. However, in this one, the sixth installment, they tried too hard to be goofy. The jokes were lame, or rather they weren't executed well (like when the police confiscate a whole garbage bag of weed from the guy's house and he responds, \\"Oh, dat stuuf, dat's oregano, my momma is \\"Eye-tal-ian\\" and she like lottsa oregano in her lasagna\\"). And the leprachaun doesn't talk (or rap)or blurt out riddles like he used to. And where are my \\"zombie fly girls\\"?! Oh well, <sigh> I guess good things like \\"In the hood\\" don't last forever, just leave it to some knucklehead to go out and ruin something that was already divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"I'm a really big fan of this series, and had high hopes for this one, but it just fell flat. Too much of the human characters (I don't really CARE if bike boy is trying to \\"do the right thing\\"), the Leprechaun got his backside whipped most of the movie, the killings were neither imaginative nor graphic, and there wasn't anything that really surprised me. The only really funny part was the bong scene, which was pretty much done in the first \\"Hood\\".How you can botch a Leprechaun movie is beyond me, but maybe it's the curse of the evens (the odd numbered ones are MUCH better than the evens). The end was pretty lame, too, and didn't make a whole lot of sense. Extras on the DVD were pretty much non-existent. I'll still buy the box set when it comes out, though. If you like this series, check it out just so you've seen them all, but this movie was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOW THE WORST MOVIE OF THE SERIES!","review":"BASICALLY A SEMI-REMAKE OF THE FIRST MOVIE.

THIS MOVIE HAS SOME OF THE WORST MURDER SCENES TO'VE EVER BEEN SEEN IN A LEPRECHAUN MOVIE! AND, AS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, YA DON'T EVEN GET TO SEE THE LEPRECHAUN USE ANY OF HIS MAGIC!

(And if he really tried, he could have found his destination by clicking down by country and region.) It was difficult adapting my Delorme GPS to work, but with the help of Customer Service from Route 66, I did and then everything worked superbly all the way. Very easy, intuitive interfaces. More information produced than you'll ever need. What blew everyone away was that we were driving and someone wanted a rest stop. Two clicks and all rest stops were displayed, with one in five miles.

Lawyers is not an offensive term. The book is a good review of law school at the time, it had not changed in 75 years and taught you only to be a law student, not a lawyer.

You'll spend weeks just waiting for someone to respond, or call you back, who actually knows anything about the product at all. It has been the most unprofessional and inconsistent group I've ever had to deal with.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.I purchased the Prismiq Media Player before Christmas and was unable to get it working. After numerous emails to the Support Center, they stopped responding to my messages for two momths. I asked to return it and they said that they needed to get a \\"RMA\\" - return merchandise authorization to me, which they never did. When I finally got a reply (late March) they told me to return it to the retailer, who after all this time refused to accept it.I have written to PRISMIQ senior management team, bypassing the Support Center: the CEO, Vice President, Marketing; Vice President, Sales; and Vice President, Operations.

I was able to browse the web, listen to nearly flawless internet radio (the best quality streaming media I have ever heard) but when it came to listening to my WMA files over a wired 100mbps network, the music skipped and popped worse than a scratched CD--worse than an old vinyl LP.

I placed numerous calls for support and never received anything that made the device work properly.

There is no installation support that I could find or access, so I decided to return the item based on the company status.The media player was simple to install as far as the cables and connections are concerned. It has built-in wireless and ethernet capabilities, however, neither would allow it to work with my PC that has my media files. Issues included connecting to my network and getting past firewall and anti-virus issues. Ports have to be opened and accessible and configured appropriately. This is not documented well, so the goose chase is on from the beginning. Additionally, the media server software would not load but after rebooting 10 or more times, I finally thought it was loaded since the program finally ran. Once it was running, I could never get the player to find the network and the server, and eventually gave up and returned the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insecure","review":"Unfortunately, the Prismiq Media Player only works on insecure wireless networks. As of 07 January 2004, Prismiq does not support WPA.When asked about security, Prismiq support recommended that I disable WPA on my wireless network and rely on the very insecure WEP instead. They made no mention of additional steps that I might want to take to better secure a WEP encrypted network, such as not broadcasting the SSID. Is this an indication of how seriously Prismiq takes network security? Does the Prismiq media player pose a risk as an easy point of entry into a wireless network? I returned mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most frustrating Xmas ever","review":"I have finally sent this back after a month of trying to get it to play more than one song before locking up. It simply does not work as advertised. It locks up constantly, the media server software is a CPU hog (I have a P4 3Ghz) and crashes all the time, the media manager software is amateurish, it constantly loses connection to the wireless network and when it does so you have to hard reset the unit. I mean losing the connection is one thing but having to pull the plug is ridiculous. The interface is very poor and slow. Tech support is laughable.

Frustrating is that when I contacted Target.com they assured me that they would send a replacement which would be correct, but it was not. They now tell me that they will look into the discrepency of what is pictured and what is being shipped, but that is all they can do. I think they need to update the picture or if both are available at some point, give customers the option of choosing the color they prefer.

It's not---the movie was filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio and that is what you see on the DVD. I was fearful that they would crop the top and bottom of the image for a \\"widescreen\\" effect.

Just started with the book and some ideas are helpful but some can be time consuming to get together and plan, esp. for both full time working people and we don't even have kids yet. What's great is that although it is hard for both of us to plan one per week, we just give ourselves a longer time frame and it even sparks just doing other spontaneous or planned romantic things together and not exactly follow what they recommend - since you can't know what the other is supposed to do anyways, and just the idea of having to rip something open is fun and exciting. There were times I went ahead and just ripped out another if one was just not do-able -- ie. summertime event and it's already too cold to do.another good book by laura corn is the one with greatest sex -- those are easier to plan and set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Returns for us Married Couples","review":"This book is perfect for couples who have had children or demanding jobs.

My wife bought it for us and we were quickly disappointed. The book assumes an awful lot about men and women. First, it assumes the woman doesn't work full-time. My wife was not too happy about that assumption. Even worse, though, it assumes that romance is something that can be the same for everyone: conventional, prepackaged and cloned from couple to couple. The whole concept of the book is flawed. In reality, romance is spontaneous and unique to each couple. It can't come from the pages of a book written by a stranger.

You need to know that his ethnic background prevents him from being a rational one. He simply hates Muslims because where he's from. Ethic war has torn his country apart. Muslims of little understanding over there just hates everyone who is not Muslim, and they think they have the right to kill anyone who is not Muslim. This is a crime. \\"Killing Infidels\\" is NOT a general purpose term that serves the right to kill anyone who is not Muslim. The author does not present at all the historical reasons and conditions for when such verses apply. He is taking things out of context just like the media across the world.Again, you cannot trust someone with his heart filled with deeply rooted ethnic hatred. This book certainly serves the purpose of filling other hearts with hatred for the ones who wants to hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same garbage","review":"Once again, until you can answer my question about why the growth rate of muslims doubled since 9/11 and is the worlds fastest growing religion at a rate of 10:1 on christianity even with all these negative views.

If you like mindless hate and prejudice, you'll love this book.Not surprisingly this compilation of prejudice and ethnic hatred is published by an Orthodox Christian press. Got to admire those Christians and their G_d of Love and forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"If possible, I would have given this book less than 1 star","review":"It is not a surprise to read Srdja Trifkovic's racist and bias lies about Islam. Trifkovic's views are about as well documented as is his hatred for the Muslim religion. This book is an obvious attempt to appeal to Americans who because of the political correctness in this society don't reveal their true prejudice of Arabs and Muslims and are happy when someone else does it for them. The only people who can benefit from this reading are those who already hate Islam but afraid to labeled \\"racist\\" and therefore relish in Trifkovic's words of hatred. I recommend anyone who does not already hate Islam and Arabs and would like to learn more about the religion read Edward Said's \\"Covering Islam\\" or Said Aburish's \\"A Brutal Friendship\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sword of the Prophet--Trifkovic","review":"I am re-reading this book. My understanding of Islam was cursory at best. The first read was a shocker. It describes Muhammed's life, the inseparability of politics, government, and religion under Islam, Allah as described in the Koran, the spread of Islam,and the fruits of Islam.Once you read Trifovic's book you'll understand exactly what is going on in the middle east. You'll understand how children can be talked into being suicide bombers, why Osoma bin Laden, coming from a rich Saudi family and following the Koran, would become a world terrorist, and why the war Muslim's are waging against the Jews and Christianity for that matter will never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts to the Quick","review":"This is a superb work of scholarship combined with beautiful prose. It is most readable and informative. One can see why some might want to suppress the book or pan it. The portrait of Islam the author presents is in sync with current events. Born in violence and spread by conquest, Islam is not a religion of peace for those outside the Faithful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ostriches, get your heads out of the sand","review":"Lost in the debate over historical accuracy and fairness is what I consider to be an important message: we cannot view Islam with our mindset or standards of political correctness, fairness and tolerance- nor judge Islam by the standards by which we judge ourselves. Islam will not reciprocate as its frankly stated goal is world domination - either by progressive infiltration until a majority, or else by outright conquest. The author has stated it well - our tolerance contains the seeds of our own destruction. I do not advocate aggression nor do I have an idea or what the best solution is, but we must be constantly on the defensive. We are all infidels and will always be viewed as such so be forewarned. As further support for this book, one should read Ibn Warraq: \\"Why I Am Not A Muslim\\". Insofar as fairnesss is concerned, I have also read Bertrand Russell's\\"Why I Am Not A Christian\\". And I am neither one nor the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering wake up call!","review":"As one who lived in Muslim Africa, I can recommend this book highly. It points out the tragic error in receiving Islam in a spirit of American Tolerance - for their goals are not to reciprocate, and their means are consistently undemocratic, brutal, and aggresssive. Get two copies and donate one to your local library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unvarnished Scoop","review":"The Sword of the Prophet gives an unvarnished look at Islam by means of its history. We see its foundations, its unifying spirit but also its sects and factions, its periods of expansion and of decay, its theology and the cultures it forms. Trifcovic also shows Islam's disdain for values of the modern West: tolerance, personal freedom, individualism, competition, non-violence, progress, and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sobering read","review":"This book is a real eye opener. It describes Islam's history of violence and intolerance and the West's self imposed blindness to the nature of Islamic culture. In the latter part, the book explains how the U.S. has been supporting radical Muslim governments and terrorists all over the world for several decades to further the economic interests of large American corporations and their interest in globalization. It's well documented and clear-headed. One message of the book is clear: we can no longer afford to suppress Christianity in the U.S. while we promote secularism and Islam in the name of evenhandedness. Forget worrying about after school Bible clubs. If we continue on the road we're on now, our grandchildren may be wearing turbans and burkhas as they study the Koran in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to learn more about Islam? Read this book.","review":"The Sword of Prophet\\" by Serge Trifkovic is about the history of Islam from the time of Mohammed till our time. I would recommend the book to everyone who is interested in the subject of Islam, regardless of his/hers perception of Islam as being \\"peaceful\\" or \\"non-peaceful\\" religion.

The presentation of Islamic beliefs make them sound rediculous. They may very well be, but I don't trust the author. In a portion of the book, he grossly mistates Catholic theology on indulgences. Either the author is ignorant or disingenuous. I am leaning toward the later. Most anti-catholic literature follows similar tactics. The author proceeds to make a caricature of important religious beliefs and then presents the caricature (which no sane person would endorse) as the actual beliefs of the religion under attack. I don't know enough about Islam to know if the information in this book is accurate, but my stink detector is going off. I would cross check everything in this book with another source.Being on the receiving end of Jack Chick style tactics, I know them when I see them, even when it is another religion that is being defamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"store123 is the worst","review":"I ordered a Jean Paul Gaultier from this store and It sent me another version totally diferent to the version ordered, the version sent is a summer version, I made a complain to the store and they said me that the product is a new one and it was totally original, but the problem is that I ordered that one showed in the picture a Eau De Toilette and they sent me a product that has a lot of water, alchool and nothing of perfume.

It was so similar to one I had played with as a child, but the more we played with it, the more I realized how outdated the phone style was. The manufacturers might, at least, consider a push button style. The kids enjoy it though, they use it as a pull-toy and have pretend conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety issue","review":"After hearing my 1 year old scream from her crib, I ran in her room to find the coiled cord around her neck, tightly!

The phone cord was too short and the pull string was short as well. Maybe the pull string needs to be made of a thicker rope as opposed to the thin rope. She did like the rotary style dialing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little value","review":"With all the neat play phones on the market, this toy could only hold the interest of the 1 year old crowd, if that. And you can't even drag it around like when I was a child, because for safety, the strings are too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love it!","review":"I am currently doing my pre-Christmas shopping list for my 5 month old son Robert. He's already grabbing at the phone when I am talking on it, so I knew that a toy phone would be perfect come Christmas time. I was disapointed to find all of the jazzy new cell type play phones when I did my origional search. But I guess it's just a sign of the times. I was so happy to fine the origional with his rolly polly eyes. I remember calling up all of my childhood friends on mine. I just know that Robert will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long-lasting Childhood Friend!","review":"How to summarize this?

And may just order it in to have him by my side again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kid won't be fooled.","review":"The phone cord on this toy is ridiculously short. I understand a long cord may be a hazard but my 14 month old can't even lift it to her ear without picking the whole thing up. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Toy","review":"Great toy for the kids to just drag around and act like they're on the phone. The car phone enhances the kids motor skills and definitely keeps them entertained.Perfect for gifts and has reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than original","review":"Not only is it smaller than the original, the string holding the receiver to the phone is about 8\\" so it's virtually I,possible to hold it to your ear.

The toy seems old and there is nick on the phone, not like a new buy one at all. The cord for the telephone is so short that my baby has to pick up the entire toy to \\"make a call\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord is too short","review":"I agree with previous reviewers - the cord on the phone is very short (probably 3 or 4 inches long) so that when the child puts the phone to their ear, they have to lift the entire phone.It's cute to look at but not exactly functional or purposeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a Clunker","review":"The dilemma with this phone is that the cord that attaches the handset to the phone is only about 6 inches long. In order to answer the phone/lift the handset you have to pick-up the entire phone and move it very close to your face.I can guess that the cord is short for safety reasons. And I applaud that. But it negates the enjoyment of the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHILD CAN CHOKE WITH STRING","review":"I thought this was a great toy until I seen my almost 2yr old wrap the entire string around her little neck. I was worried about her harming herself and took it away. She can play with when she is old enough to understand the phone goes to your ear and not around your neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"same as I remember and still fun for the little ones!","review":"I had one of these growing up and it is still pretty much the same. (Makes me laugh, a rotary phone which most people don't even have a home phone much less can you even find a rotary? :) But my daughter loves it all the same! One con, the cord on the \\"phone\\" part is a little short so she can not have it on the floor and put it next to her ear. The red cord to pull is long enough though.Reminiscing her but the \\"original\\" has a curled cord on the ear piece and the eyes blinked on the front. Still a great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Style Phone","review":"I didn't think I would find an old style rotary phone. I was happy to see that Fisher Price still made it! I wish it was wooden like the one I got my oldest child 30+ years ago. That phone lasted through both of my boys. I hope this plastic phone holds up as well. I bought this chatter phone for my grand children to play with when they come to Grama's house. I want them to see a real telephone and learn how to dial up numbers. I noticed the only other difference was that the receiver cord is shorter than I remember and you have to hold the phone when you talk into the mouth piece. This is a must have \\"old style\\" learning toy...thank you Fisher Price!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Likes it","review":"1 year old nephew likes pulling this around the house.

The phone line is a little bit shot. Nothing special about this toy, my son nearly 1 year old, and he seems much more interesting in home phone rather than this one~~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise of Prussia","review":"This book relates the story of Prussia's rise as an European power during the first eight decades of the 18th century. The period basically covered the history of the Prussia of Frederick the Great and his father. But the core history lies around Frederick the Great who used the army created by his father to turn Prussia from one of many German states into an European power.The book proves to be well researched and its very readable. Good thing about this book is that it won't cluttered you up with excess information. I thought it would serves as an excellent introductionary book to anyone who may be interested in reading up on Prussian history. (Not to be confused with recent Christopher Duffey's Prussia's Glory book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but unsafe","review":"I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib. I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them. She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these. Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt fit on our crib","review":"The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a note about bumpers-for you who don't know","review":"Ok just so you guys know, as a student of child development and safety, your child WILL NOT suffocate due to a use of bumper pads. The only reason this has happened is because the parents have not securely positioned their sleeping child and the child rolls over, buries his or her face in the bumper, and suffocates. You should, however, remove the bumpers once your child is able to pull him or her self to a standing position in the crib, since the bumper can be used as a step to climb up and fall out. I hope this puts some of your minds at ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Terrific!!!","review":"Luis Miguel's performance is unsurpassed!

His influence is obviously the chairman of the board, Frank Sinatra. His pronunciation of the spanish lyrics is done eloquently. This video demonstrates the beauty of Mexican music at its fullest. A wide range of styles are done by Luis, such as romantic, dance and mariachi. The concert was performed at the Auditorio Nacional. I can't wait to see this on DVD! No other music video can compare to this 27 year olds success.David Reyes - Chicago- Illinois"},{"rating":"1","title":"He Gets Points for Originality","review":"Don't recommend. The author has a great premise and does some good work here and there. Other than that, it is a dull read and it seems like the author mixed some romance novel descriptions of some of the characters. He wasn't familiar enough with Bundy, because he made Bundy do things he WOULD NEVER have done in real life. Any reader of true crime/Bundy will instantly be bored with the long drawn out character buildups. Bundy lurks around in the background for awhile, but not enough story around how he got out of jail what he's thinking, his behavior, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed...","review":"I too purchased this product in hopes of using the handle. First time I pulled on the handle it popped off. My lid corners have also popped loose so the corner flaps now hang out in the open. I am very disappointed with this product. I too was surprised by the lid being attached in the back but again not a major issue just would have liked to know beforehand. Do not buy this box if you want to be able to touch it without is falling apart..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall- very good","review":"Pros:1. Installation was smooth, instructions were clear and accurate.2. Material fit and finish were excellent.3. Functions as advertised, easy to roll-up and deploy4. Looks great on the truck, tight, no creases, no noise, stays put.Con:1. The loop in the cord that releases the catch is heat welded and came unwelded quickly which allows the strap to sag. This is the only negative.Hint: Previous reviewers suggested an extra pair of hands for the installation on the Tacoma. This is definately a good suggestion, you need someone to hold the cargo rails while you align the new hex nuts. You will also need a #30 Torx socket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolle has real solutions for depression, anxiety, and fear","review":"I have been on a long and tiring search for help with depression, anxiety, and fear for over a decade. The concepts/information Tolle presents on this single DVD set has helped me more than ANY of the options I have explored. The positive impact my new outlook has made in my life has been monumental. I am no longer focused on my past and imaginary future which was keeping me in a prison of depression, anxiety, and fear. I said goodbye to my ego, turned off the noise in my mind, and I am FREE!!! This DVD, along with a copy of The Power of Now (audio book, in my case), are all that I needed for real change. I hope that anyone who has been searching for some help and hasn't found it will give this DVD a try. I couldn't recommend an item more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"perspective","review":"Eckhart has a way to put my/our daily thought ramblings in a perspective as to where I come to see another way of going about things.

However, the author fails to effectively describe why Morrie was such a great person other than the fact that the author says so. He also fails to convince the reader as to why the author was so much liked by Morrie. The quotes from Morrie are usual cliches. May be author learned alot from Morrie since he was busy making money in the past, but certainly, there was nothing refreshing for me in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there","review":"I found this to be rather trite. Many of the \\"teachings\\" are little more than regurgitated platitudes from the world religions (which in turn stole them from the original sources anyway) - anyone to whom these \\"teachings\\" are enlightening or revelatory must be a very sheltered, young or self-absorbed person. There is a much, much deeper level to explore in life, and correspondingly death; I would call this book perhaps a good \\"beginner's\\" guide, but for those seeking something more substantial I highly recommend \\"The Pagan Book of Living and Dying\\" by Starhawk. (Yes, even if you're not a pagan this book has a lot to offer). Blessed Be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to say","review":"This book says very little about Morrie and a quite abit about the auther and his life. I read this book expecting to discover how I might re-prioritize my life. I came away with nothing. I did not get to know Morrie or feel anything towards him. I just kept thinking that the author was taking a tragic situation and trying to make a buck off of it. It might have been better if the author would tell us what impact these final days with Morrie had on his life. Is he now living differently because of this? I wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A light- book to read while travelling","review":"What is said in this book could have been said in less words! Mitch Albom has not done a great job in explaining the thoughts of Morrie. Morrie sounds like a warm-hearted American teacher to me. I suggest Halil Cibran's \\"The Prophet\\". Yet, Tuesdays With Morrie is fun and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfserving","review":"After reading this book I felt the author was saying \\"Look what I did for Morrie\\", not the other way around. I did feel somewhat guilty that I didn't experience the compassion expressed by so many other \\"reviewers\\". I just feel there are other books written that are more genuine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but extremely overrated","review":"This is an interesting read, touching in places, especially in the end as Morrie nears his death. One does not, however, come away from the book especially enlightened. Frankly, I can't understand why all these other reviewers are thumping this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hackneyed, cliche tale","review":"Mitch Albom has written a slim volume that has become nothing less than the \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" of the '90s -- a \\"feel good\\" book that you forget almost instantly after reading it.Just telling people that they should \\"love or perish\\" and that the single-minded pursuit of success is wrong, isn't compelling. It's rather like reading a book full of painfully obvious truths that somehow escaped the writer ... until now.Part of Morrie Schwartz's message is that Mitch Albom needed to live his life according to the ethics he espoused. How does Albom reconcile the fact that he didn't stay out on strike against the Detroit Free Press in 1995, but crossed the picket line to reclaim his six figure job, while others stayed out and lost homes and cars?As the Quakers say, it's the way you live your life, not your fancy words."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say this, but it wasn't that great","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie covers a very important and touching topic. However, the insights handed down from Morrie to Mitch simply aren't that original and failed to enlighten me in the least. It will serve as a REMINDER of what is important in life, but does not break new ground. Morrie was obviously a loving and special man to those around him, but that does not warrant a national craze about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype maybe?","review":"I totally agree with \\"Too simplistic\\". I expected much more depth where there isn't much at all. I thought Morrie's lessons would be very profound yet his message was not profound at all. He sounds like he was truly a wonderful man and I admire the author's writing style but the book isn't life changing or deep in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll change the way you think!","review":"This book simply tells us how far off our priorities are. It takes just a couple of days to read, but will probably change the way you think about yourself, family, friends,the world around you, and life versus death. This is a story about a man dying and a new life beginning with the author and you the reader. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of the Year","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best book I have read so far this year. Not only is it a quick read, you will want to read it over and over again when you are feeling down or need some sunlight. Morrie has become my hero, such a strong man with such a great message to put out. He made me look back on my life and question what is and what should be important to me. He reminded me that one should not let the little things get to him, and that one should cherish every moment she has with her loved ones. I guarantee you that you will love this book, and you will want to give it to all your friends so they too can learn from Morrie - I know I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson on life...","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was at some points hard to put down (and Im not a lover of reading). I was attending mass one Sunday and my priest recommended this book, and I also recommend it to you. This was a heart warming book about a man who faught the disease ALS. I also had prior experience with ALS, because this was the disease my Granpa died from. If you have no experience with ALS, it will feel as if you did after reading this book. This was a short book which was great, but at some points it seemed like they were dragging out some topics. In this book there were many important life topics that I feel all people should take the time to think about. I am very happy that Ms. Ward, the best teacher ever, gave me this assignment (otherwise I wouldn't have read it). Please come back! We all miss you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll Make You Think!","review":"This book really will make you look at your life in review. You will think of all the friends you have met at one point in your life, and how quickly you forgot them. As a high school senior, it made me think of all the people I have met here (in school) and how in less than a month I will never see them again. This book will make you laugh and cry. It is so touching. I think it is because it is not just a story, but it really is a life long lesson. While it entertains you like most books, it also forces you to do a reality check. You do NOT need to read this book if you don't want to think about all the people you've been a horrible person to, and all the bad things you've done. BUT...if you want to see yourself and your attitude through different eyes and you are able to face life, think about death and open to changing the way you live, you NEED to read this book. It will change your life and the way you look at your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie:","review":"I am really not much of a fiction reader but this was a good book...

It also rang very true in the description of the dibilitation of Lou Gerigs disease.I read hard core serious text like books everyday, this book added thought provoking warmth to my holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sociology 275","review":"Overall I thought that this was a good book. I would not have normally read this book but I am glad that I did. Morrie is able to communicate his feelings in a way that only a man who knows his death is near can. Because of his unique view on life Morrie is able to make the most of the time he has left and share what he has learned through his life experiences. There are many valuable life lessons all throughout this book. If you want to read a book that will touch your life and make you see things in a different light you should read Tuesdays With Morrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The antidote to Seat of the Soul","review":"This was an uplifting, refreshing, energized story and I can not receommend it highly enough.

Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Torture to Read","review":"This book must have been one of the most torturous, boring, touchy-feely-make-you-want-to-puke books I have ever read. I would not recomend it to anyone. I would actually go out of my way to tell people NOT to read this book (except maybe to a flower child who likes all this overly affectionate BS). It is WAAAAAAAY overrateted and does not deserve all of this praise. I think that the only thing I learned from this book was how to actually get up early enough to throw it in the back of the garbage truck. A total watse of time and money, don't even think about buying it, it doesn't even deserve 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap sentimentality","review":"The emotions described here have all the weight and sincerity of drugstore greeting cards. The author is a TV sportswriter and it shows. I believe that the author had some genuine affection and devotion for Morrie, but he has not successfully captured that here. Instead, his prose comes across as shallow, manipulative and insincere. If I were the author, I'd take a year off and go live by myself in a remote cabin and re-write this book, ripping each word from my heart. This book here is just too facile, too TV-esque. The only thing that the author seems truly heartfuelt about is the awe in which he holds Ted Koppel and the Nightline program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sham Spirituality!","review":"Always read the full book before you criticize! So, I suffered through this book even though, mercifully, it is a short one. Our lives are so empty, so bereft of meaning - that we will make a bestseller of even the most inane, most mediocre self-help book. Life is not as simple as Morrie makes it out to be. If someone really cares, he would not cocoon himself with all material comforts and spend a fortune on medical expenses - when children are starving to death around the world. Morrie seems as selfish as anyone else - he wants what he wants and wraps his wants with Hallmark philosophy. Meanwhile the Earth is getting destroyed through global warming, millions are dying unnecessarily everywhere and economies and countries are going bust making billions jobless...if you want true spirituality, go to the source - read the Bible, the Koran, the Gita....

Initially, it left me wanting more and I felt the author could've better done this wise man (Morrie) justice in the telling of this story.

Morrie and Mitch meet together every Tuesday and talk about a different topic. Some of the topics are: family, marriage, culture, and money. All of these topics revolve around a center topic that is the main lesson learned from the book. This lesson is appreciation. When Morrie and Mitch were first meeting together, Mitch did not appreciate very must at all and he neglected important relationships including his friendship with his brother. But when Morrie was diagnosed with ALS, Mitch's life changed. He finally started to appreciate everything in his life. This book tells the story of Mitch and Morrie's life together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrie puts it all in perspective","review":"I read this book on a long flight home from a week away. I missed my family. I was tired. It touched me deeply.Told in simple, powerful language, this is a book about what matters. It is a book about life, written from the perspective of a man coming to the end of his. It is about a man who advises us to \\"learn how to die in order to learn how to live.\\"Morrie reaches out to his student (writer, Mitch) at a time when Mitch most needs it -- a time when he is questioning his lifestyle and the choices his generation is making. It is a great book for anyone who struggles with the desire for a simpler life in a complex world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want a Morrie","review":"After reading this book you'll want a Morrie in your life, if you don't already have one. And If you do have one, you'll cherish him or her even more.Tuesday's with Morrie is a true \\"eye-opener\\". It definitely makes you think but a lot of books may make you think. The difference between this book and most \\"thinking\\" books is that this book will make you want to talk too. You'll find yourself stopping sometimes just to chat with someone about the subject you were just reading about. You may even make your own list of subjects that you want to discuss with someone older and wiser, or maybe even your age. I loved the fact that even though it was a sad ending, it wasn't the sad ending you usually read about. It'll make you want to let go one of those happy cries.Read it. Read it to your children. Read it to your mother or father. Read it to someone special to you. You'll both enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most inspirational pieces I've read","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie is without a doubt one of the most inspirational pieces of writing I have read.

The most touching anecdote is his death bed regret for not forgiving an old friend before the friend died. It is a poignant lesson that even a sweet man like Schwartz can lose a friend through pride.On the other hand, Albom is an annoying presence in this book. He dutifully hates himself for his worldly success, but obviously made a tidy sum on this runaway best seller. Schwartz is too fond of Morrie's aphorisms (e.g., \\"to learn how to live, you must learn how to die.\\") Morrie's recollections and present sense impressions are far more valuable than the cliches that Albom thinks so profound. I also wish Albom had not waited until the end of the book to disclose the financial relationhip that he and Morrie had entered into. There is nothing wrong with it and, in fact, it was a noble gesture. But through most of the book there is no explanation of why Albom's visits were such a high priority to this dying man."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read only one more book in your life make it this one","review":"Death of the body is an inescapable part of life; but death of the spirit during the process of dying is a choice. Each of us has a personal belief system about what happens to the spirit after death occurs; but no matter what your's is, this book has at least one lesson to offer you to enhance the life you are living now. Mitch Albom has given all of us the opportunity to share with him in Morrie's mentorship, a gift for which I will always be most humbly grateful.Morrie's lessons aren't geared to any one age or stage of life. I firmly belive that our youth as well as our elders will respond to this book with a true opening of the spirit, and come away with insights they might never have received otherwise.

But to have your memory trivialized by such a hack must have him spinning in his grave. But Albom knows his market, and he knows there's a never ending demand among the insecure for shallow, overly sentimental books that pull on the heartstrings, and he's delivered just that. The sales numbers certainly support that.If you need inspiration, there are better books, and not all of them are written at the fourth grade level."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE FOM SOMEONE THAT KNOWS READ THIS BOOK","review":"As a person recently diagnosed with another neurological disease MULTIPLE SCREROSIS this book hits with the force of a frieght train.

I recomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit trite, but who cares - it's uplifting","review":"Yes Morrie's insight of life as described by Mitch Albom is a bit trite, but so what; it's nice to be reminded. Albom's ability to write on different \\"lessons\\" kind of reminds me of \\"The Prophet\\" in its structure, but comes across less mystical.

For anyone wishing to relearn lessons on how to live life, this book is also for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I thought this book was one of the best I have read in a long time. I would recommend that all fathers and sons read this but also that mothers and loved ones read this too. I have searched for specific self-help books in the past couple of years and upon reading this book I would have to say that this is probably the best self-help book there is. It not only shows you about life but also how to express your feelings. I can really relate to this book because my grandfather is dying in front of me right now and I have no control.

It has 192 pages dealing with such issues as love, death, fear, and happiness. The important characters are Mitch Albom and Morrie Schwarts. It takes place in the early 90's. Tuesdays with Morrie is a story of a dying teacher and his student. Only the classes took place on tuesdays, the subject was the meaning of life, and it was taught from experience. \\" Love each other or perish\\" pg. 149. The title 'Tuesdays with Morrie' is signifigant to the story because Morrie and Mitch always have their meetings on tuesdays. The cover is simple but meaningful, just like Morrie. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this book a 9. I recommend this book because I think it is an awesome story of love and death. It really teaches you alot about yourself and the way you look at others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of the human soul...","review":"One of my associates at work recommended this because he took a class at Brandeis with \\"Morrie\\".

It will warm your heart as the conversations go on about various subjects in life. This book will probably serve to heal relationships and make you appreciate every day that you live--that's what it did for me. The advice, even wisdom, communicated in this book can be appreciated especially by those that apply it in real life. Another book that I found that is along the same lines and has helped me tremendously, as it is encouraging, positive and peppered with pearls of wisdom throughout, is Dietmar Scherf's \\"I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression\\"--also available at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I had to read this before I went to college.

A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"all about Mitch...","review":"This book is more about Mitch's obsession with his annual income then it is Morrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"It feels like you're being force-fed Mitch's thoughts on Morrie's death. And Morrie didn't even feel genuine. His words were moving, granted, but he said the kinds of things you should have realized for yourself anyway. And he also seemed more like a character in a novel than a real person as Mitch turned him into a caraciture through the hefty use of simplistic literary devices. Morrie became Mitch's vehicle. Which is strange to me. Throughout the book you get the impression that Mitch is some sort of blockhead not to realize Morrie's advice, but at the same time you have to consider he must be pretty smart to have manipulated the contents of the book so well, to make so many people love Morrie and think that Mitch had absorbed something substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuesdays to Avoid","review":"I READ THE BOOK BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN ON THE BEST SELLER LIST FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO ME. IN GENERAL, IT WAS A REAL DISAPOINTMENT! ALTHOUGH THE BOOK WAS TOUCHING AT TIMES, IT DID NOTHING BUT SKIM THE SURFACE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND HIS \\"COACH.\\" EACH CHAPTER WAS SO SHORT THAT NO TOPIC WAS ADAQUATELY COVERED. I FELT LIKE I WAS READING THE OUTLINE OF A NOVEL ABOUT TO BE WRITTEN.

I'm not sure which I resented more: Morrie's presumption that his impending death somehow imparted wisdom, or Ablom's prodigal son schtick. I'm sorry that Morrie suffered such a long, drawn-out illness, but that does not elevate trite sentimentalism to the realm of grand philosophy. Nor do I doubt Mitch's love for his teacher, or the sincerity of his motives- I just was exhausted by his bouts of self-recrimination interwoven with breathless awe for Morrie's wisdom.I must admit that I found myself compelled to finish the book.

But these are few and far between. Mitch Albom comes across as an arrogant fool ... continuing to bring food when he knows it serves as a daily reminder of Morrie's demise.... nice touch to end with a page describing all of Albom's \\"great\\" achievements in a book that is meant to speak of life's greatest lesson... the importance of love and the futility of career! Smug and sentimental writing about a lovely sounding wise old man, shame the young man didn't take any creative writing classes at University."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't relate","review":"I enjoy Mitch Albom's writing but had a hard time relating to Morrie. He talks a lot about not just striving for money and success. Some how though he could aford to have 24x7 home care. My parents both went through months of near physical helplessness before they died and I only wished I could have afford the type of care Morrie apparently received. It's easy to talk about not being money hungry when you already have it along with a university job that wasn't in danger of being downsized. I am sure he was sincere but if he was poor and his wife or a child needed 24x7 care that he couldn't afford I wonder what he would say then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New!","review":"Before I read it, I thought I would have got great ideas in it.

It's clear that he's a talented writer -- just ask him, he'll tell you! Maybe Mitch learned some lessons sitting with Morrie -- I'm amazed that Morrie was able to tell Mitch anything -- but it's clear that Albom doesn't apply those same lessons to his own life. Perhaps that's why Tuesdays with Morrie didn't resonate with me, I resent people who talk the talk, but don't walk the walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this to feel good about life.","review":"Everyone should read this book.

As Mitch and Morrie grew older and apart, Mitch forgot about Morrie. Morrie always remembered Mitch as the bright young college student that he loved.

When Mitch sees his college professor on T.V. he calls him and says he wants to come see him. Over the course of their visits Morrie teaches him lessons about his life. How it is ok to ask for help when you can no longer help yourself. To give up the man image of wanting to die after you can no longer help yourself.

The philosophy that so fascinates and illuminates the narrator is old, widely acknowledged, and understood by people who have spent any time in introspection. Is it possible that many men have never considered the important aspects of life? Is Morrie that startling to them? Perhaps it is that Morrie states things very simply--which is always good--and is easily understood. Anyway, I would not recommend this to most people--only to those who, like the narrator, are just beginning their quest for truth and beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicit details of illness and death totally unnecessary.","review":"After reading this book I was left depressed and unbelieving in Mitch's true dedication. Having seen my young mother's untimely death when, at the end, she insisted only her immediate family be with her. I cannot understand Morrie wanting the whole world to watch his body's sad decay when he could have been remembered by his lively eyes, dancing and profound wisdom. Yes, this is life but we all witness it in our own families and don't need reminders of \\"big globs of phlegm\\" coughed into a kleenex. Has Mitch now changed his life and given his efforts to community service and helping humanity? Am sure because this book was so highly rated, he will join the ranks of self healing books and another will be forthcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mentor teaches until the end; selfless and compassionate","review":"I heard the author on ESPN last fall talking about this book. I thought at first this was some kind of mistake; a dying professor with ALS and a former student just did not sound like a sports story. Well, it's not, but the message was an excellent one for the sporting forum. The reader learns what's important in life and it's not stuff or status. Morrie knew this all along but I think Mitch came to appreciate these values. The book is excellent for people (I'm trying not to say men) who have lost their objectivity. The corporate ladder sometimes tips over when one gets to the top and the climber is not prepared for the fall. Read this book and remember a special relationship that needs rekindling.

It's almost like Albom is writing in the third person...\\"I once knew this workaholic named Mitch who was reunited with his mentor, Morrie, where he learned all these insights about life....\\".

This is a book that has no problem keeping the readers interest and fills the reader with anticipation of what the next chapter holds. This book puts many of life's questions into a new perspective and a simple one at that.

With a supporting cast which includes Dan Castellaneta and Yeardley Smith (both from The Simpsons) and Linda Purl, the cast is almost perfect. This production is a little too visual in a few of its jokes. However, on the whole, it unscrupulously grabs the audio listener by his ears and shakes him with laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and engaging","review":"I started reading this book last night and couldn't put it down.

Instead, the author uses maudlin, hackneyed language to treat serious topics. There is no question, Morrie is a man of incredible wisdom with great life teachings to give, but Mr. Albom shamelessly panders to an audience with a tear-jerk fetish, corrupting the wisdom of an honest dying man with the language of a man enmeshed in the world of capitalism. Insultingly enough, it is entirely clear through Mr. Albom's language and writing style that he is intending for the reader to cry. One thing is clear: either Mr. Albom used this tragic story to make a lot of money, or he has unwittingly and foolishly ventured into a writing genre in which he does not belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Material for true living","review":"Additional instructions for how to live your life. The book was heart-warming and reaches deeply into that sensitive part of all of us. We all fear death, but as we have been told time and time again, it is unavoidable. Morrie's final lesson is one of truth. Released from the power of the \\"material world\\" Morrie is free to live out his final days knowing who he is, who he has been and though it is unspoken, he knows who he is to God. Two very powerful messages are woven throughout the book: one must first learn how to die in order to understand how to live; and if you have lived your life in a way that has touched the lives of others, when you dies, it only life that has ended not a relationship. The relationship will live forever. Thank you Mitch for this wonderful story, it has taught me much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Mirror on Middle Age","review":"This was an interested book that for me was as the title tag line says about \\"...An Old Man, a Young Man...\\" As a man approaching middle age, the author's reactions and feelings as he responded to Morrie's strong life spirit even in dying rang true. What I didn't get, was any deep sense of where the author went with new perpectives on life the Morrie brought about in him. Clearly, he was touched, but what did he change in his life?. Maybe in his next book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about a dying man who shares his view on living","review":"In this book, Morrie is on the verge of dying yet he strives to tell others of his views on living while he still has time to experiance it. The book is well crafted and organized in an effective chronological order, with each chapter centered around a central theme in philosophy. The chapters start with ideas in philosophy as life, culture or death. Albom writes with a sense of compassion for Morrie but also with the goal of cataloging the last few years of Morrie's life. Yet Albom, does tend to lean more toward a record of Morrie's life and doesleave out some of the more emotional things in the book. This is not to say that this book doesn't bring tears, in fact it often does. This book is very well written and a great record of Morrie's ideals and beliefs that he put forth in the final years of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is so complex...live it in a simple way","review":"This book has really made an impact in my life.

Its a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone.....","review":"I'm sure you've read many reviews on how touching this book is, and I would say 'to each their own'. But an entire book written about a death-bed conversation can be a bit much for some people. Think of the scene in 'The Empire Strikes Back' when Yoda is dying and speaking his last words to Luke... well now imagine that scene was the content of the entire movie and you get a sense of what it was like to read this book. The first half was touching... Morrie - an old college professor was dying, passing on his words of wisdom to his dear ex-student. Well, by the second half of the book, I just wanted him to pass away so I can finish the book and start another. I'm sorry, some may say this is blasphemy, but how many tear-jerking eye opening last words of wisdom can you really absorb? And to be honest, I can hardly remember what they were after I closed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooooring","review":"I don't see why people like this book so much.

This is one of the most beautiful books you can find on the bookshelf. I have no hesitation in recommending it.

It was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story.","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the few books available that seem to encompass the true meaning of life. Mitch tells the story of his meetings with his dying professor, Morrie Schwartz. Through these tales we are given the opportunity to look into the mind of a dying man. Morrie's hopes, fears, and dreams are given to us with the hope that we may learn from them. The book feels different because it was written by a journalist not a novelist. Albom wraps the book up in a way that few authors have mastered. It may end prematurely, but it leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It is a heartwarming tale that has the ability to give your day a little more meaning. The book may not be a challenging read, but it does make a reader think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, am I missing something here??","review":"I read this book at breakfast this morning and felt like I've been robbed. What psychobabble! Shame on Mitch Albom. Can't believe this book got so many good reviews. Are people who read this book and loved it lacking in these simple insights about life and death? Haven't they ever read anything like this before? Most women's magazines and Readers' Digest have articles or snippets about people like Morrie confronting death and offering newly found wisdom. Mr. Albom should get back to covering sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jouney to death","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie is a sweet book about the author Mitch and his journey with Morrie as Morrie is dying. Mitch's life changes as he visits Morrie each Tuesday. With Morrie's whitty sayings and wonderful advice, Mitch has a different outlook on life and death. It is wonderful to read about the love that develops between the two men. A good book to read. I read it in a day.

I couldn't even absorb the lessons and wisdom I was supposed to be taking away from this book because I was so aggravated by Mr. Albom's narssicism. It seems like every page was steeped in a light bath of 'thank goodness Morrie had me' attitude. Not to mention the outright statements like the part where Mitch talks about if he died, his boss wouldn't even care as long as he had some of his amazing writing underneath his dead body.To me, a young but frequent reader, this book felt more like a tribute to Mitch than a tribute to Morrie. Did anyone else feel that way about this book? Or am I way off base here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked at the good reviews!","review":"With all due respect to Professor Morrie, I mean no disrespect to his illness or the obvious many lives that he touched deeply.However, I found the book to lack depth. The writer professes the way he wastes life not loving enough and being positive like the mentor he neglected for years. Sure, this is a problem many people could sympathize with. We all take for granted the things we have until we are about to lose them. The book does not deliver on why we need each other even in the worst of times and only aims to highlight the courage of of his teacher whom he forgot about for so many years. I would have liked a deeper exploration of people in general and why we are so self-involved. I guess this was beyond a writer who has more experience writing about quarterbacks and goalkeepers.The book is good for hopeless people looking for even a douse of inspiration. That is as far as the writer can take you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, drab, and vacuous pseudo-literature...","review":"The author wants this book wants to be profound. He wants this book to be awe-inspiring. He wants this book to be an alarm bell that shakes us from our day to day complacency. This is all well and good, even respectable - indeed, perhaps more of us ought to strive for such noble ends. However, as one of the two main \\"characters\\" in the book, he comes across as incredibly naive and lacking much of anything resembling humanity. His semi-tough guy persona is nothing short of laughable, and his stilted prose renders a possibly moving experience inert. Under his pen, the depths or the human soul are made superficial and cliche. Do yourself and the rest of humanity a favor and read some Dostoeyevsky instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge this book by the cover","review":"Basically this is a decent book until you see Mitch Albom on tv and see that he goes against all the lessons he has ever learned from Morrie. Morrie is a good natured man, but his lesson are too much like things you would read in a Hallmark card. It was very old to keep reading his lessons because there were so many and they were all the same basic idea. Basicallyyou could read the first few chapters and still understand the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Very. While Morrie appears to have been a kind and gentle man, there's nothing unique about his \\"special\\" insight (we should all love another). Prophets since the beginning of time have been telling us this. I also found the author's attitude rather self-serving: I think he smelled a \\"story\\" here and went for it. Well, he apparently has sold a bunch of books, so he was right, there was a \\"story\\" there."},{"rating":"2","title":"As much Mitch as Morrie","review":"I usually eschew \\"inspirational\\" best-sellers, but I read this one because I have a beloved relative with ALS and wanted to understand what she's going through. The deepening relationship between the two men as Morrie's condition worsens is touching, as is the transformation in Mitch's consciousness. However, I felt the book was nowhere near the \\"complete Morrie\\": being a consummate teacher, he set Mitch a limited assignment that he knew he could handle, but the deeper thinking behind Morrie's aphorisms remains unsaid. It's a good story (about Mitch), well written, and worth reading, but I'm looking forward to \\"Morrie in His Own Words\\" for what Morrie was really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY INSPIRING","review":"VERY INSPIRING.

While it is impossible to dislike Professor Schwartz, and hope against hope that he will beat his cruel disease, it is also impossible to escape Mitch Albom, who is so sophmorically self-absorbed that he annoyingly assumes his shortcomings must also be our own. For those of us who actually spent our growing-up years growing up, I have a small insight for the author: Professor Schwartz's aphorisms sum up the kind of love, compassion, empathy and fair play most of us learn as children, not as gifted undergraduates in a Brandeis lecture hall. Readers who find Morrie's observations startling, stimulating or novel may, like Albom, merely have some growing up to do. May they do so and find joy, but I respectfully suggest they keep their therapy (and this book) to themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but too soft for my taste.","review":"This book is great... for an older person, but for anyone under the age of twenty its a real bore. The content of the book is all about learning life's lessons and learning to live life to the fullest. It is really not a subject most teens care to read about because most of us are still out partying and doing whatever. However the book does make you think about where your life is headed. In me it raised the question of whether or not my life will pan out the I feel it should, and when time runs down on my life and I finally die will I be satisfied with what I've accomplished. All in all this book is good, but I feel it is geared more toward older adult taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to expect when you read Tuesday With Morrie","review":"I thought that Tuesday With Morrie was an excellent book.

Albom's representation of the disease and how it impacts a sufferer is entirely wrong, in my experience. I am appalled that this man has made truckloads of money from this disease, without bothering to get his facts right. If he misunderstood it when he wrote the book, he should issue a new, revised edition.Far from the wonderful, uplifting experience that those who don't know the disease say they get from this book, I warn those who suffer from ALS and their families and friends to give this book a wide berth. It is all about Albom and does not give true credit to the real mental and physical anguish that those of us who suffer from the disease feel.This is not one of those wonderful books hat help the soul soar, it is an exercise in self aggrandisement, a misrepresentation of a serious and appalling disease and another example of media driven success, regardless of content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched by the movie","review":"I just got done watching the movie Tuesdays with Morrie and I was truely touched because not only the courage of the teacher but the compassion of the student.It is to bad that there is not that much compassion shown more in every day life or maybe it is but it's just not seen.I now plan to read the book because the movie really drew me in and I do not watch that many network movies so Oprah if you ever check in to this site I Thank you for brining us this truely heart warming story.

All I had heard about this book was how moving and inspirational it was. Then upon reading it I find either of those qualities in it. Rather, is was struck by the selfishness of Albom and his ignorance of what Morrie had been doing. Albom presented Morrie as if Morrie had been needing to be reunited with him to be completely contented.

I was the student.\\" But it sounds like Morrie Schwartz had a lot of visitors and a lot of people around him as he was dying. Albom doesn't show up until AFTER Nightline and Ted Koppel.

Morrie's life was truly dedicated to teaching and the example he set for his pupil as he slowly lost his abilities from his disease was the ultimate lesson in how to really live for Mitch Albom. Mitch learned how to stop and smell the roses from his old professor's tuesday lessons. This book really shows the beauty of the human spirit shining through even in the face of death.

He gives you humorous bits of wisdom and little life lessons that help you see death in a different light.This book is about Morrie and his old college student, Mitch. Mitch loses touch with Morrie after college and forgets the important things in life. After Morrie catches ALS (a terminal illness), he guests on Nightline.

In the process of making me laugh and cry, it made me reflect upon my life. It is about living and how you live than about dying. It's about enjoying and appreciating the gift that is freely given to all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent lesson before dying...............","review":"I love the title of this book. Tuesday is such a \\"blah\\" day of the week but Mr.Albom makes it very special with his insightful talks with Morrie Schwartz. This professor/student relationship is so touching that it makes one wish everyone had such a teacher in life. I had heard many good things about this book but had to read it for myself. I wasn't even aware that Ted Koppel had interviewed Morrie three times! Morrie's points about life were poignant and all too true. I wish more people had this insight and not just near the end of one's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book and learn how to deal with life...and death","review":"This was one of the most amazing books I've ever read. I recently lost my father to a sudden heart attack last fall, and have been searching ever since for \\"the book\\" to help the healing process. Well, I found it and I was not disappointed. This is must-read for anyone who is trying to deal with the struggles of life and death. Thank you, Mitch, for sharing the story of your mentor and friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most profound and heart warming story. Lessons on Life!","review":"It is the most heart warming and moving story I have ever read. I am thankful for Morrie Schwartz; for his wonderful tribute to all people and to Mitch Albom for writing this book so the world could share this inspirational story. It is a reminder to all on what is 'truly' important in life and the many lessons to employ and live by. Thank you Morrie, Thank you Mitch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teacher Affects Eternity","review":"This book is a treasure chest of lifes lessons. It makes you look at your life and whats important. On a tombstone it tells the year of birth and the year of death and in between there is a \\"-\\". That dash is what counts. Morrie made his dash count. Thank you Mitch Albom for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great little book!","review":"In our age of greed and moral deterioration, this book proved to be very refreshing. Mitch Albom's simple presentation makes it a very easy read. Even then, emotions seem to jump from its pages. I was deeply moved and inspired. Worth every minute and every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"This was a very good book. It really made me think about this crazy world we live in today. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuesdays with Snoring","review":"Tuesday's with Morrie is a book that philosophizes about death and enlightenment. The book in my honest opinion is not for youth. It seems like a book with not enough passion for young readers. After the author describes Morrie's condition as he slowly dies I found myself not caring after a while and found reading the book as a tedious task. There was never a point in which I was totally involved in the book. Some people might view this as an emotional tale, and say it's a touching book, but this is hard to imagine. This book seems dry of any thing vaguely close to gripping emotion. I don't know which age group to recommend this book for, maybe for the older readers who no longer have good taste in books or are feeling that they connect with Morrie, and his disease. Now im not saying that if you are required to read this book you are going to go through hell and back, but there are definitely better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreck","review":"A slim volume of advice that is shallow and insignificant offered to a writer who is vain and selfish. There are many other, better books that offer insights into ordinary Americans that this one does. Try, At Home in the Heart of Appalacia instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love This Book","review":"Saw the play first a few years ago in Miami. I've read some other books by Mitch Albom, and decided to pick this one up. Such a great, touching book. Afterwards, I bought copies for my mom, dad, and brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Day Read-Lifetime of Wisdom","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie is a great one day read to take along on a plane, to the beach or anytime you will have the opportunity to read. Mitch is the everyman in this work, too wrapped up in life and not enough in truly living. Morrie is the voice of wisdom and experience, who desperately wants to live his last days with as much love and meaning as possible. Together again after many years apart, both find their coach/player, student/teacher relationship deeply meaningful and rewarding up until Morrie's passing and beyond.We should all be as fortunate as Mitch to have a mentor in life, and wise enough to recognize it. Filled with wisdom on many aspects of life, Morrie teaches Mitch, and us, that love and relationships are the highest aspiration of life. I completely agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's perked up to be!","review":"After reading \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" by the same author, and reading/hearing comments about \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" I really thought this was going to be a great read also-- but it wasn't. Reviewers make it seem as though there are so many revealing thoughts and lessons to be learned through this book, however, I found most of them to be common sense based. It was interesting to follow how this elderly man degenerates, yet keeps a positive attitude all throughout. Nonetheless, it wasn't as engaging to read as \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the careerist, bad for the rest","review":"This book is probably beneficial for careerists too absorbed in an objective-oriented, material world to value the other aspects of life, especially being a testimony from one of their own. As an instrument of social change, 3 stars.But it is essentially useless to anyone else with a pre-existing and healthy skepticism of human nature, activity, and group functioning. For this, no stars.More points off for cheesy melodrama, giving a grand total of 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was moved to another level in my own mourning.","review":"The author allows the experience of his listening to bring us the wisdom of his professor. I, like other reviewers, found new levels of understanding in my own mourning as I reflected deeply on the recent death of my father. I read this book in one reading, remembered well the 'white whiskers' growing on the chin of someone so near death, cried deeply, and stepped into new understandings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed and I cried...","review":"Mr. Albom's \\"thesis\\" really hit home with me. I read it on my return flight home from a week long business trip. I too am Mitch's age, I too have a \\"home on a hill.\\" I too struggle with the balance between career and family. Mr. Albom's report helped me a great deal to remind me the material things mean nothing without my wife and kids love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor's New Clothes perhaps?","review":"This book was highly recommended to me so I bought it ... looking for some answers to a personal struggle.I will say that I am fairly disappointed. As some other reviewers indicated, the book could easily have been reduced to about 80 pages and had the same effect for me. I kept hoping that things would improve as I got closer to the end. Unfortunatley that never happened.Seems like a nice tribute to a loveable old professor but the book was not well written. Many details that would have added to the depth of the book were left out ... and other musings were repeated over and over.I'm not sure why all the rave about this book. Plenty of others out there that truly make this book look almost silly. Glad it really didn't take me long to finish it, otherwise I'd have been annoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRATION FLOWS!","review":"Tuesday's with morrie was a fabulous book that inspired not only me, but several of my friends! It makes you realize the harsh truth about death. Mitch Albom lays it all on the line with this book telling about an old man struggling with health problems and his fight to stay alive and teach others how to live life and love it as well. I strongly encourage you to read this uplifting book, I guarantee that you'll have a new outlook on life after you're through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"I loved this book very much. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I think that whoever reads this book is impacted by its words and meanings in some way. The lessons that this book shares are carried upon in our minds as well as our hearts. This book simply is a gift to mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I would highly recomend this touching, not sappy book. While Mitch changes a great deal it isn't an imediate change like many books portray. The change in him happens over many monthes, i found this made the story very relatable to real life. While it is only 192 pages it is written extemely well. It doesn't take up extra space by trying to drag out the story longer than it needs to be. The flash backs were a wonderful way to explain pertinant information and engage the reader without going into to much unneeded detail. The format really expresses the book well by putting you there every tuesday in chronological order. It also helps you follow along and keep track of Mitch's change and Morrie's declineing health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and melodramatic","review":"I admit that I only read the first half of the book. I couldn't stand any more. One of the reviewers said something about \\"fourth-grade level\\" writing, and I couldn't agree more. Why do so many people eat this up? Have they never before thought about life and death? This book is appropriate for the reading level and reasoning ability of a ten-year-old."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book.","review":"There must be more in a person's mind, as death approaches, than has been discussed in this book. I also don't understand the raves about the book. I found it rather insipid and definitely lacking substance. The problems with the author's brother could have been developed more thoroughly, perhaps for greater interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"Just because a man is old and dying doesn't mean that he automatically knows all. Morrie made statements about how life should be lived. These statements were accepted by the characters in the book as the truth just because he was dying. I just couldn't accept this. Although this book was very highly recommended to me by a friend as a \\"must read\\", I was greatly disappointed in the lack of substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one inspid book.","review":"The professor sounds like a great guy but Albom took his wisdom and distilled it into a Hallmark card of platitudes. But the book is worth reading to learn the magic formula that creates a best-seller. I wish I wrote this book. For the $$$$"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye opener of life","review":"Of all the books I have read in my life this is the best one so far. It makes you live life to the fulliest and not be so caught up with the fear of death. Not only taught me about death but also all those things we fear about the most. For example, love, regrets, and marriage. These are just a few of the many things that Morrie teaches us through his inspiring words.It has really inspire me to live my life with no regrets. I just hope that I can be as strong as Morrie if I am placed that kind of situation that he was. I highly recommend this book to everyone that feels that their life is not worth much because this book will teach you not to take life for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could only hope...","review":"I could only hope that when I get to the end of my life, I have half of the insight that Morrie had. I found this book to be a very quick read but the lessons held within to be wonderful and so easy to apply to life. If you ever need to read something that is life-affirming, this is the book. Beautifully written to capture the last days of this wonderful human's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a touching real story of something everyone faces..death","review":"Tuesdays With Morrie was the first book I have ever read that made me put the book down and weep. Everyone faces death and most people are terrified of it. This book examines a man's death and shows that one needn't be frightened. This issue is at the core of our being as humans and I have never heard a more enlightening or deeply joyful tale. Although it is sad, the freedom that Morrie achieves before he dies is inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Graduated College Students.","review":"This book is good for any middle aged or adult reader because it shows how a mentor in your life can have lasting memories. Where a young man,twenty years later looks up his old and best professor he had in college. And found him in his last months of life because he was dieing of cancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grace of the Living","review":"Reading TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE was a wonderful experience. The dialogue worked well and the author's style introduces another ethnographic approach to writing about the self in the company of fellow earthlings. I finished the book feeling more human and compassionate than when I first opened it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"When Mitch learns that his favorite professor from college is ill with ALS (Lou Gherig's disease) he resumes his relationship with Morrie and the two begin meeting again on Tuesdays as they had done years before. Rather than being bitter about steadily losing the functions of his body, Morrie embraces the prolonged opportunity to say his goodbyes. Morrie shares the stories of his life with Mitch and reminds him what is really important in life. Morrie's health deteriorates, but Mitch's hardened and cynical outlook on life softens and his heart is renewed. The life lessons in this book stay with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesday with Morrie","review":"Recommend by a friend. Glad I listened. Makes me realize I need to focus on Life's Greatest Lesson more than I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"well....","review":"It has great condition and price. but adding shipping fee, I'm not sureIf it was good deal...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, touching story","review":"Usually a great book is more in the telling of the tale then in the tale itself, Tuesdays with Morrie is no exception. It's a sad story, beautifully told and it makes you aware of what a blessing life is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"It gives a great lesson on life. I was impressed by Morrie's positive attitude about his disease throughout the book. My father is suffering from a disease closely related to Morries, it really hit home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A caring insightful book","review":"For those readers who found nothing in this book for them - my condolensces. The lessons imparted to Mitch by Morrie in learning how to live with high minded priorities and learning how to die with dignity are something we all need to know. And if we think we know them - we may need to be reminded. This book did that It is a reminder of decency, caring and love of fellow man that needs to be on everyone's bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I started to read this book and I must say that if Mitch Albom describes Morrie Schwartz in less than perfect detail, Morrie Schwartz is one wonderful human being! Yes, this book can be whimsical at times (Or it feels like it is TOO GOOD to be true!) BUT it appears to be meant to be read numerous times with each reading getting more powerful. A lot of times we see Morrie Schwartz in everyday life and unfortunately we are blind to his wisdom. It is very sad he had to die with Lou Gerhig's disease in the manner he did. Ciao!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, yes...but did the author exploit the subject?","review":"A sad story, yes. Morrie was a terrific subject and his lessons are timeless. But, I have to wonder how Mitch Albom sleeps at night. From all he \\"learned\\", or allegedly gained from these \\"Tuesdays\\" didn't he exploit Morrie just a bit? Morrie encourages us all to live for today, stop, enjoy the little things around us, LIVE, not just to work, to make money, but LIVE! I put the book down at times rejoicing in these simple words.How then, is it that Mitch Albom, one of Morrie's great students, gets away w/writing his story? What did/does he get but the profits from a dying old professor? Hmmmm....what did Mitch come away with? From the look of it, a bunch of dough.Yes, we're the richer for learning a little about Morrie and of ALS but Mitch Albom is richer for exploiting him, and apparently, not that much wiser for knowing him."},{"rating":"2","title":"death is OK","review":"This book made me see death in a different way. Before I was scared of the thought of dying. Morrie, somehow made me more relaxed, and I have accepted death as a normal part of life. I can only hope that I will die with as much dignity as Morrie. I will vow to live my life with compassion for other people. I will try to live my life as if it were my last day. I owe a great deal to the experiences Morrie went through, without his experiences, I would not have learned these valuble lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you greatly Morrie!","review":"This was such a neat book to read! After I started with the first page, I couldn't put it down until it was over!I myself have had a very near death experience that made me very able to relate with Morrie's situation. It brought many great feelings of joy to my mind! It is already 2:30 am and I am usually asleep by 10:00 pm, but like I said, there was no stopping once I started reading! Then right after I finished wiping the tears of joy that were left on my face after the last sentences, I had to write you and tell you my wonderful feelingsabout this project. I'm not sure that I am sending this to the correct location, I just wanted to share my opinion.Even though my mother gave this to me for Christmas, I know her intentions were for me to lend it to her to read. But, I've already told her, \\"Only if she FORSURE returns it back!\\"Thank you very much Mr. Mitch Albom for sharing your wonderful story with the world!Jill Ellena I am 27 years old"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally overrated!!","review":"What a disappointment this book was. There is very little substance in this book. Whatever lessons Morrie had to teach, could have been summed up in a short chapter. I feel like there was no book here. Mitch Albom reconnects with an old dying teacher while he is out of work and essentially capitalizes on his meetings with him to profit off of a book. There is no character development. The book is divided into small chapters on a specific \\"life\\" topic. In each chapter there is maybe one sentance of wisdom Morrie imparts, without real life experiences to support them. I am very sentimental and was fearful I would be overcome by emotions from this book. Didn't happen. Book is totally overrated, overpriced and undercooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I found this book to be very sappy and condescending. The author portrays his mentor as some sort of saint and prophet. It's the sign of a truly bad work when an author turns a real person into an unreal character. Why did he feel the need to repeat so many of Morrie's \\"wise words\\"? Was it to drill it into the readers' heads, \\"Hey, this is important, so pay attention here\\"? This account was definitely written for the unsophisticated reader. Like another reviewer of this book, I didn't care about either Mitch or Morrie after reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational and easy to read","review":"I can see why this book has been a best-seller for almost a year. It is a moving book and, because the chapters are short, it is an easy book to pick up and put down at will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie was truely inspirational","review":"Am am a 30 year old proffessional person, dealing with age and business accomplishments and my own personal spirituality and have had a difficult time trying to balance the two. Turning 30 has not been easy for me, however Morries advise has helped me to deal with it on a possitive note and to help me decide that making \\"the big buck\\" is not going to make me a whole person. Money does not suck, but it is not the end all beat all of life. Thanks Mitch for sharing and Thanks Morrie for being there for so many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timing is everything","review":"I picked this book up in the airport on the way home from my mother's funeral. Being in a very introspective mode, I found this book to hit home with life's simple moments - the one's that unfortunately only rise to the surface through brushes with mortality or crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental and Sophisticated","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie was given to me by a friend and recommended by another; both of whom are educated and sophisticated readers (as am I). Yes, it is preachy and somewhat repetitive; however, we found it uplifting and insightful.Morrie gives some very good advice like, 'Let the love in.' and 'Is today the day?'. He has an ego, yes, but he certainly learned how to live in way that many people are not experiencing these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Can I Say!","review":"WOW. There is so much hype about this book. It was given to me as a gift from the wife of a friend. (I should have known). I am 183 pages into it and still waiting on the point.For those of you who think it has so much to teach you, I wonder where you have been all your life. \\"Be nice to each other\\", \\"love one another\\", \\"don't hit\\".... Seems like I used to see these things on a \\"Everything I Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarden\\" poster. I was expecting some deep revelation. It hasn't come yet.Morrie seemes like a nice guy, but the book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death lite","review":"A sugar-coated pill, easy for those aging baby boomers to swallow. No doubt he was a sweet man, but I didn't learn one thing from Morrie (as represented) that I hadn't heard from many other sources. How many people will make real changes to their lives based on Morrie's lessons? Did Mitch Ablom? I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I picked this for a book club based on the many great reviews and fertile topics of discussion the book seemed to bring. Unfortunately, I found the afforisms in the book to be light weight and the sort of thing one might read in a fortune cookie. \\"Love each other or perish\\";\\"Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others\\"; \\"Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else.\\" I also found the author coming across as opportunistic. He sought out his college professor only after finding out from the Ted Kopple Show that the professor was dying of a disease process in his 80's. The author loses his job AFTER finding the professor and then begins his book writing effort supposedly at the encouragement of the professor. The author emphasizes that the book was the professor's idea several times. Not life changing; not entertaining; but short at least. I found The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch to be a thousand times more inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZOMG! inspiring!","review":"I can see why many people will be Moved by this book, but I simply can't list this book as one of my favorites. I'd like to say this book taught me a lot, but both Morrie and Mitch seem a bit naive. Yeah, like I need them to discover some of those things.That being said, I do like the writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - lack of substance","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. There was nothing new or inspirational that hasn't been captured in countless cliches - and the entire focus of the book was on the author, not the teacher. Where was Mitch for 20 years? How meaningful is a relationship that was academic in its beginning, on hiatus for 20 years, and subject for a book in the last few weeks? This is not a lesson in living & dying - it's an example of selfishness and how to make money under the guise of enlightening other people and romanticizing death. If you must read it, at least get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author did not go into enough depth.","review":"I was left feeling very much dissappointed in the book,especially after all the hype. Had the author spent more time on helping the reader get to know Morrie,I possibly could have felt more compassion and empathy than I did. To be honest,neither the authoe, nor the professor seemed to be very likable people. The book was very over-rated. Don't buy it, just go to the library and check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this be more trite?","review":"What makes a wonderful personal memory doesn't necessarily translate into an enlightening read for others. No doubt Mitch holds vivid deeply felt memories of his former professor - who sounds like quite a wonderful guy - but the \\"lessons\\" learned are obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book, Shallow closing","review":"This is a great little, short book. It's a great thesis paper about one's life in general, and each tuesday's subject penatrates the reader with its strong point of view. But the ending comes too suddenly, and is once again simple, but this time around also very flat and shallow, leaving the reader without smile on his/her face and dry eyes. It's still a great read and it's worth the money. Take what it gives you, and don't expect more. Enjoy your one Tuesday with Morrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"I had a very dear friend who had AlS. She bought at least 36 of these books for family, friends and caregivers. What a wonderful gift it was that she gave us. My friend Pat Bodnar, like Morrie chose to live life to the fullest, A lesson to be learned from reading this book is that you have a choice, you can give up, or like Morrie and Pat, you can live while you're dying. I recommend this book to everyone. Once you start reading it, you won't put it down till you've read the last page!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-READ! EXCELLENT!","review":"I read this book in 2 nights. I recommend it to anyone from the ages of 10 to 110. It makes you appreciate life, growing old, compassion for the sick, and friendship. If you've ever lost someone through a terminal illness, I guarantee you will not be able to put this book down. You'll be laughing and crying throughout this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very powerful. Albom really shines here.","review":"It really makes you take another look at life, and the way that you are living it. I've read many books, and this one beats them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book","review":"If this book were not based on a true story, it would probably get negative reviews for being too far-fetched and unlikely. However, it is based on a true story, and for that, it is revered as one of the most inspiring books on the market today. Mitch Albom was blessed to have known someone like Morrie, who was that comfortable with his own death, that he used much of his last time on earth reflecting on life and trying to make it work out better for the ones he loved. Most people can think of someone that they know that is impossible not to love, and to Mitch Albom, this person is Morrie Schwartz, and this book is the story of how Morrie passes on lessons of life before he succumbs to Lou Gehrig disease. Also recommended is the movie, with a great job by Jack Lemmon as Morrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Moves you to Tears","review":"In the beginning, I thought that this would be another typical teacher recommendation type of book. But because of the positive comments I got about it, I decided to try it. Soon, I began to get into the story, the sadness of the disease, and I began to feel sorry for Morrie. However, as the plot showed me hidden lines written in between the sentences, I began to see not the sorrow, but the joy in every chapter. When Morrie could no longer get out of bed, I felt devastated because I had gotten to \\"know\\" Morrie through the book. It really showed me that in this capitalistic world that we live in, it is possible for someone that seems to have handicaps to show you the way out of them. In conclusion, I think that this book is one of the few that touched all the feelings hidden within a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review: Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"Quick Thoughts: Thought-provoking. Morrie. Life. Learning.This is an older book that I think about from time to time. It's about life, love, and everything in between. The cover does it no justice. The title doesn't scream run and go get me, but if you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down. Mitch recounts the time spent with a professor dying from ALS. It reads like any other fiction story and stays true to the story-telling that Albom is known for. It isn't depressing or too matter-of-fact. It hits the perfect spot. I loved it so much that I assigned it for a few of my ninth graders when I as teaching. Not one of them wanted to read it and not one of them wanted it to end. It's a short read that will change your life for the better. Not because you take it to hard, but because the story is just so touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE","review":"This is a beautiful, life-changing, life-affirming book. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a story that will make the reader rethink his or her relationships and can be the start of a healing process for estranged families. The enthusiasm for life that this man has is astounding and incredibly uplifting. His philosophy is that each day we wake up is a gift from God, so what do we do with a gift? Do we celebrate, honor and cherish it or defile, ignore and take it for granted? Morrie never loses his dignity because he never loses his love and appreciation of that gift. This is a book to treasure and re-read whenever we've had a bad day and buy plenty to keep on hand for gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride, Ego, Humility, Peel Off The Layers","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie was touching. You could tell the author had the most major transformation of his life up until that point. As he was able to peel off layers of his ego and pride that he lived in by spending time with his mentor and witnessing the humility that he went through while dying. This book makes you look at living and especially dying differently as it opposes the fact that even those who are non-functional physically can still contribute the most important things to people and society as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it several times at different points in my life and each time I take something different away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story that moves everyone","review":"It may be a little too advanced for the younger crowd in my opinion, but it is a great one to start with. Tuesdays with Morrie makes me think more about what to do for my small period of living, to wonder the world and do as I please. This book really tells you to take a look at your life and to think more of what you want to do than what you \\"need\\" to do such as work long hours, get a raise, when the real meaning and true thing you need to do is make a difference, explore, ask questions, and to be open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for human who starts the career.","review":"I never read a book like this befor because I thought it would be hard for me.But I am so glad that I read this book and discussed in our class. This class is ES4D in the NYCTechnical College. I was emotional by reading it. During reading I like the book more and more.While reading this book, I realized human\`s interrelation don\`t mean anything without the love with family and friends. We should open our heart to listen to other people with their problems and their heartache pain.Don\`t only give lecture. Morrie is not only a teacher and coach to Mitch.When I was reading the book I was studing with Mitch.

If you want a book that will help you to put your priorities in order and help you decide what it truly important in life, may I recommend the following: \\"Gift of the Sea\\" by AM Lindberg; \\"Your Erroneous Zones\\" by W Dyer, \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" by Scott Peck, and the New Testament"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid, presumptuous and intellectually diluted...","review":"A good book or a bad book is one which makes you react - the act of reading that book should become a memory - a part of your life. Good and bad are subjective here - if you agree with the book, you call it a good book. If you disagree, you call it a bad book. But books like \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" are an insult to the written word. They are a collection of sentences that have no right to exist.

I read this as part of a college assignment. It was one of the best assignments ever. This book taught the class so much about living life, and living it to the fullest. If you are facing difficult times in your life, this is a MUST READ. Perhaps someone you know is facing family sickness, or having a difficult time with family relationships -- if so, this is a great book to help overcome those problems.

While at times seemingly very heartfelt the author consistently makes it very clear he's not the brightest bulb. Another review put it perfectly. Any book written by Morrie is going to have a whole lot more content-and probably be a hell of a lot less self-satisfied than this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too superficial ...","review":"Not impressed!!

Albom really thought this was a good analogy to use? When I read that line, I literally rolled my eyes. My 10 year old nephew writes better than Albom. The poor grammar, run-on sentences, etc, made me cringe. Not to mention, it was obvious that Albom only got in touch with Morrie because Morrie had been on Nightline. Albom wrote that his main goal in life had been to be famous. Thanks to good ol' Morrie, he's accomplished it. Albom fancies himself a great writer. Don't be fooled by the hype.

Instead he made a bookdeal by leveraging his relationship with a overnight sensation of the TV, and as a self-centered opportunist, shallowly recorded the teaching as his blueprint roadmap to his fatten piggy bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuesdays With Morrie, A story of Mitch Albom and his ego","review":"Tuesdays With Morrie was basically a story of Mitch Albom feeling sorry for some old man. While morrie's views on life were insightful, Mitch's outlook on him self and morrie cancel out the good things about this book. Page after page was constant contradictions and examples of Mitch's enormous ego. I found it weird how Mitch didn't bother looking morrie up until he saw him in poor condition on TV. Mitch only thought to visit morrie because morrie made him feel good about himself. Mitch made it sound like he was the only thing keeping morrie alive.I would only reccommend this book to someone who likes to disagree with people's opinions and actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie is extremely overrated","review":"Mitch Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie is far from a great work of writing.

The simple platitudes that we hear every day like \\"you should value you're family\\" and \\"money isn't important\\" take on a whole new meaning when one is dying.Overall-When it comes time for me to meet my end I hope I manage to do it with half as much guts and honesty as this old professor."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"great book. shipped quickly. my mother loves mitch albom and really enjoyed this novel as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the man","review":"Morrie was obviously an amazing, caring, wise person. He got that way by living a life of service to humankind, by focusing on more important things than money. So along comes this journalist who jots down a few quotes, and people flock to it saying how much they learned. This totally misses the point. Morrie's life demonstrates that there are no shortcuts to the lessons he's learned, but in our quick-shot read-a-book-and-now-I-know-everything society, people think they \\"get it.\\" Morrie specifically says that he hates self help books, and yet now his life and death have been turned into one. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too straight-forward","review":"Tries to be an inspiring story (in a self-help sort of way).

But it just isn't a good book. Every quote from Morrie is straight from one of those books of inspirational quotations, one after another.I also have to wonder about the effect on Mitch Albom after spending this time with Morrie. He seems to be working as much as ever, just adding this book and movie to his plate.I don't want to criticize Morrie or his effect on people. But this book isn't worth $21."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read.","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie was simply an attempt to explain death, written by someone who does not know how to write. I painstakingly managed to complete this thin book for a school report after hours of boredom. It was only after much difficulty that I was able to actually focus on the boring text. I can usually finish a 400 page book within a couple hours. Tuesdays with Morrie was fortunately far from 400 pages. However, it took forever to finish. I can recommend this book to no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and cliche-ridden, written by opportunist","review":"What a banal load of crap! Do people really buy this stuff?

I really got the idea the first Tuesday, and I didn't need the rest.Morrie keeps telling Mitch that money isn't everything. But I kept wondering if Morrie's tune would be different if he didn't have the private nurses to take care of him.Of course Morrie had already died long before I got the book (oops-- I hope I didn't give away the ending...), but as I read the book, I couldn't help wishing he'd get on with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly bad","review":"I picked up Tuesdays with Morrie at a yard sale recently, after having heard for years about what a life-affirming book it is. I lost my grandfather about 2 years ago and had many heart-to-heart talks with him in his declining years. I hoped the book would capture some of that sensibility. Instead, it was the most trite piece of crap I've read in years. While Morrie was most certainly a commendable person and inspirational teacher, [...] And things that seem to Mitch to be revelatory are the most obvious things that should have occurred to most people by adolescence. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not for me","review":"I found this book very well written and especially interesting because it is a true story. Morrie's advice should be heeded by all. The way it can relate to anyone seems almost coincidental. However, this kind of touching story is just not my cup of tea. I guess I'm just not the sentimental type. Maybe I need a little suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"this is the best book i have ever read! i have never learned so much from any book. not only was morrie a very smart and interesting man but mitch albom is an amazing author. he told the story wonderfully(i would recommend reading any of his books you can get). i would highly recommend this book to anyone, it was very inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Touching Story","review":"Tuesdays With Morrie is the perfect book to read for those who wish to understand the aspects of life that many people struggle with.

It left me with an small void, a nagging feeling that there should have been more to it than just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This death is ugly and it's all been said before--better.","review":"I was told I'd love the book. I didn't. Morrie's dying is a very ugly one, and frightening too. It gets in the way of his aphorisms, which have been said before and better. It's wonderful that Morrie is so unselfconscious that he can expose his physical symptoms with no embarrassment or disgust, even the ultimate indignity of having someone wipe his ass and declaring that he gets to be a baby again! I feel terrible for him, but I would like to have been spared the awfulness of his illness. It's hard to believe that anyone could find an up side to this wretched disease, let alone lots of up sides! I also question Mitch's sincerity and would like to know if he truly changed as a result of knowing Morrie so intimately. The book disappoints. You can't argue with any of Morrie's philosophical statements but you can't be very moved by them either."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacks depth and is written at a gradeschool level.","review":"I am very disappointed with this book and am stunned by the amount of positive reviews. This book lacked depth. The main ideas could have been summed up in less than 1000 words, but are repeated over and over. It is written at a gradeschool level. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that Mitch Albom was in it for the money the entire time (as was Morrie to pay for medical bills)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment!!!","review":"This book is easy to read, and, at times, very funny. However, it lacks depth, and was utterly disappointing in that regard. The book, overall, left me wanting more. I must agree with the review and comment from the New York Times...This book simply fails to enlighten!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great lesson for life...","review":"I could read this book over and over and never get tired of the simple messages that abound within its pages. ALS (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is a horrible illness to deal with, but the optimistic way in which Morrie approached the final days of his life is a testament to how we should all live. Mitch Album expertly displays the importance of living each day to the fullest and not taking anyone for granted with this piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing one CD","review":"I bought the CD to play it in class while we read the book.

What's the point of what we do each day? Morrie gently reminds of us of what life has to offer when you take the time to look. I think everyone should get a chance to read this book. Soemtimes the things we want most are the things we already have and take for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book changes your view of death","review":"I found the book to be very touching and realistic.

It uses such simple words, but teaches so much. I have read this book for the thrird time now and I feel that each time I read it I learn something new. It is so great because it comes from a guy who is really dieing, but does not see the bad part of it, instead he sees it as a perfect opportunity to teach not just his former student, but everyone who walks into his life the greatest life lesson. Live, learn and love life. Morries believed greatly in have a wonderful life when you are alive he belived in living life to its fullest until your very last breath. And he did. Overall I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is not hard so it does not take an expert to read it. Expect to appreciate life more when you are done reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Tuesdays","review":"while the story may be a good one, i found the book slow. being dyslexic with ADD, i had a very hard time getting into the books plots and found it even more dificult to get through it. I believe, this book is a best seller simply for the number of professors requiring it to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching...","review":"...I loved it! It brings death down to a very human level. It makes a person realize how selfish the healthy are, especially when there are people like Morrie in this world. He is dying yet he teaches the the rest of us how to live. I would recommend this book to anyone who is afraid of dying. I think you will view it differently after reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is short, Great book, read it","review":"I read this book and I think it is a great book. I don't understand how can the other reviewers criticize it so badly. It was a great book. It is very touching. I think those who critize the book are someone who can not stop whining about life and can not start giving and love others and live their lives meaningfully. yes, those life lessons, we might know them since we wer little. However, have we forgot about them as time goes by or just know them but never act on them. After I read this book, I start to think about my life and how i should not care about so much materialistic things and start to love and forgive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Enlightening","review":"I found this book to be totally enlightening. Generally, I refuse to read anything about death, and it took considerable effort on the part of my wife to get me to pick up this book. She assured me it wasn't about death, quite the opposite, it is about living. She was right and I strongly recommend it to everyone who wants to think and be touched in a very positive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable lessons indeed","review":"People rarely want to discuss death in such a frank and heart-breaking manner. Most people don't even want to think about it at all. Yet it is going to happen to all of us someday. The key is can we make our death meaningful to those who love us and care for us? Well, Morrie managed to do that for Mitch Albom and in the process Mitch has given us this wonderful gift of a book. I found it to be inspirational and gut-renching at the same time which is rare indeed. Please read this book if you have forgotten how to \\"stop and smell the roses\\". It is the little things in life that truly are the most valuable, like love, laughter and good health."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite author!","review":"You've done it again!

Tuesdays With Morrie shares a personal relationship between a teacher and a student that extends far beyond academics and a few years in a classroom. It reminds us how important relationships with friends and family are and encourages us to reach out and build these relationships throughout our lives.By the end of this book, we understand that the riches we are looking for are found in people not things, with the exception of this book. It is a treasure worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more people like him!","review":"I picked up this book 1 year ago at a friend's home and read a few pages. I left my friends home & never got around to buying a copy of Tuesdays with Morrie for myself until nearly a year later!I just finished this book and I am forever changed! To see that there was a person with so much knowledge, so much love and so much compassion brought tears to my eyes.Morrie is someone who will truly never die. He touched the heart of his family and friends, but through this book, he will continue to touch the herats and souls of every person lucky enought to pick it up.In such a difficult world, it was wonderful to take a few moments each day and read about a man who had made good choices - probably hard ones - and regretted very few. It is even better to hear of a successful person who vowed to never eploit others. Sensible, courageous, compassionate - these words describe Morrie! We need more people like him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story that makes you think about life","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie was a wonderful book. Morrie is such a good person with a passion for life. This book will make you stop and think about your own life and how you could make it better.

I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you want to learn a great lesson about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"It was a good good that sad towards the end. I wouldnt have read the book if it wasnt for my Marriage and Family class at Cypress College. The book makes you want to visit people you care about that you have forgotten about.

It makes you appreciate people you could lose someday a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"As a college senior six weeks away from her degree, and with plans to be a teacher next year, I can think of no better book I could have possible read at this time than Tuesdays With Morrie. Anyone who would give even the slightest critcism to this book obviously doesn't get it, or is deeply cynnical and unfeeling. Morrie Schwartz figured it out - he knew what each and every one of us is trying to find in our own lives every day. This book is truly about life's greatest lesson - love above all things. Not only do I believe that this is one of the most valuble books I ever read, I also believe in its great importance. Therefore, as soon as I finished reading it, I went out and bought over a dozen copies. I am going to give it to all my friends as graduation presents. If there is one tool that a college graduate, just starting out in life should take with him or her, it is this book. But I would also encourage anyone from any walk of life to read it. It is truly remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way life should be is explained","review":"Many questions that I had about life were explained and focused in this book.

I just couldn't stop crying when morrie was dying. Strange but true, we miss our mentors more now than the time when they were really there for us.The converstaions between mitch and morrie are simple yet powerful, mundane yet throught-provoking and cliched yet new to your heart. It is we, who know how much we are into this routine life of cat and mouse and how hard we are trying to break it.Morrie teaches us how to get away from the routines of your life and enjoy your life to the fullest.This book acts as a clensing agent to your soul. These books come once in an eternity. Get it and cure yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"Absolutely lovely book. A definite must buy. Once you have read it, you will be recommending it to a lot of friends too.It starts with an ex student connecting with a much loved professor when he learns that the professor has only a few months to live. It is about the conversations betweens these 2, every Tuesday on a variety of topics like Death, Forgiveness, Marriage.... In the meanwhile it also gives you a glimpse into the lives of them both.The book cant really be described, it can only be read & recommended.After reading it, I'm inspired to reconnect and really talk with the senior members of my family, a large number of whom are over 75."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've read this book three times now, and every time, I've cried.

It is a story that will reach your heart and have you look at life in a different perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Inspirational","review":"As I had to read this book for a class assignment it turned out to be relevant and very inspirational for my life.

One would definitely take something away after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie was a fantastic book! Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It was a very touching story of a man who brought so much joy and hope into the lives of others. It is too bad that not everyone could have a mentor like Morrie Schwartz in their lives. The way that he viewed life was amazing and I wish that I could be as true to my self as Morrie was. This book was fantastic and I defintely recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper","review":"I must admit it was the made for TV movie with Jack Lemmon that inspired me to purchase this book. But once it arrived, I could not put it down. This book reminds us what life is all about. We need to live as Morrie did, telling others how we feel and not waiting until it's near the end to share these emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about life","review":"I read this book thinking to gain information about ALS, but that's not really what it's about. In spite of dealing with death, this short little book is about life and love and enjoying what you have when things look the most bleak. It's more about giving and accepting than about losing.Morrie Schwartz, losing his body bit by bit to Lou Gerhig's disease, offers what is in his heart and mind and, in doing so, lives life rather fully to the very end. His former student, Mitch Albom, visiting on Tuesdays, accepts the gift of his mentor's humor and wisdom, and then passes it on to us along with Morrie's biggest lesson: \\"Love wins.\\"I laughed and cried and was content at the end, in spite of Morrie's inevitable death."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellently written piece of liturature","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie, while jumping from the main story to flashbacks of Mitch Albom's college years with Morrie, was extremely well organized. The switches between the flashbacks, the history of their lives, and the actual fourteen week study of life and death was interesting to read, and more importantly, understandable. Without questioning what the author was actually talking about, it made the book a moving, if not a quick read. The important issues were discussed with such wisdom that this book was well worth the short amount of time it took to read. Morrie's perspectives, while rather counterculture, made more sense than many of the commonly held views of today. He describes the importance of family, love, and a well examined life, in terms that would make anyone rethink their philosophy on life. This powerful book was an excellently written piece of liturature, with messages that will affect generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable Morrie","review":"A truly uplifting book with a positive take on many end of life issues. I laughed and cried.

The relationship between Mitch and Morrie is slightly interesting, I suppose. The whole book, though, is just one big sympathy request. Apparently Morrie was summoning the spirit of \\"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.\\" All of Morrie's lines could theoretically be a quote you add to your picture in the yearbook. And that's the problem. It's quote overkill. The average person doesn't speak in constant inspirational quote mode. This book didn't change my life, but it did change the position of my eyes (that is, off the pages of this book). This book is also a desperate attempt to engage sympathy for Morrie. I'm sorry he has ALS, but I can't do anything to change that (especially since he's now dead)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't find this book to be that profound.....","review":"Yes, I am one of the few people who didn't find this book to be the life-changing miracle that many others did.

I can't believe that some people actually referred to it as 'the best book you'll ever read'...NO WAY! I was and am still terribly disappointed in the book. What a waste of my time and money.

In spite of this, I read to the end, hoping for something enlightening, which was even more annoying because it never came.And if all that weren't enough, the old man's political views had to be sprinkled in for good measure.

Once I started reading it, I just couldn't stop. I tried to compare what Morrie said to what I was doing and feeling in my own life, wanting to be like how he thought people should be but realizing that I wasn't. I am now trying to change in some ways. After reading a very informative part I would sometimes set the book down and contemplate about the part and try to absorb the fool meaning of the part.

It is something that everybody should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Touching, Inspirational Memoir","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie touched my soul, helping me to understand death, dying and growing old with dignity. Mitch and Morrie shared a passionate, respectful friendship that is rare, especially considering the age difference. Nevertheless, these two men taught one another, along with the readers, so much about life, respect, getting old, and mostly, how to enjoy the little things we all take for granted.Morrie showed great courage as he slowly faded away. Through his stories, I understood what aging, death and dying is like, and how we should respect the request of the elderly, terminally ill, or those we just fail to understand.I found this book an inspiration to me, and others. I cried, laughed, mostly -- I understood what Morrie and Mitch taught us.As the author of A Condition of Limbo, I realized after reading Tuesdays with Morrie, our stories are similar, filled with love, admiration and a new understanding of the terminally ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"How embarrassing for Mitch Albom to have learned these lessons this late in his life. The same goes for Morrie himself. And to think they believe that others haven't is a great insult. To say that the Morrie wasn't self-absorbed is a joke.

So, I want to put in my two cents on this overly sentimental and poorly written book to balance the scales. This book made me cringe with embarrassment for the writer. A friend who read it, returned it to the bookstore and demanded her money back, she found it so poorly written. Reader's Digest articles share the author's philosophy but are usually better written and more original.

The Answer: It is cheap,it is short and it is written on a third grade level. It therefore involves very little committment of time, money or thought. It allows the average moron to proudly state to others that he just got done reading a N.Y. Times Bestseller. Of course it [is inexpensive] and took 2 hours to read but what the hell.

Having my husband die from ALS, I can only say this book adds insult to injury with its easy platitudes about enjoying life. Dying is hard and dying from ALS is even harder. It's difficult enough to endure without feeling the pressure to have the kind of saccharine epiphanies that the author callously offers. Sorry if I didn't find ALS at all ennobling.

Just as clearly, Albom is a not-so-intelligent man who coped with his teacher's illness with dim-wittedness and such a high degree of hero worship that he neglected to realize the obvious--Morrie's wise insights are not all that insightful. In fact, if you haven't said or been told them by the time you're 25, it's evident you've been a bit out of touch your whole life. This is a touching story, perhaps, but if you're expecting to learn life's greatest secrets and lessons, you'll be extremely disappointed. Sit on a bench in a nearby park and observe people--you'll gain a greater understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I, too, had heard so much about this book, and sat down to read it on a Friday night.

I wanted more about Morrie instead of the narrator/author. When I discovered that Morrie had written his own book, I wished I had not bought and read Mitch Albom's book about him. Although I have not bought/read Morrie's book yet, I would hope it's better--or at least worth the time you spend to read it, in comparison to Mitch Albom's book that should be about Morrie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder of lessons from life to often forgotten","review":"A must read book for those who have become caught up in the fast pace of today and the need to do it all and have it all today. Through his Tuesday conversations with Morrie, Mitch Albom is able to capture the messages of life shared with him by his friend and mentor. While the lessons shared through the weekly meetings are not new, the fact that they are often ignored or forgotten is what makes this book so powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"After reading \\"Tuesdays...\\" I gave it to my mother to read because she too is dying of a terminal disease.

I hate to be the one to bring you this news, but your final day is not certain. It could be today, next week, next month or not for awhile. But the day will come! God bless Morrie and his family.

This book speaks to one's heart on what and who really does matter in your life and asks you to examine what legacy you are leaving behind for your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and inspiring","review":"You can read this book in a few short hours, and it will be one of the best few hours of your life. The book is about how the author, Mitch Albom, reconnected with his favorite college professor when he accidentally came across a Nightline story about the professor, Morrie Schwartz. Morrie had contracted ALS - Lou Gehrig's disease.Albom does a wonderful job of relating his feelings for his professor and relays exactly what Morrie Schwartz wanted him to say. The book teaches you to accept what life gives you, and seek and give love, which is more important than material things.My only problem with the tome is that I am not quite sure that Albom truly believes his beloved teacher. It almost seems at times that Albom was merely reported what Morrie said, rather than agreeing with him. The book comes off as if you are supposed to believe that Morrie was able to change Albom's life, but he has not convinced me that was the case. However, it may very well help you change yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesday's with Morrie","review":"After hearing much raved reviews for this novel, I decided to give it a whirl. It turns out, this novel was one of the most inspirational novels I have ever read. Morrie Schwartz, an elderly man dying from Lou Gherig's Disease, is reunited with an old, close student of his. Morrie wakes Mitch up from his monotonous, meaningless life. Morrie teaches him lessons about life and living, as he reaches his last days. Every Tuesday Mitch makes the journey to Morrie's watching him wither away more with every visit as they discuss love, spirituality, happiness, and the other essentials in life. If you are looking for an inspiration, Mitch's story of his Tuesday's spent with Morrie is a great place to start. This book gets my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish","review":"I couldn't get interested in this book. Number one because of my own beliefs about death and heaven, just wasn't matching with that of the writer. I'm usually pretty open-minded and will at least read the whole thing. But I couldn't get myself to continune reading. Maybe I will try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This story gives a lot of food for thought. It is so well written and gives valuable insights into the problems faced by many people today as they deal with terminal illness It also gives their caregivers and family great information on what their loved one would like from them. Not everyone faced with their imminent passing is able to express themselves the way Morrie did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story...loved it!","review":"I felt as if I was sitting in the comfort of Morrie's home, surrounded by friends. Although you are not truly included in the dialogue, Mitch and Morrie make you feel engaged, as if you are a part of their talks. Morrie was Mitch's old professor but it's long after the final bell rang and Morrie has never stopped teaching. He continued to teach life lessons, like the idea that we all need to \\"love each other or die.\\" Even while battling ALS, Morrie continues to teach and he never loses his special touch. This is an interesting and worth-while memoir that demonstrates some of life's greatest lessons. By reading this we learn to love the people in our lives, and appreciate the small things. Tuesdays With Morrie has left a lasting impression on me, and I highly suggest you read it so it can do the same for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"The story is easy to read and follow.

I like Mitch Albom's style, which makes the book easy to read and understand. It is fun getting to know Morrie throughout the story. He sounds to me like a wonderful teacher and friend. I think that the book teaches some very valuable lessons of life, but it does not really teach one how to live a meaningful life, it just explains what a meaningful life is. Yet, I think that the book is a wonderful inspiration for one to work towards. It is better to know what a meaningful life is and not know how to live one than to know nothing about it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie was quite an eye-opening book.","review":"I found Tuesdsays with Morrie to be very enlightening. It presents a clear picture of what life is all about and how death should be faced. Morrie was a very inspirational character and a true philosopher of life. The book was not only entertaining but a lesson as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who ever feared death and wondered what their life could ammount to. Although it was rather short, it was to the point. The story of a friendship between a dying old man and a young man truly touches your heart. This book proves that no matter what happens in your life relationships with family and friends are most important."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book about an amazing man.","review":"Tuesdays With Morrie disappointed me for several reasons. Although Morrie Schwartz obviously has many lessons for the world, I quickly tired of hearing them in \\"fortune cookie\\" form. Albom's utter idolization of Morrie is annoying. In fact, by the time I finished reading TWM a second time I was livid with Mitch Albom marginalizing Morrie into an old man who randomly belts out a proverb.I was interested at first, but after a few chapters the lessons blur and Albom's arrogance becomes intolerable. Albom moans and whines about how much he sacrifices to visit his old professor. All I can see is how hopelessly self-centered Mitch really is. Mitch mentions how he continued to bring food to Morrie for months after Morrie stopped eating normal food. How oblivious and rude can one be?There are important lessons taught by Morrie Schwarz, lessons everyone should take to heart and teach to others. Unfortunately it appears that Mitch Albom is a very poor student."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting book for both the living and the dying","review":"As a nurse, a woman, and a friend, I found this book to be truly inspirational. The true story of one man's journey into life and another's journey into death, and how both men made the journey side by side, provides for a one-of-a kind reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesday's With Morrie","review":"This was a fast read. Sometimes we get so wrapped up in our own busy lives that we forget some of life's greatest lessons. This book helped bring me back down to earth and realize what is most important in my life. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh.","review":"The success of this book and the many gushing, syrupy reviews here just go to show how far the dumbing-down of North American society has gotten, more's the pity. Emotion is the highest good, and the reviewers who say that this book is a cut above most things out there are unwittingly revealing how gullible, mushy and anti-intellectual they really are--do they ever read anything challenging, or just pap like this? Does the book say something valuable? Is it written with talent and verve? Can we discuss it on an intellectual level? Nah, let's concentrate on all the gooey emotions it conjures up. Shame on all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"From another student of Morrie's","review":"I was also a student of Morrie Schwartz's from the late '70s into the early '80s. He was a sweet and lovely man--the kind of teacher who was more a friend than a mentor and who, I think, was always more comfortable in that less assuming role. Having known him, it is frankly hard to imagine him wanting to be anyone's \\"coach\\" and certainly not the archetype of wit and wisdom into which he has been transformed. Obviously, all of this has more to do with our yearnings than his own. As the kind of social psychologist he was, THAT would have evoked his interest--and his compassion as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn living by learning dying through morrie Schwartz' eyes","review":"This is a true story of a man's instructions for \\"packing up\\" (that which is important) before dying. From that start, he makes it obvious that these lessons about dying are the same insights that make one's life vastly more fulfilling than when one pursues material rewards.Reading this book reminded me of my commitment to \\"be my monther\\" one night in a time of personal crisis. She had died of ALS (Morrie's killer), and I was struggling to reconcile my conflict between aggression and peace. For a while I was able to \\"be\\" my loving and peaceful mother and let go of the conflict. Albom's book renewed that insight in me. I plan to re-read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" whenever I feel myself slipping back into the aggressive, material dirven assumptions about life. It always makes the world look more like the place where we want to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lessons A Must Read!!","review":"A powerful book.

I could not put this wonjderful book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Must Read","review":"The book was so awsome that i couldnt put the book down after the first page.It was interested in how Mitch and Morrie got along so well. Mitch the former studuent of morrie would go to vist Morrie on tuesdays because they were tuesday people. I think it's pretty cool how they would talk for hours about real life solutions. I found Morrie interested in he wasnt affraid to die and had no regrets. Mitch on the other hand didnt understand life as much as Morrie did. It was upsetting when Morrie found out he had Als also know as Lou Gehirg disease. The best part of the book was it didnt matter how far his disease progreesed becuase they still meet on every tuesday to talk about things in life. I would suggest this book to people who love to read books about people. I could not beleive how Mitch didnt cry till the end of the book. I guess it up to the you to read the book to found out what happens toMorrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"With dignity, with courage, with humor, with composure.","review":"This is how Morrie Shwartz described to Ted Koppel, the way he wanted to live. It seems as though Mitch Albom saw that, and so much more in his old teacher.We find Mitch at a point in his life where he is basically consumed by his career. That is, until he sees \\"Nightline\\" and it features his old professor. So, every Tuesday he visits his old teacher for one final class, to work on their final thesis. Mitch finds himself admiring the way Morrie used to dance with students, how when he was so sick he missed going for that daily swim. While Morrie would enjoy life, with observations such as, \\"Age is not a competitive issue. Think of all I can be! I am every age, up to my own.\\" With life lessons such as forgiveness, and even saying goodbye. Simple pleasures in life. That's what Morrie taught. During a period in the Vietnam war, he gave all his students A's!This isn't a book you have to think about. It is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually hugged","review":"I walked away from reading Tuesdays With Morrie in one sitting feeling as though someone had just hugged me. The life and death themes of this book refocused me on what things matter most in life. While the book is about Morrie dealing with his own death, I found it more a vibrant book about life. I did feel, however, that while the book deals with issues up to the point of death, it did not cover issues dealing with after death. This is left to the faith of the reader. I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Amusing Aardvark","review":"When you flip a book open, and the first line which catches your eye is \\"Before you learn how to live, you must learn how to die,\\" you know that poor man's psycho babble is about to spill forth and that you should quickly abandon ship.

The advice on how to live is so old and over used it might have well been dispensed from a five year old. People turn to this book in order to give meaning and significance to their lives. Yet, the keys to a happy and rewarding life can not be found in best-selling pseudo-self help books.
