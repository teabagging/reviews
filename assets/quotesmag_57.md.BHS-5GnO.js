It was hard as a rock, tasteless, and messy. I followed the instructions of boiling some milk, chopping the chocolate in my blender, and mixing it together. It came out foamy, like one reviewer described, but I was surprised to find it tasteless and flat!! I ended up adding 4 T. of my standard coco mix just so I could finish the drink.

He uses examples and software not included on the CD. So when I went to the bookstore and saw that there is new Poser 5 Handbook I looked at the examples and the software necessary to complete them and once again that are not on the CD! How do you expect someone to complete tutorials with programs they don't have, figures they don't have. If you want to really invest your time and money into Poser then this is the book for you. You can buy all the programs and extra figures necessary to complete Mr. Mortier's tutorials. A good book to get is the Poser 4 fx and design or wait till Secrets of Figure Creation in Poser 5 is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad Tutorials","review":"While this book does a fair job of describing how to use Poser, when it comes to showing you step by step examples of how to do a particular task it becomes incredibly bad. The author completely leaves out certain crucial steps leaving you to flounder around. At times he can't even get the steps in the right order. From what I have been able to ascertain the author does not appear to have any ability to write to a beginner audience nor does it appear like he wrote this book with Poser on his computer. If you are a beginner then this book is NOT for you at all. If you know Poser 4 well then you might be able to figure out what the author is trying to tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"MLA Prize","review":"I have not read this book yet, but it won the 1999 Modern Language Association Prize for Independent Scholars, a great honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book could save your life","review":"As a therapist who has specialized in dealing with mood disorders for the last 40 years, I can tell you that this book will give you the best information available today.

The story line shifted from Ardagh's personal trauma as a falsely accused traitor to the the very traitorous atmosphere of an early Irish king and his court. The end left the possibility of a reconciliation with his Sidhe brother (very small possibility!) and also was open ended enough with political struggles to envision more books following. The magic was not overblown or out of place.

All times are our times, and this story lives them, yet transcends them.

Surrendering to divine will, the search for truth and integrity, and the realization that all of the world's spiritual traditions are valid paths to God, are themes masterfully woven into the plot. This is an engaging and \\"hard to put down\\" read, which effected me profoundly and suggests some of the challenges and potential for growth that humanity will face in the new millennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inventive concept, painfully poor writing","review":"I was looking for a good novel that interpreted 21st century geopolitics from a spiritual perspective. Sai Prophecy certainly presents a promising, inventive plot that follows the spiritual growth of several generations of one family and their involvement with the three incarnations of avatar Sai Baba and key political figures. Unfortunately, the author's writing skills are not enough to pull it off, as major plot shift after plot shift occurs with little explanation or justification. I also found the author's political positions naive and irritating -- the bad guys are Arab fundamentalists who undermine the spiritual greatness of America by cutting taxes and aid to Israel! The sections dealing with Sai Baba's influence on the key players are very interesting, but the character's emotional responses to actual or near miraculous events are treated so superficially as to make one laugh. I'm still looking for a readable spiritual/political thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religion is Religion No Matter How You Cut It!","review":"I wonder if the other reviewers and I read the same book? To me this book was religion as usual. A benevolent god telling you it is an honor to suffer, be treated brutally or killed horribly, or......., all in the name of the benevolent, smiling god. Not only is it an honor to be mistreated - it is a must that you do it with a smile on your face and peace in your mind and heart. I, for one, do not find comfort in a god or gods that require suffering to attain that god's love or heaven. Being reincarnated to do this thing over and over until you get it right is just too much. I find no comfort in god(s) suffering on my behalf. I have children and I would never wish or give suffering to them. If we are children of god(s), am I supposed to take comfort in knowing that suffering is my legacy? I don't think so. What's wrong with this picture? Whatever the mystery is - it is still a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written jibberish","review":"I could not make it past the first two chapters without having to go back and reread the jacket and see if the praise written there really referred to the rubbish I had just read. This poorly written novel, trying so hard to be \\"culturally insightful\\", lacks any nuance and subtlety, particularly in its pro-Judeo-Christian, pro-Eastern spirituality slant and Islamist conspiracy plotline. This book plays on so many stereotypes it would be laughable if it weren't trying to pass itself off as legitimate literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sai Prophecy","review":"I haven't seen so much bigotry in one place in a long while. It seems that all religions are good -- EXCEPT Muslim. Muslims are bad, and are trying to take over the US. The only good Muslim, apparently, is one who has converted to Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful thinking at its best!","review":"It's an interesting story that any good Christian, Jew or Muslim would be appalled at. If Sai Baba is based on a true guru, then he sounds very much like the Antichrist. Jesus says of the end of the age, \\"For many will come in My name saying 'I am the Christ' and will deceive many.

I put it in the Tales from Avonlea \\"Beginnings\\" review section. After I realized my error, I searched for a phone number for Amazon but could not find one. I wanted to call and ask them to remove it from there.Anyway....I absolutely love the Avonlea series that Disney Channel used to have. I was very excited to learn that Disney was releasing the series in a season format.On the plus side, this Disney release does have closed captioning even though the packaging does not indicate it. Unfortunatley, the video quality is very poor and most of the episodes are edited! Also the audio was out of sync at times. (I don't know if that was just my copy).I would consider buying the seasons from Sullivan Entertainment, but they are not closed captioned which is a must have for me.If you don't mind the video quality being poor and the editing, then I think you may like the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Family Entertainment","review":"If I did not watch each and every episode at least twice I watched them at least three or four times.

When I put in the first episode tonight, I was extremely disappointed. Many important sections were cut out, including the two that explain Sara's decision as to if she is staying in Avonlea or not. As well, much of the background music is missing, which is incredibly noticeable for anyone who watched the show when it was originally on Disney channel, or who has watched the previous DVD and VHS releases of various episodes. These changes were not made known anywhere on the DVD packaging. There is no excuse for the changes made to the series, since at least some of the episodes have been previously released in their original form and quality. True fans should wait for Disney to release a \\"real\\" Season 1 set of this show, not settle for this poorly edited \\"imitation\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editted Versions of original episodes!!!","review":"I was so dissapointed when I watched the episodes on this collection.

I jumped at the chance to purchase it. That being said, as a true fan of Avonlea, I would like to share the following information for other fans as a warning. All the episodes on this set have been edited from their original form, They have been butchered. They have annoying and quick fades to blacks, and some scenes are cut abruptly. I love Avonlea I just don't understand why we must get a trimmed down version that is not complete. If this dvd set advertises itself as \\"complete\\" it should be. If Disney Plans to release the other seasons, they should include full length uncut episodes the way the show deserves to be shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Band's Best Album Ever","review":"In 1968, The Band wrote the manifesto for a revolution of simplicity with MUSIC FROM BIG PINK. The self-titled second album, however, was the revolution itself. Ignoring the excesses of psychedelia, The Band based their lyrics around the America of the late-1800s that I passed a Social Studies class about in the early 90s. Many of the themes of that course I took in school are even more present here than on the first album, either explicitly (\\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", \\"King Harvest\\") or implicitly (\\"Across The Great Divide\\", \\"Rag Mama Rag\\").

And for sure, it is not bad, and has it's merits. However, it is doubtful that this remaster was done from the true original analog master tapes, and even the liner notes are silent as to the source used, relying only on engineer Steve Huffman's name, gained through exhausting self-promotion.Sonically, it exhibits a smiley-face eq with prominent bass and a tipped up brightness on top, with elements of digititis on high transients betraying the likely DAT source. Or maybe Huffman just needs a better digital setup? Mobile Fidelity has their own, proprietary all analog tube mastering chain and only use true analog masters.Audio Fidelity should maybe use the excellent engineers of MOFI for their product. This one is good, but not enough of an upgrade over the current Capitol remaster to be worthwhile. Still sounds too digital, unlike the now defunct DCC.

It contains no useful academic information. It contains little in the way of description. It doesn't contain enough quality photographs to be considered a good coffee table book (despite its pocket size). Thank goodness I've been to Burma to see these, otherwise I might be fooled into thinking this was a useful book to own or recommend to others. Don't waste your money or time (all 35 seconds of flipping through it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"This is a book of photographs. But that is where the accuracy of the description supplied by the publisher stops. If you want a SMALL book of unclear photos, that is fine. If not, forget it. First - the titles implies you are getting photos of Buddha images - in fact there are very few of these. The blurb implies you are getting a useful and interesting work. You are not. There is no information at all on the sites and the single page of text seems to have been knocked together with no thought to context, content or purpose. You have no idea from the book itself where any of the photos were taken. This is a sad waste of effort and Shambala should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Theme--Very Poor Writing","review":"I was interested in this book because the theme is fascinating. However, I couldn't read more than 10 pages (and even that was a struggle) because the writing is so poor. As a previous reviewer commented, the writing seems childish. If you like reading good literature, I don't recommend this book. A book to consider that deals with a similar them but is superbly written is Lying Awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I just finished this book and can't recommend it enough! The fear, the trepidation of Emily/Maria Amata comes across on every page as she struggles with her committment to the Lord and the concept of forgiveness.

I read it in two days, and that was while taking care of my 3 year old and infant! I also passed it along to two others who both enjoyed it as well. Definately worth purchasing. I look forward to the author's future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful theme - dreadful writing","review":"The struggle with forgiveness which Sr Amata encounters is a deep, moving idea. Yet the writing in this book is very poor. Both the conversations and the descriptive paragraphs reminded me of a children's book. I suppose the crude vernacular the nuns employ is supposed to be natural (Marigolds? Yuck, they stink!), but I found it very trying.The author clearly tries to incorporate varied elements: showing how all nuns struggle with selfishness and weakness; caring for others in the community; the varied paths to the contemplative vocation. It does not work in a book this slender. One is left with a brief reference, but no depth.It is unfortunate that a theme which could have been very powerful is clouded by the folksy language and lack of character development. About all one knows of the main character - let alone the other nuns - is why she fears ringing the bell. The instant healing as she finally does so does not ring true, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book.","review":"This is a well-written book, which provides a generalist approach to dealing with cross-cultural issues with many excellent examples. The core idea of the book is based on the Hofstede model. One of the central criticisms of this model has been that nation state and culture are always presumed to be the same. Local culture does not follow political boundaries. The authors seem to be unable to avoid this trap.Cultural Intelligence gives good insights on how to notice \\"Cultural Cruise-Control\\" and change own way of thinking. Providing some practical tools would have added to the value of this book, but this is a good book for international managers and HR personnel involved in multicultural business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outdoes all the rest","review":"I have read countless books regarding inter-cultural communications and competence but I have to say that this is eons ahead of all others (including some by the same title). The strongest argument that the authors make here is that there are no patronising sets of rules to follow in different cultures, that one can, using an effective method and basic awareness, communicate across any culture successfully and without the aid of guidebooks and the like. In essence, this is the only book anyone will ever need on this subject...nice work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book doesn't give you a laundry list of things for each culture.

The nerdy accountant looking for love in all the wrong places, the slick evil charming villain with perfect hair and a psychotic personality, the damsel in distress. The only interesting thing in this movie was seeing Charlotte Rampling. That was interesting because if you ever wondered what a marionette's grandmother looks like--now you know, courtesy of Rampling. Charlotte on a sex date??? More like a carbon date. And yes, something you never ever saw in any other movie--just when the hero is about to be blown away by the villain, a revenge seeking woman shoots the villain from behind.

Well, start with a script so full of holes it would pass as a substitute for Swiss cheese and then add characters so incredibly one dimensional that they bore you to tears. Mix in a little passionless acting and you have a recipe for dud.There is no depth here...not in the plot or the characters or the direction. It is clear that the director was trying very hard to create a modern day noir, but without firm characters and a believable plot (we won't even go into how implausible this is), all the smoldering stares, the pretty lighting and the nerdy accountant who meets incredibly appealing (verging on homoerotic in the first 20 minutes) con artist, come off incredibly flat and uninteresting.For a really good movie on manipulation and deception and sexual tension, try \\"Apartment Zero\\" with Colin Firth and Hart Bochner, who (I kid you not) is absolutely brilliant as a charming dangerous man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deception","review":"Leave your inghibitions at the door as Hugh Jackman (X-Men Trilogy) and Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain) lure Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge) into a tangled web of lust and lies in this scorching thriller. Lonely, timid accountant Jonathan McQuarry (McGregor) lives only for his work - until a chance meeting with suave, charismnatic corporate lawyer Wyatt Bose (Jackman) introduces him to \\"The List\\". Suddenly, the right mobile phone number and the words \\"Are You Free Tonight?\\", launch Jonathan on a decadent journey of sexual conquests and self-discovery amidst New York's power elite. But an affair with a ravishing and mysterious stranger (Williams) will expose him to yet another world he never imagined: one of betrayal, treachery and murder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception is DECEPTIVE","review":"This movie starts out very promisingly and then descends quickly into B-movie territory. Unfortunately, the Producers, who include Hugh Jackman himself forget that all thrillers need good scripts and credible plots to keep going. The plot falls apart quite quickly after a nice 40 minutes, and all suspense goes with it. The premise sounds inviting, but the execution as the reviewer below me says, is lame. By the end, I couldn't fathom why these great actors were dealing with such a poor and implausible script.I realise from Woody Allen's SCOOP (also starring Jackman) that Hugh is really too nice of a guy to play a rogue or anything sinister. Ewan McGregor is in his usual form and it's a shame more couldn't have been done to give this more oomph. Mi-3 starlet Maggie Q makes a fetching cameo in this, but that's about it.Two and a half stars.PPS Amazon really needs to enable half-star ratings like Flixster"},{"rating":"2","title":"The shadows of deception....","review":"\\"Deception\\" (2008) is directed by Marcel Langenegger. The film is about an naive accountant, Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor), who finds himself immersed in the mysterious adult world of a sex club. This in turn leads him into a con game of which he was unprepared for. The film is a sultry, smoky, film noir that seduces the viewer just like Jonathan is seduced. Beautifully dark views and seamless direction lead us through a maze of encounters that reveal a subtle manipulation by Jamie Getz (Hugh Jackman). This movie deserves to be seen on blu-ray given its gorgeous images that come across like a Rembrandt painting with its rich, deep blacks, and chiaroscuro forms that are enveloped in shadows of deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't review when you don't receive the merchandise.","review":"I have had very bad luck ordering DVD's through Amazon.

I had a sense of deja vu while watching it and realized that they plot is pretty similar to \\"Bad Influence\\" starring James Spader and Rob Lowe, which was just as bad. In a nutshell - gullible geek (Ewan MacGregor) is seduced into an alternate lifestyle by charismatic baddie (Hugh Jackman) and his life is never the same when he falls for a mysterious blonde (Michelle Williams)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Twists but Terrible Ending","review":"While the movie is somewhat of a slow builder, I found that the movie was extremely predictable.

If you're looking for a clean romance novel with a Godly message tied into it (as I was), and expect to find it in this because it's a Love Inspired book, you may be disappointed.

I'd recommend this book to anyone who knows or has an autstic reletive"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for adolescents to spread awareness about autism","review":"This book was recommended to me by my writing course teacher. She knows about my son's Autism and passion for writing about special needs. It is a topic I know a lot about, am familiar with, and enjoy writing about.She was absolutely right. Rules is excellent for young adults. Different kinds of special needs are talked about in the book. Young adults treat other kids with special needs differently, and there is a real sense of what is right throughout the book, without being cheesy or over the top.Rules is a great read for kids with special needs, siblings of kids with special needs, and all young adults who are around others with special needs (which is everyone!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book for anyone to read. We are never to old to be reminded to look at things from all sides. This book helped to remind me that just because someone may not be able to communicate the same way I can doesn't mean they have nothing to say. It gave me a new look at my own childrens relationship with their autistic sister. Some times it is easy to for get that they are affected by her autism too. I also bought this book for my childrens school libraries. I would recommend this to anyone to read if they are affected by a disability or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutley Excellent","review":"It is often easy for those who write Young Adult/Juvenile fiction to make some characters overly antagonistic and others overly sympathetic. RULES, however, creates real characters who are both sympathetic and humanly annoying. I adored Catherine and her brother David. I found them both to be endearing, funny and easy to feel compassion for. Catherine's \\"rules\\" were familiar to me as a mother of a son with Asperger's Syndrome. I understood her need to keep a situation under control because it can so easily come unraveled. I loved the way the author showed how David communicates his feelings (and kids with Autism DO have feelings) through the dialogue he had gleaned from the Frog and Toad books. I truly enjoyed this book, and thank the author for doing such an excellent job in writing it. Can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Catherine's younger brother is autistic and though she loves him, she sometimes resents how difficult her life is with him in it. She wishes, for once, that her parents would think of her first and that David would just follow the simple, everyday rules of life that are obvious to everyone else. She creates a list of rules for David (No toys in the fish tank).When a new girl moves in next door, Catherine hopes that she and Kristi will become friends. Worried about how Kristi will react to David, Catherine tries to keep the two separate. Meanwhile, Catherine also develops a friendship with Jason that she hides from Kristi because he is confined to a wheelchair and can't speak.Maybe a bit predictable, but in a good way, Catherine's struggle with \\"normal\\" and finding acceptance is told with warmth and compassion, without ever feeling preachy.Newberry Honor book. Highly recommended for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crazylife for Catherine","review":"RulesBy Samantha LeahyIf you want a book you just can't put down, or a book that is just too good then Rules is the perfect book for you. Cynthia lord really put a picture in my head. I could really see how embarrassing or sad Catherine must felt for her brother David. Catherine's brother has autism,So Catherine has to make up all these rules for David to do and not to do. Through the course of the summer Catherine goes through all these crazy experiences and meets many new friends. When Catherine meets her new friends she finds out that she really has a normal life. She finally wonders what is normal. I recommend this book to people who like fun and exciting books with funny and exciting characters. If you like those types of books then Rules is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"My opinion of this book was not very good. It was extremely slow getting to the climax of the book. It took 200 pages just to get to the dance. They started talking about the dance in the middle of the book, like on page 75-100. I did not think that there was a real point to the book other than to tell you that it is hard to have a sibling with a disability. The book was also pretty boring. I can normally read a book speedily, but this book took longer because it didn't really engage me in the story. Also nothing really happened other then the main events. The whole book was basically Catherine goes to OT, next day she plays with Kristi, next day she makes words for Jason, goes and swims at pond with Kristi, makes posters for dance, then goes to Jason's party then to the dance. Even the main events were briefly described. I would probably not recommend buying or reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK EVER!","review":"I had to read this book in school. It is by far the worst book I ever read! It is so boring! Nothing happens! Cathereine goes to OT then goes to Kristi's house then she makes cards for Jason. blah blah blah etc etc ... Its so repetitive and boring. I cant belive this book has awards! If i could i would give this book ZERO stars! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!! IT IS SO BORING!!!!! If you want a good book, get the Percy Jackson series. Its really good and wont bore you to death. If you want a good book, i recomend the Percy Jackson series. Its very good and things actually happen that are exiting! I am just saying this book is very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Message","review":"Many reviews and comments have already been expressed. I am a church librarian and have this book in my library. I find that children need to understand and be exposed to many areas of life and autism is a real fact. It is not easy to be a sibling to a child with special needs; in fact it sucks! But that's life and kids that deal with the issues grow to be better adults and offer more empathy. Hurrah for author Cynthia Lord. We used this book for a book review for tweens. Great discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book!","review":"I thought this book was very well written. The book Rules is about a 12 year old girl, Catherine who has a little brother, David with autism. Throughout the book Catherine learns how to take care of her brother. Catherine makes rules for her brother since he doesn't understand things very well. For example, one of her Rules is \\"Don't put toys in the fish tank\\" and \\"Don't take your pants off in public\\". The thing I liked most about this book was seeing how people treat those with a disability. I would defiantly recommend this book to children ages 10-13. Either gender doesn't matter because it's just a great book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"RULES...Rule #1...READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Cynthia Lord has created a wonderful, endearing and entertaining story that opens up discussion for so many life lessons. Working with kids with autism, I welcome with open arms this enjoyable teaching tool. I would recommend this as required reading for kids from 4th grade all the way through 7th. I think the characters are realistic and they teach from the heart. It is a good tool for teaching kids (and adults) about taking the extra step to learn more about those around us. I loved the relationship between Catherine and Jason and enjoyed \\"watching\\" Catherine create new words for Jason which opened up his world a bit more. Kudos to Ms. Lord on her Newbery Award. Education, compassion and understanding are lessons this book offers.

It is a story about Catherine and her daily life with her brother, David, who is autistic. She loves him, takes care of him, and teaches him all kinds of rules just in case he wakes up one day and is \\"normal\\". On the other hand, she is also embarrassed by him and wants to keep him hidden from her friends.Catherine befriends Jason, a paraplegic, during one of her brothers' therapy sessions. He communicates with a book of words that Catherine eagerly adds to. The relationship between Catherine and Jason is very sweet and caring with occasional ups and downs.I really enjoyed this book, but I do believe that many of the issues the author raises would get overlooked by the younger readers. This book would be a great book for parents and younger readers to read together, it would also make a wonderful book to read as a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book, just short of a five-star rating","review":"In _Rules_, we see the struggles of our 12 y o protaganist: making friends, coping with her autistic brother, venturing into a friendship with a disabled teen. My favorite character is that teen, who most people regard as mentally disabled just because his body is disabled. It's worth reading the book just for that character, his courage, and his subtle humor.The character development in other respects is just shy of top-notch. Our heroine is likeable and really grows by the end of the story, but she seem to be over-reacting to several events. I would have liked a little more insight into the autistic brother and a little more refinement of word choice and style. Also, I was a little uncomfortable about the \\"girl-friend/boy-friend\\" aspect of the conclusion not because of the boy's disability, but because I don't think (and many, many people will disagree with me here) that 12 year olds should have boyfriends."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"No Toys in the Fish Tank\\"","review":"\\"Rules\\" is a heart warming book.

In the end, Catherine accepts David and herself for who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money !!","review":"Very deceiving!! I regret of ordering this book.

It has absolutely NO inovation, and, still worst than that, it seems to put the together all the available cliches of German power / melodic metal in just one CD. It's almost unbearable at certain parts. Of course all the musicians involved are very skillfull, but that did not save the album. THe term \\"metal opera\\" is wasted here. Trust me, it's just another power metal record: double kick drums all along, screaming vocals, hopeful lyrics, harmonic solos.

If this is cheesy, then let's not make another song with \\"I love you\\" in it, it's been done before.

Completely missing are those groovy bass lines that Migs does so well and what is left are a bunch of overly glossy diva trax that are pretty lightweight even by Naked standards.

I first heard Migs on Digitally imported and have loved all his stuff. It definatley is not a pure house album, but a fusion of chill house and sexy vocals. More of a relaxed listen than club jumper. Although some house reviews dislike this aspect, I prefer the more soothing beats and less repetative vocals. I'm a huge fan of The New Deal, who will always be a better show than any DJ, and therefor prefer them for my live experiences. However, I can't stop playing this album and am in the process of picking up more of his goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5 album of all time","review":"Back in the day I used to go to Tower Records every Tuesday to listen to new music.

I started off loving it with the hijacking, but then the farmhouse scene was boring. Then the motorcyle ranch and Carol were extremely interesting, but then once that was done, I was bored again. On top of that, there were too many questions left unanswered. I was pretty disappointed with this one but I'm still going to finish reading his collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape into Kenyatta's world","review":"Another slamming book from Donald Goines that displays his wonderful and great storytelling. He gives his readers characters that they can relate with and who they love. Readers can relate with these characters, even the ones that they hate - the dope pushers, the crooked cops, and the racism that permeates law enforcement. This is a great trip with Kenyatta, and the black/white cops that are tracking him. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at movies from the 1950's","review":"This 9\\"x12\\", 255 page, hardcover was published by Arlington House in 1989.

Each movie entry has a photo (from the movie or a publicity shot) followed by brief description. Nice eye candy, and if you're old enough to have gone to the movies in the 1950's a nice way of remembering what you'd have seen on the screen.

It is 4 strips of roughly 2\\" x 2\\" cloth, each folded diagonally and inserted into the other, with the black cardboard holding them in place. The pros of this are it does look good. When you cut or fold off the excess cardboard, it will fit in most suit jackets' breast pocket.

I bought it because I couldn't forget the haunting words on the back cover of the book that said \\"...this nun with that ardent soul whose fiery mark is left for us in her letters.\\" Once I started reading the book, I found I couldn't put it down. It's so easy to relate to Marianna, as a woman, as a seeker of love, of God, of what we all want....complete unity. This is much more than a love story, much more than love letters sent, only to be rejected. It is a story about finding our divinity in life.

The novel is based on actual love letters that were written by the nun Mariana Alcofardo. Katherine Vaz is an academic but writes pure poetry painting a vivid picture of life in Portugal during the 17th century. I learned about the food , customs,life as women and daughters of wealthy landowners and above all an intimate insight into life in a convent. As the story is set during the prolonged war with Spain the love affair itself is fascinating between Mariana( a Nun) and her french soldier. The love affair is more about Mariana's desperate and all-consuming passion, she is rightly described as the Nun who loved too much. A beautiful, beautiful story well worth reading. Something to sweep you off your feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promise forever: Love Inspired # 209","review":"~Tyler Winchester isn't the powerhouse the town's people think he is.

I didn't notice any problems, and the weird character proportioning (Geese, for example, has arms longer than his legs) seems like a superdeformed drawing style, not an error. There are only two real problems with this game, as I see it. 1) It's too short. There are plenty of characters, but the difficulty makes it easy to win every time. 2) The bosses (Billy Kane, Geese, and Krauser) are very hard. Of course, I expected this because SNK always makes hard bosses. Everything else is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disapointing...","review":"It's a 2001 dvd, so I hope the CZW product has evolved since then, because it is still a long way from being as professionnal as ECW was...

Digimon and Pokemon has the same point: Kids find little monsters with special powers. But unlike Pokemon, Digimon can actually talk!When I saw the movie, I didn't much care for the animation (and yes, its different than the TV show). The movie only makes sense if you have watched the TV show. If you haven't seen the show, the movie explains mostly everything you need to know. I would recommended anyone to watch the TV show before they see the movie however, beause the TV show was so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not better than the show","review":"Digimon the movie is a film you will definitely want to purchase if you are a fan of the digimon series (particularly the adventure 1&2). It ties up some of the gap that happened between the two seasons. The film is divided into three stories and narrated by Kari to bring them all together as one. The only negative aspect of this is that the film suffers from mediocre animation since it was compiled from the original japanese movies that were made before the first season began. All-in-all a good movie for kids or fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Product package was is awesome condition. Movie played with no issues. Arrived as described, in about a week.

Friendship, loyalty, and true caring are just a few that I have seen over and over again. In my mind it has made Digimon a hands down choice for me. I love to watch it again and again with my siblings. My dad may not be too wowed by it but the rest of us still love to laugh at the humor and get sucked into the action. In fact they've been begging me to let them watch it again. I finally made the switch from my VHS copy to the DVD and I can't wait to see some of the new menu's and features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainly For Digimon Fans","review":"I enjoyed this movies being a Digimon fan. If you don't know much about Digimon in the first place, this will be a very confusing movie. It's 3 compressed Japanese films so it skips through the backstory of the digi-destined and how they got there digimon partners, how both the new and second teams met, etc. They basically tried to put together the story of Willis, Kokomon, and the virus. Also, the anime in this movie is more like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon, which is a different style of anime from the one on the Digimon show. The DVD doesn't have many extra features, just a Len music video and the movie trailer with other basic DVD options. Unless you're a big fan (which I am :), I'd just rent it. Oh, and I would've liked if they made a compressed version of the 1st and 2nd movie from Japan and then released the whole 3rd version seperately. Would've made for MUCH better movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW !! ITS DIGITASTIC","review":"Digimon was the best movie that I have ever seen. It has an awsome plot and characters.

Very... animation for an anime movie. The animation is even better on the digimon show,the digimon movie is even worse then the digimon show. This is also a big copy of the Pokemon movies that really failed. Also when there's sad parts the digidestined act all emotinal and start crying when it's not sad. It just makes me crack up when those stupid,cruddy sad parts. I mean the digivolving is so lame cause it just wastes time on the digimon show and the digimon movie and then the digimon turn into cruddy baby digimon after they digivolve and battle. The pokemon evolution is very correct and the pokemon don't dumbly de-evolve. It's a cheap rip-off and it's waste of time seeing it. I TOTALLY DESPISE DIGIMON!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digimon The Movie review","review":"The animation is awful. The story is just 3 different movies \\"taped\\" together with little-to-no connection with each other. The jokes are dumb. The cast is bland at best. The 1990's soundtrack has little-to-nothing with the movie too. The exposition is poor at best. The pace and emotions are rushed. Even the action scenes get boring after awhile because there soo many of them. Worst of all,it has no morale. Overall,This is worse then Pokemon the First Movie. At least Pokemon's movie had a morale. Even though it was a hypocritical morale. I give this movie a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take my advice....","review":"...Don't even rent this peice of crap. It's sooooo dissappointing, cause the show is really good. but the movie sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit disappointing...","review":"While this movie had its merits, it was overall disappointing.What the dubbers did was combine three completely unrelated thirty-minute movies into one long, drawn-out movie with a strange sense of pacing, and a confusing plot that will make even the biggest Digi fan's head spin.That said, I did really enjoy Chocomon and Gummimom's story, it was quite creepy. The fight scene was pretty cool, though I think that the animators don't really utilize very interesting camera angles or vary the perspective, which makes the animation seem a little boring.Oh, and one more thing that I thought was really quite unneccesary was the \\"Angela Anaconda\\" short at the beginning- very bizarre, and most unfunny."},{"rating":"2","title":"10x better than the TV show","review":"Frankly, the TV show gets annoying. But I rented this movie just to check it out and let me tell you I was not disappointed. The movie is much better than the TV show in every way! The effects are cool (I wish the movie was in widescreen so we wouldn't have to sit through poorly mastered fullscreen transfers) and the multiple storyline will keep you interested for more than 90 minutes! The soundtrack is really good too, mostly filled with pop punk rock (unlike Pokemon, which got stuck with the pop soundtrack) and ska. If you just want to see a good kids anime movie, check this out. People should watch it with no expectations. Just watch it and enjoy it. Get the DVD though because DVD is just cooler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This movie is great!! I don't care what others say, I really like it, The first part when it was 8 years ago, I thought it was a trifle weird, but it was cool. I liked the second story best since it was cool when Metalgarurumon and Wargreymon digivolved together into Omnimon (or Omegemon, call it what you like). The third part was also really cool when Patamon and Gatomon Warp-digivolved into Seraphimon and Magnadramon.

The character animation is a bit odd- they all look a bit wobbly round the edges- that is, the character design is not a bold and clearly defined as in the series. Overall, it was visually and narritively interesting. However, as the review title may suggest, this is not one movie. Originally in Japan, 3 films were released- a short 20 minute flashback sequence and two full length features. For that reason, I'm giving this 2 stars- I hate it when the West rewrites scripts and cuts shows or movies to RIBBONS, and although I haven't seen the originals you can bet your bottom dollar there's been alot removed."},{"rating":"2","title":"transported to Heaven","review":"This cd is amazing!

Altogether a wonderful compilation of her thoughts and emotions, Debut is one of my favorite CDs, right behind Post."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop in its prime!","review":"It took Bjork long enough to rise out of The Sugarcubes, whose music her phenomenal voice constantly transcended. However, her experience at the cutting edge of \\"pop\\" seasoned her for this unprecedented breakthrough, which with the collaboration of Nellee Hooper piles on the layers of complex, original, and very satisfying musical arragements.This is also Bjork at her most melodic, with \\"Human Behavior,\\" \\"Big Time Snesuality,\\" \\"Venus as a Boy,\\" and \\"Aeroplane\\" being lively, very catchy but well-written pop songs. \\"Come to Me\\" and \\"Human Behavior\\" delve into a more ambient range, effectively avoiding the sugar high some songs might induce.However, what helped to ensure that this \\"Debut\\" would lead to bigger and better was the earthly charm and beauty that Bjork's voice could evoke without the heavy arragment with the simple, dreamy \\"Like Someone in Love\\" and the droll, breathtaking \\"Anchor Song.\\" A must for anyone who loves to come alive with music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"This is considered one of the best electronic records of the early 90\`s and one of Bjork\`s essential albums. While it is innovative in some moments, parts of it already sound dated today, and a lot of songs aren\`t all that interesting to begin with and turn out to be a bit irritating. Bjork sings in an unique way, no doubt, but it doesn\`t mean that she\`s always nice to listen to. A few good tracks appear here and there, such as the opener \\"Human Behaviour\\", the atmospheric \\"One Day\\" or the ethereal \\"Come To Me\\". Still, as a whole this debut is too uneven to recommend even if it is a somewhat curious album. It\`s follow-up \\"Post\\" is a more well accomplished effort, this is just a fashionable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking","review":"Her voice is a little miracle The music is modern and every song sounds different The text is not complicated, it's creative and honest She gives the impression of having a great personality, I admire her work"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could i not see!","review":"Being a fan of Bjork for about 2 years now (after seeing her on a concert on TV which was unbelievable) i bought Telgegram, thinking it was an 'actual' album. Telegram didn't appeal much to me, so I waited awhile and just popped it in one day. It was unbelievable, then i bought Homogenic, Post and finally Debut. When I first heard debut I liked 'Human Behaviour', 'Venus as a boy' and other songs but i thought it was too techno-ish (i never liked techno, i like aphex-twin and squarepusher type stuff) but upon listening to it again i realized..IT'S AMAZING. The ballads are unbelievably beautiful, and if you have the bonus track 'Play dead' on your CD, It's one of her best songs (if not, try getting the young americans soundtrack of which it's on) I really like 'come to me', 'one day', and every song. Except 'anchor song' will take awhile to grow on me. Tori, Bjork, Pj Harvey are the most amazing women of the 90's i'd say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork Bjork Bjork Bjork..etc","review":"Progressive dance music mixed with jazz, and Bjork's startling, unique voice is what makes up this masterpiece. Bjork is one of the most innovative, one of a kind artists in existant. She has no fear in what she does; shes brave in trying new things. This CD starts out with Human Behavior, which has one of the catchiest drum beats i've heard. After this single, more happy songs come up, then a quiet harpsichord/vocal song. It is hard for one to like Bjork upon first listening to her; she is definatley an aqquired taste. The more I listen to her, the more I love her. This record is brilliant for the first solo album of hers; and trust me, they just get better and better. So be like me and LOVE BJORK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning \\"Debut\\"","review":"Although she had been in the Sugarcubes and had actually released her first solo album in Iceland as a child, \\"Debut\\" is what really introduced Bjork to the world as an adult solo artist. Of all her albums so far, this one is still the most dance floor friendly and probably the most commercial. But Bjork's incredibly expressive and unique voice and experimental spirit elevated this CD way beyond generic mid-90's dance music fluff. With \\"Debut\\", Bjork emerged as an intelligent, intuitive, erotic and often jubilant musical talent. Highlights include the exotic \\"Human Behaviour\\", the playful \\"There's More to Life Than This\\", the ecstatic \\"Violently Happy\\", and the slightly melancholy \\"Anchor Song\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avante pop","review":"As we all know, Bjork became very popular following the end of The Sugar cubes. This first solo album walks a fine line between a slightly interesting listen to overall irritation. Musicaly Debut offers some wierd dance-pop tunes - not bad at all in some spots - Venus as a boy sounds like something from the far side of Neptune. What keeps this album down all the way is Bjorks constant misuse and abuse of her vocal capacity. The majority of the songs contain screeching and yelling. This really grates my nerves. Many singers know their vocal limits, but it seems that Bjork is indifferent. Oddly enough, this seems to be a major selling point to her fans.Recommended for those who like a certain wackiness to their dance music."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.......","review":"I hate to give a two star review, but this album doesn't make much sense to me. After buying her brilliant, flawless, amazing album \\"Post\\", I figured this would be really good too. The album's not bad, it's just blah. There are some good songs, but most of them are dull. I'm sorry bjork! Some of the pop dancy-ish songs are good, and the first song is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"All I have to say is Debut is the best album ever created. Just listen to the songs and see how brilliant it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Björk portrays the Reykjavík club experience","review":"Listening to this album, I am reminded of a Saturday night I spent in Reykjavík, which is, of course, Björk's home town.It's a rowdy, sensual place, full of excitement, skimpily-dressed girls, and gorgeous icy-blonde men. Everyone's out to have fun, and this album definitely does that.When I hear \\"There's More to Life than This\\", and she exhorts the listener to \\"sneak down to the harbor\\", I think of the throngs of clubbers I saw near Reykjavík's harbor, which is close to the club district. She speaks from experience!Parts of \\"Debut\\" are slow, but all in all it is a vivacious, fun album by a very talented musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork's best","review":"Absolutely essential! A great solo record. Club hits \\"There's More to Life Than This\\" \\"Big Time Sensuality\\" and oddities \\"Like Someone In Love\\" and the saxophonic \\"Anchor Song\\" make it my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT pop music.","review":"This album is the definitive answer to pop music. It has a little of everything, from great techno beats like Big Time Sensuality (one of the best feel good songs ever!!!), and Violently Happy, to the beautiful ballads like One Day and Come to Me (a must for those romantics out there). Debut is just damn good pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique vocals and great music","review":"Love this album. Was a Sugarcubes fan and a bit nervous about this one, as many \\"solo\\" albums just don't have the magic that the group albums do, but this one is definitely the exception to the rule. A fun album and one that is great from beginning to end, in my opinion. Good showcase of Bjork's unique voice. Some cool club tunes, too.I think this is the very best Bjork album. It captures the raw energy of her talent and the production is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The little pixie that could","review":"No one sounded like this little Icelandic chanteuse with the captivating voice, and strange but tuneful melodies, when she left the Sugarcubes and ventured on with this enchanting solo album... One minute churning out irresistible dance anthems like 'Big Time Sensuality' and 'Violently Happy', and next dropping the beat to a silently addictive 'Venus As A Boy', and then haunting us with her arresting wails on 'Human Behavior' ... disturbingly sweet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork's best","review":"This album is classic, one of the best techno/dance albums ever and certainly Bjork's best. She manages to be unique and original with arrangements, but still have wonderful, catchy melodies. This is an essential album for any Bjork fan, or music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary listening.","review":"\\"Human Behaviour\\" was the first time I'd ever heard this woman's voice. Thank God for that happenstance. This LP folds you within it and you become one with the fibers contained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork's best album.","review":"This is Bjork's first and best album. It's so diverse, with great club songs and beautiful slow ones too. Her other albums are great too but Debut is my fave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Disco","review":"For all the talk of Bjork's experimentation and how \\"cutting-edge\\" she is, this album just sounds like disco to me. Manufactured beyond belief. You know, let's hire some trendy producers to make beats and then have this cute, kinda funny looking foreign girl with a weird (read as: annoying) voice sing over them. Future Bjork albums would improve on this formula (mostly by masking it in a faux \\"dark\\" atmosphere) but Bjork's music is still basically hollow. If you like techno, you might appreciate some of the tracks here, but after a while, this just sounds like Gloria Gaynor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man she scares the crap out of me!","review":"She just does, okay. She looks like an image from one of Marilyn Manson's videos, and I don't mean that as a compliment.I kind of wish she had never released a debut album, because without a debut album, her career would never have gotten started. She is the opposite of good. Therfore, she is bad, untalented, annoying, and untalented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and Utter Garbage","review":"I have never heard such a pile of nonsense in my life. If Bjork were not the darling of the arts and croissants crowd, she would be waiting tables in a sulfur reeking diner somewhere in Reykjavik. Save your money and buy a real record."},{"rating":"2","title":"0","review":"Beethoven used to respond to critics who didn't think highly of his work by saying, \\"My music is for a later age.\\" I think Bjork could say the same thing to hers. I pulled out this CD after not having heard it in 4 or 5 years and can honestly say, it sounds as fresh and original now as it did when it was first released in '93. I felt like I was listening to it for the first time again and had discovered something new. What makes this recording so timeless is that Bjork is able to take seemingly different musical ideas and moods and make them make sense together. And while it's not always pretty, it's obvious she's more concerned with truth. Bjork's music contains the original energy of joy and her startling and wonderfully expressive voice is a gift to all of us mere humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"I purchased this scrubs set for my 2 year old for Halloween, the pants were a little big but they were great quality and looked very authentic.

Its smart, savvy storyline has a unique depth to it: many of the situations (including the main plot) are directly from ancient Japanese legends. The characters, even though their initial roots are buried in the pit of cliche, are presented in a logical and sensible approach. The violence, which is most intense during the first two episodes, tends to be well-drawn and realistic. There's also something behind the gun-and-kill approach: most situations are not cleared easily by Kome's bazooka. It takes some thinking, which is missing in all but few of today's cartoons. An excellent series for anyone mature enough to handle brief nudity and realistic \\"violence\\", it provides quality viewing. Make sure you don't pass up on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TAC V.S. Aragami","review":"The story, animation and character voices are all very well done, any anime fan would probebly want to see this one. The volume gives a brief recolection of what has happened and then later onfolds the plot of the race of the Aragami, a brood of creatures that have been trying to destroy Japan for 1000s of years. All in all I think this one was a good anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a toy","review":"i got this for christmas and it didnt work i couldnt get it to work ...when i did i did two stiches and i had to redo the thread.i cant believe how they can sell such a toy.i might be young but listen up THIS DOES NOT WORK. dont waste money on a cheap piece of plastic. buy a needle,thread,and fabric and hand sew,it would cost less and would take less accembile"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"There is no better book that I have read on the theory and practice of theatre. As Peter Brook says in the preface, \\"Grotowski is unique. Why? Because no-one else in the world, to my knowledge, no-one since Stanislavsky, has investigated the nature of acting, its phenomenon, its meaning, the nature and science of its mental-physical-emotional processes as deeply and completely as Grotowski.\\"Grotowski argues effectively that the split of the stage and the screen necessitates that the stage redefine its focus. The screen with its higher budget and countless retakes will always beat the stage in richness. So, Grotowski posits \\"If it [the stage] cannot be richer than the cinema, then let it be poor.\\" The rest of the book illustrates what such a poor theatre means in practice. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"This set needs a dose of Spinach!","review":"After only a few days, Popeye's head fell completely off. And my children were not especially rough with the toy - they basically had the Popeye gang living in the doll house. It appears to just be a design flaw, the thin neck on the Popeye figure cannot support the big head.Considering the inexplicable dearth of Popeye toys out there, I was really hoping this set would be a winner. But with the main character's head falling off after only a few days of moderate play (and Gorilla brand super glue was of no avail), I have to urge folks to avoid these toys. It just leads to more grief, especially with younger kids who get attached to the toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything in one movie!","review":"I don't like to off-handedly rate anything five stars as it cheapens a rating system.

The only reason it gets ONE star is that Amazon does not allow awarding ZERO stars. If you enjoy watching tiresomely bad acting, cheap effects and costumes, then go ahead and waste your money on this film. The ONLY redeeming feature of the DVD is the commentary, and that is only because they discuss some of the sets and locations used. None of the information about the movie itself is worth remembering for more than ten seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spoof of Sifi / Monster Flicks","review":"If you've seen old SiFi / Monster flicks, you will enjoy this campy, cheesy effort by a good cast trying to act badly.

Blamire and his troupe of legitimate and canny acting professionals (no, you can't just wing this stuff; you have to know HOW it was originally done and WHY it descends to us as quaint and quirky) keenly understand the faux-conviction that informs those old films and renders them so naively charming today. These talented people take the cheesy tropes over the edge, make you blink in disbelief, and then establish a new edge. Cheaply.Those kitsch-meisters of the '50s might have gazed forward with their atom-powered crystal balls, watched Blamire's movies, and actually learned something from them. I'm not sure what. But surely it must be up there on the screen... somewhere?All hail, to pseudo-scientists everywhere! This film is like your high-school physics lab, on nitrous oxide. Freaky-wise entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Homage to B-Movies Ever","review":"This movie was just plain fun on so many levels. The bad dialog, the over acted acting, cheesy effects. Some might think of it as an ordinary b-movie but it's a clever homage to them. It plays it straight and never let's on that it doesn't take itself seriously. It will have your eyes watering and sides hurting from laughing so hard. And since it was made for $40,000 it shows it's just more than an homage. It shows you don't have to have a giantic budget to make an entertaining film today! I can't wait to get this one on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie ever written/directed/starred in.","review":"Larry Blamire wrote, directed and starred in this homage to black and white B sci-fi/horror movies. The humor is clever, quick and alternates between dry and slapstick. The cast is phenomenal, the props will crack you up and every line in the movie is super-quotable and easy to work into everyday conversation.I've spent a decent amount of time showing this movie to people who've never seen it, and I've never had anyone dislike it.

A Lame atempt to recreat old style scifi movies of the 50's. The Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes. does a better job of recreation of 50,s type scifi movies.

Instead of the 1950's style over-the-top, over dramatic acting, these guys opted for just plain bad acting.

Now, as an Integrative Life Coach focusing on Debbie's work in the Spiritual Divorce and Divine Blueprint models, I am deeply moved to be guiding others to having their own breakthroughs and healing, and begin to create lives they love.

Ironically, I discovered this book from the Afterword of another book \`Individual Power' where the author shared how much this book helped her. What a wonderful gift this brought to me!The Dark Side of the Light Chasers helped me learn how to embrace those aspects within that I did not \`own' but viewed as \`wrong.' Through this wonderful book, I was able to discover the good behind the so-called \`bad'.

I recommend this book highly, especially to people who care about personal development."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those books you have to eread","review":"I bought this book years ago when I saw Debbie Ford on Oprah. For whatever reason, I never read it. Recently, I was Debbie's new movie \\"Shadow Effect\\" and was so moved by it that I went back and read this book. Woe. I can't help but think if I read this book years ago I might be a different person today. For me, my issue has always been that I judgmental. I didn't want to be this way, but had no idea how to stop. After reading this book, I felt such relief as I learn how to have an awareness of my dark side and then how to see it can actually be a benefit to me and I don't have to continue beating myself up for being who I am.I know \\"shadow work\\" was originated by Carl Jung and other people such as Ken Wilber have written about it, but I feel, for someone who is just starting on exploring their shadow this, by far, is the best book you can read to begin the exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my life forever!","review":"This book has been the greatest eye opener for me it's taken me to the depths of my soul.

It's about accepting all your qualities and seeing them in others so you can accept the world as it is, and more,it taps into your subconscious so you can see truth clearly. I could go on. I had to buy a new copy, my old one is so beat up. It's just one of many books I believe that can change the world we live in for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"A repeat of numerous books and seminars on the subject.

How often have we all been misled by simplistic systems like the author promotes, that are hollow by nature?Reader, God has plans for you, plans to build you, not tear you down, plans to give you life, and a future. Turn back from the circular path of chasing your own tail. Seek peace, not as the world gives peace, but as God gives peace; the peace that passes all understanding. I wish you luck and eventual joy in your search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for people with low self esteem.","review":"This book was one of the biggest wastes of my time as far as 'self help' books are concerned. I would never recommend it to anyone, especially someone with low self esteem.\\"So when we've had it with our friend, colleague, or sibling, it's because he or she is giving voice to parts of us that we have suppressed of rejected, parts of us that don't fit the persona we've created to present to the rest of the world.\\"Pure rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting to the Point","review":"I think this book has a good idea about facing your shadow, but it can be said in fewer words, maybe twenty pages instead of 179, with a list of the most effective exercises. What I dislike about a lot of these self-help books is they contain a lot of filler. And they all have that same style which you can almost predict. The authors would serve the reader and the book much better if they just got to the point and left a lot of the stories out. But I guess they have to fill the requirements of the publisher.I think more effective, is a book written with creativity and brevity. Books written by Chinese ancients come to mind. The ideas stick with you much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One More California Guru...One More Psychological Diet...","review":"When are we average people going to stop letting self-help gurus like this author cheat us out of our hard-earned money? I read the book with somewhat low expectations, and I was not disappointed!Maybe I'm completely out of touch with the rest of the world (i.e. California), but I hear one more Self-help Guru telling me that if I follow her psychological diet of nutritious nuggets I will shed the cumbersome load of stagnant mental sludge. She has some nice ideas but they are neither original or practical. I hear a hundred other psychoanalytical prophets speaking through her words.

You have to be carefull and evaluate before if that specific person is emotionally strong to ACCEPT that she/he is stupid or useless!It can trully help or trully damage.And, something that caught my attention, is that Debbie Ford doenst have ANY professional trainment, she calls herself a \\"healer\\", yeah, but sometimes attending to the university might help, u know what I mean?If she is professionally cualified, she should mention it, otherwise she could be taken as a fraud.C.A.G.Psychologist"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worse books I've struggled to read","review":"This book is pure new age semantic babble. this book is a waste of the paper it's printed on.

I cannot say enough about this book! Thanks to this book, I feel I can really see the positive and negative sides of myself.I am using it to figure out how to get rid of the clutter in my life and embrace the simple beauty of it all. Another book that is really helping me now is 'The Ever-Transcending Spirit' by Toru Sato.

Centering on a released rapist (Ontkean) who resides in a rural town, the script does a good job of trying to see the situation from various points of view--that of the convicted felon, the parole officer, the neighbors. The tale holds your interest and makes you think. It's not heavy on the melodrama, but instead gives the serious nature of the story room to breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Movie I ordered!","review":"They sent me the wrong movie!

One of the fiercest, funniest, most provocative playwrights the English language has ever known, he nonetheless remains little more than obscure in the U.S. This collection of essays are his thoughts on theatre and his own work. Firmly Nietzschean in his thought, Barker gleefully and convincingly rips conventioanl liberal and conserative pieties to shreds. And he exposes the moral and artistic bankruptcy of our current, naturalistic theatre. Barker is convinced he's oppressed (poor baby, he's been scorned by the National Theatre, relegated to those backwaters, the Royal Shakespeare Company and The Royal Court, among others) and that he's a genius. But don't take his word for it. Do yourself and those around you who love theatre a favor and read his plays, starting with his Collected Plays, Volume 1. I started reading Barker eight years ago, and I'm still blown away each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't what you think it is...","review":"Plain and simple, if you're looking for the French film \\"La Haine\\" a.k.a. \\"Hate\\" (forgive me if i've misspelled the french version), THIS AIN'T IT.

If you're looking for a good pen, skip this one. Everything in this pen is plastic, and it feels absolutely cheap. I have a more expensive one, and it is amazing; I just ended up giving this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!!","review":"These pens arrived in a padded envelope on a hot summer day. I opened the package to remove the pens, only to find my hands covered in goo! Initially I thought that the grip material had melted in the heat of my mailbox, but after reading the other reviews here it seems that is not the case. I'm going to try to wash them, but as of now they are unusable because of the gooey/greasy residue they leave on whatever touches them. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps \\"closing\\" by accident, very irritating","review":"I handwrite a lot for work and I write fast. This pen doesn't keep up. I think the design is flawed. Where you twist the pen to open and close it is too close to where you grip it to write, so it keeps twisting closed while I'm trying to write. It's very irritating.I've had other Sensa pens (granted, they cost way more than this one), where the twist mechanism is at the very top of the pen and that's a way better design because it won't twist closed when you write. I cannot use this pen for anything more than short notes, grocery lists, etc. It doesn't serve the purpose for writing a lot or writing fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky gooey pen","review":"I have an old Sensa pen I bought close to 15 years ago that I love. When I found out Sensa pens weren't being made any more and I saw these on Amazon for such a low price I ordered 2. When I received them they both seemed to be leaking a gooey substance from the gel grip. I couldn't wash this substance off of the pens and it made the pens unusable. There is no stickiness at all with my old Sensa. I returned them both for a refund from Amazon. At least Amazon returns are easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Very Sticky Grip","review":"After spending about 10 minutes trying to unwrap the 2 pens I bought, I was very disappointed in the grip being so sticky. I tried washing it off and that didn't work. I question the authenticity of this pen and I am very disappointed in these overall. I even questioned whether or not these were used. Overall, I will probably just throw them in the junk drawer and shop elsewhere for a quality Sensa pen and seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected...","review":"I heard that's these pens are really nice to have, so I figured that I would buy one and try it out.

I have no idea how someone could justify spend any amount of dollars on this pen, or even cents for that matter. Just like the rest of the reviewers, I received my pens covered in \\"gel\\" with an accompanying letter explaining it was deliberate and done in hopes that I would enjoy it? That has got to be the lamest excuse from a company for a mix-up like this. I am extremely unsatisfied with my purchase even though I paid notably less for my pens from a site other than Amazon. I can only be upset with myself for buying from a site with an unreliable return policy and horrible customer service (tanga.com)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy","review":"Great comfy pen.

There is no other pen like it on the market, and, sadly, I believe it is no longer in production. A great pity.

But the 'tongue-in-cheek' approach of the series soon grew on me.The marvellous scenery including lovely, (often) scantily-clad ladies are a bonus. The references to modern-day practices such as business marketing are funny and bring to mind the approach taken in the Asterix series of comic books. The fights are of the 'sock, pow' variety and frequently end up with a whole barbeing demolished. Kevin Sorbo makes a charismatic Hercules andhas obvious appeal to the ladies (my wife thinks he's a hunk).I bought this on special and it's well worth the price.

For example, it covers topics like choosing matte or glossy paper. Even photographers who use film have already encountered such choices. There is a light touch on calibrating a monitor and profiling printers, using online photo printing services and setting up your own photo web site. Anyone who subscribes to a photo magazine has likely encountered all of the same information before. Similarly, a simple web search on any specific topic will produce more detail than the book conveys.

It has a mixture of it and poppier rock. But quo does great pop rock so that is not a problem, the band was still riding high and at their peak in many ways here. Fans of the harder rocking releases will like this one less than what came earlier perhaps but it's still a dynamic and fun release with several big hit singles on it. IN fact most quo cd's had several big hit singles on them! which is a awesome accomplishment. THis is still a strong cd with not a bad song on it unlike their 1983-2000 era of discs. (which still had lots of good songs but were often way too poppy). This is alot better though even the poppier songs have a rockier edge; songs like 'baby boy' could be a pop hit even today probably. The title song was taken from john fogerty who had a excellent release a few years earlier with it. That cd is worth owning too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too hard","review":"This game is so hard it takes away any fun.

On my previous XBox, I owned PGR1 and PGR2 and when I got my XBox 360, I bought PGR4. By far PGR2 and PGR3 are the best. Project Gotham Racing 3 just failed in terms of graphics and concept and if you ask me, the graphics for PGR3 are just as great as the graphics for PGR1 and generally that would be good but considering PGR1 came out in 2001, it is not a compliment.

Feels like it's from 2005","review":"Odd physics, clunky racing, random drifting, hit-wall-spin-out-lose-three-place-last-lap style races, crappy car selection... Overall, I played the game for about 45 minutes before I got bored and frustrated. Remember Need for Speed Underground? Drifting was great there and well executed however unrealistic as it was. Forza just took drifting out all together and made the rest of the game flawless. PGR tried to do both with allowing you to pull off moves, but did it poorly. You either break hard, not at all, early (causing you to understeer into a wall) or late (causing you to slide careening into a wall). Slow acceleration of any of the cars in the game makes it pretty boring. Like I said, about 30-45 minutes worth of gametime before you put it down for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game if you're looking for a good racer.","review":"Project Gotham is one of the better racing games out there today. PGR3 is a pretty good instalment into the franchise. The high-def graphics are amazing, and the cars are extremely realistic. The only gripe I have with this game is the repetitive career mode where you continually do the same thing over and over. Other than that, it's a very solid game. My geuss is PGR4 will be better.If you like racing games, you should also check out Forza Motorsport 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"i bought this for someone else, and they played it a lot, and actually got pretty far in the game consider it was their first racing game.

I liked this table because of the chalkboard and paper roll feature. The table is a good size with 2 benches for children. The only problem with the table was that when I was putting it together two of the bolts that you screw the legs into were not soldered to the frame plates. I had to unscrew the 2 plates and then first screw the chair legs into the bolts and then re screw on the plates. It took some figuring out but eventually I got it all put together. I recommend Alex to use a better quality inspection team upon manufacturing. Obviously this was overlooked. Most people probably would have returned this item as faulty. Overall however this product is a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try, Don't Buy!","review":"We ordered this table and were so happy to get it. Cute, functional, all seemed well! The art paper and the cups were just perfect. However, after a few weeks, the legs on the seats started getting loose. The same thing followed with the table. We thought at first we had over stripped them and bought our own hardware to fix up. Same problem happened again. We returned the table to get another just like it and the same thing happened. If you look close at the table and seats, you will note that the legs all enter at an angle, but only a simple metal plate helps secure them (no reinforcement). We think this is the problem. It is a great thought, but we returned for our money back and are looking for the same idea without the angles that seem to cause the problem..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great, But Didn't Fit Together","review":"The table looks great and my son loves it, but not all the parts fit together. My son and I had lots of fun putting it together until we got to the read paper role holders that screw on underneath the table. One of them doesn't line up with the screw holes in the table. I'm going to have to get a power screwdriver and try to just screw it into the wood directly. Hopefully it doesn't damage the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken!","review":"The art table arrived with the wood on the side broken. When I called amazon, they said that we'd have to disassemble it, obtain a box and re-pack it, and be home to coordinate a pick-up from UPS to obtain a credit. That creates an unreasonable amount of work for us to a solve a problem that is not our fault! Amazon should stand by their products, stand by their (many) outside vendors, and send us a new table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great table for toddlers","review":"My two year old daughter loves this table and bench set. The benches are wide enough that my husband or I can sit down next to her to draw with her. She will sit and draw for a while at this table, and loves to hide things in the cups and pocket that are included. The paper roll is hidden underneath, and the paper cutter on top is safe and effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"This watch looks beautiful and it is quiet and precise. Also, it is pretty thin and comfortable. It would be perfect if there were no two issues:1. It stopped working after two weeks. I suspected battery, so had a little trouble opening the watch.This is what you need to do: Find small opening between the lid and the body of the watch. Use very sharp knife or small flat screwdriver (that you can use to tighten sunglasses) and open. If you do not find this small hole, there is no way to open it. BTW, battery is hard to find in electronic or pharmacy stores. After I replaced it, it works just fine. The original battery was Sony, but it is possible that the watch was in a warehouse in the box for a year or two before it was shipped to me.2. Another concern is the knob on the side that is a little long and may rub the skin on your hand.I recommend this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, not so good product","review":"This little pan is what I wanted in terms of size and price, but the nonstick surface proved to be very thin and fragile.

It's obvious the author is in love with his main character - who is a true work of fiction, by the way. And the only sex scene the author can muster is gruesome S&M.;I can't believe the author is a supposed journalist.

The only information that is not provided in the book is how and where to modify the pattern to make is fit someone that does not have her size.

And for the price, it is a great bargain. Do yourself a favor, join the Half Japanese Revolution and start a fire in the sky. And for all the Velvet Underground fans out there this was produced by VU drummer Moe Tucker who also contributes guitar and drums to several tracks.

I switched to the perfect serrated round ravioli cutter to make my ravioli by hand.

On a technical note, the DVD lacks any scene selection, forcing you to use fast forward/reverse to get to any place on the disk.

The grainy black-and-white effectively highlights the dreary, bleak nature of these characters' lives. But the acting isn't so hot, and neither is the script.

Also, rather than a shiny appearance I am accustomed to, these forks have more of a brushed metal appearance.All in all these are a good product, but not as high end as I expected. But then, that is my mistake as the price is appropriate. These are a great value for the price.Note: Something I had not anticipated, is that 3-tined forks since they have greater spaces than 4-tined forks, will drop through the silverware tray on your dishwasher to at least 1/3 to 1/2 length of the tine.

Like if you're awakening. People, to be honest... this album totally worths each penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Americana with loads of reverb","review":"Wow, this is pretty. If one had to assign a genre here, \\"instrumental atmospheric post-rock\\" might do. Heavily delayed and effected guitars form soothing soundscapes, with low-key bass and drums accompaniment. Occasionally female vocals (mixed way back a la My Bloody Valentine) and cello add color. Some musical reference points might be the Cocteau Twins or the Verve's first album as covered by Bill Frisell. Like Frisell, Hammock expertly convey the quiet openness of rural America, though with fewer quirks and more bliss. Despite the stubbornly diatonic harmonies, there is much skill and subtlety here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2005: Great to relax and meditate, hypnotizing","review":"If you can imagine of a music gentle enough to swing you into a deep and relaxing sleep, along with the breeze blowing in your face, you can imagine how Hammock's \\"Kenotic\\" is. Hammock's production comes in as a blend that borders ambient and post-rock very subtly, almost not wanting to be one or the other. What really matters is that their sound can be as soothing as Tristeza's or The Album Leaf's, and as symbolic and obscure as Sigur Ros' at times. The end result is one of those albums you can listen to over and over again, without noticing the pass of time... like watching the clouds pass by. I've found it to be great to relax and meditate, so it's certainly turned into one of my favorites in 2005 so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reflection","review":"The Stations for Teens was a great source for the youth group and provided an excellent way to reflect on the Passion and Death of Christ.

Rod Paterson's flawless voice and vocals. Beautiful arrangements. Does it get any better than this? No. It does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTLY HORRID!","review":"This CD by Peabody Myers is the most HORRIBLE cd that I have ever purchased! All of the songs lack creativity. I strongly advise you not to purchase this cd because it is not exciting and you will only pop it into the CD player once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in Comparison","review":"Although a big Catherine Coulter fan, I found this book quite disappointing. The plot did not stick together very well with a poor climax and cluttered ending. I've always seen this book laying around on bookshelves and now I know why.I enjoyed the heroines (Miranda, Entti, and Sira) but the heroes were trivial."},{"rating":"2","title":"First in the Trilogy","review":"The Lord of Hawkfell Island is yet another brillant novel from Catherine Coulter. The whole trilogy was excellent. No one book was better than the other. Beautifully written and researched. The love scences are as always tastefully written and very romantic. She is definitely my favorite author. I have read her books over and over again. I don't think that there is one out there that I have not read. No other Romance/Historical writer compares to her in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring boring boring","review":"The characters were flat. I couldn't understand the motiviation behind their actions. One minute the hero and heroin hate each other and the next, they don't. The change of heart is not believable and one never feels any emotions. I found myself not caring about any of the characters, or what happens to them. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT DID I EVER SEE IN HER?","review":"I used to like Catherine's books a long time ago. That was before I met Woodiwiss, Lindsey(of old), Garwood, and McNaught. I recently read this book and wondered what I ever saw in her writing. The female has a very fluent air in her speech while her men talk as if they just learned a new language. It is stunted reading in the dialogue. This particular story had great potential, but it went sour after the third or fourth chapter. I don't know of any reader who enjoys the heroine being forced time after time to have intimacies, and be expected to forgive the hero, if he can be called that. The writing is a 1, but the story line that had potential is a 2. It wasn't until recently that I realized that Coulter uses a lot of violence to get her heroines under control of the male or rather to show the males dominance. Unsatisfying and bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, if you're a caveman!","review":"The men literally drag the women by their hair in this novel, it is beyond me how it got categorized as a romance. The romance is virtually non-existant whereas violence is abundant.If you're looking for brutality, rape, incest, homosexuality, and things of that nature, read this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulter can be wonderfully romantic. This book is not it.","review":"Deeply disappointing. Coulter's contemporary romance novels are pretty romantic, but her historical novels can be problematically misogynistic. I enjoyed the sequel to this book years ago (Book 2). This book was completely different, so I'm taking the time to warn other readers. I don't mind a little sexy domination, but this novel *SPOILER* had the heroine punched, slapped, whipped, dumped on, thrown on the ground, and even raped for no reason. The hero even suggests a slave girl be eagle tied and raped. And the narrative just blinks and continues. Not the least bit of tenderness from the hero. Bizarre, even considering the time it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it!!!","review":"UGH!! i did not like this book at all!! i couldnt even finish it because i got so fed up with the 'hero' he was abusive, rude and i dont know how anyone could love him!! i was ready to throw this book out the window!! women were treated so badly in this book!! and there were very weird parts in this book. this was the first book i have read by this author and i dont plan to read any of her books again!!dont waste your money on this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So horrible","review":"Ughh!! I found this novel horrible. I didn't find romance in it what so ever, Rorik abused of Mirana through almost 1/2 the novel. One moment they cant stand each other and the next they are in love. The only reason I finished reading it was because I was sick in bed, couldn't sleep and decided to finish it since there wasn't anything better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls a mile short of interesting!","review":"I love romances, once I get them I usually can't put them down. This is the first book I've read from Ms.Coulter and it's my last. Rorik was an unsympathetic abuser who was found humiliating Mirana constantly throughout the book. Mirana was uninteresting. Their romance was practically nonexistent and they went from hating each other to loving each other in one chapter! Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"abusers are not romantic","review":"The negative reviews here pretty much sum it up. I wasnt planning on adding anything until I got to page 243 and read \\"He had never struck a woman and wouldn't begin now\\". The woman in question is Ennti - I guess all of those times his fist connected with Mirana's face didn't count. Not to mention his foot on her neck, throwing her on the ground, whipping her in front of his men for failing to address him as ' my lord', raping her (he feels her \\"flinch with pain\\" he \\"violently forces her down onto him\\" yet apparently this is okay because he slicked her up with soap first). This should not be touted as romance. I'm stopping on page 243 - I've wasted enough time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wife-beating = romance? PUH-LEASE!","review":"I got this book as part of a lot on ebay. Believe me, I wouldn't have sought out this monstrosity for itself alone.The historical accuracy and detail are great, hence the two stars for this book. Coulter really makes Viking times come alive, but if I'd read about the heroine getting socked in the jaw by the hero one more time, I was going to scream. It wasn't romantic - it was sick! Maybe women were pretty much treated close to that back then, but that doesn't make it palatable reading for today's woman. To have a romance book that fails in its most important mission - creating a story that makes the reader wish she had a love that great - is unforgiveable. Had I been Mirana, I wouldn't want Rorik anything BUT dead, and I would have made it happen, too. The fool had to sleep sometime!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb","review":"This has to go down as the most boring, dumb, and lame book Ihave ever read. Rorik is a wife beater, and Mirana, as strong as sheis, just takes it, then somehow manages to fall in love with him.In general, I never know what to expect with Coulter's books. Sometimes they're superb, other times, they're like this one: you have to force yourself to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy construction.","review":"I ordered this magazine rack for one of our bathrooms. When it arrived, I was disappointed as 2 of the wires were badly bent. I decided not to get a replacement because the whole construction is pretty flimsy, not worth $30 on sale (maybe $10-15 max). I just don't see how you can use this shelf on a daily basis without shaking/moving the whole rack while getting your magazines out or putting them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. Errors, errors, errors! Find a different review book if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before you buy!!!!","review":"The third edition of this book had multiple errors. I had hoped that this would not be the case with this later edition but I was wrong. There are at least 4 errors that I could pick up in the OB/GYN chapter alone. My suggestion to them....get a new editor!!!! My suggestion to you...save your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book, Lovely Music!","review":"This is a lovely little pack of information and music on Johann Sebastian Bach. The book is clear, concise and interesting and offers a detailed but not too demanding biography of a wonderful composer. The accompanying CD's (3) offer excellent examples of Bach's works and at the back of the book the author provides details of each piece of music choosen on the CD along with details for further reading. If you wanted one book to give you some insight into the life of Bach and his works I could not recommend anything better. I must state that I am no expert on this subject and this is the first book I have read on Bach but like I said it's a great way to start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"I just got this in the mail today. Shipping, at the very least, was very speedy. However, when I opened my package, I noticed that not only was my hula girl wearing a yellow dress, not a green one, the dress was made of string and not any straw type substance. The hula girl looks nothing at all like the picture, even the base is different. The hand positions are flat and unnatural. Overall, the hula girl I got in the mail from this company did not resemble what I was led to believe I had ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get fooled.","review":"Like the other reviewer said. It's doesn't even resemble the picture at all. Bought as a gift for bf and when we went to put it up. The skirt (yes they were made of strings and not the straw materials)immediately fell apart. I got some super glue and put it back but now the sticker on the base doesn't stick well. I decided not to bother returning it because it seems more like a hassle instead.

The \\"humor\\" offered is dark and makes you want to more feel sorry for the kid than to laugh at him. This movie isn't even funny on accident. Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari may both be talented, but no one could make a good movie out of this script. If you want to watch something funny definitely buy or rent something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Date Movie!!","review":"This movie is really great to go see on a date or to rent for a date, to stay in all night! I love the humor in this movie and the cast was well chosen! I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh!***Check it out!!***"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie Worth Buying","review":"I will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot. The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this. If you like it the first time you see it, then proceed to buy it, because you always will. If you're not keen on it, then don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I rented this sad excuse for a movie based on Biggs' great performance in American Pie. ...

I saw it thinking it was pretty decent and got on with my life. Later when I actually thought about it I found a ton of reasons to dislike the movie. One that really annoyed me was Mena Suvari's role. I happen to like her but her role totally bashed women. She dressed kinda wacky and different which I totally thought was cool, but she let her teacher/boyfriend treat her like garbage. Also Jason Biggs; what's up with him? I don't even need to go into further detail. I usually like teeny movies but this about the worst one I've seen.

I had a hard time buying Jason Biggs as a small time guy starting school, and his roommates were just mean, instead of being funny cariactures like those in Heckerling's Clueless. The brightest spot was Mena Suvari, who was the only person who felt 3 dimensional. For her, I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1.' Skip this movie and see American Pie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave, scathing, searingly honest.","review":"'Loser' is Amy Heckerling's 'Candide', in which a naive optimist is sent out into the world, only to discover that it is unjust, exploitative and brutal. The best thing about 'Loser' is its casting, and the manipulation of expectations it raises: where 'American Pie' was a sweet romantic comedy disguised as a scatalogical exposure of man's basest instincts, 'Loser' is a scatalogical exposure of man's basest instincts disguised as a sweet romantic comedy. The ironic references to Mena Suvari's most iconic role - 'American Beauty' - expose the paedophilia driving that work's sentimentality.This is a film of unimpeachable integrity, as ugly and unpleasant as the characters it satirises, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' in Hell. So much integrity, in fact, it's vitually unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good!!","review":"i really don't know why the majority of people on amazon.com didn't like this movie. i thought it was great. it was funny cute, sad, and it was just so good. this is, with out a dout, my favorite movie. i've seen it about 7 times and im still not tired of it. the last thing i have to say about this movie (besides it was awsome) is i really wish more guys were like Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adorable film... three and a half stars","review":"Well, this is one of those movies that you can be sure what the ending is just by watching the trailer.

Those roomate jerks that Paul has are all great (yeah, yeah...), and Mena'a carictor is way better than that sweet virgin thing she did in \\"American Pie\\".

See this movie id you want a feel-good film or just something to watch with your BF/GF."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all!","review":"I rented this movie on DVD hoping it will be good but it wasn't. It had a bad plot and horrible acting. I am a Jason Biggs fan and of course the hot actress Mena Suvari but I didn't find this movie funny. It seemed more like a serious movie and a romance movie. It's about a dorky kid who moves into a big city where he finds out that nobody likes him. He moves in with 2 roommates who are really mean to him. He suddenly falls in love with his professor's girlfriend but the kid doesn't know they are in love. Later, the girl falls in love with him back and the kid starts to be cool. See what I mean? I didn't really like this movie at all it was really boring. The only thing good about this movie is Mena Suvari.

When you steal the plot of an Academy Award winning classic like 'The Apartment, it's just shameless theft, based on the (correct) assumption that young audiences won't know your sources.

Amy Heckerling, please change careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slow- a waste of time","review":"I too was expecting a fun and cute movie- though not necessarily of the American Pie genre- and found an extremely SLOW and boring moving.

There are better ways to waste 2 hours, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loser","review":"Loser is by far one of my favorite movies. I remember that there were only 3 other people in the theater when I saw it, though. I definitly does not get the attention it deserves. It's a cute story about a small town boy who moves to the big city, and he falls for the independent girl on the way. The movie is rather predictible as most teen movies are, but it a really funny and cute look at college life in NYC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"If you can access Amazon, this book is too basic for you. If you have ever used any windowing computer that ever was, you won't find anything of value in the 1070 pages.

There is a paragraph on the concept of a zoom button, but none on making your digital camera download pictures.Since the pages are to small to be used in the fireplace and too stiff to use in the bathroom, I have no use whatever for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows For Absolute Beginners...","review":"... at least that is what the book should be called.

I would absolutely love to see neo geo put out MK 3 for the Pocket Color, I would pre-order.

Really, Brautigan's poetry is some of the only poetry that doesn't lie to itself, acknowledging both the author's and the medium's weak points, yet still conveying honest insight through endearing prose, with images that fall apart the second you touch them, leaving you with a feeling of naustalgia; this, I think, is the appeal of Brautigan, and while he might not be a master on the terms of Ezra Pound, he is great on his own terms, and for those that don't know (or care) who the hell Ezra Pound is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traits High on a Cloud","review":"By far, the best song on the album is High on a Cloud by the Traits.

A show built around her would definitely have promise, but this falls way short. The writing is flaccid and the comedy is often too broad. And the co-stars are nowhere near as talented as she and it ruins what could have been a great vehicle. But that's what happens when you choose a cast based on who's Jewish rather than who's the most talented. I'm referring here to actor Jake Johnson (Jewish despite the Anglo name) and then most especially Max Greenfield who is not only awful and a total amateur, but is so homely it's genuinely painful to look at his face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Blu-Ray Version of TNG?","review":"We are already offered on Amazon an HD view of The New Girl via streaming, so why can't we buy a high-def Blu-ray version of it?

In reality, she is a nerd, and she is not pretty at all, I mean i'd probably still do her, but only from behind. Her act is tired, she plays the same character in every movie/show.

Admittedly, I'm sure it was my error in not reading closely enough, but do note that this is not a tea nor does it come in tea bags. It's more like a granulated powder. That said, it dissolves easily in hot water and it quite tasty. Initially the taste was a little too sharp for me, but I have discovered that with some french vanilla creamer it actually makes an excellent chai type drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"This is my favorite hot drink.

It was too strong. I tasted too much honey flavor. The ginger was medicinal. I drank it all anyway because I was sick and thought it might help. It did. The next day, I felt better but still a little nauseous and I drank more. It helped again. The next day I drank it twice, even though I was barely feeling ill. The day after that, I craved it in the morning as much as I normally do coffee (which I'd had to stop drinking while sick).I still find the taste a little too spicy - and now I crave the stuff. I don't even like honey and I don't mind the flavor in this drink. Its a little infuriating to become addicted to something that you were pretty sure you didn't like. Worse, it really helps with upset stomachs and gas. I'm getting some for my mother and I have a feeling I'll be having a cup even on days when I don't need it. At least ginger is good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ginger tea with a little kick","review":"I tried three different brands of ginger tea and I think this one is the best. This is not in a sachet. Ginger is dried into granules (way better) and mixed with a sweetener like cane sugar or honey. This brand brews dark which is the way I like it. The other brands were light in color but they tasted okay. This one is closer to the brand I used to buy in China, but the Chinese brand was much stronger. I like to drink this during the flu and cold seasons and when I've had a heavy meal and need to settle my stomach before bedtime. This is the kind of tea you will either love or hate. I love it! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the cane sugar which I do not use. I prefer liquid sugar or sugar in the raw. Otherwise, this is a great drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ginger product for drinks","review":"I had not expected this product to be so good. I had received a packet to review, liked it immensely and ordered quite a few. I put it in tea; also when I can't sleep or my stomach is acting up, I put it in milk, warm it up and it is wonderful!

I was looking for something that would cut my paper because it was so fine, and this did not satisfy me. They also bleed on my hands. There appears to be a hole next to the tip that I cover with my finger when I write. This causes some sort of pressure issue that makes my thumbs black. If you want MARKER pens, then this is for the fine point enthusiast. If you want to scratch your paper, then get a ball point. Rated 2 stars because of the bleeding issue on hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pens","review":"I love these pens and for the sort of work I do there's nothing better.

Little is derived or well justified. This reference will not help you think critically about the underlying methodology. The only reason to use this book is if you want a fluffy, example based approach to regression. Expect to be frustrated.For someone with an appropriate background in linear algebra, I would recommend Davidson and MacKinnon's \\"Econometric Theory and Methods,\\" which is a much more satisfying approach to regression."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor choice for those with little statistical experience","review":"Please don't waste your money on this book, especially if you have little prior knowledge regarding linear regression. It is poorly written and seldom gives proper explanations for the various aspects of regression analysis. Weisberg wrote it keeping brevity in mind, so don't expect to find many details; this book is definitely not for beginners, and even people I know with more experience have noted that it is often difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly heuristic, filled with errors","review":"An absolutely terrible text. The book rarely offers anything remotely resembling rigorous derivations (almost entirely heuristic arguments), and as often as not has errors in the derivations they do present. On top of that, the R package written for this text by the author (package \\"alr3\\") contains errors as well. In order to complete the exercises provided in the text, you actually have to EDIT the provided functions.Overall, this is an inexcusably bad book.If it's required for a class, see if you can get it from the library, and buyApplied Linear Statistical Modelsfor reference instead.

Season Three is packed with others such as the muscular and attractive Ares, with the puzzling Calisto and vain Aphrodite to name a few, and all Xena fans know the plots and story lines just keep getting better as Xena travels.It is episodes like the musical, \\"The Bitter Suite,\\" that makes Season Three a set you MUST have.

While it may be appealing to those who have never heard other versions of the requiem, those who love THE REQUIEM will find this version uninspiring.

For example: Design - the text will be cut off mid-sentence by a diagram that you don't need to look at until the next page, when you have to flip back and forth to refer to it. Organization - information is scattered about so you feel like you're reading the same [boring] thing 20 times, so you start skimming, but then you miss the one kernel of information that's added each time (the book would be shorter, lighter, AND easier to read if it were organized better). Also, the author includes full citations for everything, like a term paper (a loooong one), so you can lose track of the sentence you're reading by trying to hunt through all the names and dates to find the information.

This shirt was a little shorter than we would normally buy, but of course you can't tell that online. We are afraid that after it is washed, it will probably be too short for him. I am still satisfied with the purchase though. I would just say that it is not a really good choice if you need the length. It is one of those t-shirts that looks wide and short. Different brands are cut different ways and if you buy clothes for a tall man or are a tall man yourself, you know what I mean by the wide and short statement. Overall, the shirt is very high quality and a thick material."},{"rating":"2","title":"best live album ever","review":"The best live album I've ever heard.

It's been years since I saw 'em though and I felt I might get that experience of a live show with \\"Live Transmissions From Uranus\\". I don't remember them talking so much when I saw them. I recall some jokes, but mainly them playing their unique blend of surf rock mixed with elements of new wave and punk, weird sound effects, and of course sound bites of sci-fi B movies. They ruined this album by running their mouths way, way too much onstage. They don't even pull off their jokes, talking over each other and crap. Somebody actually yells from the crowd for them to talk less and play more. I couldn't have agreed more.

This toy is just like fishing in real life. The fish swims when placed in water, it's mouth opens and closes and it comes with 2 worms (that have magnets attached to the worms). The reel allows you to throw out a line and reel it back in. Although it doesn't seem like the reel is super durable, it seems to hold the weight of the fish which is somewhat heavy.

All i can say is, I am still confused as to why this book was written in the first place. The book was so uninteresting, I couldnt finish it, i just gave up in frustration. The prologues of Blue and Lilly were great. Then when the story shifted to Nick and his life, it just got boring and drowned on and on. This auther does not know how to weave a story together. The story was all over the place. And i didnt see the reason why she had to have so many curse words, and then get all preachy at the same time. It just seemed like she was having her characters use that language to make them seem more \\"real\\". Well it didnt work, it just made the book worse than it already is.

I decided to see what this book was about because of all of the positive reviews not to mention the shameless plugging of many for this book in other reviews (which by the way is tacky). But I figured this book must be really good, right? Wrong! I found the book to be preachy and a contradiction. I see that the author has a message that she is trying to get across but I question this book as being an effective way to do just that. One minute I'm thinking Christian fiction, but then I'm thrown into obscenities. The next minute I'm thinking just AA fiction, but then I'm preached to. The book was all over the place.I truly do not understand the rave reviews. I've read other books whether Christian fiction or not that doesn't come across the way this did.

I wasn't disappointed. At the end of the book, it becomes clear that this is a chastity parable written by and for some iteration of fundamentalist Christians. The characters are uninteresting and predictably stereotypical, the story itself is unsuspenseful and trashy, and the narrrative structure and writing sytle are profoundly amatuerish.

This is why this novel applies to all. It was a good idea to put a list of STDs in the back of the book. She covered all the basis in this book. I'm passing it on, not just because it was a good book, but hopefully to be able to help others. Outstanding job. Oh, by the way, I like the character list in the front of the book.

Three of them now have an unreadable display and one of them randomly turns off. It's not a battery problem, as I've replaced all of them recently. Also, the quality of the speakerphones have degraded to the point where you can't use them anymore. You can hear the other party fine, but when you talk, they only hear a crackle.To top it off, I got a wireless internet router a couple years ago, and this thing operates on a similar frequency!

My son NEVER plays with it now, I was VERY disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does it say???","review":"I have a ten month old who adores Elmo and my own cell phone, so I thought this would be the perfect gift...boy was I wrong! All throughout the store he played with it and loved it. When we got home it was the one toy he was the least interested in. We both were so dissapointed with the volume level. I understand that it is supposed to be lowered for saftey reasons, but the only time he can hear it is if he is in a quiet room. Let us as the parent decide whether or not the volume should be louder. Also, I have found that this phone is very heavy!It's bad enough the volume is so low, but when it's so heavy that my son can barely pick it up to put by his ear, makes it ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make the volume so LOW?","review":"My daughter loved this phone in the store.

For safety reasons (as claimed on the package), the volume is louder while the phone is in the box; however, my son is able to hear the sound while playing with it.

She loves to press the buttons and pretend she's talking when Elmo speaks. Each button makes 3 or 4 different sounds, depending on how many times you press it. Opening the mouth piece causes the eyes at the top of the phone to open, while I thought this might be an area that breaks, it seems to be quite durable. Our child also likes to open the eyes with her fingers, and this does not seem to have damaged the toy in any way. Like most toys for our baby, it has had several drops from the high chair onto the hard floor, and continues to work just fine. Overall, we are pleased with this purchase, and this along with the Elmo remote control we purchased seem to have worked in distracting our baby from the real remote and cell phone. We would definitely purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE FOUND THE ANSWER TO THE VOLUME PROBLEM!!!!!","review":"HELLO,IF YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM I DO, THEN LISTEN UP.

If you take the tab out, the sound will drop to such a volume that even with your ear on the phone itself, you will still barely hear it. It was a huge disappointment. So, if you still plan to buy this item, do not throw away the plastic tab. You can still reinsert it into the hole and get the original sound back (which is not very loud either). I repeat ... do not throw away the plastic tab. I kicked myself and spent a half an hour looking through the garbage can when my child cried. She told me the toy was broken and wouldn't even go near it.

Thankfully I read Michelle's volume fix and had saved the box with the plastic tab. I reinserted the tab and cut it off - VOILA, volume restored.

It is almost a whisper. You are barely able to hear the volume unless it is extremely quiet. I thought the toy was defective until I noticed the Note To Consumer explaining that the volume will go down. I think that is terrible that Fisher Price put the notice inside the box. They should have it on the outside of the box where potential consumers can read it and then decide if they want to buy it knowing that information. I would certainly not have purchased it had I known. Now my son has no interest in the phone because he can barely hear it. I cant even bring it back because the package is torn apart.

Of course, there is a safety factor to make sure whatever you put in doesn't come out because it's small.

As far as the volume issue, I do agree with the other reviewers, the volume is MUCH lower then most toys. However I err on the cautious side and end up putting tape over most other toys to lessen the volume when there isn't manual controls.

If I had previewed the book at a book store I most definitely would not have purchased book. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out Of Date","review":"I'm not very satisfied with this book. It's a very basic and also out of date version of Home Automation techniques. It takes a very basic approach to home automation and does not offer much helpful info about current techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"In serious need of update","review":"With the pace home automation as been changing, this book should be considered \\"out of date\\" and hopefully soon be \\"out of print.\\" While the author does seek to enlighten readers, the focus of the book is out-of-touch with main stream home automation thinking in 2002. Even the control systems referenced are no-longer near the cutting edge. While references to structured wiring still ring true, the techniques for reaching a total intregated system have changed. I was so disappointed with this book I actually returned to Amazon as I felt it could not enhance my library in any regard. As an alternative I would suggest \\"Home Automation for Dummies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Un engaño","review":"Este libro no hace mas que contar que funciones de una casa pueden ser automatizadas y en ningun momento describe como se tiene que hacer y no tiene ningun diagrama de como se deberia cablear la casa para soportar este tipo de automatizaciones. Uno de los puntos mas critico para cualquiera que este pensando en instalar una LAN en su casa es como y por donde pasar los cables, en este libro no se hace ninguna mencion. Con respecto al contenido general todos los temas son tratados muy superficialmente y es poco lo que agrega que no pueda ser leido en la informacion disponible en Internet.

The battery life in this product is extremly short. I bought a new battery for a weekend camping trip, used the light on & off (not extensively) throughout. Got home, placed it on my desk & 2 weeks later (with no use) it is 100% dead. It's almost as if the battery is always being drawn from, even while off. I would not have written this review except this is the second time this has happened since I bought this item.

I am not sure if Vista is good for this laptop. If I have a choice, I will select XP instead b/c running Vista seems too heavy for this machine. The machine is very easy to become hot and battery runs out very fast. Overall, I think this is a good buy but still some weakness. That's why I cannot give it 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible laptop","review":"I bought this computer before Christmas. It took 5 weeks to get sent to me.

Within 3 weeks the computer keyboard completely malfunction. With different caps turning on and off each time that I started my computer. It is now March 24, 2008 and I still have not got my computer back from their repair depot. Not to mention that the customer service is terrible. That is even comparing them to other terrible customer service such as Dell. I wanted to simply get my money back and they are unwilling to do this.

My friends and I would play for hours, driving our little car around the 3 dimensional track and waiting for the chance to put our \\"children\\" pegs in the car (always biting the bottom off to make them shorter than the parents!). I was really looking forward to playing the PC version, but was kind of disappointed because the very things that make the boardgame fun are not present in the PC version. The biggest flaw is that you can't really see the entire board view, so you have no idea what squares are coming up. Half the fun of the boardgame is the satisfying sound of the wheel whirring, while you call out \\"come on six!\\", only to be disappointed when you land on 5. The graphics are amusing, and the game does have some entertainment value, but it just doesn't recapture the old board game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks","review":"Play The Game of Life on Playstation.

An rpg on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, wow! But, when I got to playing the game I saw that it wasn't really an RPG. Sure it has the HP system and EXP. system, but it lacked a real plot. You go aroung these dungens and get money and experiance, but there was no real drive to the game except the making of new arms for the unitron.

The Pocket Color is capable of so much more than this. Thegraphics are quite poor and the storyline is non-existent. Most of the gameplay is menu driven with only a small amount of movement in the (falsly labeled) randomized dungeons. The concept was a good one and there is a decent variety of parts for your \\"Unitron\\" but the game offers little else. The only positive spin one can put on this game is its' meditative qualities.

My nails were so thin and if I were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off. I tried many \\"nail hardener\\" products with no success. Nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use. I don't use any remover - after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over. I don't try to remove it off all my nails at once - just the ones that appear to need lifting off at the moment. Agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so. This product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling.

Not sure if it actually works because i didn't use it more then twice to find out. The first coat I put on, it stung and burned my nails so bad, they felt like they were going to fall off, i couldn't stand the pain in my finger tips. I figured because i already had it on that it wouldn't hurt the second coat, but it did and it was worse. I couldn't stand it so I took it off right away with polish remover, they are still burning a bit after I removed the polish but Its not near as bad as with it on. My nails are very thin and fragile because I use to have on acrylic nails, so I wanted to try something to strengthen them back to healthy. I do not like this product and wouldn't not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage","review":"For some reason, my usually strong, long nails have been going through a period of chipping and peeling, so I fell for the Nailtique hype.Don't waste your money.

Who cares?","review":"A lot of people criticise how old Gary Cooper is in this movie, but it certainly doesn't matter to me.

I'm so glad this movie is on DVD so I can skip ahead to my favorite parts when there is not enough time for the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive waste of Audrey Hepburn","review":"I was amazed that a movie that I had heard so much about was so awful. Audrey Hepburn is wasted in a roll that casts her as an idiot. Gary Cooper is a totally inappropriate co-star. He is clearly desiccated, something not hidden by the careful lighting, side angles and shadows cast on his face. He moves like an old man, stiff and wooden. His voice is squeaky. Cooper shows every indication of alcoholism.Amazing, because Fred Astaire was probably the same age as Cooper, if not older, but in Daddy Long Legs he is charming, as well as honestly lighted. Perhaps this is because his glorious elegance and athleticism did not escape him."},{"rating":"2","title":"no masterpiece but a turly funny movie","review":"Ms. Hepburn blows poor gary cooper of the screen in this tale of suduction and pursuit.

Her acting was superb, she portrayed her character well. Cooper plays a sex symbol, and dispite the age difference he did an amazing job. I compare this movie to \\"Funny Face\\" because the female lead falls in love with an older man, however Cooper plays a more convincing role then good ol' Fred. \\"Love in the Afternoon\\" is a sincere love story, it seems to come from the heart, not the desk of a movie producer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love In The Afternoon","review":"audrey Hepburn at her very best.Top cast and wonderful movie.The final scene is one of the greatest in the movie world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Films","review":"There is an intelligent reason films from this period are considered \\"clasic\\".

I almost upchucked when he kissed her. I am well aware there are many, many older men/younger women romances. I don't have anything against them, per se, but WHAT is it that she would have seen in him... except his wrinkles? I know I'm being cruel, and I'm no spring chicken, but I didn't sense any sparks between the two of them. I saw Audrey's face before the Coop goes in for a kiss... and it was: \\"Okay, I have to kiss him, let's make this good.\\" The cover of the DVD looks like Grandpa is holding his debutante granddaughter. This was some old studio lecher's idea of a hot film. The public went to it because that's what they were given. I can't imagine this kind of film being a hot property now, but what do I know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more stars, this movie is great!!","review":"This film is delightfull. I have never really had a chance to discover a true and classic romantic film that is until I saw 'Love in the afternoon' wich turned me on to a whole different world of the day when Gentlemenly values ruled the movie screen and Women were portrayed as having a certain class to them that Hepburn brought about most beautyfully. Audrey was truly a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful actors and interesting plot & dialogues","review":"I have seen this movie in an English movie theater in Vienna and fell in love with this film the minute it started.I love the plot in which the cello student, Arianne falls in love with one of her dad's surveillance 'victims', Mr. Flannagan, only by seeing him on a photo and then getting to know him through fate. I also love the dialogues between them and seeing him turn into a man who denies that he is in love almost until the end of the movie, of which he hasn't been in a long time, only because of her being mysterous but emotionally honest. I also like that there is such a large age difference which makes it even more interesting. All in all a fantastic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love In The Afternoon","review":"What an incredible romantic and funny movie. Audrey Hepburn andCary Cooper play well together. Charm, romance, a little fantasy without the nudity and foul language of most of today'sfilms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story about love found in unexpected ways.","review":"\\"Love in the Afternoon\\" is a beautiful tale of a young woman,Audrey Hepburn, growing up in Paris and her father is a private eye who for years has been traching the affairs of a \\"Playboy\\", Gary Cooper. She has fallen in love with Cooper even before she has meet him, she sails into rescue him before on of his lovers husbands slices him open. Hepburn turns the tables on Cooper and becomes the mysteriouse woman/girl who will not fall under his spell. Cooper is taunted by the background that Hepburn gives to him relating her tales of torrid love affairs she has had over the years. Cooper finally doesn't know which way is up and needs to find out who this beautiful temptress really is. This movie is by far one of the best movies to see either Hepburn or Cooper in. Cooper may be a little on the older side for this role but then anyone opposite of Hepburn would look older than the forever young Hepburn. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love in the Afternoon","review":"Pleasant movie but nothing special, a very ordinary story. Audrey Hepburn's charisma is what puts some life to the movie. Some subtle humour though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper do NOT make a good couple!","review":"Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper are wonderful actors but should never have been paired together. There should be a believeble age difference. Audrey's calling him the best looking man she'd ever seen is NOT believable. The plot is decent but I didn't like Cooper's gigilo character. Audrey is stunning as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredible waste of time - VERY dated","review":"The wisdom of Amazon kept recommending this to me. Why - because I bought Two For The Road several years ago?? That purchase was based on love of that film and its timeless reflection on love/marriage. Love in the Afternoon cannot be compared in any way save for the presence of the lovely Audrey Hepburn. She shines in both films but the latter doesn't come close to being saved by her inclusion.Gary Cooper - are we kidding? Who in the name of William Shatner (an Olivier by comparison) ever considered him an ACTOR?? His wooden, plodding recitation of lines was a hideous waste of time, energy and celluloid. I can understand a town full of people planning his demise at high noon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragedy disguised as a love story","review":"This movie helps us to understand why the divorce rate is so high amongst this generation. The story line is written to depict a great love founded on lies and deceit. Cooper plays a skirt chasing, immoral, philanderer, who has absolutely no depth of character and nothing positive to offer, other than financial security. Hepburn portrays an idiot child who can't see what a loser she pursues. The differences in their ages could suggest that Cooper is a child molester. I found this movie disturbing and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"enh","review":"\\"Love in the Afternoon\\" was distracting at best, and banally charming at worst. It could barely hold my attention during dinner.

So The Dermis Probe is more than just another book one dips into to derive entertainment and enjoyment. Although the stories, extracts and commentaries are certainly enjoyable and interesting, they carry within them a kind of 'magic' that works on the mind to expose itself to itself so that it can work better and more efficiently.

The software that controls this box (which MUST be installed in order to access it) is very poorly implemented - I would say circa 1990 (Windows 3.0) quality, if that.The deciding factor for me was when the firmware upgrade aspect of the software (which the software prompts you to run ***each*** time you open it) crashed during the firmware upgrade. If you don't know the significance of such a crash, the answer is short: likely inability to access the device or any of the data stored on either drive inside.

I have a 54Mbps wireless network, and operations such as saving that should take just a few seconds stretch into minutes. I have no idea what this thing is doing, but it takes forever to do even the simplest tasks.

Even with a Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm drive with 16mb cache it is still very slow. However, thats not the real issue here. Serious and frustrating problem is it will routinely disappear from the network without rhyme or reason. Has dropped out of sight even after just using it and going back to save a document. The only thing that will bring it back is always a reboot of the router, and sometimes a reboot of the PC also needed. Its always the router first, that usually does it.

Instead of being able to use the drives as is. Netgear decided it needed to create it's own file system. This is definately a \\"plug and pray\\" piece of equipment. I think Netgear had an intern design and write the application for this. They also need to really test it to make sure it works in many types of network environments instead of some lab.I am returning mine as soon as possible.If you are looking at buying a NAS sytem don't buy this one. Go with D-Links or the Buffalo. Although more expensive, they seem to have very good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow storage","review":"This device looked good on paper but when I received it I was very disappointed. Installation was easy but file transfer is pathetic. I thought I'd try to back up an 8Gb data file which took 8 hours. Back up of my laptop took 46 hours.

Boy was it the worst thing I ever did for his business. I remember the install being a rather unfriendly process. A few days ago his Admin calls me to say they are having some sync trouble, but the files are still there. So I go in yesterday and upgrade the firmware and PC software as per the instructions on [...] .The damn thing set the drive size to 0 MB and killed the partition. Tech support told me the device was defective and outside warranty even though just prior to upgrading the files were there.

But the mere fact that my data storage has to be reformatted makes me realize this was a bad purchase. This happened after i upgraded my firmware. Before that I was able to get my files fine.

I am happy that I'm now able to access my pictures and music with my pc and my laptops."},{"rating":"1","title":"All promise and little delivery","review":"I have had the box 1 week now. It only works with XP computers. My Apple and Vista ones are out of luck. Vista has hope (someday), but the unusual architectural choice of SAN vs NAS makes OS X very unlikely ever. I have had one broken mirror, and have had it lose connectivity with its own disks once (could be IDE disks I bought). The SAN thing is the big loss though. It means you can't mount the drives on even XP laptops or XP desktops without using the supplied (non-WHQL'd I might add) drivers (let alone OS X or Linux). I feel snookered."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product still on the market?????","review":"This was useless the day it came to market. I was one of the stupid early adopters. I am surprised its still on sale in 2012! I was only able to give mine away with 2 x 80Gb harddisks as part of the deal those years ago.

Just threw my money away.Look at the reviews here and LEARN!! Stay away from Netgear - they serve up useless junk.Anyway, next (after reading reviews) I bought a Synology NAS. WOW!! Fantastic - up in minutes. Shows what a Quality product can deliver.Bottom line - DO NOT BUY NETGEAR!!!Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but multiple shortcomings","review":"The SC101 does enable one to take IDE hard drives and make them available on the network.However, it doesn't work with Windows 7 or anything other than Windows XP and Vista.It uses a proprietary file system, so it cannot be accessed directly. You must install the Netgear software to enable a Windows PC to see the drive.Very clunky solution, much better alternatives at less cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not supported in Vista or Windows 7","review":"This was actually a pretty nice product. At the original price it was a real deal a few years ago. Unfortunately, there have been no upgrades to the drivers. This means no Vista or Windows 7 support.Also consider that special software needs to be installed on all computers that wish to access this device. Otherwise, it will NOT be accessible by that computer.So, unless you are an old-time hacker who will keep all his network in XP, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toaster has only one setting....sloooooow!!!","review":"I cannot believe this is the worst toaster ever!!!

There is no darkness settings either but my friend says thats why it knows how to toast anything to perfection. Can someone explain why there is an internet connection.

No trouble setting it up or mapping. However, initially it was very, very slow and caused my laptop to crash frequently.

I also have a Linksys NSLU2 in the same network, no firewall issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"SC101 Never again!","review":"Please, please.........Do not buy this thing, there is a wealth of information by users out there with multiple problems and almost non-existent support. If you do buy one - DO NOT MIRROR IT! - use it only as a storage device without any of the RAID features, otherwise you will almost certainly lose your data!I ultimately stopped using mine and went to a USB/Firewire attached external drive enclosure, much faster a more versatile.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA","review":"As of mid-February 2007, Netgear has not made available drivers for this product to work with Vista. So, if you have any thoughts of maybe upgrading your operating system, check and make sure drivers have been made available. The XP drivers do not work.Before I upgraded to Vista, the product worked pretty well. But, it's amazing to me that a current product like this does not have drivers for Vista.

WHAT A WASTE OF TIME/MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this product","review":"The product works as advertised, that's not the problem. The problem is what's not advertised. Basically, it uses a proprietary system, so you need to install software in whatever computer you want to access it. The drivers are only for Windows XP (some say it's worked for them on Vista with some registry changes and what not). And it definitely doesn't work in Windows 7 or any 64 bit version of any OS. So basically, this product is as obsolete as obsolete goes. Netgear abandoned any support for this unit a few years ago, so don't even bother contacting them. It's also very slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling Screwed","review":"NOT FOR LINUX. Not many reviews were available when I bought this device and I'm paying the price of that now. It requires the software to be installed on every computer that will use it and the software refuses to install. It even tells you that it has not passed windows testing. Has no web interface so the screwed up software is the only option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed and Poorly Supported","review":"The SC101 is based on a proprietary protocol, so when it craps out on you (note when, not if, because it's so poorly designed) the only option you have to retrieve your data is by buying a new SC101, which you'll just want to throw away after recovering your data. When it does work, the attachment to your PC is sketchy, at best, and the communication rate is slow. Save your money and buy a standard NAS device. I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this junk and Netgear SCM","review":"This Netgear unit uses proprietary (zetera) technology which is a pain to configure and work with. And if you ever have a need to uninstall Storage Central Management software from your computer, be sure to have a full backup of the system before doing so. Else you would be dreading the BSOD after uninstalling the software.Definitely not worth the money and effort! Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great intentions but product falls miserably short!","review":"I won't go too in depth here, there are already plenty of reviews that sum up this device...NOT WORTH IT! I got it for $29.95 and i'm getting rid of it. First of all it's PATA (IDE) and doesn't work with all harddrives. PATA is fine however prices for PATA are about 25% higher than SATA, probably because they are being phased out. The worst part about this is that the firmware needs to be upgraded to work in Vista and many times the upgrade will fail. Also, all computers you want to access this drive must have software on them. Other bad things include drive format not readable in Windows, that means if this thing crashes, or if a drive crashes (and the mirroring doesn't always save your data!) your are up s**t creek without a paddle if you know what I mean. Get a Pogoplug instead! I pre-ordered! http://www.pogoplug.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Piece of Junk","review":"I bought the SC-101 as it seemed to be a reasonably priced storage solution for our small office.I set it up, created partitions for our 3 users and all seemed well.The same day, one of the partitions vanished, and since no one had yet uploaded any data, I tried to repartition. The unit would not allow me to recover the missing portion of the drive, despite resets and hours and hours on the phone with a customer service rep who clearly had never heard of the product.The unit never worked as it should and it was promptly returned to the store.Avoid this item at all costs. Spend a little more money and read the reviews carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"requires newer drives","review":"It appearred esy to setup.

SC101 works only with ATA6 or newer IDE hard disks.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience! Many Problems and now no Vista support","review":"I bought this device as a NAS in my network. The setup is pretty easy. Than you find out that you have a proprietary solution. It runs only with computers that have the driver installed. I would expect that you get this information before you buy. Than after installation I experienced several (allmost every day) break downs of the system. Drives where not accessible and I had to reboot. Those problems finally seemed to be solved with a new driver. Meanwhile a upgraded my laptop to Vista home premium. Guess what - the new driver. as the old one, doesn't support Vista. So, no access to my data on the SC101. I bought a Buffalo NAS and now I'm satisfied.

I have had success at using it but... I have had far more problems than I care to say. I am writing this because I had the device working, they prvided updates. The updates failed to work even on the original machine using SCM software that was working. I have owned two other companies \\"nas\\" products. They work. They were supported. In short, their software is written poorly. if it works poorly with XP, I can't wait to see it under Vista. Their device is really nothing more than a piece of junk. Used @ $42.00 is a rip off.

I spent 2 days trying to make it work. Netgear's technical support is not very good. They are slow to respond, and the help they provide tends not to be very useful. Rather than just returning the unit, I decided to exchange it for another. The new unit fired right up and has been working beautifully for over a week. I know there has been alot of complaints about the heat generated by the SC101, but I find mine runs very cool with the two 120GB hard drives that I installed.Overall I would of rated the SC101 a five, except for the bad time I had with the first unit and Netgear's technical support."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit is a Windows PC Terminator.

It seemed to work fine when I installed it on the network and added the software to a computer on a hard line. On my first wireless installation attempt I could not see the drives (partitions) and no matter what else I have done I cannot fix this problem. I called tech support and as much as I like talking to people overseas I found the imprecise english tough to deal with. The tech support agent made bizarre comments like \\"if you have a 100gb partition on the SC101 to mount it you need 100gb free space on you laptop\\". This is just ridiculous.

(Hence \\"Sell Out\\" and \\"She Has a Girlfriend Now\\") I really like their sarcasm and their horns always sound amazing, but it's just not ska. This CD will not withstand the greatest test: you won't like it years after buying it. If you want some good ska CDs, look into Skavoovie & the Epitones' \\"Fat Footin'\\" or older Pietasters, like \\"OoLooLoo,\\" both of which I still love.

I've had this cd so long and listened to it so much I'm kinda sick of it now.

When Aaron first belts out the lyrics to \\"Sell Out\\" to the end with \\"Alternative Baby.\\" This is just an awesome C.D. Aaron Plays a mean guitar. Who ever thought of guitar riffs in a ska band?

The problem is, nearly every song on this CD sounds the same as the one before it. They over use those stupid, moronic, cliched ska phrases (Pick it up, etc.) on nearly each song. Don't get me wrong, this CD is cool the first time you hear it.

The most interesting thing about this novel is the female character Thalia Drummond, she is actually very modern and seems to me like a prerunner to some of the female heroins we have come to know later, for example Lisbeth Salander. As far as I know this novel is written in the 20's. But the general feel of the novel is much earlier, I would have thought the 1880's. I don't know why, but the plot of this novel makes me think about modern art...

Though excited at first, she quickly became frustrated as it was hard to steer and tipped over easily. The spinning thing in the center would quit working with new batteries (changing them can be a hassle because of the design) and the only way we could get it going again was to shake the bike. It wasn't long until she just quit playing with altogether and we eventually gave it away. For a toy by Little Tykes this was a disappointment as we've never had a problem with any of the other toys we've gotten from this brand. The only reason it gets 2 stars for durability is because the handles never popped off on ours as it has done with other reviewers. QA must've been on vacation when this was rolled out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go a different route","review":"For my daughter first birthday, I debated purchasing Little Tikes ride-on or one from Radio Flyer.

The wheels do not glide well outdoors and the steering is limited and clumsy.

I hand wash them and would not lay several in the sink at a time, but am not afraid to slide my hand inside for a good cleaning. We use them at the dinner table for a glass of wine and the complete glasses at Sunday dinner, birthdays, and when friends visit. My 8 year old drinks from them so they receive a good clinking rather often without chipping. It makes everyday more special instead of dusting them off once or twice a year.

Mr. Farland needs to bring in new ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"My girlfrend liked Runelords, and so I read it. i didn't like it but I decided to try the sequel, Bortherhood of the Wolf. It was worse. This is clunking writing and boring concepts that are not new or original in any way, except for the endowments which, while interesting, are unrealistic in application. The thinking is sloppy and so is the dialog.Bottom line: this book and this series is a waste of money. If you want to read the true master, get a hold of George Martin's third book in A Song of Ice and Fire series, Storm of Swords. This looks like a comic book by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad recommendation","review":"I checked this book out on a recommendation from an acquaintance who I will never listen to again.

For those who like one-dimensional heroes and villians, and a simple plot-line without requiring deep philosphical pondering, you may not enjoy this book, but even then it is such an extraordinarly good read you may find it hard to put down. The hidden truth of the story is that this book is more about human nature and the philosophy of the moral/ethical/virtue strugle of man than anything else. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Become a better tale teller","review":"This is my recommendation for the author. This story is so full of holes and what is there is so woefully underdeveloped I don't understand how this book can be praised as a major literary accomplishment.

When the situation is complicated by the coming of monsters from deep below the ground, in countless multitudes, with powers humans cannot understand, and almost no one except a construct can stand against them, and humanity cannot band together to defend itself because of the intransigence of one man with thousands of endowments, the situation is infinitely worse. There is an end to the book, but there is no closure to the story. I am moving on to the next in the series as quickly as I can get to it. I need to know what happens next . . . and making the reader want to know what happens next--in the next paragraph, or the next chapter, or the next book, is the mark of a good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW AND THRILLING","review":"David Farland has created a vast, magical world that drew me in and left me panting for more. His style of writing lets you stand next to the characters, hear the clashes of battle, smell the smells and taste the tastes. His endowment invention was probably the most original idea for magic I have ever read, let alone heard of. The Runelords will let you off amazed and satisfied, more riveting than any of the books I have read. Treat yourself to this adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire a ghostwriter","review":"I expected this series wouldn't go anywhere. I was right (this book is more repetitive than the first) and wrong (nevertheless, here is book 2)in the same breath. Once again we have a device that baffles, with a new twist; PETA will be thrilled.I have serious objections to writers who treat everyone not central to their plot as hapless and empty (though they are, eventually anyway, especially in these books) NPCs. Talk about a control freak's dream. The real problem is that the writer has less regard for his atmosphere people than the ruthless characters do. He should find some fawning but talented writer to endow him with the ability to tie up loose ends and make you care that all this blood is shed. I expect that the only people left more drained and wanting than these victims are his readers.He gets one star for the battle scenes, otherwise, you'll find this book empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as the worst role-playing game scenarios","review":"It really does read like some ill-conceived fantasy role-playing game. Statistical approaches to abilities, freakish monsters and heroes. Dull, dull stuff.Reviewers seem to be in awe of the \\"originality\\" of the magic system. Geez, easily impressed, aren't we? An original magic system is neat for those weekend dungeons and dragons campaigns between junior high students but doesn't impres me in a novel. Try writing with depth and skill, now there's something you don't see on the fantasy shelves these days.I'd rather eat broken glass than read this slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy it, couldn't finish it","review":"I tried, but didn't make it past page 100. Same old stuff, a generic fantasy novel full of all the usual cookie-cutter castles, villains & heroes. If you liked the first one you get the same thing with the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very D&D","review":"I am disappointed that Tor, who I have always considered a very high quality fantasy publisher, would put out this book. Upon opening it I am greeted with four or five maps of not only the world or a continent, but of towns and castles, all of which looked like things I drew to run my roleplaying world. On top of that we have references to stamina, and beauty, and agility--all the RPG stats. Yuck! This is badly written and poorly plotted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy stuff","review":"I had no idea when I first was given this book that David Farland was a false name for Dave Wolverton, who wrote and co-wrote so much of L. Ron Hubbard's strange stuff. I read the sum of all men and it creeped me out, but I assumed that was intentional and let it go. But once I got into this one, I began to see a frightening pattern.The writing in this book is very repetitive and amateurish. The concepts do not make make sense, unless you put them in the context of Wolverton's real world. This is an unimpressive and poorly written series, but it certainly does contribute some dangerous ideas and attitudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONCEPT TOO DISTURBING","review":"I was put off by the concept of Nobles taking enhancements from other people, leaving them living vegtables. And the Reavers, insect like things that surge from the bowls of the Earth- Yech- too scary. Not an alternative world I enjoyed visiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on! This series REEKS!","review":"With so many other fine and semi-fine epic fantasy series out there, this is a pale also-ran, a cheap imitation of Eddings, Donaldson, Jordan and even Goodkind with a sick mentality behind it. The writing is trite and one dimensional, the characters [especially the women] are dull and stereotypical. The dialog is wooden, and a lot of things are stolen directly from other fantasy worlds [like the reavers].Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the series","review":"This book continues the Runelords series and compared to the first one there is more action and magnificient battle scenes. Once I picked up this book, I could not put it down. My only complaint is that certain parts are a little too redundant, repeating parts that we read earlier in the book or even encountered in the first of the series. This may be the author's way of keeping us abreast of the situation but at times it can be annoying to read something that I already know.All in all, a valiant effort.On to the 3rd of the series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow knockoff","review":"This book could have been done in half to a third of the pages he took. Ethical questions notwithstanding, it's also a very derivative book. The reavers are right out of Thomas Covenant, as is, if I recall, the concept of draining, and some features of the evil characters.If you actually liked this, go back in time a couple decades and read Donaldson instead. The characters are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I firmly agree with the critics, this series is the first one in a long while that has the potential to compete with robert jordon. if you thought the first book was good wait till you get your hands on the second!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and boring","review":"While I find the magic system in this series to be intriguing, the author's repetitive explanation of its function and effects are distracting and boring. I also found the relative strength of Fire to the other three elements to be skewed. Although there are times when the elements can be out of blaance, the ineffectual workings of the other wizards compared to the sheer might of the Fire wizards left much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"I am totally lost in the quest for a point in this series, and it appears I am not alone; the author joins me on the endless search for the theme here. True, he has invented a magic system different from other series, but it is implausible and offensive. The characters are one dimensional and unsympathetic, the writing flat and the interactions between men and women dull or worse. It is hard for me to imagine that a writer as fine as Orson Scott Card would do anything more than spit in the direction of this book, and yet a lot of the second-rank SFF authors have lined up to praise it. I can't believe they even read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first book in this series wasn't marvelous, but was pretty good, and interesting. I hoped that this second book would improve on the subject matter.Boy, was I disappointed.This whole book seemed very vague, with the main hero dissolving into confusion, and dragging his readers with him. The other characters are poorly portrayed, and the whole book leads to a massive battle scene at the end - which fizzles out with almost no punch. The conclusion of the book seems to be more because the author ran out of intelligent things to say than because the story was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed","review":"If you don't want anything new from your fantasy reading, this book is for you. You will find ripoffs of many other concepts, including those from D&D and other role playing games, Stephen R. Donaldson's Reavers and all your standard fantasy tropes. Farland is a second or third class writer, unable to match the vision and verbiage of Robert Jordan or the excitement of Terry Goodkind. This book is not worth reading at all in my opinion, but if you don't mind reading the same stuff you find in other novels, at least spare yourself the expense and buy it in paperback. My library doesn't carry it, which should tell you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not totally hideous, but not really even good","review":"David Farland's writing style drives me crazy. The characters are cartoonish clowns, and the plot is wooden, but there is a hint of interesting stuff below the surface, if he could just unearth it from beneath all the garbage. I gave the second book a try, hoping he had gotten better at it, but was wrong. I borrowed this book, and I was glad to give it back. I will not make the same mistake again, and will read nothing more by this author [in any incarnation.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS CHINESE!!!!","review":"WHEN I GOT THE HARD DRIVE I PUT IT IN MY 360, AND IT DOES NOT SAY 20GB!

You are basically paying $80 for a hard drive for 360 that people are giving away on craigslist for computers.I haven't had any functional problems with it, but then again I would expect that from most any hard drive manufacturer. The space is enough to store a small amount of songs and a half dozen demos at a time (and of course your saved games).The only reason I could find to rate this higher is that without it your 360 would be crippled, but I really don't think making an expensive hard drive required is a good thing.

It is not uncommon for a drive to be falsely advertised by a a small amount of space. However 2/3 of what of what is advertised is unacceptable. It would be the equivalent of getting a 640 GB hard drive when it was advertised as being 1tb. Also this is a huge rip off considering you could buy a 250 GB external hard drive for the same price. In my opinion you would be better off buying a 16 GB flash drive for under $20 because there is more storage, it is half the cost, and its portable so you can put your gamer profile on it and game at your friends house using your profile."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"great buy for the price holds all the games you would possibly need and works easily. connector part a little loose but makes no difference.

If you have to purchase it with your own funds, I suggest you don't. This biography is unauthorized, so the band doesn't have anything to do with it. All it is, basically, is some British woman talking about the band for an hour. There are occasional sound bites of things that the actual band members said, but these don't last long. I've listened to this CD once. If you really want to know more about the band, go ahead and get it. But it is kind of boring if that's not what you're looking for.

I was hoping to hear of individual biographies of each member. Or maybe to hear the band members themselves talk about their experiences - but instead we get 5 second snipets of the band talking over the phone to an interviewer.

The producers brought in Kenneth Tobey -- \\"The Thing from Another World\\" -- to help get it off the ground. A little more of him in the film might have helped. We also get a food first glimpse of a very young Lee Van Cleef. If you want to know how they did monsters before computer graphics, the answer is Ray Harryhausen. He was the father of most today's movie special effects. The superb giant dinosaur in this movie is his creation.\\"Them\\" is probably one of my all time favorites primarily because of the intergral way in which the monsters -- giant ants -- fit into the movie. There was no doubt that the movie was about Them and was among the first to blame perfect, giant mutations on atomic bomb radiation. I'd call it the classid B-grade sci-fi movie. An entertaining watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in color!","review":"Amazon lists these classics as being in color. They are not.

After she opened her present, I spent a few minutes looking over each stone. There was no scratches, no visible imperfections with the settings.My mom has sensitive ears. She has a hard time find earrings that won't irritate and cause infections; the 14K gold seems to not affect her ears. She wears them all the time as a result. It makes me slightly jealous.

Fun to watch for about five minutes, but Cage goes on and on and on, with ever more weird and over the top acting, a silly accent, and illogical reactions. Is it a study of the horror of a businessman going mad, is it a comedy about corporate avarice, or is just a lousy movie with an actor being as self-indulgent as only a big ham can be?

Too shamelessly postpunk for musical dabblers, you say, yet too averse to 100 percent thrash 'n' thump for hardcore punk fans? Perhaps. But that leaves a lot of listeners, and for us, \\"Talk in Circles\\" is an addictive record. Its 60-plus minutes come at you in fierce little waves, with peerlessly yowling vocals over arrangements incorporating elements of free jazz, country, folk, da blooz, and (lest we forget) large dollops of thrash 'n' thump. And it's all delivered (and produced) with the kind of sharply focused garage-rock clamor a band just can't fake. The lyrics express various shades of self-doubt, frustration, and disappointment, but the music signals the band's fierce determination to survive.

I even wrote down that the album was good enough to buy. I went on secondspin and bought it eventually.It took me about a year to get around to spinning it again as there is so many other cds hogging my ear. Well, we got a problem. The album has 20 tracks and it takes an hour to finish it. I'm really disappointed here. I'm putting it back on my shelf knowing I'll never spin it again.It sounds like the White Stripes except less interesting. There wasn't really any tracks that caught my ear. I regret this purchase.

There actually are a couple decent songs, but it also might be good if it was their 4th or 5th album, you when bands go to the desert to find themselves. They just re invented themselves after being a band for about one year, when they should have stayed true to their roots. If you want to hear a good Willowz record, buy the first one \\"Willowz s/t\\".Vortex 2.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing lets it down","review":"When I bought this CD, near the beginning of my classical listening career, my reaction was very negative, due to the very rough character of the orchestral playing. On revisiting this recording, I find a capable interpretation from the conductor, with fine, characterful instrumental soloists - but the ensemble playing is still very rough, to the point that it makes pleasurable listening difficult.This recording is attibuted to Henry Adolph, but I think this is a pseudonym for Anton Nanut, who recorded all the Mahler cycles with his Slovakian orchestra (I recommend his recordings of symphonies 1, 5 and especially 6). I discarded the Point Classics CD years ago, but I now have a recording of 4 on the Cantus label, credited to Nanut, which I believe is the same recording as this. I've heard mention of a Nanut recording that uses a boy singer, but it's a soprano on both this CD and the Cantus one."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one else is writing songs like this...","review":"While this disc is not as good as \\"I See a Darkness\\" (certainly a member of the proverbial \\"deserted island disc list\\"), \\"The Letting Go\\" is terrific. BPB is so creatively prolific, giving his fans twists and turns that are almost always welcome (the disc with Tortoise is an odd choice, however). Standout tracks include \\"Love Comes to Me\\", \\"Cursed Sleep\\" and the title track, which maintains BPB's mystique as much as anything he's ever written. Any fan of Americana should begin to include the work of BPB in their disc collection. As a fellow with more than 500 discs, I can safely say that there isn't much more rewarding, thought-provoking music in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful; True to Form","review":"When I was told that this album had strings on it to accompany the guitar, I was skeptical. Then I listened to it. The string accompaniment works beautifully. I don't know from what well Will Oldham draws the emotion with which he has performed album after album, but it runs deep and dark. The Letting Go is just another in his long line of exceptional albums that consistently deliver in terms of songwriting, music, and performance. I whole-heartedly recommend this album to both new listeners and long-time fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifico","review":"Bonnie 'Prince' Billy reste, avec cet album, l'un des songwriter les plus innovant et exigent de ces deux dernières decennies.

Probably Windows users looking to bash the Mac. Sorry, but if you're looking to move into the future, for work, for school, for design, for entertainment, you can't beat this.

If you want to have the original releases then buy Harry Belafonte'sindividual (3) All Time Greatest Hits CDs as Vol. 1, 2 & 3 if they're still available. LuckilyI have these. Lately greatest hits compilations are NOT true to the original recordingsbecause the producer NEVER heard the songs as a youngster. You would be betteroff reading reviews from people who lived in the era when the songs were popular.It's too bad when a major label like RCA can't find someone to verify the authenticityof the recordings.

Some of the guitar soloing reminds me of Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath, while the bluesy solos sound a bit like Ritchie Blackmore.I think the lead singer is like the guy from the Texas rock band, Bloodrock, who released their first album in 1970 as well. Sometimes he comes off kind of obnoxious, like in \\"Ritual\\" where it's REALLY hard getting into those vocals the first time you hear them. With some time and patience however, it all seems to click.\\"Vulture Blood\\" is just a really good heavy rock song with a speedy guitar riff and fast vocals. Good stuff. \\"Burning\\" should have been a classic because the vocals are really spectacular, the organ work is just brilliant, and the guitar solos are comparable to Deep Purple (and that's a compliment!)Overall, just quality hard rock from the early 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver for 1st year Law Student Torts Class","review":"When I ordered this book, I was skeptical it would be of much use, and didn't even pick it up to help me study until the night before my final.

The answers on the flash cards are seldom, if ever, sufficient for an A in a class and sometimes they are just flat out wrong.Also, there are like 1000 flash cards which makes it difficult to go through them all quickly.

These cards make for a great supplemental study aid. The best feature, in my opinion, is the \\"scenario\\" questions. These are like mini-fact patterns designed to get you thinking about one particular issue. I've found these to help get my mind around particular topics in a format conducive to an essay style exam (which all of my instructors use). I do wish that the cards had some more \\"concept w/definition\\" cards (where one side gives a word, concept, or issue, and the answer side has a rote definition), but it's not a major issue.

What's more, the classic \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" song is hardly heard at all here. It's heard throughout the ENTIRE ride, Gore.If you're in the mood for a pirate movie, I guess this is the place to come (although don't overlook the underrated \\"Pirate Movie\\" from the early 80s).

All in all an excellent family movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly kids' stuff, and way too long!","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this movie -- basically mindless entertainment. And it was somewhat entertaining, though VERY cliched, for about the first hour. The scenery is beautiful and the cast is great. But, as other reviewers said, there are WAY too many interminable sword fights and marine battles. And my God, why did they make this film almost 2-1/2 hours long? I was getting restless after 90 minutes, and after two hours I finally threw in the towel. Johnny Depp isn't bad, but as other viewers said, many times he races through his lines so fast that you can't understand them, which I find VERY frustrating and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun...","review":"I had went into this movie with a lot of skepticism but when I walked out, I had come to really enjoy this movie. I have to say that this movie was truly Johnny Depp's showcase. Here, he shined. It wasn't the best movie of the summer because it ran quite long and at times dragged. But overall, I will buy it when it comes out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I can't believe this much fun in a movie is legal! Johnny Depp plays a delightfully cracked Captain Jack Sparrow. I absolutely love this movie. I've seen it three times in the theatre already and I love it more every time. I could see it at least a couple more times! The Must See Movie of the Year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Pirates of the Caribbean is by far the best movie ever!Great plot, great cast, great action!BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped wrong item","review":"Very disappointed to open package and it was not what I bought.

Now I have to deal with sending it back and pay the return shipping out of my own pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This is the #1 movie of the centry.

That being said, he completely saved this film. Had anyone else taken the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie would have been unwatchable. The plot is cookie cutter, and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, while very hot, is laughable. It's pretty obvious that Will Turner is not supposed to be the guy we think rocks. At least, I hope he isn't, cause he was pretty dumb. In any case, Johnny Depp could deliver something written by Robert Jordan and make it seem like pure genius, and so the film wins out. The cinematography is beautiful and the skeletons are pretty damn cool. Geoffrey Rush does great as the pirate villain, and has his \\"arrgs\\" down perfectly. This film is worth a viewing. Or 20 while you drool over the awesomeness that is Johnny Depp."},{"rating":"2","title":"what fun","review":"This is a fun movie for the whole family.

Yes, I, like so many before me looked forward to seeing this movie. It seemed to have badass pirate-itude in all the trailers. What happened? I watched this movie, and saw what could best be described as an \\"attempt\\" at a good pirate movie. They had everything they needed to make one....except a good script. Next time lets hope they write thier way into something good. This movie totally jumped the shark.When I found out it was made by Disney, my disgust turned more to pity. I haven't seen a good movie by these folks since the Lion King. Considering who made it, its very good. That said, this movie gets two stars, and I am being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, if not great movie","review":"I saw it in theaters, of course, so I have no idea as to extras on the DVD, but it is a very funny, good movie. I went since my daughter is a fan of Orlando Bloom & he is not hard on the eyes for me either. The movie, itself, was very entertaining. Johnny Depp was hilarious & I am not a huge fan of his, since his films are so inconsitent, in my mind. My only complaint would be the soundtrack @ times overwhelmed but in home you can always turn it down. My other complaint is that @ times there was too much going on on screen. It could have used more close-up then cut to action (like LOTR) as in fight scenes but that was minimal. I took my 4 yr old to see it, telling her 1st that it might get scary but she was scared for only a second.Wait after credits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, but the blooper bothered me too","review":"I too was disturbed that Will \\"killed\\" his own father by ending the curse, but aside from that little flaw, the movies WAS fantastic and Johnny Depp should win an Oscar nomination at least. The special effects were perfect and the rest of the performances were outstanding too. I loved the performance of the two British soldiers who did a great homage to Laurel and Hardy!Can't wait to add this DVD to my collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo-ho yo-ho a pirates life for me!","review":"The greatest movie I\`ve ever seen!

Johnney Depp was milding amusing, but the living dead pirate crew were just too dumb. I almost fell asleep a couple of times, and couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKES A GOOD NIGHT LIGHT","review":"This movie is awful. It's full of everything that's been done ad nauseum in the pirate-action-adventure genre, so there's nothing new or original. It is a very boring movie; very tedious. Johnny Depp's talent was virtually wasted, and I feel for him. The only thing worth noting is that a couple of the scenes are right out of the Disneyland ride of the same name. This no doubt will benefit both ventures. If you need a night light, pop this one into your player."},{"rating":"1","title":"something for everyone","review":"If your a kid who likes pirates, this is your movie. Plenty of action and adventure on the high seas. If your a guy, youll like Keira Knightley. ( very pretty AND a good actress) If your a lady, well its Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. If your a real pirate, think again. The bonus features offer 10 , yes 10 , hours of extras including bios of real histoical pirates and a behind the scenes look at how they made the ships, costumes and characters as accurate as possible. Johhny Depp deserves the most praise as the sometimes inept pirate Jack Sparrow. A very interesting portrail of a pirate. If you like Johnny in this , also try From Hell or Sleepy Hollow. I didnt really think Mr. Depp was a very good actor, but I was VERY wrong. Sorry about that Captain Jack, please dont make me walk the plank. Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"widescreen annoying","review":"Ordinarily our DVD can fill the screen on any widescreen movie, but this one is preprogrammed to override your DVD player settings giving you big fat black lines top and bottom. Friends of ours complained about the same effect on their widescreen rearprojection TV. Great movie, but who wants to spend 140 minutes looking at a tiny picture on a big TV set? I guess the people who produced the DVD want everyone to go out and buy a 10,000 dollar plasma TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"You can't go wrong with this exciting and FUNNY movie! I highly recommend it. Great story. Great acting. Great special effects!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Good movie on it's own. Has very little (other than tribute scenes) to do with the ride of the same name."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.99999 stars.","review":"i ecpected a boring horror movie when i saw hthe previews with the skelotons. to my surprise pirates was spectacular. the best part was definitly the wonderful script. every scene was accompanied by a great line. a must see 12 times. the only bad thing about pirates was that there is one part of the plot that is unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I really liked the movie, Pirates of the Carribean. I am 11 years old and really enjoyed learning about pirates from the second disk. It tells about the different kinds of pirates, the boats they used and their daily life. I found out that pirates preferred small boats with one large sail because they were faster. Also a pirate's life is difficult because of bad food, water and no dental care. I found out their three main weapons were swords that were shorter than normal with only one sharp side, the captain had a pistol, and small knives called daggers. The boats had cannons. They would follow their target, to see if it was worth taking the ship. They would often fly a flag from a friendly country then raise the skull and crossbones, black flag when they attacked. They also liked to terrorize the other crew with shouting and hand grenades. I thought it was a very interesting and funny movie. So parents go buy this DVD because your kids will learn alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever","review":"the movie was the best movie I ever saw I wached it at my friends she just got it for the holidays I really like seeing skelatins fighting That was my favorite part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for kids","review":"This movie has too many swashbuckling sword fight sceens.

It had the feel of a film shot over a period of years. The characters changed personality to fit each moment as though they'd forgotten who they were yesterday. The special effects got tiresome. It was like having to listen to a car salesman chatter on what the car could do on the road when all you want is to get out there and drive. Pirates of the Caribbean reminds me of those never-seen-in-a-theater films that turn up on cable TV. You'll long for a commercial break!P.S.

I just finished seeing it for the 5th time and it's still as marvelous as it was the first time.

Children will probably love it, although some of the special effects may be a little to horrible for very young kids.I thought it started quite well, but by the time I was 3/4 of the way through I was looking at my watch, and with about 15mins to go I gave up and turned over to watch something else. The film was much to long at 143mins. Few films justify being over 2 hours, and this film provided ample evidence of that.A waste of Johnny Depps undoubted talent. I shall not be watching the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have rented this instead of buying it....","review":"I think this movie is okay. Johnny Depp is excellent in this movie, but the story line gets old quickly. There are a few surprises in the end, but over all I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED!","review":"I had heard so much about this movie that I couldn't wait to see it. I was very dissapointed.I am a big Disney fan so this review is not anti-Disney.Much like movies based upon video games, movies based upon theme park rides just don't work. Or haven't worked yet. This movie had everything you could ask for. Major Stars, Major Director, Major Producer but NO PLOT. That is not fair of course it had a plot, just not a good one. And the plot that they did have has so many holes in it that as the end I was left asking myself \\"did I really just see what I thought I did?\\"Special effects were great, but once again studios don't care about the writing. How can you have a good movie without a good script?But it all comes down to box office and since this one made millions, there will be more like it and the Hulk and Dare Devil and the list could go on forever.Save your time and money. Skip this one.BUTAt least it wasn't Charlie's Angels 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats Interesting","review":"The movie was I shall say VERY INTERESTING not in the best of ways. Johnny Depp's acting was fairly good, while Orlando Bloom's acting STUNK!!!!!!!!

Orlando Bloom looked like a colonial beach bum."},{"rating":"2","title":":D !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D","review":"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The CGI work was really good. The fact anyone could make a movie incorporating so many touchstones of the Disney ride is interesting. Seems Walt, really did have good workers way back when. Hard to believe this was to be a one off when you see how popular it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's Wild Ride","review":"A number of years ago I lived not far from Disneyland in California, and one of my favorite rides was Pirates of the Caribbean. When I first heard that the movie was being made, I had my doubts....most Disney films I had seen just didn't appeal to me. What a pleasant surprise!!! I was stunned by this movie. The acting was superb, all around. There was not one actor who did not do a tremendous job. The special effects went way beyond my expectations, and the music is still going round in my head. As for the DVD, the bonus materials alone are worth the price of the DVD. I especially enjoy the bloopers reel! It is hysterical. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. \\"Drink up me hearties, Yo Ho!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic film...A great DVD!!","review":"When I first saw previews for this film it didn't interest me at all as it looked too cheesey and bland. But after hearing all the rave reviews from friends and the media I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did by the end of the movie I walked out of the theater in awe. This movie had everything I could ask for -action/adventure/comedy/suspence/romance/horror all wrapped into one. Plus not to mention a great cast that just made the movie more outstanding. Johnny Depp is one of the most elite actors out there today and his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is beyond belief.Pirates of the Caribbean was a welcomed surprise as every now and then a movie that comes out that manages to capture lightning in a bottle, this film does that flawlessly. I can only hope that the sequel will be just as good.The 2 disc DVD set has loads of extras from concept art to deleted scenes and will keep you entertained for hours on end.This is a must have for anyone's movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pirates series is awesome","review":"Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom.

You know that her lover will follow to save her life and you know who Elizabeth will end up with......oh but I still have hope for my boy Norrington! But I have to say the CGI was amazing and the acting was very good. At times I forgot that Depp was playing Jack because his performance was so good. Along with adventure there is comedy, action and romance.It's a great escape movie and I strongly recommend it.I'm looking forward to the sequels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates, A Cursed Treasure, Clashing Swords And A Lovely Lady Too!","review":"'Pirates of the Caribbean' released in '03 is nothing less than non-stop entertainment from start to finish. Disney certainly fooled me on this one. When I first learned they were going to produce a major film based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at their amusement park only one word came to my mind, BOMB. Boy was I ever wrong.Johnny Depp is marvellous as Captain Jack Sparrow, the \\"best pirate\\" you'll ever see as is Geoffrey Rush in the role of the villianous Captain Barbossa. Orlando Bloom proves himself up to the task holding his own against such stellar actors as Depp and Rush and Kiera Knightley is not only as lovely as ever but proves she's more than just a pretty face.Action/Adventure - Comedy - Romance.

Popcorn and soft drinks all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Have Won The Oscar!","review":"You will watch this movie over and over and over and over .... The special features and out-takes are great. Although I am not a big Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom fan, they were both FANTASTIC! Captain Jack Sparrow and his antics were some of the most entertaining bits I've seen in quite some time. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa is unbeatable and I only hope they can resurrect him for the sequel. One of the best parts of the movie is the crew.

The movie contains everything for a more than enjoyable film. There is romance, adventure, and wonderfully played humor. Johnny Depp is purely brillant! His is funny and very fun-loving to watch. He is definetly the [bset looking] pirate I've ever seen. You cannot keep your eyes off him when he is on the screen. Kiera Knightly plays her character well, too. It is nice to see that she is not a whimp and can stand her ground while surrounded by pirates. Orlando Bloom plays the hero, which is many times hard to play because it is sometimes a very limited roll to expand on, but he really does take charge of his roll and does not let the audience down. This movie is just fun and wonderful. It is so very nice and refreshing to have a movie break away from the monotonous sequal dominated summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! THE most fun you'll have all summer!","review":"I have seen this movie twice and plan on seeing it again tonight! This movie is by far the best and takes disney to a place it's never been before.

This is a must-see movie! Even the music captivates you and takes you full force into the Caribbean! This movie ROCKS! I want everyone I know to see it! If I could give it 6 stars, I would've! Go see this movie!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As much fun as the ride","review":"Pirates is an interesting concept in and of itself being based on a Disneyland ride. Only Disney could make it work.Johnny Depp, in my opinion, finally found his role. The part of a not quite bumbling pirate captain was perfect for him. His character was realistic and fun. He took it over the top (in a good way).Orlando Bloom proved that he is more than a Tolkien elf by being an able swashbuckler. He also did well as the straight man to Depp's antics.The cinematography was beautifully done and the CGI was seamless especially during the fight scenes.Well worth the two hour wait in line."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER","review":"I love this movie becuase there was so much action and because I couldn't sit still for even one second during this movie. I couldn't think of a better cast and crew to do this movie. I think this is the best movie this year event though some critics don't like the movie. I think it is because they have something against pirates or something. Well that is what I think about this fantastic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! does not even begin to express it!","review":"I rarely pay movie prices to see a film at the theater, but I did go see this one! It's Fantastic! I was reading some of the other reviews and I have to say that I was surprise at one saying it was too long. I saw it three days ago. I'm not a clock-watcher, but I was amazed to read that it was a 2 1/2 hour movie! I had no idea I was in there for that long - it totaly took me out of time for the duration.Johnny Depp is fantastic. I've always liked him, but this was extra fabulous. Orlando even has us 40 year olds drooling - good looking and a great performance to boot.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I will definitely buy it on DVD. I don't think I will take the kids (8 and 11) to see it at the theater because even though overall it's not a horror film, there are some scenes that in the dark of the theater, on the big screen and with the loud surround sound going on would probably terrify them, but they will LOVE it on DVD, I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure entertainment!

Simply put, this movie was (and still is) GREAT FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite \\"Pirate\\"","review":"I have to admit, I originally went to see the Pirates of the Caribbean because I wanted to see Orlando Bloom. But when I saw that Johnny Depp appeared, his careless and casual way attracted everyone to him. He was witty and funny-looking, making me one of the millions of the fans obsessed with Johnny Depp. On the other side Orlando was an expert swordsman and later he and Johnny Depp made the perfect pirate pair. Also Orlando Bloom has wonderful love with the heroine. I have to talk some about the skeletons because they are so powerful. They got cursed from the missing coins, so they must find the coins and correct them; otherwise they would never die, so they gave lots troubles to Johnny and Orlando. So it made the story became more interesting. Formerly I never liked a role so quickly and so profoundly as Johnny Depp's role. So it's a recommended movie for anyone who likes action, humor and adventure, and it's a good entertaining movie. I hope you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny's best film ever!!!!","review":"The reason I went to see this film in the cinema was because Orlando Bloom was in it but when I saw Johnny Depp I thought he was so much better. He's just such a brilliant actor plus hes got the looks as well. Johnny plays the character of Captain Jack Sparrow very well and the way he acts and talks is in a very unique way. Johnny Depp deserved the Oscar for this film because he did his very best (as usual) and produced a magnificent film!! Well Done Johnny we love you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! No other pirate movie will ever be able to compete!!!","review":"WOW!!! I have never seen a better blockbuster than this. I've seen it three times and I just want to go back again and again. Orlando Bloom is HOTT and Johnny Depp is absolutely hilarious. There's so much action and it just doesn't stop. This movie doesn't lack anything. It has adventure, romance, comedy, great graphics, scary moments, fantasy,and most important Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. I give it 5 STARS. I'ld give it more but I'm not allowed.

The first film shows not only pirates but ugly rotton skeletal figures representing pirates. The captain of one ship drinks some rum and the liquid just drips through his skeleton.All of the films are too long also. The second film shows Captain Jack Sparrow holding a thumping human heart. The first one and all of them have some language in them. The violence isn't graphic but it has a little humor in it. There's some humor in the films but the stories aren't too enjoyable. Some violence is way too long. I don't like the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid crap.","review":"The plot: There's not much of one, just a bunch of pirates swinging swords and yelling things like \\"Ay, Me Matey!\\"My opinion: This movie is a must miss. Similar to other crap shows based off of freakin' rides, like the Haunted Mansion, or The country Bears, this movie sucks. There is nothing good about it, not even remotely.The Overall: The acting, diecting etc. wasn't bad, but nothing can save this tragedy.DVD: Not as good as it could have been.conclusion: Not that good, actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrgh Its' boring","review":"Maybe I can't stand pirate movies, maybe I cant' stand Disney films minus the Pixar name, maybe its' just this movie was boring for me. I cared nothing for any character or plot. The visuals were nice and Johnny Depp provided some amusement but overall he wasn't enough. Did anyone notice that the movie is set in the Caribbean and there are about 3 black people in the movie. Gee maybe asking for a smidgen of realism is too much, but dang guys its the West Indies. I just hated this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of trash ever.","review":"Simply the worst movie ever made. It's Johnny Depp selling out wearing eyeliner and dressing like a silly pirate for 143 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Disney work","review":"I love pirates and tales of adventure, so I was looking forward to watching this movie. But it turns out, unfortunately, that this is a typical Disney movie, with the typical Disney humor. Complete with the two stupid bad guys, the dumb British old guy plus (new & improved!) the dumb British young guy, flawlessly beautiful, haughty heroine, and Orlando Bloom as the hero. I couldn't help laughing aloud to see that scrawny Bloom playing the part of a blacksmith's apprentice - ! The fact that the heroine gets stranded on a deserted island with a drunk pirate captain and presumably manages to avoid being raped also bothered me. It seems to me that the movie makers were most interested in the horror aspect of the film, which was interesting but totally sensational and, I thought, redundant.Johnny Depp's performance was great, of course, but it couldn't save the movie. The soundtrack is very enjoyable. I'd rather listen to it than watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was with all the hype?","review":"Everyone told me this was the best movie ever, so when I got a hold of a copy of it, I decided to watch it, thinking it had be pretty good for everyone to get that excited about it. It started out dumb, but I thought it had to get better. No one would love this movie that much if it stayed that stupid, so I kept on watching. Apparently it didn't have to get better, because it only got worse. I won't say that it was the worst movie ever. I have seen some movies that only deserve half a star, and this one did deserve the whole thing. I think the only good part of the movie was Johnny Depp's twitch. That was pretty funny, but other than that, it's not worth the time or effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates from Heaven","review":"This was a TrUlY amazing movie. I was really surprised about how good it is. It has a little of something for everyone: comedy,romance,scary parts,and action and adventure.Comedy: Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) makes this movie so funny for all ages.Romance: Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightly) and Will Turner(Orlando Bloom)have a romance going on in the middle of this movie which ties in perfectly with a pirate movie.Scary Parts: When the pirates are in the moonlight they turn into freaky skeletons. They are a little too intense for smaller children.There is also a pretty freaky monkey!!Action and Adventure: There is plenty of this because duh! it's a pirate movie. Will and Captain Jack have an amazing battle at the start of the movie.Overall, this was a outstanding movie that has great acting, directing, and battles. I can't wait to experience this movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollicking Good Fun","review":"This is probably the best pirate movie I have ever seen. It is hard to tell if it is gered toward kids but adults can like it too, or vice-versa. Mr. Depp makes the quintessential anti-heroe. They need to make a sequel all about Jack Sparrow, forget the subplots!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous entertainment","review":"Johnny Depp is sensational in this movie. It is packed with action and has an interesting plot. It was also great to see Orlando Bloom in something so totally different than his LOTR trilogy role as the blonde elf Legolas. Romance, swashbuckling, great effects. Fun for nearly all ages. Some of the pirate scenes might be too graphic for small children, but otherwise I would recommend it for kids over 5 or 6 if they are used to viewing action movies. I thought it was charming and I disagree with the 32 year old who thinks she is too mature for this... I am 56 and I LOVED it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for Widescreen.","review":"You must watch this movie in widescreen, why cut off the sides to fill you screen? You will be missing the movie.

Definitely watch this movie, and its sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew this would be THIS good?","review":"Believe the hype. This is the best summer \\"blockbuster\\" to come along in years. Maybe decades. I'm thinking since \\"Raiders\\".This is a movie that will appeal to an impossibly broad spectrum of filmgoer. Fans of \\"old movies\\" will marvel at the delirious swordfights and the appropriately hammy performances. Post-modern elitists will giggle at the witty screenplay and Depp's perfect performance...he's taking the material straight on, yet simultaneously winking at the audience. Kids and teens will love the action, the jokes and the walking skeletons.Seriously. There's a reason this made a couple of hundred millions dollars this summer. It's a film everyone can like."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen Pirates for the first time...in HD!","review":"Amazing quality. This blu ray edition really pushes both video and audio to the limit.

I got quick response emails in regards to the order. It was shipped quickly and was in perfect shape. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PIRATE TALE","review":"Don't let the fact that this is a movie based on Disney theme ride and made by Disney. It's not a kids movie although it's perfectly fine for kids as well.It's a nice throwback to the kind of swashbuckling pirate movies of the 40's. Johnny Depp is fanatastic in his over the top performance of the slightly foppish and drunk, Captain Jack Sparrow. Jack is trying to get his ship back from a rival pirate played by Geoffrey Rush.Orlando Bloom is along and actually does most of the swashbuckling as he tries to rescue his love from Rush and joins forces with Depp.Maybe slighly scarey for very young kids as Rush's crew turns to skeletons in the moonlight due to a curse which they are trying to lift.Great battle sequences with the vintage ships and strong swordfights. Romance and comedy thrown in to boot. A rousing adventure.The DVD has many very good extras including multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, making of feature, pirates history, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say....","review":"Johnny Depp makes this movie worth watching. I recommend buying this DVD simply because Johnny Depp does such an amazing job of portraying Capt. Jack Sparrow. His voice, his mannerisms, and the way he handles each scene make him such a delightful on-screen presence. This was definitely one of the more entertaining and fun movies of the summer and one any action movie lover should own. As far as extras are concerned, the deleted scenes are nothing special and the commentary is pretty standard fare, but can be informative if you can sit through it. Just buy the DVD for the movie itself, and if you have the spare time navigate through all the extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"a swashbuckling thrill!","review":"I have seen this movie only once, and it is definitely my absolute favorite movie of the year.The plot is exciting to the very end, shocking at times, and johnny depp is absolutely delicious as captain Jack Sparrow.If you have never seen this movie, I sincerely reccomend trying it. It is suspenseful, thrilling, and jam-packed full of exciting special effects. The humor is absolutely perfect, and both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are WONDERFULL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun","review":"Excellent family film. Disney has done it again.

If you haven't seen it you really really should!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best films of the year","review":"i saw this movie twice in the theater. i absolutely loved it. it was definitely worth going to see. i think of it as one of those films that you have to see in theater in order for you to get the full impact. Johnny Depp took a character and made him unforgettable. a lot of people thought this was going to be a serious movie, but it wasn't. sure, it had it's serious parts, but it was also a comedy, romance, action/adventure mixed with a little bit of horror. if you haven't seen this film i beg you to see it. it's like a redifined Arrol Flynn movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, Horror, Comedy, and Romance all in one package.","review":"I think Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is this summers best movie. I was looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the preview for the first time. I loved every minute of this movie. The action in this movie is awesome and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The sword fights are very fun to watch. This movie is scary in a lot of places especially with the cursed pirates (which is where the special effects are the best). Johnny Depp is very hilarious in this movie, and he does a great job not to go overboard with his humor. Plus there is a little bit of romance in the movie that takes place but it doesn't happen until towards the end of the movie. This is one of those few movies that charms the audience plus it outstays its welcome. If I could see a movie twice, it would be this one. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it! You don't know what your missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Time To Be Had By All","review":"Simply put, this movie is amazing. You might think that a movie based on a ride is going to be horrible, but this movie is well acted from an excellent script. It isn't like you don't know the ending early on in the movie, but you don't know the many amazing twists, and the history behind the Black Pearl and its curse. Johnny Depp, who plays Captain Jack Sparrow, gives an unforgettable performance - really. It is definitely the must-see movie of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time","review":"I am very happy to see a really good summer movie. This movie is original and amazing.

A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A side-splitting, swashbuckling adventure!","review":"Pirates of the Caribbean is a delightful summer film filled with pirates, gold, monkeys, and the almighty eye-candy. So far it has $275 million at the box office and still remains near the top of the charts.Depp plays Captin Jack Sparrow, an alcoholic pirate who escapes from an island and meets up with Will the blacksmith, played by Orlando Bloom. When Will's love intrest Elizabeth is captured by a hoard of pirates, it's up to Will and Jack to follow the cursed ship the 'Black Pearl' and save Elizabeth from certain death.'Pirates' is a film that has wonderful comedy and jaw dropping special FX scenes.

Starring Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow), Orlando Bloom (LOTR trilogy), and Kiera Knightley (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace), it mixes suspense, swashbuckling action, and humor. The story is about a rogueish pirate and a young, straightlaced blacksmith teaming together to rescue a fair maiden from enemy pirates, who happen to turn into skekletons in the moonlight. The thing I like about it is it's a sword-clashing adventure for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Caribbean- The Curse of the Black Pearl","review":"Great Movie.

Depp is excelent, he acted very well in this film and his charector(Jack Sparrow) has an interesing personality. The special affects are excelent. My favorite part is when the evil cpn. Barbosa says \\"you better believe in ghost stories, your in one\\" and then becomes a skeleton kind of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best movie of the summer of 2003 besides X2","review":"If you think this movie is just another kiddie flick from Disney, then you either have no exposure to the media or you are completely prejudiced and narrow-minded about Disney for adults. This movie ROCKED! This is the second time I saw Johnny Depp. The first was in Edward Scissorhands. He was great in that but his role in Pirates makes his performance as Edward seem like Jerry O'Connel in Kangaroo Jack. This movie has it all: plenty of famous actors, Bloom for the teenage girls, Knightley for the younger ones, and a heck of a lotta action. Bring on the sequel! I hope they do as well with POTC 2 as they did with X2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Movie of the 21 Century","review":"This is by far the best movie I've seen since I don't know when. I know everybody probably gets tired of hearing \\"Oh my gosh Johnny Depp was incredible!\\" but it's true. The who movie is a masterpeice wort seeing again and again. The proformances the director gets out of his actors are astonishing. The special effects are brilliant, and the whole movie in general seems to give off some kind of aura making you feel like you're in the movie. OK now I'm running out of big words to call this movie, but they're a 100% true. If this isn't your perfect dream movie, your having bad dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp is awesome!","review":"The funny thing is I went to watch this movie only because Orlando Bloom was in it but now am completely obsessed with Johnny Depp! He did an amazing job in it and deserves a best actor nomination (at least) for this part. This movie had everything a good film has: action, humor, romance, it's just fantasic! The special effects were outstanding, don't know what else to say, it was just great!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Summer Movie!!!","review":"This was a great movie! I'd been waiting months to see PoTC and when it came out I was not dissapointed! Johnny Depp was amazing. He IS Captain Jack Sparrow! Love the pirate makeup! Of course Orlando Bloom was just as awesome as Will. And he's hot! The special effects are great, especailly when the pirates turn from human into skeleton, and vice versa. The movie has many memorable lines that I'll probably be quoting for the next 6 months, along with singing the yo-ho song. Another great thing about Pirates is that it kept true to the ride, from the prisoners trying call the dog holding the keys to the man sleeping with the pigs to the different lines every now and then, such as captain Barbossa yelling \\"Ya bloomin' cockroach!\\" I definitely give this movie 5 stars and reccomend it to anyone who's prepared to be \\"Blown out of the water.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best... Pirate... Movie... EVER","review":"I love pirates, and I'm one of the few that enjoyed the movie Cutthroat Island. This movie, though, is far far better. I was afraid it was going to be just 1hour 30minutes and no time to put a real plot in. But it's 2hours 30minutes! Very fast paced, egaging and complex plot, that keeps taking twists and turns, everything you can hope for! Johnny Depp's character is an absolutely perfect pirate... he's a trickster who plays all sides against each other and keeps you wondering what his true motives are. This movie's got humor, romance, suspense, horror, fantasy, adventure, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and of course PIRATES! I hope it will set off a trend for more pirate movies in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic.","review":"it's a pretty good film -- mainly because of johnny depp. a few holes in the plot, a few predictable moments, but overall entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depp is the best","review":"If you want a great family movie, this is the one. Pirates of the Carribbean comes to life from its original Disney World ride to take you on a thrilling journey with Captain Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly make a terrific love duo, but Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush make it complete with their pirate personas. No better classic to bring to life than this one, highly recommended for the whole family to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Sparrow just plain rocks","review":"I've always liked Johnny Depp but I've never been a huge fan of his... until now. His character, Jack Sparrow, is the sum of all hotness. Depp's acting was really top notch. He created this quirky, flamboyant, scuzzy pirate who just plain rocks. This movie also has some other people like that blonde elf guy but they honestly don't matter. Out of all the movies I've seen this summer (X-2, Matrix Reloaded, Finding Nemo, The Hulk, T3) This is the only one that I will buy the second it comes out. Go see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Johnny Depp is awesome!","review":"I just got home from the movie and I already want to see it again. This movie was totally awesome.

And if you want that, there are plenty of other movies you can watch that are far superior to this one. Also -- what was Johnny Depp THINKING? He slurs his words so much in this film that I couldn't understand most of them! This movie was just plain SAD. If you want to see Johnny Depp in a good role with swordfighting, rent Don Juan DeMarco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" will be the best movie in the summer of 2003.

Disney movies are known to be PG-rated, although this is rated PG-13 it still seems like a PG movie with all the \\"family-fun humor\\" in it.

I found the script vapid and Depp's staggeringly unsympathetic performance to be lackluster.Without having taken a sip of alcohol, I found myself falling asleep between musings about when this film was going to make some sense, or at least measure up to its considerable hype. I ordinarily enjoy this type of film but found this one boring. Maybe it's the easily-amused nature of many in today's viewing audiences that made them enjoy this film.

The big day came and I was one of the first in line to buy the new DVD. Problem was it was only available in wide screen format. Apparently I am still probably one of the only individuals in the US with a regular TV set, not a wide screen. I purchased the DVD anyway despite the annoying black lines on the top and bottom of my TV. The movie was so much fun that I was willing to watch it on my 32 inch screen even if it ment I could only view a 12 inch strip of it accross my regular TV. Problem was when I tried playing the bonus features on my computer. Even though I have a new computer with Windows XP, I still couldn't access the virtual features on the DVD. Conclusion: I'm highly dissapointed that such a wonderful film was marketed in such an awkward format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Playback","review":"I have a Samsung BDP 1000 - in the BD package from Disney you get 2 disks, one special features and the game and the movie itself. The movie is unplayable even with the latest firmware update for the player but strangely the Special features disk is fine. Unfortunately I am returning these 2 disney Pirates BD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ship is foundering!","review":"One of the silliest movies I have seen in awhile! An absolute waste of talent. Some of the special effects are interesting, but no movie should be based on that alone. The story is so confusing and contrived that I was bored with it half-way through and could barely keep my eyes open. Therefore, only two stars for this mish-mash of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOPE THE PIRATES LIFE IS NOT FOR ME","review":"The movie had good effects, there right the skeleton thing was cheesy.Had its entertainment, but i think the lady actor in the movie made it stupid. The whole thing of her being nice english girl and then ordering pirates to fight back. nah I only saw this movie because johnny depp is one of my favorite actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie!","review":"This movie has a wonderful combination of acting, screenplay, and special effects. Johnny Depp performs beautifully in this.I'm usually not a big fan of the widescreen, but I really don't mind the widescreen. I think that all of you people who are happy that it's only in wide screen format should stuff yourselves because not everybody likes the things that you like, thurr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Only OK","review":"The reason I didnt like this movie that much was that I couldnt stand looking at Johnny Depp. He looked like a woman with the black makeup around the eyes. I did not want to see a mannish woman jumping around"},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore summer blockbuster","review":"I must say I was very disappointed in this film. I was expecting a fairly exciting and intense action film with some good laughs and quirky characters.Instead I got medicore action scenes, barely giggles, and cardbored, forgettable characters. What really amazed me was that this movie had no centerpiece action sequence. There really wasn't a single action scene to remember the movie by, or a memorable moment period for that matter.This film is barely worth a rental, and definitely not worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depp pilages the show.","review":"First off, I don't like Bruckheimer's movies. So I wasn't that keen on seeing this. Plus the fact it is a Disney movie, that added another mark against it. When I heard Johnny Depp was playing a pirate and modelling his character on Keith Richards, I became intrigued. Depp is one of, if not the, premier actors around. As Jack Sparrow, he steals the show. The rest of the cast do excellent jobs also. The movie has a good pace, has some humour and some great effects. On DVD, it looks and sounds superb, with plenty of extras. Overall, a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"This movie was so awesome! I honestly didn't expect it to be so good with all the stupid moives that seem to be all the rage this year. But this one blew me away. The plotline was wonderful and Johnny Depp was a riot as Captian Jack Sparrow. It was also surprisingly clean of cussing and everything else, something that seems to be continuously lacking nowadays. I loved every minute of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed, doesn't allow pause and resume","review":"The movie itself is great and looks great. The problem is, say you pause this for a few minutes and come back to it or turn off your player and want to watch from where you left off, well you can't without spending 5 minutes getting through about 500 previews and warnings. It's a long movie, and unless you plan to sit through the entire thing in one sitting, don't bother. No bathroom breaks either!Disney has blown it with how they designed this disc. All my other Blu-rays work as they should. My DVD player 9 years ago picked up where movies left off after pausing or stopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!

The action is fun, scenery is incredible (this is probably one of the best Blu-Ray discs I have seen in terms of video quality), and jokes are funny for both young and not-so-young. I was pleasantly surprised because I expected this to be one of those over-hyped movies that your kids make you sit through, and it turned out to be a movie that I will watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"This is by far the best movie I've ever watched in my entire life.Johnny Deep plays the amusing Jack Sparrow, who is the main highlight of the movie. He's hilarious, he's odd, and you can never tell whose side he's really on until near the end.Kiera Knightly does well in the role of Elizabeth Swann, the governer's daughter and in the beginning, the holder of a cursed medallion that a group of pirates that can never be killed desire very much. She plays the modern girl stuck in old times, as well as the damsal in distress.Orlando Bloom acts as Will Turner, Elizabeth's admirer. (There's one in every story) Will goes on this adventure to save his beloved Elizabeth, only to relieze that to break the curse set upon them, the evil pirates of the Black Pearl require his blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"POTC ROCKS!!!","review":"POTC Rocks!! it is the best movie since sliced bread and will continue to be untill sliced jelly ( try and do that huh ).

Johnny Depp is a knucklehead in read life who keeps promising us he will move to France because of what he thinks of America, and Disney has been making so many non-child friendly movie that Walt Disney is turning over in his grave. Yet...This IS a very fun movie. It has humor, it does not drag, and its special effects are super except for the very final scene where the special effects as slightly overdone.The story leaves you wanting more (and they are making a sequel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best summer movie so far. Next to Nemo.","review":"I have to be honsest I wasn't expecting much. I am always iffy about movies produced by J. Bruckhimer, they are usually filled with more explosions than characters. While this movie does offer some good swash buckeling action, it was the most fun I've had at the movies so far this summer. It was full of surprises and always being a fan of J. Depp, he pretty much carried the movie, but the supporting cast was really good to. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!!","review":"i think it was the best movie of the summer id have to say johnny depp looked cute as a pirate hehe bye!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...a must see summer flick!","review":"I loved this movie so much, that I saw it for times. It's funny, action filled - without being to gory, and has wonderful actors. I only noticed one major mistake (when Captain. Jack Sparrow is making his 1st escape, he seems to throw his hand-cuff chain around a rope, and slide down on it...how did he manage that??), which is pretty good for me, because I'm one of those people who looks for faults. It has romance without being gushy, and tries to scare you in a funny way. The little hidden part after the credits is OK, but nothing spectacular, and you have to site through about 10 minutes of credits for a 2 minute extra. All in all, I loved the movie, and really recomend it to people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's Johnny","review":"What a great movie for the whole family. Johnny Depp true to form is superb in his character. I am never disappointed in a J.D. film. It's colorful. funny. action packed and great special effects. Can't wait till it's out on DVD. Well worth a trip to the flicks to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp, I bow down before you!","review":"What's this? A good Disney movie? How is that possible? This movie is simply the best movie of the year. Pirates have always been on the top of my list as \\"Dream Job,\\" however, I don't think I'm built for it. Oh well, the movie's awesome. Johnny Depp plays Keith Richhards, uh, I mean Jack Sparrow, THE MAN! Johnny Depp is absolutly astonshing. He really gets into the role. Also, there's Geoffrey Rush is THE Pirate. (I even heard him say ARRR!), and the plain badass. The plot is that Jack Sparrow wants to get his ship back from the evil Rush, who is planning to break the Curse Of The Black Pearl, which he and his crew has. The movie had some great action, and the characters were pretty interesting. I really liked the evil monkey. Worth seeing, GET IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The acting punctuates the movie","review":"After I have seen the movie, I would say Johnny Depp has given his lifetime performance. Being silent in the big screen for a while, finally he has grasped another excellent role besides the one in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. Perhaps, the role is not that great, but Johnny Depp decides to act the role in a camp way, which is absolutely fabulous to me. The role he has is a pirate who was betrayed by his shipmates long time ago, and his captain position was then taken over by Geoffery Rush. Stereotypically, a pirate is supposedly to be masculine (as Rush), but he adds a bit of femininity into the soul of the his role. Without Rush and Depp, the movie would not be as successful as it is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARE YOU READY FOR THE PIRATES?","review":"\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\" exceeded my expectations. Having heard it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, I was thrilled. But when I heard that director Gore Verbinski, who had done the horrendous \\"Mouse Hunt\\" and the overrated ghost thriller \\"The Ring,\\" was directing, and not to mention Walt Disney Pictures' first PG-13 rated film, my anticipation dimmed. Then I saw the finished product, and was amazed! The casting of the film was perfect, from Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow to Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. The action sequences, now a trademark of Jeryy Bruckheimer Films, are incredible, and ILM's horrid and disqusting dead pirate effects are brilliant. The film is by far Disney's best live-action film yet! Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live-action film yet for Walt Disney films!","review":"This film is the best film that Disney has in it's live-action collection! Every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life. I really like all the extras on the disc as well I like seeing how the film was created, looking at deleted scenes, learning about the history of real pirates, and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of Walt Disney himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!!!","review":"Oh my gosh!! This is one of the best movies i have ever seen!!! And Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, and Johnny Depp is in it!The DVD is GREAT because you can wath the actors go through sword training, get into makeup and so much more. Plus you get commentaries, behind the scenes stuff, pictures, and SOOOOOO much more! I would defenitely bye it if I were you!There was one part in the second disk that skipped a bit, but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bloody best movie ever!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I first saw this movie I loved it. the action was awesome the dioluge fine, and the acting lemme just tell you Johnny Depp-Jack sparrow. and ther was almost no gore in the fighting save for a few moments during rampages in boats and when Jack shot barbie-bosa. the story consists of barbosa and his crew of condemned pirates who have a curse set on them for stealing the gold of cortez. to break the curse they have to get the blood of the turner family with the madellion and all the gold in the exact-spot it was when they stole it. Elizabeth Swan the goveners doughter is the one who has madellion is kidnapped when the congdemned crew of Barbosa rampages port royal. Will Turner [the man that loves her]. then breaks a pirate named jack sparow out of jail and they together steal a ship fight pirates and rescue will's girl.Rted PG for action\\\\adventure violenceOverall this is an awesome movie and deserves every oscar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is one of those few hollywood blockbusters that actually deserves all of the attention it gets. Johnny Depp is great as Jack Sparrow, you never know what he's gonna do next. However, my favorite character in the movie was definitely Barbossa, played by Geoffrey Rush, what a character! The set-work is great and the visual effects are very good although you can really see the computer working those skeletons. But who cares! It's a very entertaining movie that's very funny, got some good action, and best of all a really engaging soundtrack that really propels the movie forward. I'd recommend this for children and adults as the humor can be shared by both. All in all, a very light-hearted movie with plenty of plot twists and action to keep you interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"pirates of the caribbean","review":"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl [Blu-ray]the movie is more crisp & cleaner & high def, more behind the scenes to watch.More pirates of the real Caribbean facts to learn. new documentaries to see & full behind the scenes as they put the movie together."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"yo ho, yo ho. A pirate's life for me\\"","review":"I confess, I saw this movie for the first time only recently. And I am now obssesed! I really only wanted to see it to drool over Orlando Bloom, but I just fell in love with it! My personal fave is Captain Jack Sparrow, he is hilarious! I can't wait to see the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Performances are over the top!!!!!!","review":"I have seen this movie twice and found it even funnier the second time around. I am sure that had to do with the fact that the first time, I didn't realize Jack Sparrow's character was based loosely on Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones. Johnny Depp does an amazing job. I think because of his good looks, no one gives him the credit he deserves as an actor. He's so smooth in this. He didn't even have to speak to make the film funny. He was Jack Sparrow. Should he get the oscar? It's hard to say because I haven't seen the other movies to compare. He should definetely get acknowledged in some way because his take on Jack Sparrow and his acting, were phenonmenal. On another note, the filming was incredible. It was such a beautiful mood piece. It took you back to another time and place. Coming from Disney, I was impressed. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Disney should Make More Like This","review":"Let me start off with saying that Johnny Depp was great in this movie. It had the potential to be horrible but I am glad to own it. I had heard enough praise about it to be confident enough to buy it without seeing it first. This movie had everything that I wanted it to have. Orlando Bloom who I liked already was great and he was played a stupid character but he managed to save the part. Johnny Depp was hilarious with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. This was Disney's first PG-13 movie in the U.S and I hope not the last. I've grown out of Disney but I was impressed. This is a must see and a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A\\" for Effort","review":"This movie was a decent viewing experience, even the third time (don't ask). The special features on disc two of the DVD prove that this was a huge production, so a four star rating is only fair, as you can't conciously give this movie a low rating. They did try. To watch or not to watch? Why not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The critics are wrong","review":"Pirates is a must see especially if you are a Disneyland Buff. It is very well done (although it could have been a little shorter)and very funny. It is not really for small children especially if they get nightmares but for everyone else it is a lot of fun. If you have been on the ride at Disneyland then it will be fun to watch out for some of the rides attractions that have been incorporated into the movie. I plan to see it a couple of more times to see if there are any hidden Mickeys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I LOVE Pirates of the Carribean! It is a great movie. As soon as I saw it I knew I needed to own it. At first I wasn't really sure how they were going to make a movie from a ride at Disney World. I have been on that ride and I really had some doubts. But I saw it anyway and I'm so glad I did. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are great together. Johnny is histerical and Orlando is just extremely good looking! I absolutely recommend this movie. I'm not really sure if your going to want to watch it with very young children though. Keep in mind that the pirates on the Black Pearl are cursed. Some of the scenes when they are ghosts might scare the little ones. But anyway, this is a great movie with a great cast. I suggest you watch it, right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"johnny is brilliant","review":"If you are a Johnny depp fan, you will fall in love with this awesome action and adventure flick, if you are not a Johnny Depp fan you will still enjoy the film. the special effects are amazing and the acting is brilliant especially from new comers keira knightley who plays Elizabeth swan and Orlando Bloom who plays the dashing young hero william. All in all an unforgettable motion picture where you,ve gotta hand it to Johnny who stole the show with his hilarious antics as Captain Jack Sparrow. Possibly one of the best films of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent movie, even for the guys.","review":"Never one to be a Johnny Depp fan (I hated Edward Scissorhands), I was \\"roped\\" into seeing this movie, and loved it so much I bought the DVD!

Excellent acting by all of the stars and at least Depp and the movie got some nominations and/or awards.

Not easy to get tired of.The only bad part is the deleted scenes. They aren't really \\"scenes\\", more like 10 second bits of scenes that were edited out for obvious reasons. It seems that the just wanted to be able to say they have 10 hours worth of extras and they just picked up all the crap on the editing room floor and called it an extras.I won't nock off a star for it since I am really just rating the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp is more than expected","review":"I wondered about this movie and I was not sure what to think. From the first time I watched it I fell in love. It is a good story- very well written- and the imagery is shockingly good!! The special effects are awesome and Johnny is wonderful. The opening scene is so good- as someone has already mentioned when he is on the sinking ship- I was just enchanted by him. Orlando Bloom is wonderful- and the sword fights are cool. You will watch this movie over and over!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't that right, Savvy?","review":"I can't help but be a bit bias about this movie. A movie with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is just so appealing to me, it hardly matters what the movie is about. But, even though I say that, I actually really did enjoy the plot. It was a bit cheesy, I can admit - especially when Elizabeth says \\"You like pain? Try wearing a corset\\". That was beyond corney. But you've got to take into account that this movie has to appeal to children as well as adults, as it is a children's movie. So I suppose corniness was just for the children's enjoyment. Other than that, this movie has it all: action, romance, humour, suspence and much more. And has the power to make you sit on the edge of your seat.

Aside from being too long, having too much gratuitous violence and endless scenes without structure or story line...this movie simply lacks any noticeable value and results in being another Hollywood release of little consequence. \\"Pirates\\" only required about 10 minutes to establish itself as a \\"bore\\", but proceeded to build a reputation for excellence in stale storytelling throughout the film with its trite dialogue, needless violence, and pathetic renderings of familiar scenes from Disney's famous theme park attraction the film was supposedly \\"based upon\\".

It just oozes badness. I can't think of one redeeming quality about it, even Depp, whom everyone said was the most entertaining part of the film. Instead he's the worst facets of his portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson melded with a rabies victim. The other performers are just as bad. The dialogue is horrific. It has every big blockbuster staple, even down to the screaming child alone in the street for some reason who is saved from a falling building at the last minute. Much of this movie I spent cringing. A waste of time, money, and human effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was horrible","review":"It's one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Pirates of the Caribbean is very overrated.

The whole movie turned out to be the longest bore I sat through this summer. All the sword fights were so incredibly dull and tedious that I wish they were taken out and replaced simply with Johnny Deppcharacter monologue. At least there is one character that is funny, alas 1 star.Aside from the Captain Sparrow there were no exciting characters in this mindless popcorn flick.

More than anything else this movie is painfully predictable. My wife and I suffered through this inane movie assuming it would become entertaining at some point.

There was supposed to be evil pirates, Jack Sparrow has to stop them. The commercials blatantly lied. What we have instead is common criminal pirates who are cursed. All they freakin want is to get the curse lifted from them. What's so evil about that? Jack Sparrow runs around in circles and acts like a fruit, managing to get caught all the time. Nothing they said in the commercials was true. After watching it once at the movie theatre I don't think I could stand to watch it again.If you like Disney family fare, this is for you. If you believed the lieing commercials, you are in for a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible movie","review":"Honestly, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen.

The highlights of the entire film are the uses of computor technology. Another addition that saves this flick is the stylish acting of Johnny Depp. He is simply hilarious as Captain Sparrow, and steals the entire show. Geoffrey Rush also delivers a haunting performance as Captain Barbosa. Orlando Bloom is our true hero, and saves the \\"damsel in destress.\\" (Kera Knightly)There is no straightforward plot to this, as it focuses on the talents of Depp and Bloom.

A ghost ship the Black Pearl's crew is seeking the last piece of gold and the son of a late pirate in order to reverse the curse they brought upon themselves and one that brings new meaning to the term \\"skeleton crew\\".

This movie is filled with suspense laughs and swashbuckling action. Jonny and Orlando made a great team. And Kiera was a really fighter. The technology was really good and it looked pretty real... and the special features are good. i love the blooper reel.. ive watched it a bunch of times and the dvd is getting used often. if you havent seen this movie i think you're missing something.~*wOLf*~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised after watching this movie for the first time. It is funny, witty, and full of action. The characters are well cast and the story line moves along wonderfully. But for the most part, it was so fun to watch. Johnny Depp does an excellent job and I loved seeing him receive a nomination for his role. I definitely recommend buying this DVD for your collection. The extras are worth it and it has been in my DVD player more than I can count since I received it! Great movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising fun and excitement","review":"after reading the numerous \\"two thumbs down\\" type of reviews i was hesitant to get this, but i like a lot of what Depp has done so i took a chance. fabulous. funny. unpredictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You can always trust a dishonset man to be dishonest\\"","review":"With wit like that, who could'nt love this movie. The Pirates of the Caribbean overcomes the greatest plauge of Disney ride movies-it knows when not to take itself serisouly. The movie is part ghost story, part adventuere and mostly comedy. with high profile stars like Orlando Bloom and Johnny Deep that can actcualy act, the movie always keeps a fast pace, has some fun fight secenes and a forgetable plot-cure the curse- but that is the point of the film-to have a blast. By sure to see it (don't let the country bears turn you away:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I saw this movie thinking it would be an amusing, watch-one-time-and-forget kind of movie. I was blown away! I have had the DVD for about two weeks now and have watched the movie 5 or 6 times. The cast is phenomenal. Johnny Depp is absolutely hilarious! I laugh every time I watch the movie! Geoffrey Rush is fantastic, too. Usually, I hate computer animation because it looks so fake, but this movie is absolutely fantastic! The skeletons look so realistic! The sword fights are very exciting, especially the one at the end where they are moving in and out of the moonlight. I highly recommend this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Movie","review":"The special effects in this movie were just stunning. The movie blends together, action, adventure, mystery, humor, and romance perfectly, and the added bonus of Orlando Bloom was greatly appreciated. ;) I highly recommend this movie. Johhny Depp was hysterical as Jack Sparrow - he has a good flair for making people laugh in POTC. Orlando Bloom was gorgeous throughout, and Keira Knightley was beautiful - an actress with amazing talents. Buy this movie, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I loved \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\". It was the best movie i've ever seen! What made it better was that Orlando Bloom was in it. He is the hottest actor in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Blu-ray","review":"This is a pretty good movie to start the Pirates series. I did notice that this movie was a little grainier than the second part since I own both movies. So as far as the graphics go, it's not too bad, but still a bit grainy. The uncompressed sound is always amazing, and will really rock if you have a surround sound system. By far, it's a collectible movie...so it's in my books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my all-time favorite movie!!","review":"I went into the theater wanting to watch Orlando Bloom onscreen in Pirates of the Caribbean. But after seeing the wonderous Johnny Depp perform his part of Jack Sparrow I was in awe! He does so wonderful portraying the quirky but still gentleman-like pirate. I recommend this movie to absolutely EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Caribbean - 5 / 5","review":"One of the most fun movies I've seen in quite some time, Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible movie that everyone should enjoy. This movie has it all: stunning special effects and CGI, wonderful acting (especially by Johnny Depp, who is amazing), and a fun and entertaining story. Perhaps the best family movie to come out in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clean Fun","review":"A simple fun entertaining movie. No deep, needing extra brain cells to get movie. Just some good clean fun ideal for when you want to keep it light and simple. Johnny Depp does a great job with the Captain Jack character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be?","review":"More Disney trash based on a stupid amusement ride at Disneyworld. Disney can show this garbage but wont let Michael Moore's movie out. Mindless boredom, cheesy music, I dont know if Depp did a better job of acting like he had the disease he described or inadvertantly making fun of disabled people. Orlando Bloom isn't a good actor except in Lord of the Rings when he's supposed to stand their and act like an airhead, he added nothing to this movie. BAD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"One question...how could so many of you liked this movie? The acting was horrible, story was boring, pacing was too slow, and the action was bland. This movie put me to sleep. Not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stinker","review":"I had high hopes with this one, but true to form, Disney let me down AGAIN. What a stinker! The plot, if there was one must have been concocted during a drunken spree. And speaking of drunk, Depp acted like he WAS drunk during this whole mess. Depp does NOT belong in a period film. Maybe a mental ward, but that's another story. Granted, the special effects were outstanding, but face it, this movie was sinking from the start. I love pirate flicks, but this one really deserves to be buried. And can we please get away from everyone doing impersonations of \\"Robert Newton\\" from Treasure Island ?!!! The two British soldiers acting like Laurel & Hardy was bad enough! My advice ? The entire cast, directors and crew should be \\"Morris dancing\\" for this dribble. (If you don't know what \\"Morris Dancing\\" is, it's an 18th Century term which means to swing from the gallows!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirate movie without pirates","review":"Depp does well in his performance of Captain Jack and there aredozens of spectaculair scenes...but over all things simply do not get dirty and mean anywhere. Why can't they shoot a decent pirate movie anymore with some real hommicidal maniacs in there? Why do beautiful actrices like Keira Knightley have to be tough at the same time? Girls back then were no sporty spices at all! Why do they always have to come up with those boring politically correct movies? Doesn't anyone want to tell the people how things really went back then? This should be the type of movie entertainment that kids shouldn't be able to watch instead of heavy violence or mature movies! (SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The creepiest movie I've seen in a LONG time","review":"I can't stand Johnny Dep or Orlando Bloom. I go for the old CLASSIC movie stars--aka Gregory Peck, Michael Landon, Jimmy Stewart, etc. Call me old-fashioned. But these modern stars DON'T know how to act! Kissing some girl's face off doesn't make you an actor. And I didn't like it at all that the bad guys--the drunk, murderous theives--got away with everything while the good guys were portrayed as cruel and even stupid.The only good part at all was when Elizabeth blew up the rum. The rest was not funny, just bloody and gory--and CREEPY beyond words. And no, I didn't like LOTR either.Skip POTC and watch something real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this movie is a real stinker!","review":"I am writing this review to prevent others from wasting their precious time and money. Take it from a guy who appreciates good films and understands value, Pirates of the Caribbean is greatly over-hyped and overrated. I am not going to go into a detailed scene-by-scene breakdown or critique any of the actors because it is simply not worth my time to point out the faults.If you are reading these reviews for advice, then I hope that my words will be helpful to you: Beware of this disappointing movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't rate it when you are still waiting to receive it.","review":"I ordered this item over a month ago and I am still waiting on it to get here.

The rest of the cast is great too and I really love the scene on the deserted island, some of Johnnys best work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phwarr!","review":"This movie is the best film i've seen for a long time. Johnny Depp is absoulutley gorgeous as Captin Jack Sparrow and not to mention totally hilarious. Kiera Knightly is so lucky to have been part of the film along side Johhny and Orlando Bloom. What was she thinking when she was on the island with Jack? How could she resist him, lol. So all in all a GREAT movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ok, seriously this is one of THE best movie I have ever seen! It has Everything!

A MUST OWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite movie off all time!","review":"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It totally surpased The Hulk and Terminator and all other movies I've seen this summer. Pirates Of The Caribbean is an excellent movie. It is one of those movies you know you'll like from the very beginning, and I haven't seen a movie like that in a long time! It's got great acting, great driecting, great script writing (with many unexpected and intelligent scenes). And of course, Keira Knightley who plays Elizabeth Swan is the hottest woman to ever walk on the face of the earth. So, this movie has everything you could ever want in the movie. It is my favorite movie of all time, right up there with LOTR. So what are you waiting for? GO SEE IT NOW! I saw it two days in a row and have now seen it 4 times and I'm going to see it many more times. Definatly worth your money! By the way, don't forget to sit through the credits to watch the special scene at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Caribbean!","review":"One of the greatest cinematic lines ever:Indignantly: \\"That's your plan!? Sit on the beach, drink rum, and wait to be rescued?!\\"Waving hands about: \\"Welcome to the Caribbean!\\"Pure fluffy entertainment, watchable over and over. Johnny Depp finally breaks out after years of great acting. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are adorable. Geoffrey Rush adds a little edge. Jonathan Pryce plays straight man to the madness.Great theme music - I wouldn't be surprised if Disney changes the music on the ride now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loveable Pirates","review":"This is one of the all-time great movies...I never get tired of watching it. Even though it is rather long, the time passes rapidly due to a great cast, a wonderful plot, and just an overall outstanding film. Everyone should own this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Story, Bad Adventure, Blockbuster Extravoganza","review":"This movie has the most basic plot and dialog of any movie that I have ever seen. It is quite possible that a second-grader wrote the script. It is hard to look at a crappy epic blockbuster like this seriously. I would show this to my 10 year old boy and no one else. Don't even waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"invalid format","review":"First of all I would like to say this was a very entertaining movie. My review is really geared toward the product itself. I wasn't able to play this dvd in my xbox 360, which plays everything except blueray. I would venture a guess and say it wouldn't play in a regular dvd player either. Once I threw it in my computer my media player was able to run the disc. However, it seems like in certain parts of the movie happened maybe 6-8 times the movie would freeze for 6 -10 seconds and didn't show that part of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER","review":"This movie was FANTASTIC!! It was truly one of the best movies I have ever seen!!

I would definitely reccomend anyone to see this wonderful pirate classic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING MOVIE","review":"This movie totally rocked, one of the year's very very best!!!! Johnny Depp was hilarious, Keira Knightley was great, Orlando Bloom was great (not to mention cute), and the \\"Jackisms,\\" a.k.a \\"But why is the rum gone?\\" was absolutely hilarious. This movie has something for everyone, and it's a movie anyone can watch (try to avoid letting kids younger than 10 watch it, though-they'll get extremely scared)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely AWESOME","review":"I know, I know....I am just now watching this movie for the first time. I have to be honest, i thought this movie would be a bit childish, what with the Disney name on it and all that goes along with that. I picked up the DVD because my kids wanted to see it and i was truely amazed at how great this movie was. I thought i would see cheesy pirates and tinkerbell somewhere in the mix but WOW, i loved this film. I think this may have become my favorite movie.If you love drama, action, adventure or love stories then you will enjoy this book. Johnny Depp plays an awesome character, and Keira Knightley is simply gorgeous. The ghost/cursed scenes weren't even clost to cheesy, i love the way they pulled this off.If you have not seen this movie, check it out. I don't think you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING, AWESOME ADVENTURE!","review":"I loved this movie! There is not one boring minute of this film. It will keep you engrossed for every single second! Johnny Depp, of course, is brilliant and gorgeous and, I must admit, the reason I watched it in the first place. I extend kudos to the entire cast, though. A job well done on everyone's part. It is simply so entertaining! It's funny, and adventurous, and you don't want to miss a minute of it. I've watched the DVD 4 times this week alone.

I loved the movie in theaters, and when I recieved this disc as a Christmas disc, I was floored.

Aye maties, have a good one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OHHHH...HELLO JOHNNY!!!","review":"I must say, any movie with Johnny Depp is certainly a treat. Better yet when I originally went to see the movie in the theater, there were quite a few kids filling the seats...so it's a good movie to watch with children. (Good babysitter material.) I think Depp truly embraced the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, and Orlando Bloom was great as well. The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars was because I wanted to see Depp hook up with Keira Knightley by the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy purchase","review":"Would have liked to know that this item was not able to be used on my DVD player. The fine print on back stated not for use outside of UK"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Long Commercial!","review":"I like many of the actors in this movie, but I found the plot to be boring and it just seemed to be a long Disney commercial to me. No surprise they came out with Haunted Mansion and I'm sure they'll release Space Mountain or the Tea Cup Ride movie soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"But, where's the rum?","review":"I am giving the movie 2 stars, just to be nice. My closest friends have the DVD, and saw it in theaters 13 times. Yes, 13. I saw it twice in theaters, I was dragged persay, and I found it unbearable to get through the second time. At first, I wasn't real into seeing a movie of pirates. It just isn't my thing. People said the movie was humorous, but really I didn't get any of the humor in the movie. The best part was the end with the monkey at the rolling credit. However, according to my friends it was one of the best movies of the year, so don't take my opinion for it. My friend has her brain into writing fan fictions of pirates. I don't know if the movie was so wonderful because of the hunkalicious Johnny Depp, who I don't find very handsome, or what. However, the actors did a good job, Johnny and Orlando, and any female will start drooling over the presence of these two males. I didn't though. They just aren't my type."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only watched 1 hour","review":"Save your money. I don't see how this movie ever got so many positive reviews. My wife and I could only watch about an hours worth before stopping it. It is only the second movie that I have bailed on this year. The other was \\"Anger Management\\".

If you want to watch a much better pirate comedy try \\"Yellowbeard\\" or \\"Cutthroat Island\\".Larry in Appleton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omigod, omigod, omigod!!!!","review":"You HAVE to see this movie. It is MUCH better from the first movie that was based on a park attraction, the slop called Country Bears. I can't wait for this movie to come out! It is the best!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasure and Pain","review":"I love this movie, and the DVD is its own treasure, with all of the extras. So why the pain? Because, in order to get the Lost Disc, you have to purchase the entire thing all over again, which is an unnecessary expense to the many who already have the 2-Disc Collectors Edition. I'm not sure if the good folks at Buena Vista considered how this will result in many of the original 2-Discers ending up in a lot of Used DVD bins. Normally, that would be fine, but the people who are going to want the 2-Discer (as opposed to the Single Disc, Just-The-Movie edition) are going to be the obsessive extras collectors who will therefore want the Lost Disc.The Lost Disc extras are great, but would it not have been at least a bit more convenient to put out the Lost Disc as a single component?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirate Storytelling","review":"I'm giving this movie 4 stars because the acting is great and johnny depp is just hilarious... besides, who doesn't like pirate movies? Lots of flair, sword fights, big ships, special effects, costumes, the works. Makes for great disney rides.However, although all these movies have amazing entertainment value, their scripts and storytelling SUCK in a way no movie has managed to suck.There is zero cohesion, closure, and at least half of all the subplots you're introduced to vanish in the story without making any sense. Regardless, these movies are so full of action, customes, jokes, and adventure, that you really wouldn't care about the bad storytelling. After all, it's still a pirate movie. Storytelling could only be expected to be \\"Pirate Quality\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Pirates of the Carribean is the best flick to come out in years. It's for children, young adults, and the young at heart. Johnny Depp is marvelous. His portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow is among the best acting I've ever seen. The scenery is gorgeous. The villains are ruthless. The heroes are dashing and brave. The action is exciting and reminiscent of Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. The soundtrack is riveting and inspired. There is also a Titanic-like love story unravelling throughout the course of the story. This movie has it all, and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn entertaining","review":"I am not a big disney fan, but this movie was actually pretty well done. Funny when it needed to be, good action, well written story. Enter Captain Jack Sparrow, a lost pirate, onto a small island in the Carribean, looking to commondere a ship. In turn, he crosses paths with his old crew of the black pearl, where mutany is abound. There is also a curse upon the pearl that, as the movie unfolds, one figures out how to cure...but of course there are a few twists that make a simple solution fun to watch.I recommend you see this movie, I was pleasently surprised. Worth the rental. Off to see number two. They have a lot to live up to, and the hype is probably right, this is a good movie series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"SERIOUSLY the BEST Disney movie EVER.

And the plot composition was absolutly wonderful.The tale of risking everything for your love and meeting pirates (the good, the bad, and the ugly) pulls you to places you cant wait to go. Not to mention the suspenceful subplot of...well we wont go into that.Disney has done a wonderful job with the casting as well. Jhonny Depp as the Drunken Captian Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as innocent Will Turner, and Gefforey Rush as the pirate you love to hate. This movie is worth the seven dollars to see it in the cinema, it's an unforgettable event.-C.DeVincent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family fun!","review":"Love Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow.

If you love the ride at Disney you also love all the hidden references from the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm Captain Jack Sparrow...\\"","review":"Pirates of the Carribean is the best movie of the summer of 2003. It draws you in, throws you off a plank, shoots you through a canon, and spits you back out. It's just a wild ride. The whole overall feel of the movie is so... refreshing. Just the swashbucking, scurvy mates, ahoy... that hasn't been done in so long. The sword fights are great, the moonlight effects are excellent, plus bonus points for having a demon monkey. I really liked Keira Knightly, whose scenes on the island with Johhny Depp are just so fun. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush do well with their parts, but the movie is really stolen by Johnny Depp. His amazingly hilarious Jack Sparrow is an example of great acting. He created a whole little world with his character, with his pronunciation, and his wacky hand motions.Don't miss out on this amazing film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depp = POTC","review":"Despite my girlfriend's and my fears of Disney \\"basing\\" a movie on their ride, perhaps \\"inspired\\" is a better word as this is a great piece of entertainment. It's clean, hilarious (can you say \\"Depp\\"?), and interesting...as well as one of the more quoted films among my friends. If you like pirate-anything or just a fun movie to watch that isn't too heavy but doesn't dumb down either, this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST movie this summer","review":"Normally by May, I'm dreading the summer \\"sequel\\" season, so this year, I was very very excited for Pirates of the Caribbean....and I definitely was NOT let down one bit when I saw it! Johnny Depp was once again in superb form (his entrance has got to be one of the best I've ever seen!!!), and Orlando Bloom is proving to be a force to be reckoned with, and I think we'll be seeing ALOT more of him, which is a good thing. This film has it all....humor, action, some suspense, and top of the line special effects! Heck, there's even some romance thrown in there! Something for everyone!! I wouldn't recommend young children, but I took both my boys, ages 8 and 6, and they both LOVED it, and the \\"ghosts\\" did not scare them at all. Plus there is NO swearing or nudity to worry about. Also, stay until after the credits for a little \\"extra\\" something. I won't say what so as not to ruin it, but it's worth it. This is truly a gem in the wasteland that is usually summer cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I loved - he's such a loser and doesn't realize it!","review":"Depp's character doesn't get much right - from the first scene with the sinking boat that would have been a problem for anyone else (yeah, I meant to do that!) to losing the Pearl and getting caught over and over. But he is so confident and charming and insane that he won't get that he's screwed up - and the beauty is that WE don't quite catch it either. As someone else said, in anyone else's hands Sparrow would be a cartoon. Depp's characterization was brilliant.It's not high art, but if you like Depp at all, it's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curse of the Black Pearl","review":"I have to say that I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, but after watching this movie I thought he did a great job performing.

It's ironic that the book that offers the least insight into the workings of Neal Cassady's mind would be his own autobiography. I can't say very much about his prose either--his letters, if anything, capture the best of his essence for posterity. Perhaps Neal was just too pragmatic before a daunting typewriter and the task of recording his life--he is too chronological and spends too much time on his family tree, which is not fascinating enough to warrant it. The book, which reads more like a school paper, ends with Neal still a child.

It was a runaway sensation and brought new life to the genre of the comedy album, which had been in the doldrums for most of the 1970s. Sure, it is dated -- there are Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon jokes, and some of the materials about the sex scene in San Francisco seems awfully tame by today's standards.

Be warned however, that Genghis Khan's life only accounts for approximately 1/3rd of the book as the rest covers the subtitle.The author goes to great lengths to point out how evil Christian Europe is compared with the Great Khan. His violent exploits are merely glossed over. This reactionary work tries to break the stereotypes Genghis Khan has found himself encumbered with over the centuries. Instead of embracing his legacy however I find myself questioning the veracity of the source material.Overall though this book was worth picking up if not only for the accounting of Genghis Khan's life.

At times tedious read, but well organized and informative. I can't give it 5 stars, because although an excellent history book, it does not read like McCullough's history books.

Amongst this books problems is that it ignores most of the vast number of independant, contemporary Asian critiques of Ghengis Khan and the Mongols as murderers of millions. Various books, such as The Mongols by David Morgan, have translations of contemporary Persian, Chinese and Arab sources which paint a much different picture than Weatherford does. This diverse set of critical accounts, with authors representing many different religious, social and economic groups, presents a challenge to any favorable account of Ghengis Khan, a challenge Weatherford doesn't meet. He provides no real basis for dismissing these many independantly written accounts. He doesn't even indicate, unlike every single other Mongolian history I have ever read, how common and universal such accounts were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent telling of a fascinating story","review":"Jack Weatherford's commitment to understanding Genghis Kahn and the Mongols is an accomplishment of the highest order.

Don't order it!","review":"This is just a disorganized compendium of whatever material the \\"author\\" could dig up. He tries to pretend this is literature and his prose is awful. It reads like a poorly organized encyclopedia. Given all the historical characters the book needs some graphics showing family trees. There is only one pathetic sample at the front of the book. This book is unreadable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak scholarship, at best","review":"Hoping to find a modern analysis of Genghis Khan, I found myself increasingly startled by the willful lack of scholarship in this work. The writer set out to paint a revisionist account of Mongol rule, and he carelessly bends facts to support his thesis. The mix of anachronism and selective interpretation of his sources is shocking. One example is is reference to \\"Michael Paris\\", who he chooses to quote when it suites him, only to question the integrity of this source when the narrative runs counter to his intention to show the Mongols of the source of modern thought, including the Renaissance(?!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Culture Shock","review":"I never knew how much I didn't know until I read this book. I only read it because of my book group, and everyone in the group was enthusiastic about it. I think that you'll like this book, even if history wasn't your favorite subject, and that you'll learn something from it even if it was. I wish all my history teachers had made this required reading instead of the thick, unreadable surveys of World History I was offered. Jack Weatherford hooked me from the first few pages and opened my eyes to world I barely knew existed. It is an adventure well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book to learn Ancient Mongolian Culture or about Chingiss Khan","review":"Very good reading about the Life and Times of Chingiss Khan.

At times, it becomes tedious to read but overall, an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written by an anthropologist","review":"Most biographies are written by historians, but this one is by an anthropologist and is very well done. Lots of detail I probably could have done without, but nevertheless a fascinating picture of the Mongol Empire and especially on the results of this 13th century phenomenon that affects us today.

Great research, well written, super read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book will change your view of world history. We were taught nothing about asian history in high school and this book fills in some big missing pieces. Plus it's a delight to read. I disagree with the other reviewers who complained about the book's alledged claims to have \\"started the Renaissance,\\" or the reviewer who seemed to read excuses for mass murder. Nonsense. The author simply talks about the contribution of the trading network established by the Mongols, and is frank, but unapologetic about the brutality of the Mongol wars. Balancing this is a very human view of the people of Mongolia and their significant contributions to world civilization. The book also traces some of the earliest instances of anit-asian racism, such as is embodied in the word \\"mongoloid.\\" Must reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of a bad book","review":"Oh, my....This book is so bad it is not even funny.Here are a few quotes:\\"In Easter Europe, the Mongols united a dozen Slavic principalities and cities into one large Russian state.In eastern Asia, over a span of of three generations, they created the country of China...\\"\\"As the Mongols expanded their rule, they created countries such as Korea and India that have survived to modern times in approximately the same borders....\\"\\"He (Genghis Khan) lowered taxes for everyone and abolished them altogether for doctors, teachers, priests, and educational institutions.\\"The above quotes are form within the first ten pages of the book.I could not force myself to read on any further.Sorry about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscover the real Mongols","review":"I have to give Weatherford credit for reviving the reputation of the much maligned Mongols. His account was a great fast-paced, exciting read. I especially liked the last two chapters which covered the global awakening that the Mongols ushered in (basically linking Eurasia through trade routes and anticipating Europe's Renaissance) and the bubonic plague (which basically undid the work of the prior chapter).My one complaint is that Weatherford is a bit too obviously biased against Christianity, and will often make non-sequitor asides about how the medieval church in Europe was intolerant, etc, etc. (Of course, we all have our biases, but Weatherford is a bit too obviously in the secularist camp.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A History Book You Can't Put Down","review":"Few of us learned about the Monghols in college. Until I read this book, I didn't know Genghis Khan from the Aga Khan. The book tells one a great deal about the Monghols--not only their rise under Genghis Khan but their history through Kubilai Khan and beyond.

There are grammatical errors, lots of repetition, and so much awkward writing that I, my grandfather and my stepfather all had to put it down.I think the only reason this book gets such good reviews is that it is one of the more easily-accessible books on the subject.

From the Mongol perspective Temujin was a great man, but read other histories of the lands he invaded and conquered and you will find him not so greatly respected. A great deal of blood went into the making of his empire. In today's world that kind of activity would land him in the World Court for crimes against humanity.The book is enjoyable enough if you do not think too critically or read with the eye of a copy editor.

A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective. MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west. Secondly, Nazi helicopters? This is just plain sloppy. MacLean should have known much better.This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy. For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island. The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far.

After the soaring, sweeping guitars of \\"Love,\\" this album came across as a cheap metal album. One reviewer says it is the album AC/DC should have made; maybe so, but the Cult were on the road to something completely different, something that transcended bar-rock. There were a couple of decent songs, but Rick Rubin's color-by-numbers production is just a terrible mix with the Cult's ethos. Instead of soaring spirituality, it's plain old earthbound mediocrity.

I think this album is the litmus test for the Cult. If you sort-of like it but not really, then head to the back catalog. If you love it and think it just rocks out hard, then progress to the forward catalog.I bought this the day it came out, and was completely disappointed.

If it weren't for the Pixies, this would be a shoe in for best rock album of the 80's. Overall it's one of the most well crafted, pure ROCK albums out there. Fantastic vocals by Ian. I challenge anybody to top his baritone howls. Billy's solo's are awesome, not to mention the fantastic, though simplistic riffs all over the album. Drumming is great, and the bass fits perfectly.

I heard it first when I was still an impressionable teen and like a fine wine, it has aged well over time. Although I have always given props to The Cult in whatever incarnation they went through, this album, through and through, is just great. It's one of the most exciting, albeit mindless, rock albums you're likely to come across. You won't find any thought provoking lyrics or anything but Billy Duffy just drives it and Ian Astbury has never given more attitude to his vocals. If this is the only Cult album you bless your ears with, then turn on, turn up and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cult album","review":"I was disappointed in reading the few bad reviews on this site from so-called Cult fans. I think their thinking is narrowminded, and not respecting the Cult in trying something different. I'm a huge Cult fan and even though I love their other albums, this one is my favorite. The songs totally rock with hard, crunching riffs with the boogie sound I love, sort of like AC/DC. There are hardly any bands that makes a rock album that totally boogies, and I'm glad the Cult made Electric the way it is. The only reason why I'm not rating this one five stars is the cover version of \\"Born to be Wild\\" is hideous; it should have been left off the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful garbage!","review":"This book deserves NO stars.

Mr. Knightley is an old fogy, his brother is churlish, Jane Fairfax is even more of a non-entity than in Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\", Mr. Churchill is back to being a cad, and Emma herself is unconvincing and has lost her confidence. The story is choppy and disjointed and has overtones of homosexuality.

Need I say more? What ever possessed Tennant to think this gory word picture would bring to mind the beautifully restrained writings of Jane Austen? Austen's polite restraint and gentle humor are only a few of the reasons she can deal so effectively with the controversial topics of her times. While this book wrestles with controversial topics, it is done without finesse, beauty or regard for Austen's original character development.

I was so dissapointed and at the end I didn't know what to make of it. It's definitely not a PACHA sound! Believe me when I tell you, you could not get the crowd going at PACHA IBIZA with this kind of mix. The mix is flawed in so many ways. For one the track Summer Moon mixed into this mix is so out of place. Doesn't do it for me.On the other hand Sarah Main Rocked it! The fact she dropped Kerri Chandler as her opening track set the tone for what to come. A great 5 star mix and she definitely captured the PACHA sound.

I just recently watched it, and had to watch it again. I can honestly say i have never watched an anime, and wanted to watch it again so soon after the first viewing. I see another gay man disliked Junjou Romantica, talking of rape. Yes, in the beginning Akihiko forced himself on Misaki, but he really didnt put up much of a fight, and if you watch it the whole way through, he really regrets what he did. Speaking from past experience, I also did things that i wasn't really ready to do, but went along with it. Most of us, like Misaki, were young, confused, and unsure of ourselves at one point in our life.I like to look at the anime as a whole, it has its darker moments, but the budding romance between the two, with some comedy, and drama, I think it is one of the best i have seen to date. I would recommend it to anyone, and have to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Romance, and a lot of laughs","review":"The second season of Junjou Romantica is where it all comes together, and contains the most bizarre comedy and the most touching scenes in the whole series. Usagi's father and brother make their appearances, and both are real weirdos who do nothing but complicate an already complicated relationship. Hiroki and Nowaki manage to maintain, but with Hiroki being the fly-off-the-handle type he is, it's not easy. My favorite storyline, though, is Junjou Terrorist -- I think that one has the most meat, the most subtle humor, and the most touching scenes. The Miyagi-Shinobu pairing works out to be the most appealing, as far as I'm concerned.The whole series is one of my all-time favorites, and I find myself dipping into favorite scenes when I want to relax with something light and engaging for an hour or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Winchester, VA","review":"I live in Winchester and recently began reading Willa Cather's books because she was born here.

Cather lived that life, and although her books are fiction, she, like many authors, includes bits of her own life and experiences in her writing. I could follow her up to Timber Ridge, down to Winchester, and was so absorbed in her writing that I felt I'd stepped back in time and was watching her beautifully painted scenes and hearing her realistically-written dialog for myself.

Ideally I should have bought them separately. The blocks are a lot of fun, but the wagon is a little awkward. The cord is very short (to keep kids from strangulation I'm guessing) so it's hard to pull. With the wheels it's also hard to store this on the shelf with their other toys, so if I were to do it again I would go with a wooden block set and then buy a better-designed wagon separately.

I suppose if I had taken the product width & divided it by the #/blocks in the pic ... yeah, you get the idea.I definately would NOT have picked this one had they lised the block size.(And if I hadn't had it direct shipped to meet me out of state, would have returned it & bought a different one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC Blocks","review":"My grandson loves these blocks. He don't pull them around, but he likes to name everything that is on them. The only thing I didn't like is that he would throw them from time to time, which I had to stop him from doig. Other than that, he seems to enjoy them and the pictures on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tiny even for small hands","review":"This product is much smaller than I expected.

She loved the blocks and started trying to put them together. It's still one of her favorite toys and it's been about a month since she got them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves these blocks","review":"These were a gift for my one-year-old. He LOVES them. He likes pulling them around on the cart since he just started walking, but mostly likes to dump them out and play with them. My only issues with these are that the string is a little short, even for a one-year-old to pull around. He ends up spilling them on accident and gets a little frustrated. Second, the blocks are a little small. Maybe 1x1x1. Not so bad for small hands, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduring Wooden Blocks","review":"I had similar blocks when I was a child and purchased these for my first great-grandson this past Christmas (2007). He immediately went for the string to pull around his blocks and really loves playing and building things with these blocks. He also enjoys putting them away in their own little wagon. These alphabet/number blocks have been around for over 100 years and continue to be loved and enjoyed generation after generation. They encourage the child's creativity and learning. Who could ask for more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This product is an excellent way for a young child to learn the alphabet and the order of the letters of the alphabet.I could not be happier with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"I am very pleased with these blocks. The cart has smooth, rounded corners- not sharp like garanimals version. The Melissa and Doug website states they repeatedlt check their products to make sure the manufacturing plant is producing products up to the proper standards. in this case it means no lead or wierd chemicals in the paint. that is important to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than i expected...","review":"I didnt pay much attention to the dimensions of this product before buying. I assumed the blocks would be the typical size of a wooden ABC block set. Theyre not. This is a very small product, barely the size of an 8x11 piece of printer paper.

I used to do flyers for a living... if i had submitted half of these I would been laughed at. They are all bubble gum generic, half-a$$ed, and uninspirational. I should add not creative either.

They provide consitent, quality output and require no sharpening. Unfortunately, most automatic pencils have crummy erasers. They're small, they wear out rapidly, and retailers charge a ridiculous price for refills. Do you get frustrated with erasers on your mechanical pencils? Try the Remedy. It comes with a big ol' retractable eraser that can be summoned and sized with a quick twist of a knob. It has a nice thick grip and a professional look. I like the fact that Staedtler left the lead-advacement mechanism where it belongs - at the eraser where I can click it with my thumb (other pencils use a button on the grip to advance the lead). If you're in the market for a mech pencil... the Remedy won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worms under your skin","review":"I do not often engage in playing video games, but when I saw Worms at the home of a friend, I decided to try it. This game is absolutly irresistable and it is really difficult to stop playing. The accents are hilarious, yet at the same time you are laughing, you will be busy planning and plotting your strategy for the next move. The weapons are murderous( no pun intended) and it is indeed a fun and challenging game for the above average player. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's your problem Cowboy?","review":"I found the story amusing, with a very different slant on a western. When Alex decides his only alternative to lonliness was to begun life anew on a distant planet the fun begins. The author, Sam Welch, has done a terrific job of portraying aliens as green cowboys, with the ability to create anything the imagination can conjure. The story is filled with surprises, which I will not go into so as not to give the plot away. I have also read Tecumqua by Sam Welch and this author has an imagination and a very creative writing ability that keeps the reader wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a review rather a complaint waiting to be addressed!!","review":"I need you to know that the package has no bulbs so the first project itself is not possible as also the two top slots on the LHS rae vacant though you donot mention any code numbers so they may be meant to be empty only.

I also love that it's a digital watch but not clunky or with a large interface. However, the band broke four months into wearing it.

Thankfully The World Cafe community, speaking through Juanita Brown, has come through with a great book.This book combines stories, theory and practice to illustrate the impact of The World Cafe and the potential of conversational practice as a whole.

This book and the process of the World Cafe is an easy to use process that almost anyone can learn. There is no right or wrong way to do it and that is the beauty of the process.

I was so not impressed. First of all she is supposed to spin on her little platform...doesn't falls off. The little ear piece/microphone for the child falls out of her ear. She has some type of stick in her hand which doesn't come out so you can't change her clothes like the other dolls. My daughter doesn't play with her like she does the other ones.

Not as Expected","review":"There are four dinosaurs with multiple parts and you snap them together in different ways. My son (age 3.5) played with it for about 10 minutes and then moved onto something else and hasn't played with it again. I guess if we had lots of sets it might be more fun but at $20 a set, there are plenty of other toys that I would purchase instead of this one. And, unless you use the correct pieces, the dinosaurs don't stand up well, which doesn't lend itself to much pretend play. The toy looks pretty dinky for the price. Our older child also was not interested in this toy, so I don't think it was an age issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atheists, Reconsider","review":"Recommended!

She'll solve the mystery, rescue some guys, and blackmail her way into a posh job. Not a bad days work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific, one of my new favorite books.","review":"Having run out of new Amelia Peabody mysteries to read, I decided to try some others by Elizabeth Peters. This book is the first in the Vicky Bliss series. It is quite as much fun as Peters' other novels, and it contains quite as much adventure / mystery / history et al. When Vicky and Tony travel to Schloss Drachenstein in Germany, searching for a lost work of art by the sculptor Riemenschneider, they become embroiled in the past and the lives of the Drachensteins, those long-gone, and those still alive-and-well. (Historical facts blended with fictional are a specialty of Peters'. Her novels are educational as well as entertaining!) As each determines to be the first to find the lost shrine, they encounter all sorts of dangers. There is as much humor as there is suspense and romance, making this one terrific book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun book, TERRIBLE reading","review":"I saw an earlier review that complimented Barbara Rosenblat's reading of this book for its German pronunciations. Unfortunately, the version I got was read by Susan O'Malley, who seems to have no knowledge of German and no interest in learning any. What started as a minor annoyance (\\"RAWthenberg,\\" \\"GROFFin\\" for Graefin, \\"Groose\\" Gott) reached the point of obscuring meaning when Ms. O'Malley read the German word Feuer as if it were spelled Fuehrer. Fire, not leader; it's important to the plot. It might not annoy people who aren't familiar with the way the words are actually pronounced, but don't try out any German phrases based on anything you hear in this audiobook.The book itself is fun but has not aged well, and Vicky's 1980s-era feminism feels almost quaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read all the Amelia Peabody books, starting on Vicki Bliss","review":"This book was a fast read. Interesting, different than Peabody but still good. A little long winded in the history dept. But overall I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicky, Vaa-Vaa Voom!","review":"Peters is a master of this type of book. She really is, but this one fails to deliver of that promise. This book introduces us to a very shapely heroine, but still a very smart heroine, as well the supporting cast. The problem with the book lies in the fact that the main character is forced to play second fiddle to a bunch of second-rate talent. This makes for a less than thrilling book. It simply becomes a book that does not have much to offer other than a fairly predictable plot and boring characters. All in all, not one of Peter's best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"silent\\" muffler","review":"This is more of a BMX style noisy racing muffler.

The author is also bent on being academic to the extreme. For example, he wastes considerable print (and the reader's time) on the definition of software and systems. Technically the book does have some merit in covering the principles and practice of installing Standard Software (ERP) but these points of illumination are far to hard find and nearly impossible to understand in this writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"Without a doubt this is the worst concept I have come across.

After I found out I could not return it I decided to put it in the freezer. I suffer from migraines and found that this cold therapy cap did not help me at all. It does not stay cold long enough. Also it has a seam that runs down the back of the item where your nerves run up your neck. This is one of the areas that needed to be cold. Because of the seam that area is not even covered with the gel. The loose fit of the cap makes this a very useless! I will just stick with my other eye mask products when I feel a migraine come on.

Dickson tries to use the fact that his story is set in a high tech future to disguse the impausibility of his military plans. But even if the reader accepts Donal's strategies as good it's hard to believe no one ever thought of them before.The universe is unrealistic and Dickson treats human societies as if they themselves are individuals. This might work if as individuals they weren't all completely one-dimensional. This is a very simplistic and unsasitisfying book which even fails to work as a simple time-passer do to the clumsy writing and silly characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was unable to enjoy this either as a literary novel or as an adventure novel or as SF. I'd been led to believe that it was some SF military classic, yet it read like a bad pulp novel.

If you are unfamilar with the format: Players roll dice and move around a board in search of stars, like a board game without a fixed finish line. (The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds.) After each round (in which each player moves once), there is a mini-game that involves every player. These are great for keeping things interesting: just rolling dice might get boring without the mini-games, and if you win a lot of them, you have a better chance of winning the big game. There are several ways, in fact, to earn stars, and it is sometimes surprising to find out who wins. Skill and chance are balanced, so that no one can coast to victory, but your little cousin can still give you a run for your money.

The mini games are a bit less boring than the actual game, but they are not enough fun make it worth torturing yourself by playing this game.

I really don't want to give anything away so if you want spoilers find a different review. There is so many new things.

If you are a big fan of the other Mario Party games, you will love this game because there are a few extra things and of course slightly better graphics. There are many new mini games that are very fun (one of my favorites was where you and a partner are climbing up the side of a cliff but have to be careful not to get blown off by a snowstorm.) However, the reason I have problems with Mario Party games in general is of how long it seems to take each player to take their turn (\\"rolling\\" the dice, moving, and the results from that). I dont care about seeing what happens to the computer players. However, I guess the makers were trying to make it as much of a real board game as possible (waiting patiently for your turn). The only truly fun part for me is the Mini Games. If you LOVE Mario Party, go ahead and buy it, but if you have doubts, rent first."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MARIO PARTY OUT OF 1-4!!!","review":"I don't care what other people say, in my opinion this game is great.The gameplay is 10/10, and so are all the other categories!

When the sequel came out, I enjoyed it as well. The third time however I was getting bored with the series, thinking that it was getting very repetitive. This 4th edition doesn't many bring many new changes to the gameplay. It's the same exact set-up it has been, and probably always will be. Nintendo needs to get it that that the Mario Party games just aren't fun anymore. Finishing a board is now a chore to do. So are some of the mini games. Don't get me wrong though, I actually enjoyed some of the mini games very much, which saved this game from getting no stars. But all in all, if you're going to get a Mario Party game, get one of the first two for the Nintendo 64. Those are better. Oh, and whatever you do, don't get the 5th one.

No new character and character voices, it's once again just a bunch of annoying squeaking animals. In addition, there are only 6 boards in total, and they are so plain. This game seriously needs to take advantage of the Gamecube features. Apparently, Hudson and Nintendo are still living in the Nintendo 64 era. The only thing OK about the game is the graphics. Beside that, it's a waste of money. Don't get it, I warn you, you'll want your money back very soon after purchase!

Gameplay is constantly interrupted by text-boxes full of meaningless information. 75% of the time is spent watching the animated characters move around. To top it off, the mini-games that I was looking forward to turned out to be quick little dissapointments.

However, I started going through some of my older makeup, and lo and behold, I found a match. It's made by Emerge, which is one of the cheaper cosmetic lines, and the color is slate. I put the Maybelline Charcoal Grey on one eyebrow and the Emerge Slate on the other, and I can't tell the difference. I don't remember where I bought it though. Probably Walgreens or Wal-Mart or CVS, one of those. Like I said, it's been a few years ago. My slate pencil is one of the very long ones, and I hope it hasn't also been discontinued.

It doesn't really get into the driving forces of what gets people into the relationship situations that they find themselves in before they start reading it - and these are always subconscious drivers that need to be understood and learned patterns and responses changed. Otherwise, all you do is try to apply things that are foreign to you, and in the long run that cannot work and isn't realistic.

In general it is a great read as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near the quality of the original","review":"The original Five Love Languages was insightful, had a variety of examples and provided a good amount of psychological and Christian theory and application. This book is supposed to be for singles, but almost every example has to do with dating couples--people I don't really consider single. Rarely does it talk about regular friendship--and when it does, it's guy-girl friendships. I was hoping to get some insight into my same-sex friendships, family relationships and guy-girl non-romantic friendships, but this book falls horribly short of that.

We have learned about our primary love language which for both of us is quality time, and we have learned about the other love languages of acts of service, words of encouragement, gifts, and physical touch. Chapman loads each chapter with illustrations, and stories and makes the read very interesting. This book has gotten me to think about the way I communicate with others and how to meet their love language in an effort to relate better with them. This book has also helped me realize why there are some I cannot relate with, and love language, and common interest are a primary reason. Overall a great read for singles.

See those ridiculously happy nicely dressed perfect looking people? Well if you're not one of them, this book isn't for you. It's full of superficial and contrived mini-stories. To methey just don't seem to fit in with real life situations that people have with all the hurting and complicated lives we go through. The stories remind me of those how-to educational films from the 40'sThe basic message of the book is this: learn what makes people in your life feel loved, follow the golden rule, etc. etc. It's pretty much intuition. I don't think however that it will lead to some miraculous change in how you deal with people nor will it do anything to help you establish new relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"This was an excellent read ,very informative.

The guy's got a deep, lush voice (just listen to 'Tu Recuredo\\" on the \\"17\\" CD--from his MTV UNPLUGGED release--another GREAT CD & DVD). The man can sing!! The videos selection here is eclectic and allows you to see Ricky through his 17 years as a soloist. He's always been the consumate peformer but the videos allow you to see how his style has changed as he has grown and matured. I especially love the EPKs (electronic press kits) since they let you see him at work and kind of at play as he jokes with the camera. If you think Ricky is just the guy with the hip movements (although they are pretty fine!) you are missing out! He's incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious HD transfer and bonus material must have","review":"Whereas years ago a Best Of music videos DVD was issued in english, this product offers videos in spanish/2 in spanglish.

The discography for all his albums and their track listings is a nice feature. It takes a bit to get used to the menu option to forward/back-up individual videos to play, and there is no \\"All\\" option.Ricky's dynamic use of either his native language, english, or spanglish, does not diminish the dance/soul urge you feel when his music fills your ears.

It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background.

Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window.

There is little or no new content here. This is because Bones, the Japanese studio making the show, was running out of money, so they needed to do some low budget episodes using already-made video.

This is not, however, a lighthearted book. The dark underbelly of America is illuminated sympathetically but with equal measures of grim realism. Homophobia, misogyny, economic exploitation, and racism are ever-present realities for the circus folk as they struggle against each other and against the ignorant small-town rubes who are their hosts.

That said I strongly encourage any bible student to pick up a copy of a print version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want Proof?","review":"Don't let the title fool you! Mr. Bruce's motive is to prove beyond a shadow of doubt of the validity of the New Testament scriptures; he does drive his point home. He did an outstanding job in uncovering many sources that the above average student of the Word could even begin to find. He covers the four Gospels with stuning detail( even their dates of writing) as well as an overveiw of the various epistles. He also discusses the canon of scriptures. What I found to be the most helpful was his covering various writings by the early church fathers, Jewish literature, and even some rather interesting gentile(pagan) writings. Purchase this book and be prepared for some interesting reading. Go with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?","review":"Although this book is a classic of Christian Apologetics and receives appropriately high reviews, I must give the product being shipped by Amazon an extremely low rating due to the extremely poor editing job done by whoever produced this book. There are numerous typos throughout the book, as many as a half dozen or more per page. Oddly enough, the version shipped to me doesn't include a copyright page, which I find highly unusual. These things makes this particular version of Bruce's book highly suspect. After speaking with the true publisher of this book, Eerdmans, it is clear that this version being sold by Amazon is in violation of copyright laws. That explains the poor editing done in this book. If you wish to purchase this book, choose a vendor or dealer other than Amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from this publisher","review":"F. F. Bruce has written a magnificent book, certainly worth having in your library. Unfortunately Amazon chose to buy this book from a publisher who must employ illiterate non-English speaking typists or proof readers, because there is NO WAY a competent publicist could have ever produced such a horrible product. Nearly every page contains typos, misspellings, punctuation errors, or even weird numbers (example: g00 for 800?). I was going to give this to my son who is having difficulties regarding the legitimacy for the New Testament claims about Jesus. But as an English major in college he would not get past the first ten pages before rejecting the book. I enjoy Amazon and have bought many books from them, and will continue to do so in the future. But do yourself a big favor and buy this book from a different publisher. You will be sorry if you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am shocked by the reprint of this classic work-FULL of Typos and errors","review":"I am shocked by the reprint of this classic work-FULL of Typos and errors. Obviously Wilder Publications is a counterfeit company that scanned and OCRed the text and never proof read. This is plainly unreadable. Does Amazon do any Quality testing of products it sells.

I don't know if they will look at it or even careIn the past I have considered Amazon.com a reliable source for books. But this last shipment from the publishing company Wilder Publications was really bad. There are many typos in the book and I found the disclaimer in the front of the book extremely offensive.

The stories themselves wander aimlessly lost among unformed and unrefined characters. Convoluted plot lines that twist back upon themselves with no development or direction.

Add to that, my instructor was the author of this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable chronology of this important history","review":"The author's objective, 500 years of history in a single bound volume, is formidable; reading it is not. Through this prism, the reader can finally make sense of much of English political/military/religious history and clearly see the motivations of America's founding fathers. Their collective genius in crafting a form of government that would: promote, not parasitically paralyze commerce; promote, not oppress, free exercise of religious participation; promote adaptation to the dynamic evolution of American culture and society radiates from these pages. A must read for any alert American citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda from Gig Harbor","review":"This album has rich and tasty arrangements with writing that is true, believable and most of all - REAL.

Great pictures and a reasonable amount of control for a beginner. Just enough to make me literate. I'll be able to use this camera for several years before I move upscale. At the time of my purchase there wasn't a USB option for connecting to my computer. This was a minor annoyance as was the scarcity of AC adaptors (available at ritzy camera stores but typically out-of-stock in my area).

Combined with a great pen (Cross if you dont want to spend too much money or a Mont Blanc if you have the extra cash) and it makes a good finish. The leather is strong and the entire product is not very heavy, yet durable. Holds one pen and some business cards. The pad on the inside has tear out notes portions which I haven't really used, but I guess someone else may enjoy it more than me. Same with the document tray, it slides out smoothly which helps if its in a bag and you want access to just a few docs w/o removing the entire padfolio, so you place them on the doc tray and its easy access!! Overall its a great product and I am very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIce folio","review":"This padfolio was cheap, and does the job well. There is space on the left side for a few sheets of loose paper. The Outlink pull-out tray also holds another few sheets of paper. Material is nice and professional looking. Only drawback is that the Outlink tray sticks a little when pulling it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely paced, nicely interconnected","review":"Derbyshire interweaves superficial biographic sketches of the mathematicians with superficial descriptions of their discoveries, alongside Will Durant-esque comments on the world political situation at the time.I found it very interesting. It will be more interesting for you if you have heard of Descartes, Gauss, Riemann... and if you have a sense of what a function is, a matrix, a ring. You need not be able to manipulate them, but if you can visualize how they work, you will enjoy this book.The presentation is fairly linear chronologically, which helps a great deal, and serves to map the development of algebra from a curious set of puzzle solutions to an abstract math/philosophy.I've read quite a few popularizations (e, i, Pi, Phi, and the ilk) and enjoyed this one as much as any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read (it's not meant to be a textbook)","review":"I found this book fun and interesting. I admit that some of the math content was difficult for me to grasp, but this book is not just about algebraic concepts, it's about the people, events, ambitions, and cultures that gave rise to them, and in this regard the author of Unknown Quantity, John Derbyshire, writes well. Indeed, the fact that certain mathematical ideas were explained only basically is fitting, because this book is meant to be the beginning, not the end, of exploring these fascinating topics. It is a place to acquire a sample of knowledge; it is not a textbook. Overall, a good purchase. Note that a high-school level understanding of math is more or less essential, unless you aim to digest the history component of this book only."},{"rating":"1","title":"better unknown","review":"Some people never know when to shut up.What begins with promise degenerates intoa tabloid journalism approach to(mathematical) celebrity along with somenaive political comments straight out ofthe establishment playbook.

And it has been great. Right up until they came out with the \\"new bottle, same formulation\\" formula.

It is horrid to use.. particularly on the face where it will have strange stuff peel off after it dries. So you kind of look like you're getting a bad sunburn peel.Not sure what other products to recommend [yet]. But the Jason Aloe Gel is a no go for me anymore. It's unfortunate.. seems like Jason did this on a few of their products (apricot scrubble, for example), and they've either cheapened them out or somehow managed to ruin the previously good formulation.Update: After searching a bit, this product might be a better alternative.

It was also a true fit per the sizing offered. My daughter loved the ring. I would recommend this as a purchase for anyone looking for a resonably priced emerald w/diamond accents.

Does this make the effort better or worse than previous material? I don't think so at all. The bands musical abilities Far exceed any other band I can think of preasently recording and not many ever. A certain 3 piece outfit from Canada does come to mind but they have not had a great effort in 20 years or at least since Signals.Listening to or watching the new Live at Budakon may give some of you nay sayers a different opinion of the TOT album ; or it may not.

Unbelievably Petrucci's solos are also boring. Shredding for the sake of shredding.

Complex time shifts appear to happen randomly without consequence to the song as a whole.The musical tone of these songs is bleak and joyless with anger and self-pity as the supporting lyrical content.

Honestly, I think many of you who are praising this album actually don't like it. I think you are making excuses for ToT out of principle and are deathly afraid to criticize your gods. I think it's pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been MUCH BETTER!!!","review":"I am a big Dream Theater fan. They are my all-time favorite band. I greatly enjoyed this album, but it is definately their worst release so far (too heavy, not outstnding songs). it gets 2- 2 1/2 stars because though it is still a great album, all of their other albums are much, much better; I expected more from them! I hope they go back to Metropolis pt. 2-style for Octavarium."},{"rating":"1","title":"no title needed","review":"This is another pedestrian album from a highly overrated band. Don't get me wrong: these guys have chops to kill, but good chops do not make great progressive rock. The biggest problem I have with this band is that all their songs sound alike - melodically clumsy and harmonically poor. There just is not enough original ideas, although there are occasional interesting instrumental passages. The vocalist just sucks, and overall they sound like a neo-prog band on steroids"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars? you dont know music","review":"I cant believe all of these 5 star reviews- who cares if it is a great band-- they are great-- but this album sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible for DT-","review":"THIS IS NOT A GOOD ALBIM AT ALL! BAD, BAD PROG- BUY IMAGES AND WORDS- OR SCENES FROM A MEMORY- THIS IS NASTY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DT","review":"I like all of the other DT's a lot! But this one just doesnt cut it- i hope their new one is better! A LOT better"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't have much to say for Dream Theater's latest...","review":"Dream Theater really lost it on this release. After owning \\"Images and Words\\" for some time now, I must say that \\"Train of Thought\\" really loses it's spectacle and Dream Theater's respect. I honestly feel Dream Theater sold out to the sameness of todays music. Yes they show the same wacky guitar riffs and heavy laden verses which I have always enjoyed about their albums but \\"Train of Thought\\" really loses this. James Labrie's vocals are awful and show no sign of the same man we knew before. Labrie even raps on one of the songs on this album. It is simply awful and I find myself comparing this to Nu Metal. I'm sad to say that I wouldn't recommend this album to find Dream Theater's as always has been \\"amazing talent.\\" Instead this is a repeat of the past and of the present. This was a horrible way to spend $15 of my money, don't waist yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"I love Dream Theater, but this album is for me the biggest disappointment in prog music. It's definetely their worst studio album. It's monotonous, repeating, with interjected John's solos which are technically perfect, but not captivating. I also miss Jordan's keyboards and Mike's typical drums. It seems to me that they lost invention, they repeat the parts from their previous albums (especially mid part of \\"This Dying Soul\\" is pure copy of \\"Glass Prison\\"), but this I wouldn't mind the most. The worst is that the whole album reminds me of Metallica, at first I didn't want to admit it, but it's a matter of fact. I hope that they won't go this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good come back","review":"Let's face it, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was horrible. But DT really rebounds well on this album. I could go on and on with pointless dissecting. But other reviewers have already done that. I will just say that this is James' best vocal album since Awake. That makes a world of difference on this album since his past few efforts haven't been the greatest.As far as the music, Think of a Tool, Iron Maiden, and Metallica cake blended at 1000 mph with Dream Theater filling and that's what this album is.A good solid effort. My only 'complaint' is that I would like to hear some of those beautifully classic lushier parts that DT was so good at 10 years ago. But I understand that that isn't want they were going for on this album, so I accept it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST!!!","review":"The first time I read the album title, I thought it would be a deep thoughtful cd. But as I sticked it yesterday for the first time in my player, I said \\"WTF!\\" And then listened to it over and over for like 6 times in a row from the begining to the end.Definitely one of the best from Dream Theater. I just couldn't say what's my favorite song, as all the songs are just masterpiece, really, I can't find any weak song on it. But if you ask me which is the first song that caught my attention, I would say the 5th and the 6th track. The lyrics are very strong, they are not weak at all: listen to the last track \\"In the Name of God\\", it totally reflects today's situation.As I said, this is definitely one of the most powerful progressive metal album, powerful yet meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not Nu-Metal!","review":"How can anyone say that this album sounds like Godsmack or Tool(who, incidentally, are not Nu-Metal --> that would be Korn or Limp Bizkit, and yes there is a difference)?I have to wonder at the people that give this album 1 star. Do they even like DT or are just faking so they can seem intellectual to their friends? Clearly, this album is far and away better than anything else out there right now and probably will be as long as Blink 182 and all the wannabe punk bands are on EmptyV. That is justice enough for at least 3 stars.To call this Nu-Metal is blasphemous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think again.","review":"Its easy to run this one down. Why? Simply because DT haven't tried to deliberate yet another SFAM. They did that with 6DOIT and probably felt that they were getting stuck in their own spectacular groove of mindless progression. Train of Thought, hence is natural progression. They pretty nearly missed a wall with this one, and you fans wouldn't have been a very pleasant bunch if that had happened. Think about it. And regarding nu-metal or whatever garb they call it- it is quite demeaning to place TOT along those pungent lines. All the tracks here are great. Not one is below the DT par. Take another shot at it. Look at it from another plane of thought. You've got to...cos' times are changing and this train is constantly travelling. Look what happened to Metallica. A few years down the line, when DT deliver a real turkey (if they do cos every body does)look back and be bold enough to spin it with a lot of pride. You can still do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"F**king brutal!!!","review":"I must say that Dream Theater never fail to amaze me. TRAIN OF THOUGHT is by far the heaviest Dream Theater release, and it rocks. HARD!!!! From the first song, As I Am, to the last, In The Name Of God, it's definitely one of the best releases I've heard from them. \\"DON'T CROSS THE CROOKED STEP\\" (Honor Thy Father), has to be one of the most haunting vocal lines I've ever heard from these guys. All in all, it's a very solid release, and if you're a big Dream Theater fan that evolves with the band, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well,","review":"Anyone esle out there on their hands and knees- praying that their new one is better than this trash? CAn we be progressive please? I dont want to find Dream Theater in the Metal Section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"I want to start off by saying that i am a HUGE fan of DT and i went into this album thinking i was getting a great album, as we've come to expect from DT. Well, let's just say i was very disappointed. DT totally dropped the ball and made a mediocre Metallica-esque album that is not bad, just not DT. All of the songs sound almost the same, except the pitifully terrible Vacant, and the Superb Stream of conciousness. All of the other songs are okay, but they don't have that talent or oomph that we usually get from DT. There are some monstrous Petrucci and Portnoy moments, but they don't seem to match the song they're in. It wouldn't be a bad album if it wasn't from DT, because we expect so much more from them. Unless you're truly diehard, or you are open to new types of music, AVOID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew on me...","review":"When I first got this album I thought it was OK, but nothing special. I listened to it a few times and then put it away. I just pulled it out again a couple weeks ago and WOW...all of the sudden it ROCKED!! I have no idea why it suddenly appeals to me so much, but I really enjoyed it when I played it this time. I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought \\"Images ans Words\\" due to the good reviews of that album and I was NOT disappointed - that CD is AMAZING!! My favorite bands are Opeth, Pink Floyd, In Flames, The Cure, Hypocrisy, Katatonia, Into Eternity, Porcupine Tree and Tool, so if you have similar interests you might like Dream Theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Theater's St. Anger","review":"Buy Awake or Images & Words... hell... even Six Degrees(never thought I'd say that). Why this album bothers me: (1)AS I AM is a great song, it sets you up for the inevitable let down. (2)Actual Metallica riffs are used... and often(listen for One and Blackened. Upon closer inspection apparent lifts from Sanitarium, Orion, and other classic metal standards will appear)! (3) The Vocals (4) The lyrics (5) They are capable of so much more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like good songwriting...","review":"don't get this CD. Nothing grabbed me. I've listened to and been a fan of DT since '92. I've seen them on every tour, sometimes multiple times per tour. I can appreciate the artistic endeavor, and I can't fault them for doing the music they want, but I just don't care for the writing on this album. The musicianship is nothing short of stunning, but who cares if the song isn't worth listening to in the first place.Jordan's performances were great. His restraint and new sounds worked well. James's performance is also quite good. Those were the two bright spots on the album for me.I was so disappointed in this cd that I gave it away. I hope it is appreciated more by the new owner. I'm passing on this tour. Sorry guys. I just don't think this is your best effort to date. In fact, I liked Falling into Infinity more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album that grows on one","review":"It took me a couple of tries, but in the end, I really fell in love with this album. I love the fact that DT continues to explore new avenues of rock with each album, and as a thrash metal album, this is one of the best I've ever heard. Each song is unique, with superior individual performances as well as great orchestration. They employ chordal structures and time signature changes which are unique and unfamiliar to this genre of music, making the whole experience challanging as well as pleasurable.I understand and respect the negative feelings some have had to the album because it such a departure form their other albums, but that's part of makes it exciting for me. I wholeheartedly recommend that you give it a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same Band!!","review":"Being a Woman- I like the songs that emphasize more vocals- Past Dream Theater songs really got me into this band- (and my husband showing me the songs) When he bought this album I was very excited to hear it- after listening to it for a while- I had to turn it off- there is one slow song, but its not very good- I feel the vocals here are not that good- This album is WAY too heavy, and \\"not proggy enough\\" - explains my husband.- He likes it however-"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's wrong with ya'll??????????","review":"I'm a huge Dream Theater fan and this is one of their best albums. This cd is there most aggressive album and rocks from start to finish. I couldn't believe the rating of this cd. It kind of pisted me off to be honest. Any way give this album a listen it's killer and flows with lots of different tempos and the most important thing \\"it's heavy!!!\\" Pick this up!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"Dream Theater's seventh album brings it to the table, dishes it out, and cleans up afterwards. A great album that, while only containing seven tracks, crosses the entire spectrum from the fast and heavy \\"This Dying Soul\\" to the calm and methodical \\"Vacant\\", easily more variation that many other bands out there can fit into albums with twice as many tracks.Train of Thought has something for everyone, and for fans of Dream Theater, new and old, it certainly doesn't disappoint. And the more you listen to it, the more you grow to like it. Definitely a recommended buy, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest heavy rock albums of all time!","review":"For fans familiar with Dream Theater, nothing needs to be said about the musicianship. For new fans, it helps to listen to a song at least 5 to 10 times before passing judgement. The songs have so much depth that a listener cannot grasp it all with a single listen. I'm a guitar guy, John Petrucci is the most skilled rock guitar player in the world IMHO. Mike Portnoy's percussion on this album is mind boggling. Not just technical, but really accessible and interesting. This album, along with Octavarium, DT displays a new level of polish with their song writing that really appeals to my ear. Buy this album, listen to it ten times, and prepare to become a new obsessive Dream Theater fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAST FAV DT ALBUM- BY FAR","review":"This album is my least favorite of all DT- except \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" of course- Its just not very progressive- a lot of technical showing off- its just not DT- Labrie- I really hope you dont RAP in DT's next album!

I am a huge fan of all music that is passionate and complicated. I really do not care for Prog music at all. On this one, these perfectly polished musicans became very deep, emotional and soulful. This is their crown jewel. I don't think they could understand how it became, and they did it. They hit a vibe and they know it. I went and saw them live just because of this work and was blown away. It is actually like beautiful artwork. It is simple, it is thought provoking, it is easy and it feels.... it lifts itself off of the canvas and has its own idenity. Everytime you listen to it you hear and feel something striking."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!!!","review":"I agree with some of the reviews below-- esp the one right below me- but its better than 1 star- Id say two- Images and Scenes are 5 stars- awake 4- change 3-- THIS ALBUM just doesent work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album for the metal fan but...","review":"This is a great Dream Theater album and by far their heaviest album yet. TOT will quicky become a fave among metal fans, but for the fans that loved Images and Words, and Scenes from a Memory, they have been short changed. This albums lacks the classical sound that most Dream Theater albums have. Train of Thought focuses on just being hardcore rather than artistic. Although artistic in its own way, Train of Thought still doesn't quite measure up to the originality of Images and Words and Scenes from a Memory. If trying to decide which Dream Theater album to start off with, I'd tell you buy Scenes from A memory or Images and words first, then it's a toss up between 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulance and Train of Thought. Either way, Train of Thought is still a great album. I definetly reccamend it for the metal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, I knew it","review":"Did you expect something better? 6doit had already shown what some of the old DT fans knew: magic is over. JP and MP just fill everything with disgusting extremely fast things. Do never again expect nice melodic (and virutous too, that was magic) unisons, or good lyrics. The only comments can be now of the sort: \\"wow, how fast\\". But never again, not even with SFAM, which I found to be some sort of insult for that master piece that was Metroplolis 1 will I expect to be touched musically (melody, harmony, even virtuosism) and lirically. Does DT belong to Portnoy? I liked him but began to find him ever more irritating each time I saw that he pretended to do everything: songwriting, singing, producing. It's obvious what KM foresaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPOCRITE-","review":"GUESS WHAT- IF I DONT LIKE THE NEW DT- GONNA SPAM THAT ONE AS WELL- YOU WONT BEAT ME- HAHAHAHAHAHA"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOT dissapoints- STILL","review":"this album is now a coaster for my drinks- it is that bad- STREAN is the only good song"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst DT- bad, bad album","review":"This album is a disgrace to prog music- it should be in the metal section, not prog"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different, But Crappy","review":"I would normally give this 2, maybe 2 1/2 stars- but i need to counter all those INSANE 5 star reviewers- IF YOU GAVE THIS 5 STARS YOUR NEW TO THIS BAND- AND DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM- THIS ALBUM IS NOT PROG- ITS CRAPPY METAL!

John Petrucci's guitar playing is still unbelievable in its speed and ferocity. The guitar solo in the intro of \\"This Dying Soul\\" has a sweet wah part with John's shredding. It leads into a beautiful melody that features one of the coolest guitar tones I've heard. Mike Portnoy's drumming is unstoppable and cutting edge as far as metal drumming goes (and it goes far).Buy it.-I'll Eat YouSoon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No time to read reviews","review":"DT is one of the few bands that I go out and purchase their material without any advance knowledge of what is on the disc. It has been that way since 1992 when I&W was given to me as a gift by a true friend. Since then I don't bother reading reviews of DT until after I make the purchase and only then it is to find out what other fans are thinking and saying. Needless to say Train of Thought, with its darker sound and more intense edge is as good as any of the best metal albums out without the harsh \\"death-strangle-mumble\\" of much of the \\"heavy-metal\\" being broadcast and played on headbangers ball and similar. I guess I am showing my age when I complain about the state of todays rock and metal music when I say that much of what comes out is either way to \\"lite\\" or else way to hard. DT is the perfect blend of virtuosity and hard driven rock with a melodic core that I can listen to in the car with the wife and not have her tell me to turn it down. Anyway, enough said, go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 stars? haha Hardly!!!","review":"This is easily the worst DT album to date. The songs are so boreing I couldn't listen to the entire thing. I had to come back to it several times before I heard the entire thing. It's a total waste of time if you own any other 2 DT CDs as every riff and rhythm is on every previous CD.

FINALLY a new DT that i love to crank all the way up and listen to over and over again!!! it is every bit as good as Awake, but a little different feel, it is not NOT NuMetal!!! the solos are awesome, the singing isn't so old school opera-ish, the riffs are heavy and tight. its like a whole cd of mirror-lie, but it keeps moving the whole time, nothing boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree- some","review":"I agree with some of these \\"negative\\" reviews- but to give it one star is a bit harsh- It sucks, but not 1 star sucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless jamming","review":"there is not THOUGHT to this album- they just shred, and shred, rinse, lather and repeat"},{"rating":"1","title":"DT headed in wrong direction","review":"I know that im not in the band- but they need to wake up- and go back to their roots- they are getting worse and worse"},{"rating":"1","title":"PROG SNOOZER","review":"NO JOKE- THIS CD IS NOW A COASTER ON MY COFFEE TABLE- JUST TO PROTEST HOW BAD IT IS-- MY FRIENDS AGREE (NOT ALL, BUT A LOT) THAT THIS ALBUM IS PURE DONKEY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"Thank you, Mr D. \\"Artist/Designer/Kibitzer\\", for your review.True DT fans would love TOT because they would have the same eclectic taste as DT itself has.

What I got was a refreshing and unexpected experience. Technically this album is on par with the other ones. I cannot say this one is better than Awake or Images and Words, etc. What i can say is that this album has more substance, once you look beyond the technical wisdom that this guys posses when they play their instruments. James LaBrie has more control of his voice, and it shows. He can still go \\"high\\" but the tone of this album is more \\"deep\\". John Meyung's bass has taken a front row in this production and it clearly shows what damage the guy can do.In all, this is an album that has more feeling and a consistent tone.

Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band.

There just is not enough original ideas, although there are occasional interesting instrumental passages. The vocalist just sucks, and overall they sound like a neo-prog band on steroids. THIS DYING SOUL- made me want to die after hearing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 1/2 stars","review":"WAAAAYYY below previous efforts- and worse than even their 1st album- for DT- 1 1/2 stars- I used to think they were prog...but... i guess not........"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE TO ADMIT IT....BUT...THIS SUCKS!","review":"Im so sorry DT fans- there is no way to lift this curse of an album!!!! OUCH- STAY CLEAR OF METAL DT- you are not METALLICA! cheap way to get more fans-- in my opinion- STREAM only good prog song....STAY CLEARps.

Im pissed.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Approach","review":"I have been a HUGE fan since the video Pull Me Under (off Images and Words....second album for those who don't know) hit Headbangers Ball on MTV (When they used to play metal...... actualy, when the used to play music in general.) If you have been following the updates on them before the album came out, they did say that they were putting out a classic metal album (old Metallica, Megadeth.) Knowing this, I was very surprised that the was the typical technicality and length of DT....the way that DT can only do and not make it sound boring. All their albums were different and this one continues the tradition. Unlike Metallica (where all albums are different) this one is actually awesome. If you like The Glass Prison (off 6doit) and its heaviness, you definately will like this album. If you are looking for Images And Words 2 or Metropolis Part 3: Stream Of Consiousness, then this album is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"What the hell are these guys thinking? Why do they thinking people can handle 12 minute average songs that intense? The solo's are just shredding and technical show off. I'm disappointed because DT starts to sound like a loony tune soundtrack instaid of honest thoughtfull songwriting. Training of Wrists is a better name!Im waiting for the New Symphony X- porcupine tree- and i would rather listen to Dreamscape- this is horrid!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was their \\"train of thought\\" when doing this?","review":"This album sipmly just blows and as a DT fan I'm very disapointed. It seems obvious that they have forgoten the lesson of \\"Falling into infinity\\" and released something really commercial. It looks like now they are going for that Godsmack/Disturbed/new Metallica sound which I can't stand. When bands used to say thay they are playing heavy they meant something in the vain of Iron Maiden/Megadeth/old Metallica, but now it is used to discribe the Nu Metal sound. Not to say it doesn't have its moments, but over all this album is a downer. Overall the complex technical and song writting that they are known for is gone in this album. I think that a two to three year break is in order for DT and they should remember why they have had the following they have had for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh-","review":"Id really like to give it 1 star- but that looks really bad- BAD DT album- (This is my fav band) if they do this again Rush if my favorite band- or Symphony X"},{"rating":"2","title":"My two cents","review":"DT continues to deliver quality music with TOT. There is definitely a progression in thier music style to a more aggressive and heavier direction. James vocals are awesome and he experiments with some other effects to his voice at times. Petrucci remains a God among guitarists with perfect technique and his usually progressive touch. At first the CD seems to lack something but as you listen to it more, it progresses and becomes a better and better piece of music. While it does not sound like Images and Words thats good since I already have a copy of that CD. Without a doubt one to the best CD's of 2003 and a great addition to the Dream Theater evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal To My Ears","review":"What I love about Dream Theater is that they keep the fan/listener guessing. You never know what these guys are going to do next. I disagree with all the naysayers that say this is nu-breed metal. This is Dream Theater doing what they do best, constantly changing. Nu-breed metal, while some of it is good, is uninspired junk usually. DT continues to have heart and soul when it comes to their music, and I feel that this is one of their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline continues","review":"The question is when DT will hit the rock-bottom. I hope \\"ToT\\" is and that they will rise again. I think the fact that songwriting for this...took not more than 3 weeks says everything.

I wasn't expecting much from it to begin with, and aside from Stream of Consciousness and In The Name of God, I don't really hear anything interesting on here. The band just sounds like they ran out of ideas and took a bunch of them from the Metallica/Megadeth playbook. I don't mind constant change and progression, even occasional tributes to influences (but not as blatant as the \\"Blackened\\" vocal section in \\"This Dying Soul\\"). But this... just doesn't do it for me. \\"Going metal\\" does not equal tuning down, playing uninteresting, unmelodic solos and trying to sound like a tough guy. It's like they're not even trying anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of funny","review":"It's weird. The people who like this album compare it with the recent DT albums, which aren't good either. I can only say that this is not DT."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Shed Some Light...","review":"Excellent CD, simply put.As stated previously, it is not understood why there is such a galactic amount of hate for this album.

A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this???????????","review":"Ok- I have been overseas for a long time- (NAVY) When I left- I was a huge Dream Theater fan- I came back two months ago- and I couldnt believe my ears- This is Dream Theater?

Comparate this Whit WDADU, Images And Words or Scenes From A Memory is like an Ant Fighting a Lion! KEVIN MOORE COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!! I love Dream Theater, but this album is for me the biggest disappointment in prog music. It's definetely their worst studio album. It's monotonous, repeating, with interjected John's solos which are technically perfect, but not captivating. I also miss Jordan's keyboards and Mike's typical drums. It seems to me that they lost invention, they repeat the parts from their previous albums (especially mid part of \\"This Dying Soul\\" is pure copy of \\"Glass Prison\\"), but this I wouldn't mind the most. The worst is that the whole album reminds me of Metallica, at first I didn't want to admit it, but it's a matter of fact. I hope that they won't go this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end 2","review":"I agree completely with Eddie's review called \\"the end\\". Since ACOS, not even SFAM has been good in my opinion. SFAM pretended clearly to be an apology for that disaster that was FII. But even its lyrics are the poorest romantic literature. From then on, concert, video and the newest studio albums, terrible. And as I said in a previous review, I came to relate this new DT with MP. He does everything.Sad, really sad.

Saw them back up ELP in 1998 (Forgetable). I am a long time Progressive rock fan, ELP, Yes, Genesis, KC, Marillion, you name it. This is not and I repeat NOT progressive rock. It is just Metal and nothing else. I was so disappointed when purchasing this album, so much so that this is the first review of any album I have ever bought (over 400). Anyone who calls this or anything by this band progressive should be shot. Metal is not progressive. I loved the work Portnoy did with Transatlantic and I am not denying the incredible musicianship of Dream Theatre, but this is metal and nothing but. A waste of money for any progressive rock fan. I rate this album 2 stars only because there are great musicians at work(?)here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love hearing the same guitar solo every time....","review":"Not, Dream Theater is terrible....all they do is make a soundscape and John Petrucci does his Malmsteen thing. Time changes and very fast songs for 13 minutes, WHATS THE DAMN POINT?? Ugh this album is boring.They should stick to short melodic songs a la Innocence Faded and Solitary Shell, great songs, but they even wreck their own song by thinking they have to put some instrumental that should have nothing to do with the songs at the end.Anyway, steer clear of this album unless you're already in the Dream Theater cult of 15 minutes of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No!","review":"Let me first say...

It may not be similar to Images and Words, and not have the technical and melodic prowess of Scenes from a Memory BUT It still showcases dream theaters TRUE ability to play their instruments INCREDIBLY well, the songs are amazing. Portnoy's drumming skills continue to always amaze me. Although Rudess isnt heard to well on the album his contributions are noticeable and are awesome. Even though this isnt a melodic drama like SFAM, it's still an amazing album. I'd recommend this with any other dream theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"I have only recently just gotten into Dream Theater, so my opinion may not mean much. Though I do believe this is a good CD in its own right. But it is much different than other releases by this band. It is indeed much heavier and the lyrics aren't as smart as they used to be (No offense to anyone) though lyrics were never their strong point. It is their instrumentation and technical ability. Something I believe they do well on this CD. The main thing is, that its different from other release, to me this is a good way to prevent becoming stale in their sound.So I believe if you already like Dream Theater and you want a harder edge, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is who they are and what we want !","review":"Wow! This is the heaviest album since \\"AWAKE\\". I was surprized when I hear this first (it always happen in the case of DT.), but after 2nd, 3rd... listening, it already becomes the best DT's album. You know why? Cause DT is alwasy progressing. They never ever made the similar album before. This is why they NEVER make me bored, and why we love them! (Jame's rap is owesome!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't decide","review":"I love Dream Theater, I mean, ask anyone who knows me, and they know how much I worship these guys. However, this album so far seems to be starting off as a letdown. The songs are starting to grow on me, but they seem very structured. I like how Dream Theater typically tried to stay from having refrains as often and whatnot, but it seems like they have in this album. Also, the songs just don't seem as tecnical as they could be, though the solos are still amazing. I tend to find that a lot of the songs sound alike, sorta the mix they used in the Glass Prison(I even think the 2nd track is supposed to be an extension of the Glass Prison). I defintely wanted a track similar to 6 Degrees or even Blind Faith more. I like how all the songs are long, and the instrumental parts always grow on me. Either way, this is Dream Theater, and Ill always buy their cds and still respect them for their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST DT","review":"YES, THIS WAS WRITTEN IN 3 WEEKS- WHAT A JOKE- STREAM OF CON IS ONLY DECENT SONG HERE- THE VOCALS ARE HORRID- JORDAN IS BARELY HEARD- PORTNOY IS A MORON, AND PETRUCCI PLAYS TOO FAST- WITH NO SOUL.

There was 80's guitar squeals, lame keyboard solos, and of course, the most annoying singer in the world, James Labrie. He sounds like a 7 year old whining about not getting any Power Ranger dolls for Christmas!If you want progressive rock, try Pink Floyd's Ummagumma.

It is as if that insult that was FII had pressed them to try to fix it pretending to please their progressive fans.

After reading the other reviews, I'm guessing this is because the album was written in only 3 weeks. I'm actually surprised. I would have guessed it was written in 3 days.4)There only seems to be one style on the album: play heavy.

I am a Dream Theater fan...they are the best, most precise musicians I have ever heard. To me they are a compilation of Rush, Queen and Kansas with a turbo attatched. Anybody who doesn't hear these bands in Dream Theater has never listened to these bands. Anyway, the music on this album is mechanical, angry and cold. Very repetitive. Munites and minutes of the same melody and riff, almost industrial, nauseating. If you are looking for Awake, go buy it, or pull it out and listen to it, you will be more satisfied.

This disc is completely different, and I knew it would be. There aren't any rock anthems or overtures on this disc that run throughout the disc, as Dream Theater would usually write. Instead the disc is cohesive in its mood. It's a dark, angry sounding CD and there are a lot more metal moments. It reminds me of certain segments of disc one of 6 Degrees and a great deal of Awake. All in all, I think this is the direction they've been trying to go all along. My favorite thing about this album is that it lacks any cheesy sounding 80's style anthems which are present on some of their earlier albums. It's all heavy, it's all intense, and it's every bit Dream Theater doing what they do best. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMAGES...OF THOUGHT","review":"WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM?10 YEARS OF EVOLUTION IN DREAM THEATER MUSIC...BUT THIS IS NOT DT TO ME.ALL THE COMPOSITIONS SEEM OUT OF INSPIRATION ,LIKE THEY WAS MADE HASTILY.THERE ARE SOME GOOD MOMENTS IN ALL THE SONGS BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR MUSICIANS LIKE THEM AND OF COURSE IN COMPARISON WITH THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS.I OWN THIS ALBUM AND I HAVE LISTENED TO IT MANY TIMES TO FIND SOMETHING EQUAL TO THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS.I DIDN'T.THIS IS A VERY HEAVY METAL RECORD AND THE METAL FANS WILL LIKE IT.PERSONALLY I'M NOT A HEAVY METAL FAN AND I DON'T LISTEN DT BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVY BUT CAUSE THEY SHOWED ME AND TO THE WORLD THAT THEY ARE SOMETHING MORE THAN A ROCK BAND.THE THING THAT SAVES THE ALBUM IS THE EXCELENT MUSISIANSHIP;THEY MAKE BAD MUSIC GOOD MUSIC.PETRUCCI HAVE NEVER PLAYED SO FAST AMD HEAVY AND WITH NO ESSENSE.THE SOLOS ARE TECHNICHALY VERY GOOD BUT THEY AREN'T DEEP AS PETRUCCI USED TO PLAY.THIS IS THE ''GO FOR THE MONEY'' ALBUM.AS IT SEEMS THEY WILL MAKE IT GOOD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"I'm going to be brief here. Compared to \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Metropolis : Scenes from a Memory\\" or the first disc of \\"Six Degrees...\\", this album is very unremarkable. Seriously, what's the point? After listening to the album through multiple times, it's just very uninspiring and lackluster. Boring, even. Nothing is worth listening to, and it just goes on and on....There isn't one song that ever screams, \\"Listen to meee !!!!\\" Nope.

Just annoying and useless.2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get back to the art of SONGwriting","review":"Since Images and Words, DT has progressively (pun intended) put more and more emphasis on chops and the expense of songs.

At least, not on this album. The first two songs conjure up familiar riffs from other heavy bands and just twist them into 10-12 minute snooze fests...random guitar pyro, killer drumming but just DERIVATIVE and Loooong...almost just for the sake of being long. Check out Images and Words for true brilliance and catchiness.........also, the new kings of progressive metal with MEANING?

If your more of a fan of there Rush-like progressive stuff, you probably won't be into this album. If your into real in-your-face metal. You'll love this album. This a Deam Theater that is raw and agressive. That having been said. There is still plenty of guitar solos, awesome drumming, bass playing, and keybeord work buy the band. This is not \\"slick\\" production wise but its not crappy like Metallica's St. Anger album. I can make out some parallels to old school Metallica and even some of the newer metal out there today but the thing is that is still plenty of guitar solos and individual vertuosity by the band. Not to mention that the guitars although detuned, ARE STILL IN TUNE. As differient as this album is, you can still make out that its Dream Theater.

However, putting together a \\"greatest hits\\" album with such a limited amount of tracks was an impossible mission to complete.Every Pantera album is nearly immaculate and it is too hard to say which is best because they are all slightly different. While this album has some good songs on it, every Pantera fan would be less than pleased with it. It is lacking too many awesome songs that every fan would agree are worthy of \\"best of\\" status.

I can see why people say certain tracks are missing, and i can name a couple personal faves that arent on her. But overall, its a great package at an unbelievable price.I dont see how people can complain about $12 for a CD of panteras best known tracks (it is a 'best of' people) as well as the accompanying videos.

Aparte de esto, aparecen muchas canciones del disco \\"REINVENTING THE STEEL\\" (que en mi opinión no son muy buenas) y mi favorita de ese CD, \\"HELL BOUND\\" no esta incluida. Por el lado positivo incluye 2 canciones que originalmente habian salido en recopilaciones con varios artistas. \\"PLANET CARAVAN\\" (De Nativity In Black) y \\"Cat scratch Fever\\" (De el soundtrack de Detroit Rock City) que son bastante buenas!

They are missing the best songs like suicide note part 1 and 2, war nerve, primal concrete sledge, domination, sandblasted skin, new level, strength beyond strength, floods, hollow..and many more.

The construction is sturdy (actually pretty heavy for wood tray) but aside from that, there's not much here. I gave it four stars, only because it's pretty bland. Yes, it's a flatware tray, but it's also 12 bucks. I saw a slightly cheaper mesh metal tray here on Amazon, and that had a bit more character to it (although the metal would probably be a bit more abrasive on the utensils.) Just something to consider. It gets the job done, but it'd be more worth the money if it was stained or painted black or something.

Dialog is flat, narration is trite (more than once the narrator describes another character as \\"someone I could really talk to\\"), and the characters are melodramatic and self-absorbed. Plus, the author feels the need to provide a note at the end of the book explaining the character of Sui -- Doesn't Yoshimoto know by now that a good author shouldn't have to explain her characters?

Great idea uh, 150+ songs, put it on shuffle play and it can go for days!!! WRONG!Lets count the problems: Occasional looooong delays between songs, a few songs just cut off and jump to the next (after a LONG pause), It usually shuts down by itself within 30-45 minutes, meaning I have to start it up again. It can take 30-60 seconds to boot up and start playing the first song, and then you have to go into preferences each time and turn shuffle play on. All of these things happen while using the power adapter. Problems grow when trying to run it on batteries.Sounds like a great idea, and using the power adapter, I would expect to have solid, effortless solution to running music for an entire evening. NO WAY! This thing usually can't play for more than 15-20 minutes before having a problem.If it were FREE it wouldn't be worth the effort"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest book on Christian dating","review":"This book does offer some helpful advice, but is primarily geared toward younger, dating singles (high school and college). These singles are at the greatest risk of investing too much time into the relationships instead of cultivating the lifeskills they should be developing. I don't agree with Holzmann's take on the \\"Brother/sister\\" angle. It's true younger singles can find themselves giving too much time and energy to dating instead of building their lives in other areas, but the idea that you can go from being a platonic friend to being engaged (as the author did)is not realistic. The best part of Holzmann's book is on page 167 where he advises readers to develop life habits, how to relate and to \\"make even ordinary circumstances extraordinary.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Farce","review":"Well, simply put, this book takes a very interesting approach to the whole Brother/Sister relationship thing. I think I can sum up my opinion of the book by referring to an example given by the author where his wife goes on a date with another man 3 weeks prior to their engagement. His wife claimed to have no clue as to where their relationship was going. Holzman could not \\"understand it\\" when the man who had went on a date with his wife, just 3 weeks prior to the engagement felt \\"led on\\". Holzman also had no remorse for loving many women. I'm afraid that this book is not healthy to \\"the body\\". Are we building one another up with these brother/ sister relationships or simply setting each other up for a big fall?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ive read some (...) in my day","review":"Pentacostal rhetoric.

I ended up hanging them upside-down like bats.The subwoofer level control has a bad taper. Keep turning, but it doesn't get much softer after 1/4, until the point at which it shuts off completely.The power is on all the time, even with the switch turned off. \\"Make this connection last\\" is right.. but unplug the wallwart first.The satellites are tight, even though they seem insubstantial.

With that said, I did spend the price that Amazon gave it, and am very satisfied with the contents. The renderings are for the most part fantastic. If you don't like one painting/sketching, you will usually find another one depicting the same thing further on. The book is divided into sections reflecting the various regions discussed in the book. Whether it is character depictions or scenic renderings you fancy the book is filled with either.The main focus of the book is art, so there are no real detailed descriptions of what you're looking at. For the most part you can use either the section or the title of the art as a quick guide. The only flaw with the whole thing I thought was the absence of an index to quickly look up paintings. I would've liked to have seen one of those.

A few of the images were truly good, but for the most part, seriously lacking. I'm just as rabid a fan as the next reviewer of this product, but I am also honest, and won't label something extraordinary just because someone's name is on it...

Making an exhibit is extremely boring now. There is no guesswork at all. You just go on the biome tab and just paint out the biome. It comes with trees, plants, rocks, the works. Sure you can put in the trees and rocks yourself but you really won't know how many to put in.

Here they took that feature away making it much more difficult to tell if they like that(i.e.) maple tree that you are puting in their exibit.

I've never tried any other products, so have no comparisons, but this seems to be working well enough that I probably won't bother with other items anyway.

Delonghi offered to replace if we sent them a snip of the cord and $9.50 for shipping replacement. OK. New Delonghi coffee maker arrived, same make/model and it lasted about 6 weeks or 35 pots of coffee. Crazy. Getting refund/replacement takes weeks and we're back to the old coffee press.

Has a marker/stairstep inside to indicate water level instead of one of those bulbs that will eventually stick.

Only used it a couple of times and decided it wasn't worth it.Setting clock and timer is a pain. One button and you have to wait for it to go all the way around. No fast/slow buttons. One direction only. After a while it will start blinking and nobody can explain why. Unplugging it clears it and then there's is 5 minutes of joy to reset its clock. A two second power failure is all it takes to clear it.Machine beeps every 15 minutes to let you know it is a pain. Shuts off after two hours whether you like it or not.

It has the most annoying beep every 15 minutes to let you know it is still on. The coffee is not hot when the brewing is finished and it only keeps it lukewarm for 2 hours. After 1 hour you certainly have to put your coffee in the microwave to heat it up. But the best feature of this coffeemaker is that it only lasted 6 WEEKS!!!! Can you imagine that, it stopped working, died dead in a month and a half. I have purchased other DeLonghi products, but our relationship is permanently ended, kaput.

I asked them to send me a email and I will attach my receipt to it and send it back to them thinking they would surely get that way. Not so. Third time I called I finally got hold of a guy that did not hang up until he received my receipt in his email. That took about thirty minutes. I got my new leak less craft in five days and soon after a month of my order I was enjoying a not so hot cup of coffee. This coffee pot does not make coffee as hot as my old Cuisinart.

Now they decided to replace it with a 'new' machine which is a totally different one (DCF2212T) This one isn't any better as the pull out basket area won't stay shut and also was supposed to have a button to push to open the basket area. It doesn't. You just pull. I have only had it a week, and several times while getting coffee, the basket area opens. I have to actually slam it shut to keep it shut.

They responded that the receipt didn't have a date on it. After I helped them by. pointing out date they agreed to replace it. They told me through unit was under warranty however I would have to send them a check for $15 to cover shipping.

Programming is easy, coffee prep is a breeze, and the charcoal filter improves the coffee taste. Unfortunately, the pot has a design flaw, as mentioned by others: After awhile the plastic rim around the pot expands and allows coffee to leak just under the pour spout. In order not to spill it all over the kitchen counter, we're forced to fill our cups at the kitchen sink. Going to contact Delonghi and see if they'll send me a new pot.

It makes a great cup of HOT coffee and I tend to make my coffee strong, so I love the 14 cup capacity because it has a larger cone shaped filter, so I can put more coffee in. The \\"aroma\\" button feature which makes the coffee brew slower is fantastic! It makes the coffee taste soooo smooth! This is truly worth $200 - but at under $60...it's a rare, quality find!

What a mistake it was. Setting the time if very time consuming. There is no separate buttons for hours or minutes. If you're setting the time around midnight, then it should only take you about ten minutes to set. Do not try to set the time or auto brew in the evening. Pull up a chair and plan to sit there for a long time. Also, you use the same button to brew or for the timer. Sometimes press it twice thinking your hitting the auto brew then when you wake up the next morning thinking you have a fresh pot of coffee, you don't.

I went online and after a couple of weeks, recieved a new one in the mail. Well, it took two days again for the new one to leak and it is worse than the first one. The weight of a full carafe with hot liquid in it pulls the glas away from the black plastic.

It made good coffee and was a good design in terms of miscellaneous performance issues: easy to fill and to see the fill lines; did not leave a mess on the countertop; even told us when it was time to de-lime.Alas, all these good feelings disappeared when the machine died just 14 months after we got it--2 months after the warranty ran out. The pump apparently stopped working. The lights come on, but the water does not move. So, let's see. $70--the \\"sale\\" price at Amazon--divided by 420 (approximate days we used it) means that we are paying about 17 cents a day for the coffee maker.

I was excited when I ordered the DeLonghi DC514T coffeemaker but with the first pot of coffee the quality of flavor was only average. After a lot of experimenting and brewing on the aroma mode that takes five times as long I was able to get it to a reasonable average. I had read a number of reviews that said it was fantastic and noted a few that said the coffeemaker had quality problems but typically if it died it was quick. This one lasted nearly two years before it died, the good news is I now get to get a coffeemaker that does quality beans justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drip Water from Below","review":"Loved this coffee maker for 1 year and 1 month.

After just two weeks, I broke the carafe. I was able to get a replacement online for about $15, no problem. The 14 cup carafe size is great for when I have company. I use the Aroma button and it does take a little longer to brew, but the flavor is worth the wait. ...So flavorful and delicious! Typically, I set the timer before going to bed and wake up with fresh, hot coffee. I have had no problems with the machine. It does beep when the brewing is complete - not a problem for me. The LED clock display is the only thing I might complain about. To set the clock you have to go around 23 hours and mine does not light up. ...Not sure if it supposed to be lit and mine is broken or if it is not supposed to be lit. Either way, it is a minor detail. I would definitely buy this coffee maker again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee, Poor Reliability","review":"We wanted to find a coffeemaker that made excellent coffee. Our internet research led us to the DeLonghi DC514T 14 cup coffeemaker. Reviews were correct, this machine makes a very good cup of coffee... HOWEVER, I made the mistake of not checking product reliability because after 5 months this machine started leaking water all over the counter. I would have known this if I had checked reliability. If you are reading this then you have covered all bases and probably will not buy this product. \\"MY loss is your gain\\".

I'm not sure if it would remind me of bands like Chemlab (which I highly recommend for any industrial band), but this album is extremely good. It is very different from a lot of other industrial that I've heard. It has more guitars and the vocals aren't quite as harsh, but it's still great nonetheless. So why only four stars? I couldn't really get into every song. The first one starts out very strong and gets you hyped up. Then, it sort of goes into a short drought. \\"Don't pray\\" is a good song, and then it doesn't get really great again until \\"Happy pill.\\" But overall, I like this album and recommend it for industrial, and even metal, fans. Very good album. Go out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, its impossible to do this justice","review":"Each and every Rivethead out there, and even metalheads, take not of this.

For example, the first phrase to learn is Xiexie, which means thank you. This book would have you say \\"Sie-sie,\\" by which I guess it means \\"See-see.\\" However, \\"ie\\" in pinyin spelling is said like the \\"e\\" in \\"yes.\\" Furthermore, the pinyin \\"x\\" is much closer to our \\"sh\\" than it is to \\"s,\\" so nothing about the pronunciation offered is sufficiently accurate. Our tour guide in China said that \\"see-see\\" is the Chinese equivalent of what we euphemistically call \\"tinkle\\" (urination by a small child).

But in this video, he doesn't tell any secret of playing fast, but an open secret --- practice. Actually, he doesn't talk much in the video. I think over 80% of the video is his demonstration over the exercises from the book given. Yes, i like his demos, because at least i know how does he start a phrase, end a phrase, and all that jazz.

What sets this novel apart from other \\"historical mystery fiction\\" is the superb writing style. The seamless first person narrative makes you \\"one\\" with the protagonist.

I consider myself pretty well educated, and English is one of my best subjects, but I was surprised at the amount of words I came across that I had never even heard before! Let alone knew what they meant! But it was fascinating in that respect as well as the story line and the depth and the romance of it all. While it did somewhat revolve around an actual love story I would say that the more romanticized parts of the novel were actually the truths and the lies and the intertwining histories that were obviously so carefully weaved together! It was just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mid 1800s mystery","review":"It took a bit to get into the book, but once I did I really enjoyed it. I felt like I had been transported back in time. The one thing that was a bit tedious was all the footnotes. Most of them really didn't help the story and I stopped reading them about half way through since they just slowed me down. I loved trying to figure out what would happen to Edward next since he seems to just keep having problems and bad luck. I discussed it with another person at a book club and had fun talking about the characters using the questions in the back. Such as, was he justified to commit the murder, and were people really out to get him. I was immediately ready for the sequel, The Glass of Time, to see what happened next. It was long book at 700 pages, but the last 400 pages went by so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Night\\" Defined","review":"Quite the intelligent read, although the constant pseudo-references to literary works was distracting. Two gripes (one minor, one major): a main plot point (\\"A Love Betrayed\\") was written on the dust jacket of the hard cover I read, thus revealing an important action towards the end of the book. I kept hoping it was referring to something else but was disappointed to find out it didn't. [That's the minor gripe.] My major gripe? The protagonist never confronts his usurper! The novel builds to what I expected was going to be the greatest confrontation of all time but it sadly is anti-climactic. What a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, terrible on a Kindle","review":"I was really eager to read this book, but I found it to be one of the worst candidates for Kindle reading ever. It has a lot of footnotes that are great and add a lot to the story (a la Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, one of my absolute favorites!), but the process of clicking on these footnotes in order to read them and then attempting to get back to the location where you were when you originally clicked was a NIGHTMARE. I ended up giving up after several frustrating experiences clicking a million times to try to get back to my spot and just ended up checking it out from the library. All in all, a total waste of money.The book itself is awesome. Just don't buy the Kindle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding","review":"'The Meaning of Night' is an amazing read - arguably well beyond any other (modern) attempt at portraying the gloom and grit of Victorian England, whilst exhibiting the very literary eloquence and beauty that one would expect from a novel written in that time.I have just recently finished this novel (or confession, mind you) and am most absolutely blown away by its complete and, for the most part, unwavering presentation, so much that felt the inclination to write this review immediately after turning its last page. If you've a passion for Victorian-age literature like myself, and even IF you're a purist who hasn't strayed into the almost-always-disappointing contemporary works that are rooted in those times, I've the feeling you'll find much enjoyment in this book.

Meticulously researched, the historical detail did bog down the book, but that was really its only flaw. The characters, and their surprising actions, were fascinating and the intricate plot moved unpredictably.

He has killed a stranger, an innocent man, as a practice run for his planned murder of his enemy. Who this enemy is and why Edward wishes to kill him is the basis for this book, the purported confession of all the events in Glyver's life that have pushed him to this point.Very Dickens like in tone this story is an examination of obsession and how it can overtake a life, to ruinous results for all. Our protagonist Glyver is a man that, although you can understand some of his anguish, isn't all together likeable. When Glyver says to trust no one, it is apparent that everyone in this tale is not what he or she seems.Filled with long buried secrets, lies, betrayals, revenge, love, houses of ill-repute, and opium dens one can almost hear evil laughter in the background. Though a long book, it moves fairly fast as we are caught up in the web of lies and sinister doings. A first rate tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary","review":"I found this book to be long, drawn out, dreary and impossibly dull.

Alas, it's downhill from there. Well, not quite, but almost. That is, up until the author detours to give us the backstory (after just a couple of chapters), it is a gripping narrative. Unfortunately, the backstory is much, much longer than it needs to be--the author losing his focus, it seems, and falling into repetitive and unnecessary detail. Then, when he finally takes us back to real time, the ending is without surprise or irony and I, for one, shrugged and wondered why I had invested the effort.The writing, to be sure, is good. Not great, but good, and I wonder if all the historical footnotes are for our benefit, as they certainly don't help move the story along, or the author's need to prove how much research he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"i never read these kind of historical novels but this one kept me interested from the beginning. it really captures the mood of england, from the landscape, the class system, and the oppressive gloomy winter. more importantly, it's a complex story of a man's need for revenge from someone who has wronged him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book you will always keep in your home and read often.","review":"I think this is one of my all time favorite books.

What a mistake! The premise of the book promises to be a great story, and it probably is a great story, but the poor writing gets in the way. He obviously has not learned the writing mantra \\"Show, don't tell.\\" I could not get drawn into the story because I'd constantly think, \\"I can't believe he wrote that!!\\" Also, Mr. Burton has made his book a soapbox for his particular theology which is quite irritating.I believe that Mr. Burton should hone his craft of writing and republish this book. Anything worth doing for the Lord is worth doing excellently."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOOM FOR THE SEGA 32X","review":"While this port is not as good as the PC version, it does hold up with decent graphics. Yes, some levels are cut from the game compared to the Super Nintendo version and PC, it still provides you with a decent amount of gameplay. My only real complaint is the soundtrack. It is almost unlistenable. It sounds as though some brought a microphone into a truckstop bathroom and recorded the audio. Overall, not a bad game and solid for the limited titles released for the Sega 32x."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Stand","review":"Good solid stand.

Few authors have the courage to look at history from the side of the loser--fewer still have the compasion to write about the players on the losing side as real people. I found that I could hardly put it down during my off hours.However, this book is an interesting read for another reason; it considers the human condition in realistic terms. It looks at how people react in a situation where freedom is denied to enforce the will of the state. The lessons it teaches are invaluable in a time when there is so much turmoil in the world.

Sleigh bells & some sort of double reed folk instrument like a Platerspiel or small bagpipe are used. The score itself makes little attempt to absorb & fuse the various styles. One type just moves into another; this Mass definitely has a \\"Gloria\\" apart from the worlds of Bach & Vivaldi in everything but joyful song; it is more like an aural assemblage. The Carols are fitting \\"filler.\\"Hard to imagine anyone being better at this than Musica Bohemia & Jaroslav Krcek, who record for the Czech import labels Supraphon & Panton, which is probably where this recording originated.

I really don't care to know what she has in her closet. How trite!! I agree with several of the other reviews. There is nothing new and seems to be more of an ego trip of a woman with too much time on her hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Looking Spawn- But Be Warned...","review":"This Spawn 8 figure is striking in it's dramatic pose and flowing cape. I was really looking forward adding it to my collection -Upon opening the package though, I found the right arm easily falls off- I can rig it a bit to stay in there for displaying on a shelf- but if you are looking to buy this toy to really \\"play\\" with it, you may be disappointed. At first I thought this one might be a fluke except that I see other comments telling the same story.I still love the way this Spawn looks and I love adding it to collection, but I have to give it a low durability rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was broken upon opening","review":"I seriously hope I missed something here, or I misplaced the instructions, but the box was opened and the leg fell off as soon as the plastic surrounding hte figure was removed.

I gave it three stars for durability because no parts on my action figure broke, but a lot of people are telling me how the arm broke off or the leg broke off. I definitely don't think it's educational because Spawn isn't exactly the best role model or even superhero, since he kills a lot of people and stuff like that. Although this doesn't have to do with the toy, just so you know, the Spawn comics are NOT for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"No originality","review":"Yes this toy does look cool, but I have to give it a low rating because it is basically an older Spawn toy, but they added a red cape.

The pic looks the same, but the spoon (and fork) are comparatively lightweight and lacking the buffed finish of the original; feels tinny in your hand. I would have been happy to pay more. I really don't think it's reasonable that the price 30 years later should be the same. Buying online will take a hit if it is typified by this kind of pictorial representation posing to be the original item.

They cut out nearly all the high pitches from the music/DVD I listened to while trying them out.The only good thing I can say about these is that they were fairly comfortable, and I like that the battery was actually in the headphones and not in the cord.Regardless, I plan on returning the pair I purchased and buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones are working good","review":"I got these mainly for when I travel but I also use them outside when doing yard work and there is lots of noise. They seem to work pretty good. I am sure they are not as good as the Bose, but I can't complain especially at the price I got them. Jensen is a good brand and these are plenty good for most applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing product","review":"I bought these hoping that they would help me work in a room with a TV playing by listening to music. They were totally ineffective. The noise canceling feature was JUST noticeable i.e. there was a barely detectable difference between ON and OFF. But the frequency response was poor - almost no upper register which made listening to music hardly bearable even with TV off. I returned them for credit,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Incredibly poor treble response. Noise cancellation nearly non-existent. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Mine are going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price!","review":"These headphones worked very well on a round-trip to Paris. They cancelled engine noise well enough for me to hear the movie dialogue clearly and to sleep on the overnight flight. They were so comfortable that after wearing them for 7+ hours, I forgot I was wearing them until the flight attendant spoke to me and I could not hear her. The headphones are very light, with fairly small earpads. They fold very nicely to fit into the carrying pouch (included). Battery life is decent, one single battery lasted the flight Paris and a flight to Hawaii from the East Coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I'm not an audiophile and have no complaints about the audio quality. However, I found the active noise cancellation to be less effective than I hoped. These headphones knock out perhaps half the engine noise. That still leaves a lot of noise! Without these, the engine noise was quite fatiguing and left me with a headdache; with the headphones, the noise is merely unpleasant and I can still function. There is a noticeable difference in engine noise level with the active cancellation on and off. Other, higher frequency noises (voices, etc) are not quieted by the active cancellation. For these noises, the Jensen's are no better than reqular, passive headphones.I agree with other reviewers that the retracting switch is poor quality. Requires a lot of fiddling to push just right so the cord retracts. Battery life is no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Drawbacks:They can get uncomfortable after long periods of time.The single battery doesn't last too long, mine last about 2 weeks of occasional use.Advantages:The noise canceling actually works fairly well. I assume more expensive headphones actually work better, though.Since there is only a single battery, they are relatively light.if you expect to use them only occasionally, these are definitely worth the price (about $23 as of this writing).If you plan on extended use in a fan-filled environment, find something more expensive, you'll be glad you had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality bad-canceling okay","review":"The noise cancellation eliminated the hum from computer fans, window fans, etc, or reduced it significantly...but the sound quality coming out of these things was really bad. I'm not even a super-anal audiophile, but I at least like to hear the highs and the lows...this headphones sound like the upper ranges are coming through a jar, and the lower rangers are muffled a little as well. The cancellation just isn't worth the bad sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not block the fans noise from my server","review":"I bought this one to cancel the server's noise in my cube. Turns out to be waste of money. Not any better than the regular headphone I already have. Also not quite comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So - Could find better elsewhere for a little more money","review":"I used these headphones for sometime now. I primarily use them while traveling on airplanes. They block out a majority of background noise, but the overall sound quality is average at best. I would say I get about 15 hours out of the AAA battery needed to power them. If you forget to turn them off, which I do frequently, they will drain the battery down to nothing and time for a new battery. Auto shutoff would have been a great feature. Certainly not Bose, but they did not cost $175 either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfort not part of the comfortable price","review":"I had to review this simply because it was not that great. The noice cancelling did its job, the sound quality was ok, but a little to the bass side, but the way the headphones sat on your head is just uncomfortable. Its plastic head thing that folds nicely into a pouch is annoying because the crack at which you fold the headphones sometimes gets your haird caught in it and pulls it out when taking them off. With me having glasses, I often have to readjust headsets often because they push the sides of my glasses to my head too much, causing discomfort. So with me having to readjust them, I often pull out hairs! And just the plasticky hard feel to them--it's just not comfy.I'll admit that I got quite a bargain of ten bucks for this item, but I would never pay 40 bucks for headphones like these, especially without a cushioned headband that others, for cheaper prices, often offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of great songs in one place...","review":"I'm giving five stars, because unlike some of the other best ofs available at the MP3 store, this unassuming-looking collection has the latter day versions of Dust My Broom, Shake Your Moneymaker, It Hurts Me Too, Anna Lee, Every Day I Have The Blues, and Look On Yonder Wall all in one place.I gave myself a headache comparing all the MP3 albums and this one won out. The only favorite missing is Stranger Blues, but perhaps that's a matter of personal taste.If you can buy only one MP3 album of Elmore James, choose this one over the fancier looking (and titled) major label offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great barbie movie","review":"My 5 yo daughter LOVES it of course, but it's probably one of my favorite barbie movies next to Mermadia.

We were also disappointed. The skeezites are scary and my daughter also asked me to skip those parts. The eating of the fairies wasn't necessary, and could have been done differently. This movie will definitely be shelved for a while. That being said, the imagery and colors of the movie are beautiful, which would be the only reason we would dare to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Barbie's best work!","review":"My daughters love Barbie movies, because they're usually less scary than Disney Princess movies. My husband and I like Barbie movies because they usually depict very brave, very strong female characters (not just someone waiting around to get rescued!) We usually end up buying these movies on the first day they came out and watching them over and over until the next \\"new\\" one -- this one, however, is a little too scary, and the story is basically recycled from older Barbie movies. Elina only shows up for a little while, even though she's on the cover. There are no songs that I can remember, and the whole thing just seemed rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie Mariposa","review":"I purchased this for my seven year old, she loves all the Barbie movies, and of course this follows suit. They actually have good morals and teach kindness...which seems to be missing in most media these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible video for kids","review":"I couldn't believe what I was allowing my 3yo to watch. Thank goodness I watch the movies with her to make sure they are okay. Well this one was not. Very poor representation for the female gender - has valley-girl -speaking fairies whose main purpose is to be google-eyed over the prince. I did not care for the \\"crying babies\\" that awaken the sea creature either. I thought it was a poor story and definitely not one that is for my daughter. Too bad I purchased it instead of borrowing from the library. It went into the garbage because I would feel too guilty if someone else picked it up for their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not hire true Hispanic actors?","review":"My girls liked this movie, but I couldn't help but notice that all of the Hispanic characters were voiced by non-Hispanic actors.

There was nothing to indicate the restricted zoning on the page I made my purchase from and am exceedingly disappointed I wasted my time and money. I would have thought Amazon were more customer savvy than to sell items to someone living in Australia who is no able to use them.

The audacity of Mattel to give their title character a Spanish name (mariposa means butterfly), and still make her yet again a blonde Caucasian is unbelievable. What kind of message is Mattel giving to the thousands upon thousands of Hispanic girls who buy their products? That their language is good enough to supply a name, but God forbid the title character actually be a Latina?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary and oddly animated","review":"This was the first time that my daughter and I had watched a Barbie movie (of any type) and we were disappointed. My daughter exclaimed it was too scary - the skeezites (sp) eat the butterfly faries and the characters are catty and pretentious. If one was 13 I would expect it would be ideal.Also - something didnt ring quite right with the accents. And the characters spoke as you would expect them too - that is - they reformed to stereotype. This is something that i feel is wrong = especially as at 4 years old they are establishing opinions that have a long lasting effect. It seems to be narrated by someone who has english as a second language. (no offence to anyone) - but the dialogue is slimplistic and trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP","review":"way to scary and disturbing for little girls. Monsters trying to eat fairies is just not fun. Also production not even in the same ballpark compared to 12 dancing princeses, Swan Lake or Princess and the Pauper. No singing, no songs, not even as pretty as mermadia or island princess. Clearly this was a rush job to make money.

Much to my surprise when I looked to see what the problem was, there were some major scratches on the disc. I cleaned it with the disc cleaner we use for damaged/dirty discs, and still it will not work without stopping.

This \\"storyline\\" if you want to call it that was almost identical to that in Fairytopia. There were way too many characters for a young girl to keep track of and the story just goes on and on with some ridiculous \\"plot\\" of good fairy vs. evil fairy. The evil fairy who.... guess what?? put the Queen fairy to sleep with a magic flower.. isn't that what happened in Fairytopia???? Anyway in a word I rate this: BORING and really not appropriate for young children as it is scary and confusing to follow. Obviously just trying to sell more dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter LOVES this!","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves barbie! This is a good movie about adventure and believing in yourself. Even my 8 and 9 year olds watched this and didn't mind it, even though they're \\"too old\\" for Barbie! Elina from the fairytopia and mermaidia movies also makes an appearance. Cute movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"In keeping with the Fairytopia storylines, the Fungi in the other movies were scary looking but funny. The skeezites were just scary looking. My 5yr. old was okay with it but my 3yr. old did cuddle up once she saw them. It also seems that they need to put more effort into the plots. And I also had some problems with the dvd. It stalled a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly the worst of the Barbie Movie franchise","review":"Yes, my daughter loves it, but I have to say this is the worst of the movies that they've put out.What's the story line? Who are these people? Why are Mariposa and her friend indentured servants to the two bratty girls? I'm not expecting Pixar-level story telling here, but come on... this thing is a train wreck.And yes, being a parent fan of the franchise (meaning, no, I wouldn't watch these normally, but my daughter loves them), I miss Kelly Sheridan's voice in the lead role.That said, hardly any child is going to notice or care about such adult \\"gripes\\", but we DO end up watching these too, so it would be nice if we got to be entertained at least to the level we've come to expect, with movies like Magic of Pegasus, or Princess and the Pauper.Your kids (if they are age appropriate to the film) will likely love it, but you may be bored to tears, or annoyed to no end as they watch it over, and over, and over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"i have all of the barbie moviesand this one is soo great.

I somehow liked it's approach, mainly because it avoids a lot of descriptory jargons and talks straight in mathematics: the language of scientists and engineers!

Having given the songs some time and a chance to prove themselves, they mostly seem to prove that their authors want to be John Lennon. \\"Anais\\" rings awfully close to \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" by the Beatles, and \\"Up In the Sky\\" similarly reeks of Lennon influence (not that there's anything wrong w/him or the Beatles). Granted, these are enjoyable enough songs (which is the point of music anyway, right?), but it feels a bit like \\"let's play dress-up\\" or a caricature.

Maybe he spent TOO much time composing these essays. The tone veers from windy, knitted-brow over-intellectualizing to the gushiest fan-magazine sucrose this side of PHOTOPLAY magazine. Much of it is reasonably readable, and here and there Sarris offers little gems of observation and insight, but for the most part YOU AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN' YET! tries to steer a course between creamy nostalgia and hard-headed analysis, foundering often.

My only complaint, which doesn't cause me to lower my star rating, is that the backpack isn't quite large enough to hold a slim 8-1/2 x 11 notebook or clipboard.

However there is a serious flaw with the toner cartridges. We have had toner leak out of two of the color cartridges, covering the inside of the unit with the powder. This was not due to installing the cartridge incorrectly since they both worked fine for 3-4 months before the problems occurred. It is nearly impossible to clean out all the toner powder from inside the printer (my company has outstanding IT support and they have given up). Everything now prints with a hazy yellow background. Our IT guys contacted HP and they deny the problem, but if you search the web you will find many other folks with the same problems.

HP's support is lackluster at best anyway. The first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them. Stay away from this printer at all costs. If you own one it makes a nice doorstop or paperweight. This is totally unacceptable considering toner and printer costs.

I think that the relationships between Chloe, Paul, and Amy helped the story, it helped make Chloe seem more real, I mean, yeah, she's a sixteen year old cat-girl with supernatural powers and the ability to come back from the dead(albiet only 9 times), but she still has the normal pressures of life to deal with, friends who are more that friends and a job, not to mention her overprocective mother.

It's almost as if they REFUSE to do a good job with the Beatles catalog because they know the Beatles will sell no matter what piece of [...] they put out.Every other act from the sixties (except Capitol's own \\"Kingston Trio\\") has gotten a respectful remasters treatment.Why they can't do this with the Beatles is beyond me. The huge shocker on this set is the release of the horrible \\"Something New\\". \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and mediocre filler material without the film's three best tracks \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"I Should Have Known Better\\".

While it's hard to argue with the release of the Fab Four's first four albums issued in the States (and it's nice to have the stereo and mono versions), this is vastly overpriced and aimed at triggering Pavlovian instincts in Beatles fans, who are yearning for the old covers and the old Capitol rainbow label. The skinflints at Capitol aren't just satisfied with squeezing last drop from the franchise; they must also shortchange fans with a substandard, flimsy packaging that is awkward to use. I bought the collection at a big-box retailer, apparently at near cost -- and still I'm disappointed. The packaging is cheap, plain and simple.

And when I opened it, and tried to get the insides out, again, it's difficult and cheapo... The album covers are fantastic--exact copies of the originals--which brings back SO many memories--but trying to stick a CD back into the so-called Box--what a nightmare. I've paid less money for way better construction of a boxed set.Musically--the CDs are fantastic--just what I'd hoped for. But the cheapness of the box construction is VERY disappointing. Shame on Capitol and whomever else was responsible for that. It's not like The Beatles don't already get enough of my money. The price was fair--but not for the way the box was constructed.

The cheesy outside cover speaks for itself in terms of the packaging. It also serves as a good clue to what can be expected inside. The included booklet is no prize either for that matter.If negative stars were an option, they would apply here.

The American mix is much more fun to listen to! Listening to these songs in the mono version is like listening to a Beethoven piano concerto on an \\"original\\" instrument, after you've already heard it on a concert Steinway. One gets the impression that Beethoven would have preferred the booming Steinway, and that the fab four would have preferred the Capitol mix. Drawback: way too expensive! Including the mono mixes doesn't really add anything, so basically you're paying about $48 for about 100-110 minutes of music. A ripoff, but I'm enjoying it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUNDS GREAT TO ME!","review":"I don't get all the complaints here. These CD's sound wonderfulto me. Maybe you had to be there?

Maybe this is moreof an exercise in Baby Boomer Nostalgia than a mind-blowingsonic wonder, but I for one am thrilled. If you were there in'64, you will love this.

Oh, well, all I can say is Capitol/EMI did a wonderful job on remastering this series. It sounds like what's on the original LPs. I admire the reissue team who respect what's on the tapes and didn't try to change/improve it. The few drop-outs were actually on the original LPs, so it must be on the master U.S. tapes from the start, and I am happy no one was trying to fix it. It was exactly like what I heard back in 1964. Well, kids, these four albums were actually the ones that made a history and change the face of pop/rock music forever!

Once you do that, it's just the opposite. On one of my first two handlings, all the replica albums fell to the floor and two of the CDs fell out since there is no internal sleeve to hold them in place.

If you get all the info about all the tracks, you won't have to buy his book now would you?

This amplifier is QUITE a bit louder then my Onkyo receiver in terms of power and sounding clear. When I'm not watching movies and I'm playing my receiver for music I truly play it very very loud and the Onkyo M-282 seemed to be a good bit louder then my receiver. It will get hot but not more then a receiver after using it for a while and I find the Onkyo to be a superb buy. The price is right and the specs are real and are not over-rated like quite a bit of manufacturers these days. The specs with Onkyo are either exact or a little bit underrated in my opinion and for the price, this amplifier is such a great deal.

While it worked for the warranty period reasonably well, it did shut itself off for reasons that never were readily apparent.Then one day, it tripped off never to come on again. Onkyo service is an exercise in all that is bad with customer service for electronic equipment. If it's out of warranty by even a day, the nature of the discussion with the service tech becomes akin to wading through sludge.Bottom line, it would cost more to fix it than the cost of a new one.

Note that the M-282 is only an amplifier with limited ability to adjust audio signal intensity in-line, so I'd recommend using it along with a receiver that can adjust the base/treble/balance and control the volume of the audio signal. I'd recommend the M-282 to anyone looking for a mid-range low-cost zone 2 amplifier with plenty of power at 8 ohms."},{"rating":"2","title":"good amp","review":"Fastshipping from Amazon, great packing job.

Along with the techniques, you are given a brief narrative about the art and each of the weapons demonstrated. All of the weapons are traditional Hawaiian wooden weapons.You can see the devestating nature of the \\"bone breaking\\" reputation of Lua, but you are only shown what has to be a very small portion of the art.

I tried all the codes for the brands of equipment I have, and none of the other codes offered the additional functionality. This remote looks good at first glance, but some additional thought should have been to implementing more of the important features people need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious design flaw............","review":"We purchased this system in April of 2001 for our van. We loved having it and it really worked nicely. Nice picture and sound quality. After about 12 months it began to develop stress cracks behind the screen near the hinge area. It was under warranty and we sent it in for repair. They replaced the screen and it was reinstalled. Again at the 24 month mark it is developing stress cracks behind the hinge again. Its a matter of a few uses until it completely drops off again, held only by the cables inside. After calling the customer service center and discussing sending it in yet again to be replaced it occurred to us that this will probably happen again in 12 months. After asking the customer service rep we found out that they will not replace it if the defect shows itself again after the 3 yr warranty is up ( from original purchase date). This product has an obvious design(integrity) issue and it needs to be adressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZCA-300 Adapter - Nice!","review":"This adapter ring fits very neatly and looks very smart on my Z5 camera.

I'm also a big fan of keeping everything together on my computer. Anyway, these speakers have a very good quality sound, a bit dull in the deep end, but for the price they were a truly great find. And so I marveled at my great buy for a couple of months. To my suprise however I began getting a horrible crackling noise. Upon closer inspection 3 of the sats have tears in them. This came as a great suprise as i have never turned the volume up past 60%. Also i run all my equipment through an audio surge protector. So i'm quite baffled by how this happened. Also I've been given the run around by Altec customer service.however despite my less than glowing review so far, i would recommend these speakers. yes i've had problems, but i'm willing to chalk that up to bad luck on my part. just thought i'd put this warning out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for a computer","review":"If you buy this for your computer and you complain about the speakers being distorted, thats usually why 5.1 sound cards was invented. Buy one for 50$ at an entry price and use the 5.1 slots for full 5.1 sound without distortion. Don't worry about the bass being distorted, the software from the sound card will let u set the controls on your computer.

There is a real intelligence in every single track and the two most prominent for me are \\"Miss Ann Thrope\\" with Jessicka of \\"Jack Off Jill\\" and \\"Scarling\\" and truly real, kinetic song which hence the name states her views on humanity.The other track is \\"My War\\" which is powerful in its message to person who has gone behind her back.

He barely discussses Oppositional Defiant Disorder(ODD), and then in a clinical framework. The big problem is the author wants to blame the parents for a child's oppositional behavior. \\"No child is born oppositional\\" he states, \\"They are made that way\\". Unless you have lived with ODD, you just don't understand. And, Dr Windell's children are no doubt GFG(Gifts from God), and he doesn't understand that parenting contributes, but most certainly isn't the whole problem.

Far better than history, though, is this excellent read. Using great wit, and self-deprecating style, Hundt recounts his personal experience in the halls of DC power. The historical events are an excellent vehicle for his story of the implementation of some of the components of the Telecom Act of 1996. I take issue with some of the other commenters chastising him for not \\"telling all\\" about his tenure. He has greatly simplified a highly complex set of issues to tell HIS story (not history). It's funny, opinionated and revealing. A must read for anyone interested in the real world of DC politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I want a revolution","review":"I was truly amazed with Mr. Hundt's style and writing capabilities.

I too am dealing with my brain injury and the process of acceptance, understanding, coping, and movement toward a fulfilling, happy, and peaceful life. It is a difficult process. The author most certainly conveyed her story.I found the book to be a shallow pep talk with no redeeming qualities. It lacked depth in articulation or any substance to medical fact or rehabilitation. If you are interested in a book with a survivors story that has meat to it read \\"Over my Head\\" by Claudia Osborn. I've read it five times and will read it many more times.

Her disability and that of my son's were entirely different. She suffered a head injury and my son became a high-level quadriplegic following a diving accident at the age of seventeen. The two disabilities are very different and yet the wisdom and level of comfort she has been able to offer our family through her gift of writing has been a blessing to us.

Lord of the Rings three movie set has over twenty hours of special content on top of the special feature's content when their ultimate edition first came out.

NO WAY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I initially was very excited for this set. But upon reading the other one star reviews I have decided not to buy it. I have already spent a lot of money on Harry Potter DVDs, especially on the Ultimate Editions. I really want to have the Ultimate Editions for Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2. This makes it look like they aren't going to make them separate from this set and that really makes me mad. From the little slips inside my Ultimate Editions, it tells you to look out for all of them and shows a picture that clearly has eight Ultimate Editions in it. I am not paying $350 for the last two Ultimate Editions if they indeed are in this set, which it sounds like they are.

I was thinking about it. but since almost everything in the description is misleading, I said 'forget it'. All WB is trying to do is screw us out of our money. Only extended editions for movies 1 and 2, and we don't even get TRUE digital copies, but the stupid UltraViolet streaming versions they suckered us with for the last movie, and that expire after three years. How about you release a true collector's edition, with what us HP fans want, or just let out the Ultimate Editions for the final two films?WB, you should be very ashamed for trying to take advantage of the fans of a worldwide phenomenon. I hope you get stuck with every single one of these sets and maybe then you'll realize that we're not going to settle for your crap anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this all you got, WB?","review":"Warner Bros....

How bout an option between normal DC and Ultra Violet? *sigh* There are a couple other things, but that was the big bummer for me.

This edition is outrageously expensive and filled with a lot of fluff I'm not interested in. I hate it when they bundle up Blu-ray editions and DVD editions. I mean, seriously, why would anyone want both? At least I don't and it is just wasting space and resources.I wanted a really solidly built and great looking collector's edition item like the Elder Wand stand from the French ultimate edition, but this just simple doesn't cut it. I wouldn't pay more than $100 for this item, $350 is just simply way over the top.Just because of this blatant attempt at extorting fans and consumers I will just forget about getting this edition or the individual movies whatsoever.

I've been waiting for this because I had read that, after Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out, that the movies would all be released with all the deleted scenes added back into all the movies and the 3D version of D.H. Part 2 would be included as well. As I have seen by the overview by you here at Amazon, I know that I will NOT be buying it. All it is is the \\"Ultimate\\" versions repackaged and sold together. All the extra footage done for the Lord Of The Rings movies was what made the \\"Ultimate Editions\\" of them so great!

Very disappointed and won't waste my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately they sent us the wrong box - for US region","review":"The box itself was great and we would have loved to keep it.However even though the box was sold as an 'All Region' - it contained DVD's for the US only - and thus we couldn't see them.It actually said on the cardboard box - that is was to be sold only in the US - and we are from Europe....We have now returned the box - and are waiting for our refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is $350 and won't even be the last release. WHY IS THERE NO EXTENDED VERSIONS OF THE MOVIES WITH THE EXTRA SCENES APART FROM THE 1ST TWO? HOW LAZY ARE YOU WB?! A RELEASE OF THIS LOW QUALITY IS JUST INSULTING"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to our intellegence.","review":"A blatant money grab by the studios. Time to put our money where our mouth is and stop buying all this crap. Its insulting to our intelligence and we should not reward this kinda lazy profiteering."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF... Buy from amazon UK!!!","review":"I got all 8 blurays with special features, in one box set from amazon UK... for $44!!!!You just have to make sure your bluray player can play \\"region free\\" discs... Samsung's are usually pretty good about it.Takes a week to get to you but well worth saving 300 smacks for the wait.Here's the link:http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00543RC0Y/ref=pe_217191_31005151_dp_1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Harry Potter Series... But there is no way I would spend $349.99 for the box set!!","review":"I really love the Harry Potter Movie Series... But I wouldn't spend $349.99 for it!! I don't much care for extras, I would have preferred a a set with All Movie Extended!!! And only if it was a decent price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off.","review":"The price is ridiculous; the fans already have the DVDs; it's a rip-off to anyone who bought the films before they were taken off the shelves. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"From an ultimate Harry Potter Fan!","review":"I love everything about Harry Potter! I guess you can call me a Harry Potter\\"geek\\". I was really looking forward to this set. I was really dissapointed reading the discription and reviews. I might spend a couple of hundred but I certainly wouldn't spend $350.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds lame","review":"The packaging looks fancy...but really...it sounds lame. The content for the movies seems inconsistent. Why only extended editions for the first 2 movies? I agree with others that they should release an edition with all extended versions. Not to mention, you can probably buy all of the discs in this box set for less than they are selling it for. You just get a fancy box for the hundreds of extra dollars it costs you. LAME. I mean i got all 8 films on blu-ray for $32 from amazon UK...its definitely not worth paying over 10x that amount for some dvd discs, 5 hours of extras, digital copies i will never use, and a cardboard box......numbered limited edition or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"The price alone is crazy! Especially since I own all the bluerays and digital copies already. The extras dont seem to be worth 340."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was excited, until I was informed :(","review":"I was all excited about this box set until I noticed that this wasn't the COMPLETE Harry Potter Collection. All I want is a Harry Potter Box Set that has EVERYTHING, extended, bonus, digital, all the bells and whistles... majorly bummed that this is NOT the box set I've been waiting for :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive fake crap","review":"Is the box it comes in real handmade wood? At that price there are alot of things i could buy. 350 for movies already out. And you wonder why so many ppl download movies. They dont have that kind of money. Even 150 is to much for this crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting for fans. DO NOT BUY!","review":"Let me put this in the short version.First off, i love Harry Potter, its my childhood and a treasure part of my life.But this box set is overpriced and insulting.- NOTHING new is included. Extended cuts? Nope- Its more expensive than buying seperately.- Cheaper to buy what you dont own.EVEN if you own none of the blurays, its easy to get each of the 8 films for 13 bucks each, so lets count.13X8= $104This is just insulting double dipping. Its obvious theres going to be another ultimate edition, LOTR did this too, but at least they never overpriced their sets.Harry potter deserves more than this milking. Paying 200 bucks is not worth for some cheap box and toys. Wait for another set.DO NOT BUY THIS SET for anything MORE THAN 100 bucksoh and most of the 30+ Discs are DVD's for digital copies so dont bother talking about the value of the discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"This is a huge letdown.I have not bought any of the Harry Potter movies because I was waiting for a really cool box set that contained everything. This box set, at first glance, looks really neat, and it is actually kind of cool, but it is way too expensive and I was really expecting better from them. I think it is pointless to have both the DVD versions and Blue Ray versions together in the same set. I just want one ultimate version of each movie that has everything I need with all of the extras, not three different discs of the same movie again and again. This is one of the reasons why this box set is so expensive and I don't want to be paying more for things I don't need or already have. The ultimate box sets released in other countries were a lot better than this.Right now, I am a truly disappointed Harry Potter fan...I just really hope this isn't going to be the last/only ultimate box set they release because they could do soooo much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta Milk It...","review":"I love Harry Potter...enough to spend money on the full set, provided that it is worth it. However, I will not spend money on this set because there is too much missing (i.e., extended cuts of ALL the films, etc...). I see this release as a way to milk as much money as possible from the success of the Harry Potter series. I will keep my eyes open for when a more comprehensive box set becomes available. I would imagine that will happen a few years down the road after Harry Potter fades from the limelight and most people's memories..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously WB?!? ...Hollywood Greed at it's worst","review":"I hope enough people get online and rate this as 1 star in protest of Warner Bros. trying to milk every last Potter fan before they actually give us what we really want....the extended versions of EVERY film on Blu-Ray.There's still plenty of money for them to make in the future when they release 3D conversions of every film, then the 3D conversion box set, then the 4K versions, then the 4K box set, then the 4K 3D versions, and so on, and so on....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't they see the backlash when LOTR makers tried to do this???","review":"$345 for 6 movies that aren't extended edition??? To top it off UltraViolet digital copy aka online streaming of the movies. WB this is a BAD move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Boo...","review":"Why spend $344 on a box set that includes discs we already own? A true wizard's collection would be in line with The Lord of the Rings. Extended director cuts of all movies + behind the scenes stuff. The digital copy is a joke, not a funny one. It isn't a digital copy you can load on a computer but rather a streamed access. Boo!I call this product \\"A swing and a miss.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"$344.99??? 31discs?? there are only 8films...!","review":"The price is too high and the fact that it has more dvds detailing \\"extras\\" is total BS. WB aware of the times, and hard to come cash? buy the small box set with 8films TOTALLY WORTH IT....you get the same dvds/blue ray that comes in this fancy box...that truttly not worth paying $344.99 for the behind the scenes...NOT WORTH IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Bitching","review":"Simple if you cant afford it or dont like it move on and shut up.
