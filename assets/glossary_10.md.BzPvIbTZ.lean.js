Glad I made this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT SNL, so don't expect much","review":"I guess I have to admit I was expecting more from this show. The fact the props and background scenery is nothing more than what a high school production can accomplish could be overlooked if the writing was up to par. The sad fact is that it isn't, for me at least. When the LOGO label appeared I truly expected something more, but ended up seeing something way less. Maybe growing up with the brilliance of SNL's early days made me jaded against this, who knows... It is at least worthy to know it is attempted as a \\"gay\\" show.... I won't be purchasing season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having a gay ole time","review":"I have been looking for this for quite some time. I was hoping to find it at the local second hand book store, but this was too much of a good deal to pass up. Thanks for this great opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric and tired attempts at humor","review":"This reminds of the kind of skits one might see from a group of high schoolers trying to make some funny skits for an overnight camp show. The humor comes from watching your friends being silly -- not from the actual script itself which would be pretty lame. That is what watching this show was like. The jokes are poorly thought out and even more poorly acted. There is no sense of comic timing and the skits run impossibly long to the point where I kept skipping ahead to see if maybe the next skit would be funny.No such luck. It's a shame that I can't enter 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY UNFUNNY AND BADLY WRITTEN","review":"The only laughs in this show are the canned laughter which is unbearable to have to endure continuously. I watched the first 2 episodes and found nothing at all to laugh at. Dreadfully corny and totally unfunny. If this was a British series there would have been laughs galore.I simply could not endure the rest of the episodes on the dvd and ceased watching it after the 2nd episode.It is one of those shows that you know after the first 5 minutes that you are in for a tedious time. Totally inane and childish sketches that it is a wonder the writers were able to have a second series. This is truly the very worst comedy show of all time. If you think that this show is funny then you have a very juvenile taste in comedy. There are some great gay comedians/ writers in America but the writers of this show are not amongst them. I cringed when I watched it.How could some one get away with such rubbish?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Gay Blah","review":"Over-used themes, tired jokes and lame skits all comprise this show which should have been called Big Gay Blah. I was shocked to see two people actually thought this was funny. I think they are the only two. How is this show still on? To compare this show to SNL is like comparing Shakespeare to \\"10 Things I Hate About You.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Drags at start,but mid-book,a pageturner.","review":"I found Dee Brown's book on this military history to drag a bit at the start,but by the middle of the book I was pulled in by the intensity and detail of his research. A vivid and brutal account of the way of the west in the mid-19th century. From the cunning stealth and strength of the leader Red Cloud,to the meticuliousness and orderly fashion of Colonel Henry Carrington, who through him and sub-ordinates(Fetterman) misdecisions,led to an combined victory of Sioux,Cheyenne,and Arapaho. Dee Brown's detail and account of this pre-cursor event to Custer,should be read by every sincere western historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"An army detail ambushed by the Sioux ten years before Custer","review":"The Fetterman Massacre occurred right after the Civil War. On the Montana Road, the commander Colonel Carrington was detailed to build and staff three forts in Montana and Wyoming. The Sioux and other Indian tribes led by Red Cloud laid seige to the forts. The Indians laid a trap and when one Captain Fetterman went beyond his orders, he and his troops were killed and their bodies mutilated. Dee Brown doesn't paint a pretty picture of the Army's decision to blaim Carrington or the Indian habit of butchering people. The only one who comes out positively is Colonel Carrington. I would agree with the earlier reviewer that the book starts out slowly, but it builds toward the climax of the battle and the aftermath."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting","review":"I am just now reading on the West and found this book to be exciting and fun to read. I learned a lot about the West shortly after the Civil War and could not put this book down. From the harsness of the conditions to bill Fort Phil Kearny to the Fetterman Massacre, it's all here and exciting to read.10 yeaars later simular events repeat themselves in the Little Big horn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well told!","review":"Dee Brown had a way of weaving the facts into an interesting narrative. He follows the events leading up to this tragic event and defines the personalities involved. Our country didn't understand the native Americans and made little effort to rectify that. An interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"this really wasnt a horror movie although there were a few scary scenes...but regardless i thought this movie was pretty damn good....great concept of a movie and it was well acted in my opinion...im glad i own it"},{"rating":"1","title":"slick but cheesy","review":"The premise of this movie was good. In fact, the first two thirds of the film kept me interested in trying to solve the mystery behind Ian Stone's \\"reincarnations\\", so to speak. Unfortunately, the main villainess reminded me so much of Lara Flynn Boyle's character in Men in Black 2 that I had a hard time taking her seriously. Plus her compatriots looked like Matrix knock-offs. Bottom line: very cool idea that spiraled toward a hokey climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a horror film, but still good","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me interested from start to finish; and when I finally figured out the mystery to why Ian kept dying, it continued to keep me wondering what was going to happen next. I really don't think I would have put this under the genre of horror; let alone the horrorfest....I would put it more into the category of sci-fi. Anyway, it is good and worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger broke within 2 months of purchase","review":"The only good thing I can state about this item is the option to do black & white internally. That was nice. Within 2 months of purchase the charger stopped working completely so I couldn't charge it. Also almost every picture I took blurred unless I had perfect lighting. I purchased this camera from Office Depot which I also highly recommend not doing. When I told them about my problems with the camera (I bought a protection plan and was completely lied to about the perks of the plan) they told me I could wait a year (or at this time 10 months) to get a gift card for the store for the amount of the camera... so I had to go out and spend extra money to replace this camera. A lot of effort for a camera I wished I had never purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your target is moving, you might want to pass on this one","review":"If you want to take pictures of flowers or other non moving objects, this camera could be just fine.However, the first and second shot delays are abysmal. In other words, unless the object you want to shoot is completely inanimate, forget about it. It is also horrid in low light.And the deal breaker: my charger broke shortly after I started using it. I determined that the camera was not good enough to look into fixing the problem.Yep it's a cheap camera but could be worth it to you to save up for something that will NOT take a few mediocre pictures and then not charge back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"a visual treat, with a focus on quality clothes","review":"This book boasts the catchy, elegant chic simple layout, with fully accessorized outfits laid out against a white background. The focus is on classic (and expensive), quality clothing (cashmere twin sets, Chanel flats, $300 Hermes scarves)-- but you could copy the ideas using less expensive basics. The idea is to pare down your wardrobe to the essentials, accessorizing the essentials to look polished & perfectly put together. The text is interesting, filled with quotes from movie stars and other famous people, with witty comments about the clothes, what one leans in business school, etc. However, you'll probably be drawn to the photographs and captions the first time through. Only about a third of the book is devoted to female attire, so if you're a woman, looking for advice about women's wardrobe concerns, you might be better served looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hefty price tag!","review":"Do not buy, it's a nice wee dvd to have but the overal dvd is very short and the interviews come and go at the blink of an eye. If it were cheaper I would say go for it but at over $20 inc postage it does not come even close to being wortn it! Not much to learn from it either! DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too late for my Book Club","review":"The book itself is great but the service from the bookseller was not satisfactory. In preparation for my December Book Club meeting, I ordered this book on Nov. 28. I contacted Amazon and the bookseller early in December and was told it had been sent. During several emails I was given instructions but no book. My Book Club came and went and still no book. I finally received it on Jan 8 sporting a Jan 6 postmark. I was not happy but hope that I do not have similar delays on future books. I will not be ordering from that bookseller again. I have had wonderful service from other Amazon sellers and look forward to working with them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse Of Ordinary People During Industrial Revolution","review":"Hard Times depicts the lives of ordinary people during the industrial revolution in England. Dickens brings several characters to life and weaves an interesting story about their interactions with each other. Most of these characters are poor and they live in a pollution ridden town where the economy is based on coal production. Dickens's description of their lives is excellent. The only reason for the four stars is that one or two secret matters are alluded to near the beginning, but they are never revealed, leaving the reader a little disappointed. Overall, Hard Times is very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending is a mess","review":"I enjoyed The Child Queen very much. Fairly standard Arthur fare. The High Queen was in much the same vein, and was enjoyable until the end. Unfortunately, McKenzie decided to make Mordred noble and likable. Then she had to figure out how to make this noble and likable character fulfill the prophecy of killing his father. The ending made no sense compared to the rest of the book - it just seemed like a slapstick comedy with horrible results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guinevere is a pitiful and weak character","review":"This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the heavy weight book down and puke. If you like reading about a weak, horrid, dull, whiny, annoying and above all...pitiful female character with no soul, passion, or feelings but greed, this is the book for you.The High Queen is one of the worst books on King Arthur and his court I have ever read. There are other more time worthy titles on Guinevere out, just keep searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was Very Dissapointed","review":"I expected so much more, I mean, after the great first book THE CHILD QUEEN, I just HAD to read the sequel. Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so Arthur dies, and Guinevere starts crying her eyes out, but other than the visible notions, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally. Nancy Mckenzie has lost the respect I had given her for such a great book and writing of the first, but this has just backed down my praises of her. I hope she comes out with another book, and this time, lay off with sequels, they are not her type of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTH NO STARS","review":"I just don't understand this books series: DelRay Disovery? I don't think so...this book is far less of a discovery than it's first book. What type of perverse plot is this?! A woman who's son who's half her age who falls in love with her and wants to become her king? Gosh... I should have read another novel. Not only was this book big (and I mean big) but it was so boring. No action or romance that the average fantasy lover looks for, I'd give no stars, but that's not an option is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Tiresome :::yawn::::","review":"THE HIGH QUEEN has to be one of the worst sequels or follow-ups to a book I have ever read. THE CHILD QUEEN stood pretty well off on it's own, I didn't expect another book since everything wounded up together quite well in the first book. But NO! The author and publisher just had to throw in a dissapointingly long and dreadful sequel that was not at all worth my time. 1 star is still just too high of a score for this long and tediously detailed novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunk Like the Titanic","review":"This whole feminist thing is erupting again. Oh, female author takes a girl-view of an old story. I'm a female, but reading this book made me feel so worthless, which is why I'm giving it another star, for being able to change my emotion. The book started off decently, but towards the end it bombed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How typical","review":"Can this author take another English course? First of all, the title is so... unoriginal. Second, the title is so...unoriginal. Third... the plot was the typical arthur/Guinevere story. Four... why did I even bother to finish this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disapointing","review":"A poor sequel to a pretty interesting book. The High Queen was the melodrama of a son falling in love with the suppposedly \\"High\\" Queen. I still have no idea why this book was titled \\"THE HIGH QUEEN\\" there was no significance to her power (she didn't have much) or rank (pretty high,though reputable ruined to being with).Hmm, don't know... maybe it's because I couldn't feel the son's love for the Queen, or the Queen's love for her husband, or the husband's love for...well, you get the point. Emotions and feelings are poorly played out in this book, a negative thing to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I studied myths and legends in College...","review":"This was a terrible book to read. It creates much shame to me, since King Arthur's story is so well known and had been holding a very dear reputation. THE HIGH QUEEN was a dearly shamelful book to read. I expected so much more, King Arthur and Guinevere have been such a great high-tall from my childhood and in college, where I studies these myths and legends. This author has made a total turn off of a tale for students and humans who have not heard of Arthur and Guinevere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a perverts book","review":"A peverted son falls in love with his adopted mother, uh, how unrealistic and how sickening. This is a bad written novel that dragged on and on. About 90% of this book is useless to the main plot and story, even the details were useless. I couldn't feel anything with this book, no love, no hate, no humiliation, where's the humanity of this novel???"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather watch GRASS GROW","review":"A grusome book who's plot moves as slow as a snail. This book is pretty massive in size, size not being much of a problem for me, unless the pages were filled with utter junk and horrid language text. There is no distinct or creative pattern, this book's prequel would have standed by itself well enough if it weren't for this meaningless and tediously trite second novel by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arthurian/Guinevere legend lives on!","review":"Arthur and Guinevere live on. This book was so good, that at the end I was so emotionally exsuasted that I hit my pillow and slept for hours!I balled my eyes out at the end about what happened between Arthur and his son, mordred.And also what happened between Guinevere and Lancelot, and their undying love for each other. Though I still found the first book,\\"The Child Queen\\" much better, this one was definately more sad, and more tragic.This book is a must for anyone looking for something with Magic, romance, suspense, and love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I recently read the combination of Nancy McKenzie's two books, The Child Queen and The High Queen, and until recently the stories by Persia Woolley were my all-time favorites. This book is incredible. I have read this book 3 times, because it is always a wonder to me how the characters grow and the times change. The first time I finished it, I cried and was melancholy for days. This book so completely depicts all of the characters, I easily and immediately felt a part of Camelot and a part of this story. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"I read The High Queen after having read The Child Queen (it's prequel) and I could not put either book down. I am normally a very slow reader, but I got through these books faster than I have any others. I admit that McKenzie's books are not \\"high art,\\" but as someone who is enthralled by the Arthurian legend, I found them immensley enjoyable. McKenzie writes so that the reader often feels as though she were in the novel. I certainly found this to be true. McKenzie's descriptions of the characters and events stayed mostly true to the traditional legend while still \\"humanizing\\" Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and all the rest. The characters became people rather than just bits and pieces of the legend. Again, I have read plenty of other books with more symbolism, meaning, and \\"depth,\\" but I have enjoyed no others to the extent of The Child Queen and The High Queen. I really wish McKenzie would publish another book; I would love to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the value","review":"It looks good, works well and for the price if you are not working in a cardiac unit or somewhere you need a top notch stethoscope, it will more than suffice.

Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SCOPED OUT THE CLEAR HEART STETHOSCOPE X 2","review":"I ordered this stethoscope through Amazon and was very happy with it for two weeks.

I had no idea how it had been damaged. I contacted Amazon & sent it back and they had a brand new one back in my hands in less than a week. Three days later, I was cleaning it off with alcohol after a \\"CODE-BLUE\\" and the RED HEART chipped and cracked right infront of my eyes with red flakes popping off the surface of the HEART and several deep cracks penatrating half way through the entire heart.

Makes it much easier to talk to patients especially being a student nurse. Patients are much more smiley when I say \\"I'm going to listen to your heart now, with my heart\\". Yeah, it's corny but it gets them talking. It deserves the 5 stars because it's exactly as described. The price is pretty good for the quality here.

I've installed it in my kitchen where it'll be used most. If I had a better option it would be in a shed or pantry.It doesn't slip in or out of the tracks as easily as you would assume. I imagine w/ a few turns it'll wear the little bumps down and it'll come out a little easier.Other than being ugly and large it's a great product and a must have if you're going to use the can crusher it sure beats a bag or large trash bin on the floor underneath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Works great with the Easy Pull Crusher.

Lynn Harris tells the fast and furious insider account of Lola Somerville (a woman you hope will be your best friend and condfidante), and her attempted road to success at a women's media empire that's more Death Star than North Star. The book is part roman a clef, part relationship guide, and part thriller, but most of all a true satire that captures the madness that was the Internet Bubble and the insanity that engulfed everyone who was a part of it -- and lived to tell the tale.

He also gives the perspective from the porters point of view, however, it seems like he is mostly guessing what the porters feel and think and I've never like that from a ethnographic point of view.

My old ones have superior battery life but not this one. It's batteries need a recharge after 35 images, max, although I don't use the large viewer and turn off the anti-shake. Then I have to charge them 2 or 3 times to get them to work. I was using Sony and Energizer 2500Mah with poor results, so The company accepted it back as flawed. The replacement is the same. I then ordered the Olympus charger and batteries recommended for this camera, and they are no better. What's funny is, my daughters Canon Supershot (same Mpix, anti-shake, large videos) worked fine on my \\"spent\\" batteries.A lot of \\"noise\\" is evident in images taken in low light. The high ISO which is supposed to help in low light, actually makes it worse.All my Olympus cameras are well made and easy to use, though the internal battery died in one after 3 years, so I have to redo my settings every time I change the battery. There are better cameras out there.

I currently have the Sony H5, with a 35mm - 12x zoom. I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos of the Olympus and sent it back. I did a direct comparison of both cameras, taking identical shots. The Olympus produced soft images that bordered on blurry, with colors more muted than the Sony. The Sony has a 3\\" LCD screen, which is much nicer than the Olympus 2.5\\" screen. I thought there would be a big difference between the wide angle and zoom of the two cameras, but the poor picture quality wasn't worth the extra wide angle and zoom (which weren't that different from the Sony after all). Finally, Olympus cameras have a strange flash function- you must manually raise the flash if the flash is needed- it doesn't happen automatically as it does in most other large zoom cameras. If you don't remember to raise the flash, you end up missing the shot. Bottom line- buy the Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for a good camera","review":"I purchased the 550UZ mainly for pix of birds in my backyard and family snaps.

The 18x zoom is great because you can get pictures that are really close and near to objects that are far away. The clearity of the pictures are crisp and sharp. The stablizer in the camera prevents the pictures from being blurey when on a boat rocking, or in a car moving. I have used the super zoom when doing macro photography and the clarity and detail in the flowers is amazing. It gets you closer to the flowers 1 cm. to be exact and veining and portions of flowers can be taken.

The limited proteins will leave you hungry no matter how many trips you make to the salad bar. And let's face it, without the dressing--you're only allowed two 1/8 tsps of oil per day--you're not eating dry salad for long. And no one is eating much more than two pieces of fruit a day without suffering the consequences. This is a one-size-fits-all diet for a population that is not all one size. My own minimum daily requirement of protein is 70 grams, which is more than this diet allows and I'm a small framed woman. With this diet, you can't help but lose weight. You'll be starving.

The story carries a lot better than the simple mistaken identity plots used so often in the golden age of musicals in the thirties.The principles players and much of the supporting cast came from the smash Broadway hit.

My one and only grype about the film version of this play is the arbitrary way the producers decided to cut the best and cleverest number in the show. I am referring of course to \\"Paris Original\\". I think the lines, \\"This irresistable Paris Original, this mass produced crime....

This film makes no pretence at realism...Director David Swift obviously wanted everything to be way over the top - acting, sets, and costumes - and it works perfectly...but it contains more truth than many musicals - take the song \\"The Company Way\\", which brilliantly encapsulates the cynicism of the \\"company man\\".Robert Morse is superb as the rubber-faced Finch - think Jerry Lewis or Jim Carrey - and is matched by an able cast.\\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\" is one of the great underappreciated film musicals, certainly one of the best film musicals from the 1960's.The quality of the DVD is excellent but sadly it contains no extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best musicals on DVD","review":"This was beautifully shot!

The story is a typical Victorian novel using antiquated words which needs constantly looking up in a dictionary. It is not one of Conan Doyle's better works. It lacks imagination, wit and character development but there's only so much an author can do in 56 pages.SPOILER:The worst part about this story is the ending. It is one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have come across. It would be so very convenient for all heroes if the villian just up and died. That's what happens in this story. The villian simply dies of exhaustion and everything becomes alright. It is probable that Conan was working under size restrictions but a writer of such great works as Sherlock Holmes should have tried harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Parasite","review":"The Parasite is one of the best stories I have read by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that is not of the Sherlock Holmes variety. Professor Gilroy, who considers himself a realist, is pursuaded by one of his associates to see a clairvoyant mystic character in action; sort of a scientific experiment. It gets out of hand and the professor finds he has taken on more than he can handle. She has him under her spell and it quickly goes down hill. The story is told in such a wonderful way that you find yourself almost pleding with the main character to get hold of himself, to stop what he is doing and run away. Suspenseful; holds your interest from start to finish. And the ending may surprise you as well. 5 stars! I don't usually give that high a rating; this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive book with limited value","review":"The book is published in a binder form and costs $95,- For this money the readers would be entitled to a detailed and practical guide, usable in their work and a source to refer to. Unfortunately the book is quite superficial, too verbose and not even clearly presented. Its major defect is that in fact it says very little about contract administration itself, that is the work the contract administrator does after the contract is signed and until it is completed. There is very little on how to deal with the other contractual party, what problems occur and how to handle them. There are some parts which are clearly irritating, for instance : Part 10. Title: What is a claim? The author says : \\"Some think this, other think that. In fact there are many types of claims\\", and does not answer the question he himself asks in the title.Definitely not value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Typical Love Story","review":"First let me say that is book isnt your typical love story where the main characters fall in love at first sight. There isnt very much interaction between the hero and heroine.At the age of twenty-nine Viscount Ashley Desford is lectured by his father, the Earl of Wroxton that he should now consider settling down and producing an heir.Viscount Desford attends a country ball and accidently meets Charity Steane, a nineteen year old girl living almost as a maid in her aunt's home.He brings it upon himself to help this unfortunate creature from a sad life of servintude and tries to track down her grandfather since her father is considered dead.

Not a fevered sort of romance, a quiet comedy of manners and real love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and humorous Regency romance","review":"\\"Charity Girl\\" is a historical romance novel set in England during the British Regency period (1811-1820). As usual for Heyer, the story was very funny. There was a nice level of historical detail woven into the story, and the characters were all enjoyable. It was clear which woman was best suited to Desford, and it was fun seeing how they would finally end up together. The only reason this book didn't quite rate among my very favorite Heyer's novels is that a few scenes ran on a little too long, in my opinion.There was no sex. There was some explicit bad language. Overall, I'd highly recommend this humorous romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Heyer Regency romance!","review":"This is fun-not her best, but definitely one to read.

(The LP guide is also easier to carry around, which is important for a SE Asia guide.)The Cambodia section in this guide is remarkably sparse.In short: get Lonely Planet's version, or don't get one at all. You might also try Fielding's, if they ever get around to updating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading For Crime Buffs","review":"This book is an exhaustive account of the first successful RICO prosecution of New York racketeers headed by the then up-and coming Rudy Guiliani and Louis Freeh. It precedes the mafia cleanup in Italy, that resulted in horrific murders of investigating judges, and yet features many of the same names, \\"families\\", and same tentacles. The case went on forever, each mafioso from high to low represented by a scrum of lawyers, all battling for their moment in the spotlight. The title comes from the heroin traffic fronted by pizza restaurants, good for money laundering as well as handy pickup points. Alexander seems to have spent every day in court, finding something interesting to say even when the case bogged down in legal flummery. She covers both sides and the infighting that went on behind the scenes. What I most liked were the portraits of the gangsters, she was hip to their efforts to look like sick underdogs when in reality they were multimillionaires!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so kit with so so quality and so so usefulness","review":"Although this is touted 95 pieces and may sound a lot, what you get is not really all that useful. There are tons of screwdriver bits, what for? How many of us really switch out screwdriver bits every time we use a different screw? I can understand having 3 each for slotted and philips, but not in the 10s.Also, the quality seems cheap. Having this for 2 weeks, I already have some rusts on the converter bit, even though this never touched any water. Also, this kit comes with a set of square drive bits but not hex or torx drive bits. HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE SQUARE BOLTS??? The socket selction is minimal, and the drill bits seem cheezy too. This is a $20 set at best, you pay $20 extra for DeWALT logo and a decent case.I am so glad Amazon reminded me to review this item so I can let it out. Where does one find quality tools nowadays?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst set EVER","review":"I'll start with the good. I like the case, and the Philips and Flat head bits were decent. But you can get those in any $10 set. The drill bits were complete garbage. I used the set for 1 week and broke 2 drill bits. They just ripped apart. Now, I had this very very cheap Black and Decker drill set before this, and that lasted over 2 years!I have been extremely dissapointed by this set and refuse to buy any DeWalt accessories from this point on.However, I have used the DeWalt compressors and nail guns. I do like those and they seem to build power tools well. However, with sets like this I am extremely surprised how poor the quality of the bits are. Save yourself $40 and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!","review":"I purchased this set for my husband and we are very pleased! I was a little worried doing this based on the reviews this item received, but I'm now grateful. I told him about some of the negative remarks and his opinion seems to differ. I believe this set goes perfectly with the other recently purchased Dewalt tools from Amazon!

Charlton Heston plays a gruff old farmer in Nova Scotia who has lost his son in the Boer War in South Africa. His son's boys come to live with him, their grandmother, and their daughter.The two boys are wonderfully played by two youngsters, Leo Wheatley and Charles Miller, the daughter is the beautiful Leah Pinsent, and the doctor by Bruce Greenwood. (Greenwood, who looks like a young Sam Neill, has gone on to have a fine movie career, and can be seen in 'The World's Fastest Indian'.)Grandfather James MacKenzie bears a hatred of the Boers (Dutch). The doctor, who falls in love with Kirsten, is a Boer.The young boys find a surprise on the family beach.With the exception of the surprise, the plot is a bit predictable, but the set design, the accents, and the acting is top notch.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LITTLE KIDNAPPERS","review":"This a delightful film.

There are only about 100 of the total 150 prescribed by the Rule of St. Benedict and some of them are shortened. When the publisher calls this a short breviary he doesn't come right out and say that it is brief in the psalm complement, and in fact you will not find a psalm list in the index. The introduction of the breviary cleverly skirts the issue with a little deft word play. Why not just come out and say it. It's a waste of money. I'll stick with the LOTH and fiddle to read the whole psalmody with my bible. Why doesn't someone make a decent breviary with a two week psalmody?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful translation","review":"This book is well organized and easy to use. However, the translation is so bad that anyone who is used to praying in traditional English will have a very hard time with it. Unfortunately, the translators chose to use bland post Vatican II English that robs the text of any semblance of beauty. It is tragic that the creators of what could have been a very valuable asset to anyone wanting an organized prayer life chose such terrible English.Fr. John W.

As much as I love the 21 novels of the Sharpe series, this one shows signs of carelessness and indifference on the part of its author. The plot is loosely thrown together and the whore-pretending-to-be-respectable-and-snaring-a-British-officer theme is straight out of \\"Sharpe's Enemy\\". Cornwell is churning books out at a terrific clip with the \\"Lords of the North series\\", Sharpe, the Grail Quest and various singletons.

First, it's an old-fashioned mystery with enough clues given for readers to try to guess the outcome. Second, the holiday traditions of stirring the pudding, decorating with greenery and Morris dancers, add an additional colorful element. And third, there are numerous references to actual people and concerns of Franklin's years in England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana's worst","review":"Diana had hit rock bottom musically in the late 80s. Her 1987 album Red Hot Rhythym and Blues was a flop, and this album, an attempt to stay trendy and youthful, did even worse.In my opinion, it's Diana's worst album. Diana tries her best but producer Nile Rodgers surrounds her voice with hip-hop/R&B; beats that sounded dated even in 1989. By this time, Rodgers had peaked as a producer. The magic that he brought to Chic projects and to albums by singers such as David Bowie and Madonna was no longer there.The title track is not bad, and the single \\"Paradise\\" is actually much better in its remix version. But there's not much else to recommend.Thankfully, Diana's albums in the 90s showed a re-energized Diana, particularly \\"Take Me Higher\\" and \\"Every Day is a New Day\\". Those are excellent albums and I recommend those over this dreary collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"MERCURIAL SOLID SOUL","review":"This is a solid soul CD.

While raising some interesting issues, the author does not address them in a definitive, fact-oriented way but instead goes off on wild speculative binges.

In reading the instructions, it looked incredibly simple and I thought it would be boring, but I was wrong!While the concept is simple, the game is actually a lot of fun. The gist of it is you move pieces around the board based on the pop-o-matic die result (and which kids don't love the pop-o-matic). ;-) Once you land on another players piece, you can then move backward or forward, either trying to obtain more players pieces, or moving away so another player doesn't land on your piece.A game with four people takes about 15 minutes, so it's not an intensely strategic game. However, if you are wanting to play multiple games in rapid succession, definitely add this to your library of games.

The look, features, functionality & price had me very excited initially. A few months after purchase the unit malfunctioned & I could no longer get the iPod player to work. They replaced it after I paid another $9 - warranty policy. The 2nd unit failed after a few months again - same problem. Had to pack it up and send the 2nd one back with another $9. Originally paid $79 at Target so now I'm into this model for about a C-note. I don't like the odds that this 3rd unit is going to last long.

I bought one in a store, it worked fine, so I purchased a second one for a gift here. Mine had no buzz. The one from Amazon arrived with a very loud buzz.

After receiving the product and going thru the manual I was dismayed to find that it is only compatible with iPod models available November 2006 or before, rendering it useless for my iPod Touch. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the FM reception is terrible. If I held the AC cord in my hand, I could receive 2 FM stations, otherwise I had absolutely no FM reception at all.

The thing lasted a total of three weeks--two of which I was out of town and not using it--before giving up the ghost. Now it's as silent as a paperweight, regardless of whether I try to just listen to the radio or play something on my ipod. It DOES make a nifty, ultra-expensive clock on which to rest your ipod when you DON'T want to listen to it, though.Do yourself a favor and buy something from a reputable, competent manufacturer.

Bass is limited, but still produces a great sound. If you are looking for something to give a whole room sound, I would suggest sticking with the Apple brand unit which is very expense.I am pleased with the unit for the purpose I purchased it for.

Good sound, lots of features. But it only plays one song from the playlist for the wakeup alarm. After only one month of owning it it started to fritz out. Playing one and a half songs, two and a half, one half, (random wakeup playbacks), finally it automatically set itself to nap mode and the alarm started going off every 60 seconds and nothing would stop it. Even tried unplugging it and pulling out the battery, then reassembling it. It never stopped resetting itself to nap mode! It has been an awful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many buttons","review":"Groping for the alarm button in the morning is not easy.

So sadly it had to go back and my wonderful Christmas present was a failure. If you require a dark room this is not the clock for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking but poor features.","review":"This doesn't have a tone control, or a stereo/mono switch, a remarkable oversight. There is usually less static in mono mode, but because this radio doesn't have this option, you'll almost always be hearing more static/noise than you want, unless you're always tuned into a very close station. Also, volume levels 1-15 are basically all the same, and even the higher ones aren't loud enough. It does have a sleep and nap timer with 1 minute increments, a highly desireable and rare feature, and also an input jack for non-ipod mp3 players, but the shortcomings I described don't compensate for this. I'll return this tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"inconsistent","review":"after four months the power button on the top of the unit ceased working and the unit could not be turned on. Amazon sent a replacement even though it was after the 30 days .... the second unit remote sensor did not function... the third unit was received and set up and seems to be working - but it is only the first week... so although i thought it was a good value ... i have been disappointed by the quality of the actual physical product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've missed a lot of class due to this thing.","review":"I'm not sure if anyone else has been having this problem, but I set my alarm using their really cool weekday/weekend features, set my songs with my ipod, have my schedule all set up... then when it would turn the ipod on, it would play for half a second then put itself on snooze. I don't know if it has sometihng to do with the \\"touchless snooze sensor\\" or not but I have checked the manual over and over again with no help. Same thing happens when I turn on the radio.

Holden has done a lot of research, but he wears his learning lightly. His biography is \\"popular\\" in the best sense - gracefully written, mercifully short (300 pages), interesting, and entertaining. He neither gets bogged down in minutia, nor does he oversimplify. Some of his conclusions may be controversial (and what is not controversial, in Shakespeare studies?) but Holden gives his reasons, and generously references opposing views, so that readers can make up their own minds as to the plausibility of his deductions.The book may be a little confusing to absolute beginners, and it might not contain enough detailed argument to satisfy academic scholars. But I would imagine that most everybody else would find in it a great deal of enjoyment, information, and interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Reading","review":"I found the book to be extremely hard to get through, wordy and boring. The entire book focuses on direct quotations from all of Shakespeare's works with little focus as to why the quotations were included in the text. The book gives the reader little of his personal life, personality, or political views, but focuses only on hundreds of people that he knew and met throughout the years giving detailed explanations of names, and their backgrounds. I found the book to be very boring, with little content on Shakespeare as a person; the book featured only comments on his hundreds of works. If you are EXTREMELY well versed with Shakespeare's works, this is a good pick for you. If you have some to little knowledge, pick something else. For the student who needs interesting information on him as a person, choose another book. I found it to be dry, repetative and only in depth on quotations from thousands of plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy and Amateurish","review":"Anthony Holden's \\"biography\\", if you can call it that, of William Shakespeare is so unbelievably shoddy, that it is surprising that it has been published by a reputable house. It is also sloppy, speculative, and downright unnecessary. Holden engages in irresponsible conjectures, which he fobs off as truth, when there is in fact no evidence. He departs freely from fact, but doesn't have the decency to tell his reader when he is indulging in a flight of fancy. As Michiko Kakutani says in The New York Times, this book is best read not as a biography at all, but as a work of fiction.It is ironic that Anthony Holden has savagely attacked J.K. Rowling, the wondrously creative author of the Harry Potter series, when his own writing is so slipshod and amateurish. Perhaps his real objection is that she's a woman, from a middle-class background at that, not an Oxford don like C. S. Lewis. He only wishes he had Ms. Rowling's creativity and vision!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks credibility, totally unreal","review":"This movie about a mafia trial and an attempt to intimidate a juror (Demi Moore) into delivering a not guilty verdict totally lacks credibility and is unreal.

This sums up my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Predictable","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. All it is about is Alec Baldwin being on trial, Demi Moore is one of the jurors, and Alec just keeps intimidating her to first get a hung jury, then to convince the rest of the jury that he's innocent (which he isn't, of course).There are absolutely NO twists and turns in this one. You can watch the first 45 minutes of it and pretty much guess how it's going to turn out.To it's credit, the acting is pretty good in this movie. It's almost funny how well Alec Balwdin plays a really mean person.But the actors could not save the movie from its ridiculous story. You'll want to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I picked up this movie with the hope of seeing some action and suspense, but was instead subjected to a dark, murky movie with Demi Moore screaming at her kid, and the dark, lifeless face of Mr. Baldwin's character.

Would buy another, and probably will get a larger sized one for the summer and more water sports !!

Why did this woman dress chimps up like people and try to get them behave like human children? Animals aren't people, and they certainly don't want to be treated like they are--it's not healthy for them or for their owners, as was illustrated by the problems Gertrude Lintz had in keeping Buddy. The film doesn't seem to get it's own message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it irritating","review":"I thought it would be cute but it's just a crazy rich woman who indulges her love of animals by turning her home into a zoo. For some reason, instead of amusing me, it annoyed me. Dressing chimps as people and treating them like spoiled children. And she does the same with the gorilla, Buddy. She first saved Buddy but instead of using common sense, she decides to try to make it as human as possible. Of course, he turns on her later and she finds out that yes, gorillas are wild animals.People who want to see animals in human terms annoy me sometimes. I remember once reading about a woman who was kicked in the face by a moose up in the mountains. Well, what did she think \\"Hey, it's Bullwinkle!\\" and try to pet it?I think it also upset me because I was thinking she could have adopted children instead of making chimps into kids. But perhaps it was best she didn't. She would have messed them up by indulging their every whim.BTW, this movie is based on a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Irresistible......","review":"Buddy is such a cute movie. It is the telling of a true story in which Trudy Lintz, ( played by Rene Russo ) a true animal lover, \\"adopts\\" a baby male gorilla. Trudy already has a home filled with many animals including birds, dogs and chimps. Being rich, she was able to provide these animals with a very loving home and environment. The mischevious chimps Joe and Maggie are halarious in this movie as we see them do everything but talk! We see Buddy grow from a baby gorilla into a huge silverback. There are very funny scenes in this movie and a few that are sad like when we see Buddy wanting to be set free. We see Buddy escape and create much chaos. Eventually, Trudy realizes that Buddy would be much happier among other gorillas so she buys him his own \\"sanctuary\\" where he is set free among other gorillas. This is a movie for both grown ups and kids alike. It will keep you entertained from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin the Warior","review":"The book starts off in Badrang's fortress where Martin is a slave.

Felldoh and Brome escape the fortress when thrown into the prison pit. They run into the Rambling Rosehip Players who help the rest of the slaves escape. Captin Tramun Clogg sails in to see Badrang but, his ship was burned by him. Clogg starts a war with Badrang but, a truce is called.

You would not want to put this book down!! This book is possibly the BEST book that Brian Jacques has written!! There are a few sadder parts, where the pace slows down a little (but that is typical of all Jacques' books). You can read this book over and over again and find something new, a new implication or piece of irony. Best of all, instead of just two armies battling each other, Brian Jacques creates a third party -- the freebooting stoat Cap'n Clogg -- that battle both the good and bad armies.I have only one piece of advice for you: GO BUY THIS BOOK NOW, OR ELSE YOU MAY BE MISSING THE BEST BOOK IN PRINT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was hard and boring.","review":"It has too much stuff happening with the food and the two different journeys.

With this happening numerous times, its impossible not to be hooked!In this book, Martin is a younger mouse, and was captured as a slave while he was guarding his family while his father was away (read \\"Legend of Luke\\" if you want to hear his father's adventre). He was taken to Marshank, where he was somewhat of a rebel. He was particularly mad because Badrang, the Tyrant of this (Marshank was his fortress)area, had stolen his father's sword from him. Along with mousemaid Rose and mole Grumm (looking for their captured friend, Brome) and the rest of the slaves try to escape Marshank and kill Badrang.This is a Redwall thriller, and is must for any Redwall or fantasy fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST REDWALL BOOK YET!","review":"Out of all the Redwall books I have read, this one is the best yet.

I've read it 5 times and it always bring a tear to my eye. I highly suggest the whole Redwall series, but I reccomend that you read this one first. Not only is is the best one, but it explains the life of Martin the Warrior, who is the guiding spirit in all the rest of Brian Jacques Redwall books. If I could give it twenty stars I would. I may sound like a lunatic, but if you read it you will understand why I feel so strongly. SO READ IT!!!!! ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"The action packed prequel to Mossflower","review":"Martin the Warrior is the first book chronologically in the Redwall series. It opens with Martin as a slave to an evil Stoat Warlord named Badrang. Martin, while chained to a stake in a storm vows to kill Badrang. After Martin escapes he has many adventures with his friends Rose (a mouse), Grumm (a mole), and Pallum (a hedgehog and my personal favorite). Together they have many adventures, encounters with many bizare animals, and hardships. This book is saved from mediocrity by it's colorful characters, furios battles, and humerous moments. It is a worthy prequel to Mossflower and a great addition to the Redwall series, but it is still not my favorite (see my review of Mossflower)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I think the book Martin the Warrior was a very exciting book. And the battle of Marshank has to be one of the best battles in all of the Red Wall stories i have read so far. the story is full of great adventures that Martin and his friends have.

It had intreiging charectors, and a wonderful plot that was uncompairable!! But the ending was rather dissapointing.

I still think the book is worth the reading, but be prepaired for the ending to be only third best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this book three times","review":"Yes, I have read this book three times and it doesn't ever get boring.

It is a great story that anybody who likes adventures can easily get into and thoroughly enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!!! Good book...REALLY!","review":"well, first of all, i really love this book! It is about Martin the warrior and his struggles. First, he is taken captive, and then rescued by Rose and Grumm from Noonvale. Then, as they run away, Felldoh and Brome are separated from Martin and Rose and Grumm, and they all work together to raise an army to fight the evil warlord who started it all. Then, when everything is set up and Martin and people (or animals)go to the fortress with their own army, they attack! well, let's just say all goes well until about the end, when some of our beloved characters meet their ends...sniff...that's why i gave this a 4 instead of a 5. it was REALLY good, but had a sad ending. hope my review was helpful!

A REAL page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST of all the Redwall books I have ever read.","review":"\\"Martin the Warrior\\" is stunningly adventureous and full of courageous charecters- inclunding peaceful Laterose, her brother Brome, and the mole Grumm. Martin himself is very strong, cunning, and couragous but can be thoughtful, caring, and loving at any time. The whole tale has the bitter hate of slavery, the resentment of the evil Badrang, the suspense of escape, the joy of victory, and the distressing loss of lives of dear friends. All is tied up in just a touch of romance. Campfur and I were soaked in tears for the death of some of the main charecters. All in all, this is the BEST book my dear friend Campfur and I have ever read!-None of the Redwall books have any civilized horses. Is there a reason? Horses would be good Warriors- like Campfur is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a huge fan of Catrow's illustrations, I really looked forward to showing this book to my son. And the pictures were great, which is the only thing that saved this book from a one-star review. The text is awful. Many of the verses don't rhyme, and they don't follow the meter of the original \\"I Know An Old Lady...\\" properly so reading this out loud is very awkward. The \\"reasons\\" for swallowing everything are boring and the ending - why she wanted the bat in the first place - is a big letdown. If you like Catrow's pictures as much as we do, this is worth a look through. But as a funny poem it fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating smell","review":"I have sensitive skin, but immediately upon applying this mask, my skin started to burn. Not tingle, burn. I may have had an allergic reaction, but I highly recommend that people start with a sample.

I am really sad because I had high hopes for this product line because it seemed to have great reviews, but I am continually unimpressed each time I try something by them. Perhaps it is because they have changed their formulas and are using cheaper ingredients? I'm not sure.

My recommendation to others who are nervous about buying skincare products is to get the travel kit: MyChelle Sampler Travel and Gift Set - 1 Kit(s) I have been going through the kit and trying new Mychelle products slowly to discover which ones I like (so far, all of them).

Suggestions anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like all the 5 star reviews come from years ago","review":"How you do rate a product you have not used?

It reminded me of the old school scary stories, like the ones in The Scariest Stories You've Ever Heard, or Chilling Ghost Stories. They're definitely catered to older children, but a few of them are mild enough for younger kids,(ages 6-8.) My daughter wanted this book, so I purchased it for her and made the mistake of reading the first story to her without reading it first myself. She couldn't sleep all night, so then I decided to look through the stories first and found a few that were better suited for her.

Add to that the fact that High Society isa remake of George Cukor's Oscar-winning upperclass romantic farce, The Philadelphia Story, sprinkle marvelous and intimate Cole Porter tunes throughout, and the ironic fact that this was Grace Kelly's last film role, and it's a sure winner.Louis Armstrong, playing himself (and who can imagine him playing anyone else?), starts the movie off by singing the title song. The song and soft-shoe numbers between Crosby and Sinatra, Sinatra and Holmes, Crosby and Armstrong are unforgettable.The plot, of course, is based on: Who Will Tracy Marry? We've got her engaged and about to wed a stuffed shirt, but also present are her ex-husband who still loves her and the scandal rag reporter who falls for his intended victim.Marvelous and witty social commentary, tho the \`social' message is more downplayed than in the original Philadelphia Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great actors that can sing, and Grace Kelly?","review":"Now there is a combination worthy of four stars! This was on PBS last night, and seeing as it had three movies stars that I like, I couldn't resist it!I am a long time fan of the movie musical, and I particularly enjoyed this one. It has Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Grace Kelly in it. Sinatra and Crosby do most of the crooning, but Kelly also sings a little bit. She can really sing too! What an amazing star! She could act, look so elegant and graceful, and sing!Usually the music takes top shelf over the acting, but I quite enjoyed both in this musical remake of \\"The Philadelphia Story\\".If you liked \\"The Philadelphia Story\\", and you like musicals.

I'd seen The Philadelphia Story many many times before seeing High Society, so that made it hard to enjoy. Some of the dialogue in the original movie was ad-libbed which added to its charm. But to hear Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra quoting them was kind of like nails on a chalk board. I'm not saying it wasn't a good movie, but for the die-hard Cary Grant fans, it may not go down easy.

Although I am a huge fan of both Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, the acting in this film was lacking. No disrespect to Grace Kelly, but she doesn't hold a flame to Katharine Hepburn. Kelly's portrayal of Tracy Lord was horrific at best. Not only was the acting inferior, but also the musical numbers were shockingly dull, the best parts were the rhythmic stylings of Louis Armstrong.

Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra are just not believable and somehow the dialogue sounds unrealistic and stilted. One song, \\"True Love\\", emerges as a winner, but the entire film appears to be a waste of talent.

Still, it does have Grace Kelly at her most luminous, and while the music isn't Cole Porter's best, just the sight of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra having so much fun dueting on \\"Well, Did You Evah?\\" is worth the entire movie (they were very friendly rivals). A very nice mid-fifties showcase for all the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Prior To Royalty Induction","review":"\\"High Society\\" is a film that features good acting performances from the late Princess Grace.

This collection consists largely of second-rate re-makes (with the exception of Del Shannon's 'Runaway' and a few others). If your looking for 'End of the World' by Skeeter Davis (as advertised)...forget it...instead you will find a poor re-make of 'Terry' by Twinkle.

If you have no background in neither this would be a good general overview book. For those who are at least knowlegable of the subjects mentioned this book would not be a good read, it is very basic in content. It appears to be an updated edtion with of course the added chapter on \\"web marketing\\",this seems to be popular with authors these days with tring to get additional sales of there old outdated books. DO not read this book if you are already into business or have an understanding of the marketing process.

I used my Reiki knowledge, complimented it with the Quantum Touch method and got miraculous results.I did a healing at my residence and than later that day a distance healing on a woman with fractures in her leg. At the time I was doing the healing her sore leg was throbbing but went away shortly afterwards.The results of her x-rays came back two days later from the doctors and showed up as 'healing' fractures.' I fully believe this is due to the fact that I added the Quantum Touch method to boost the Reiki and she is now on her way to healing. I will continue to use the Quantum Touch method in my holitic practice.Thanks,In light and much healingMary Olson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum-Touch Simple & Elegant Healing","review":"This book gives the reader a simple and elegant way to teach hands-on-healing.

Buy icecream instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"As a nurse-healer, I am always studying the dynamic and often mysterious process of energy-based healing. When I read Quantum-Touch, I knew I had discovered an important key to the process of accessing and directing the subtle energy which we healers use. I quickly put the information into action and feel as if the quality of my healing work has taken a quantum leap. The book is a true joy to read, never complicated, down to earth. I loved this book and after reading it cover to cover, I went out and bought 4 copies to give to my closest friends. I am now rereading it. Richard Gordon is a deeply developed healer with the ability to communicate the process of energy (life-force) science in a beautiful style. I recommend this book to anyone who has interest in developing the art and science of hands on healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book on healing with hands","review":"I have had this book for a while now and I have to admit I have not done all the exercises but I have felt more energy flowing through my hands.

I picked this up on a whim, curious to see if it really offered a break through in energy healing.There is nothing innovative about this book. You can find the concepts the author discusses in books on taoism and tantra that are better written and have a better explanation.I tried his exercises out and found them to be not nearly as effective as he promised. If anything it seemed this was more like a diet lite soda than anything that promised a break through. I wouldn't really recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"more brown than red","review":"The garnets in these earrings are more brown than red.

Some stories appear to have no point--but that's a North American viewpoint. South Americans: \\"It is what It Is.\\" My favorite story about children turning on the lights in their apartment and being magically realistic is in this collection. Short story books serve two purposes for me: One, when I can't sleep and need a boost toward dreamland, and Two, the paperback is easy to cart around while I'm in waiting rooms for appointments. The book can also serve as a \\"test run\\" for a new reader who wants to sample his style, characters, sentences ending in ways you'd never expect but can appreciate, and plots (some, \\"sort of\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviw of Strange Pilgrams","review":"More examples of great story telling by the master.

He has managed to write stories about things that people go through in life but in a way that no one could describe.

Escape is a fun CD, full of energy and it makes you want to dance, and then there are the ballads that only Enrique can deliver with such passion. Besides the wonderful execution by Enrique, keep in mind that he was involved in the production and writing of ALL the songs on the album. That is a great accomplishment on its own. Enrique is a great talent, and the evidence lies in the fact that he sings, writes and produces his work. For fans, it's a must have! For others, buy it you might pleasantly suprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW....#1 Latin singer","review":"WOw...this is cd ROCKSSSSSS....I think Enrique is the best out of the 3 main male singers (him, Marc Anthony, and Ricky Martin).

IT WAS A GREAT CHANGE AND I HOPE HE CONTINUES THE SAME WAY. IN THIS ALBUM I RECOMMEND FIRST LISTENING TO (7)MAYBE, (9)SHE BE THE ONE AND (12)NO APAGUES LA LUZ.

The music is more pop, and the lyrics are a little more edgy. Overall, the album has some great dance music, smooth and romantic lyrics, and a beautiful voice to go along with it. The only thing I would change is that there is too much of a computer synthesized sound in some of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"I recently purchased this album mainly for Enrique's latest single \\"Escape.\\" This is my favorite song from him so far and I enjoy his vocals on it. Of course, the other familiar song is \\"Hero.\\" It was massacred by radio after 9/11 (although why this song became famous becuz of it, I will never know.) I also enjoy the song \\"I Will Survive\\" (and no, it's not a Gloria Gaynor cover.) My biggest dislike is \\"Don't Turn Off the Lights.\\" I pray it's not released as the next single. The Sanish versions of \\"Escape\\" and \\"Hero\\" are nice additions also."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Julio","review":"Why hasn't anyone noticed the boy can't sing!

I expected songs like his last CD, his old spanish songs, or even like the single \\"Hero\\", which is great.

I'd sell back the cd, but i'd never make back what i paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"This album is the best yet to bring back the 80's beat with a millenium twist to it. Enrique has done a wonderful job in reinventing the 80's like no other one has. Especially the song \\" Escape\\".

However, when my friend insisted I listen to \\"Escape\\" in the car, I was surprised at the poppy fun feel that the whole album has. I am not one for pop, in fact, I hate it. But when you want a fun CD to stick on, this is great to get some pre-party nerves out, or to just dance around to in your living room. Kinda like Darren Hayes meets latin pop.

Neither an Agatha Christie nor a Julia Childs, Ms Davidson creates a pedestrian work of fiction overly loaded with kitchen trivia and out of context recipies that lack most of the ingredients for a solid \\"who done it.\\" Indeed, my reaction at the end was more like who cares who done it. Perhaps there are some useful hints for the budding chef but for me, I'll not bother with another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior high level murder mystery...and that's going a long way!","review":"I picked up this book in a used booked store in Powell River, British Columbia, while waiting for a ferry to Vancouver. I didn't know that culinary murder mysteries was a genre and this book was part of a series of similar mishaps. Where was the warning label?The author sets up her heroine as a gourmet-wannabe Nancy Drew running after inept murderers while strewing recipe cards along her trail. She dishes out food descriptions ad nauseam and then raves over them until you want to gag her with a kitchen towel. All the while, she insults her readers' intelligence by serving up as novelty that age old recipe of suspecting the evil looking guy first, and then making her model character the evil culprit!If you're a fan of this author's work you'll probably enjoy it. But if this is your first time try, be aware that it is definitely an acquired taste. I'll pass on seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, ponderous and cloying writting & characters","review":"The \\"detective\\" character, Goldy, is terribly annoying and way too cute for words. The books could easily be shortened by 100+ pages. Every detail however small and unimportant is described in excrutiating detail. Bad writing + bad character development = frustration.

If you are looking for a non-professionsal female \\"detective\\" story try Murder on Martha's Vineyard by David Osborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch","review":"The recipies are better than the plot. Chocolate Coma Cookies are wonderful, good as a muffin batter too... does anyone miss the shrimp currry recipe? It sounds awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to Swallow","review":"Although a recipe for successful cookies is a good act to follow, a recipe for a cookie cutter mystery is no mystery at all. I have enjoyed Ms. Davidson's previous novels with a healthy appetite, always looking to return to her good cooking. But neither her recipes (my, goodness, Velveta! I'd rather have her recipe for meatballs.) nor her writing are at all tasty in this hastily thrown together goulash. Characters pop in and out (Marla, Julian, Tom) with no explanation and no reason except some nod to her loyal readers. A newcomer to this venue would be baffled by their ties to this self-centered caterer.And you know, this COULD have been a killer recipe -- good villain, multiple suspects, a friend in trouble, good setting, and good descriptions. But the book is much too insubstantial and the characters mere meringue.I hope that next time the author goes for more solid fare with much improved character development and motivation, better dialogue, and some stick to your ribs recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fast, funny detectiving!","review":"No, Diane Mott Davidson's books are not great literary works of art. They ARE tremendously fun to read. The main character, Goldy the caterer (a little plump, a little clumsy, a little goofy, drinks too much coffee) may be you or someone you know! You will laugh out loud at her some of her predicaments, and feel her pain with the ex and troubles with raising a son. I've read a few of her books so far and really enjoy the characters, the somewhat simple mysteries and the really great recipes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overbaked","review":"Diane Mott Davidson has never met an adjective for which she couldn't find a use. Steaming, fragrant, sweet, soft...they're all here, and more. Despite likable, well-drawn characters, detailed cooking descriptions drag down a plot that's already on the edge of not-so-interesting. I did finish this novel -- all 319 paperback pages -- and am not particularly sorry I did, but never was I gripped. Near the end, a predictable self-induced crisis puts the heroine in mortal danger, from which she improbably escapes to see a neatly-wrapped conclusion in the last page or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Cookie is a Limp Biscuit","review":"A faithful reader and re-reader of DMD's books, I eagerly awaited \\"Tough Cookie\\", as I have all of her \\"Goldy the Caterer\\" series. This one, though, failed to deliver.Many of her recipes seemed uninspired, the plot boring and the new characters very one-dimensional. This book seemed like it was written in a hurry, to meet a publisher's deadline, and with little imagination.I did enjoy the setting of a ski resort; I've never been to Colorado but DMD's descriptions are always wonderful and vivid. I feel like I would recognize that part of the country if I visited, just from reading her books.Normally I try to buy her books for the recipes; with this one, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, sweet little mystery with some interesting recipes","review":"I've read several of Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy Schultz mysteries, and find that they run along the same trail--someone gets murdered, and Goldy divides her time between investigating the murder and whipping up delicious food. \\"Tough Cookie\\" is no great departure from the formula. Everyone has their roles to play, and play them they do--from Goldy's brassy friend Marla to Goldy's abusive ex-husband (whose menacing appearances often jarringly distract from the rest of the story, which despite the murders and other goings-on tend to be quite fluffy). Why anyone would want to live in Aspen Meadows, which must have the highest per-capita murder rate in America judging by the books, is beyond me! Still, a pleasant read for those who like their murder mysteries on the lighter side. Good recipes, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous and delicious!","review":"Caterer Goldy Schulz's kitchen has been shut down because it did not pass inspection after a remodeling job by her husband. Fortunately, Goldy is offered the job of a cooking show on PBS and she has decided to pursue a job as a personal chef, where she can cook in her clients' kitchens. Things are still tight financially, so Goldy decides to sell some valuable skis to her old boyfriend, Doug Portman. Before they can complete the transaction, Portman dies and Goldy becomes a suspect. Added to this, Goldy is almost pushed off the road by another vehicle. There have been several deaths near the place where Portman died, and Goldy suspects that they are somehow linked. As she begins her investigation, she discovers no shortage of suspects. Several people have motives for murdering Portman, and it's up to Goldy to find the killer. Before she does, she is nearly killed herself. This is a good addition to the series and has interesting characters and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book...But ....","review":"I loved this book. what an original concept! I couldn't put it down. I would sneak into the bathroom at work and read a few pages. I hide Tough Cookie among our many law books and pretend to be busy reading a certain case and would actually be reading about Goldy and her cooking/snooping or her relationship with her son Arch.The only problem I had was when she had that terrible car accident and went home and COOKED A WHOLE MEAL AND BAKED COOKIES...PLEEEEEESE. Otherwise the book was fantastic, especially all those wonderful recipes.I just ordered all DMD books (except Stones & Scones) and plan to have a great summer reading all of DMD books and trying out recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me hungry!","review":"There was a book fair at work and this book was 50% off, so I bought it and read it in less than three days. I admit, this wasn't a real thriller type mystery, but it was very easy to read and I enjoyed it. So much, in fact, that I ordered all eight of her previous books. I plan to start with the first and read straight through to this one. It should be quite a trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I would just like to say that this is a very good book. I have read all of the authors books and this is just one more great one. I thought the ending was very good and the book well planned, thought out and very descriptive.

Goldy has to find a way to earn a living without the use of her catering business, at least until her brand new kitchen passes the county health inspector's rigorous inspection. Leave it to Goldy to find a way! She tries her hand at a TV cooking show, and winds up in the middle of a murder mystery. As she tries to figure out who killed her old boyfriend, she will tempt you with recipes for crab cakes, ginger snaps, oatmeal and of course, chocolate cookies. I couldn't put the book down - except to grab a bite to eat! If you have enjoyed Diane Mott Davidson's other novels, you will certainly love this one. And if you are new to this author, you will want to read more! I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, and who loves to eat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate Coma Cookies are to Die for!","review":"I read the book and loved every minute of it.

It's worthy of listen and praise by anyone that's into screamo/christian rock or whatever your into. I believe you will enjoy the Question regardless...yes they are a Christian band. But dont let that detract from seeing what they are all about. I enjoy it and i'm not into all of the other stuff. But i do know that this cd from start to finish never quits or gets old at all...awesome band playing, singing (vocal/bckgrnd) and lyrics very important aspect that some folks seem to lack.But not Emery if anything by the end of the cd..i'm ready to go to listen and repeat all over again with just as much enjoyment as i had the first time through....nice follow up to the Weak's End and another notch for them. I anticipate whatever they come out with now and in the future.Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOCKINGLY GOOD","review":"This album is awesome. I have to say that Emery is very underrated. This album nearly summarized what I think music should be. I have never heard such an awesome combination of beautiful, melodious, textured music with such a perfect aggressive edge. They mixed this one up very well. For the people who maybe heard part of a song from this CD and couldn't stand the screaming, try it out again. I get annoyed when there is a scream at least every ten seconds, but this album evens it out. I just love the intensity. I have a ton of albums that I absolutely love and can listen to straight through, but this one is easily up there in my top 5. If you want to hear musicans who know how to make music, and not just the same old stuff with a slightly melody, grab this album and prepared to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Explosive Follow-Up","review":"The boys from Emery did it again. They produced an explosive album from start to finish. I usually get a little worried when bands are ready to release a new album, because of the expectance for it to be just like the previous release. But after putting this album on, I realized it was as just as powerful if not better than \\"The Weak's End\\". This album is full of beautiful clean vocals, passionate screams,deep and at times dark lyrics, and each song is built with a catchy \\"sing-along\\" type chorus. Bravo Emery! You never fail to impress me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have book for planning your career","review":"An incredibly insightful book that details how to achieve long term career success through an actionable, commonsense plan that will pay dividends immediately.

And doing so in an engaging writing style that makes this great book an easy read.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Wow! This book kept me turning the pages. Mr. McGovern shares his life experiences with his readers with eloquence and style. It's well organized and yet, easy to read. The book is written from Mr. McGovern's heart as he shares his real life experiences as a career expert. Not just another business book! I'm planning on giving one to each of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screwball black comedy","review":"The Naked Man definitely has a Coen-esque flavor, but it's more darkly humorous than, say, Raising Arizona. It starts off slow but about an hour into the movie when \\"The Naked Man\\" has gone nuts, you may begin to wonder if Terry Gilliam just took over the directing chores or if this is some bizarre dark side track in The World According to Garp.Highly recommended if you like your comedy weird and with a body count.

The overall material explaining the author's ideas of design criteria could have been presented in about ten pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed!","review":"As a frequent customer of Amazon, I am highly disappointed at the actual length of the video. I was not excepting the video to be 5-10 mins in length. I feel like I was duked. Next time, I would really appreciate it if Amazon posted the actual length of the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a waste of money","review":"There is simply no reason to buy \\"Unraveled\\" -- there is nothing inspiring, educational or even hopeful in this book. It is like reading a bad blog. The author is self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, and nothing in the book gave me any idea how to cope with the tragedy in my own life better or how to live the life I was meant to live. Losing your child is not an excuse to do whatever you want or to abandon your other children. I know this, because I too lost a 3 year old daughter to cancer, and am now going through a divorce. As for the reader who asked, in her review, why Maria wrote this book, the answer is obvious: the money from \\"Hannah's Gift\\" was running out, and she needed the income. The fact is, if she had nothing better to say, she would have been better off not writing any more books and going back to her old career in finance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this","review":"I started this book but I had to stop reading it. I just can't grasp how someone who went through the loss of a child could abandon her three remaining babies. And then she writes a book about it, hoping to profit from her selfishness. She makes me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"daring\\" author?","review":"She left her husband to go have casual sex with a yoga instructor? That's not daring. It's banal.She also abandoned her children. That's not a \\"different kind of mother\\" that's quitting as a mother.I hope that the author failed to find her true self -- otherwise she is truely an awful human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word.....selfish","review":"Although I found this book interesting, the more I read, the less I liked or agreed with the choices the author made. I didn't read her first book, because as a mom myself, I guess I'm a coward, I can't read about dying children. The more I read this book, the more the author's selfishness came through. It's all about her, her choices, her this, her that. I tried not to be judgemental, she lost a child and how can that not change you? But to leave her three young children with a man she describes as emotionally abusive and in at least one incident, physically abusive, shows her consideration was not for her children but for herself.

The material within is too ridiculously specific to be of much use to undergraduates, who need good, classic models of phenomena to understand. On the other hand, the material selection is far too hit-or-miss and general in each area to be of use to a researcher. The researcher will continue to benefit primarily from review articles, while the undergraduate will find a good biochemistry text most helpful (try Voet & Voet's section on DNA replication, repair, etc... it is excellent and can be read in a finite amount of time).Bless Ben Lewin's little heart, I don't know who the hell this book will be good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Advanced Genetics Book I've Ever Read","review":"Rumor has it that Oxford Press was paid by thepound for this text. The extremely large font (14pt?) is extremely annoying unless you really enjoy flipping pages. The index is the worst ever, the references are scanty, and the text is long on illustrations and short on substance. In fact, the illustrations are the only thing that save this book, which reduces many complex molecular mechanisms into simple succinct paradigms, completely heedless of accuracy. The mere mention of this book in my medical school lecture hall illicited a long series of groans and sighs. Buy it only if you absolutely have to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Advanced Genetics Book I've Seen","review":"Rumor has it that they sell all the books in the Genes Series by the pound. The extremely large print is very distracting and makes the book very hard to lug around. The illustrations are wonderful, but many times the text is long on pretty colors and short on important details. Mr. Lewin has not referenced his text well, giving only general references some of which are less than helpful. The index was by far the worst aspect of the book--it's almost impossible to find anything. In an informal survey, 3 of 4 students in my medical school class say they would burn their copy of Genes first if they were trapped in a snowstorm and needed the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple a text","review":"I have found Genes VI, as well as previous editions, to be teeming with errors on almost every page. In addition, its index (as others have pointed out) is absolutely unhelpful because it is too general. In other words, one would have better luck finding a topic by flipping through the book than by utilizing the index. The format of the text seems elementary and Lewin does not go into much technical detail. Therefore, I think this book is most likely suited for an molecular biology course for non-science majors, or as supplemental reading in an upper level biology course."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst index on the planet","review":"This book is rife with errors, is poorly written (and verbosely so) and has the worst index of any book half its size.

The built-in Help Guide is also rather convenient because I usually don't take the time to carefully read the Owners Manual.My favorite feature is the Image Stabilization. I was asked to take photos of my friend's wedding and reception. The camera I used didn't have Image Stabilization, and at least 1/3 of the candid shots came out blurred, which was VERY frustrating and embarassing. Not so with the FE-210.

In either case, hubs and switches are explained. While these are not part of a PC, nowadays, a lot of the value of a PC is when it is connected to the Internet.Note that \\"Repair\\" in the title is really a misnomer. An important point made by the authors. If a part of a PC breaks, it is rarely repaired. The complexity is often beyond most customer's ability to do so, or that of a local computer shop, for that matter.

How many singles can actually boast this much variety on one cd? And what's more? Everything on here is really good!! I especially like the Almighty remix of 'We've got tonight'!!

It reminds me of Beetlejuice, Evil Dead, The Nature Of The Beast, Roadracers, Crybaby, and The Road To Wellville. Those movies all have a similarly off-kilter blend of seriousness and insanity that defies even the conventions of being unconventional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorchers","review":"I saw this movie in the early 90's and enjoyed it very much. .

This is a low crime, high traffic area, so I doubt the thief would have had time to make it a long project to get open - seems the lock was easy to get open.

The first thing I did when putting the bikes together was remove all of the quick release, so we decided that the cable wasn't needed and haven't carried it at all.

I originally bought this combo for my mountain bike and have no problems in locking the frame with the U-Lock and the wheels with the extra security cable (but not the wheel and the frame and the rail only using the U-Lock part which is possible with the non-Mini version). The U-Lock and and the cable could be fit in a normal size student backpack or can be attached with the mechanism provided to the frame of your bike and it won't fall off even if you sometimes go off the curb.Security rating of this thing as rated on some sites is pretty high, as some websites that tested it vs. other similar products."},{"rating":"2","title":"good lock short cable","review":"The lock works great!

Since it was a new toy she liked to play with it, and quickly figured out she needs to pull it. I think it helps her develop her sense of using her fingers or hands and eyes coordinately ( motor skills basically). Well, like every other toy in the house, her interest is always diverted to new things that she finds. She still plays with it once a while, but we think it is a toy that she could still enjoy when she's 2 or 3.I would have given it a full-star if the paint of one wood chip of alligator's body didn't come off.

I have been a fan of Mortimer Adler, whose philosophical approach to God Turell borrows, for many years and have monitored with interest the arguments of the proponents of intelligent design and the anthropic principle, as well as the explanations of the deficiencies of Darwinism as a final theory. Dr. Turell weaves all these threads together with a personal touch, and provides some suggestions for compromises in certain aspects of the cultural war that have merit as well as some helpful tips for other pilgrims. A very worthwhile addition to the dialogue to which I am sure to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is all here but the Invisible Man","review":"More movies have been made and remade from H. G.

Yeah, that's right - I just made a gustatory comment about genital mutilation - I'm sorry; this movie has warped my fragile little mind. Honestly, there's no way to describe this one. It's gruesome, infuriating, eerie, literary . . . You may want to Google \\"The Three Beggars\\" before you watch it. That'll help you to understand some of the mythology of the film. Look, if you've got a sturdy stomach and a love for atmospheric aesthetics and raunchy mise en scène, you will love this film! If you're like me and you can appreciate a good film in spite of its stomach-turning images - you'll LOVE this film!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antichrist on Blu-Ray","review":"Wow, just saw this yesterday. Kind of hard to describe but let me try... a fun, light-hearted romp through the woods. You'll laugh, you'll cry... if you like talking animals and lots of acorns you'll love this film. Think Disney with an edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Shocking - not gruesome - not violent - a lot of hype over nothing","review":"This review is the from the Criterion Edition.Spoiler Alert for horror fans! You watch this expecting a horror film you have spoiled two hours of your life.This is not a horror film. It is not shocking in any sense. There was blood twice and even then it looked fake in the leg scene. If your expectations are a artsy film this may be for you. If you are looking for the promised horror it markets then ugh... Go watch Martyrs. It is still the vanguard for horror brutality and yet retains than 'artsy' feel. (August Underground, Scrapbook, Murder Set Pieces all fall into a different category).I will say the film is beautifully shot and the dialogue is interesting but its just so freaking boring. Between this and Let the Right One in you have the perfect cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antichrist (DVD)","review":"This movie is not only a great erotic film but has a great story that grabs you and never lets go. A good movie to share with friends and discuss later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely depraved","review":"The worst, most depraved, movie I have ever seen. There was NOTHING redeeming about it whatsoever. A dead child, an abusive mother, a lunatic husband -- mix in mindless sex, genital mutilation, blood and gore... Awful. I felt like I needed a shower and a walk in the fresh air just to clean the stench of this film off from me. Not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...hmmm...okay","review":"Alright so I bought into the hype and purchased this movie. It starts off with some hardcore pounding (I mean HARDCORE penetration). And basically this guy is so busy jamming his wife they forget to check on the kid, the kid falls out a window and the movie gets weird. I was bored for the most part but laughed at the wheel being attached to the dudes leg. I wouldn't recommend a buy, it tries to be artsy but falls flat. Kind of a dumb movie. Lots of skin and weirdness. OH, I almost forgot.. the chick cuts her clitoris off.. and they show it. WEIRD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willem, what were you thinking?","review":"Pretentious artsy wannabe flick that if it contains any good qualities, I missed them. Mr. Dafoe has never looked more bulimic and at what skank farm the casting crew found the lead actress, I haven't a clue.Dreadful movie in all but one respect. It is extremely illustrative of the non-science that Psychology/Psychiatry is. If you feel the need to sit through seemingly endless new age psycho-babble while watching two of the most unattractive people constantly fornicating....then have at it. I wish I could get my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Director is totally self absorbed","review":"I watched this film only because of Willem Defoe. That is where the movie started and then stopped for me. I will make this simple. I thought it was a terrible movie. And I know some people will say I did not get the \\"artistic\\" part of the whole thing. My response to that is this, No, I got what the director was trying to do, but the whole time he was directing the movie, I got the impression he was off sitting in the corner thinking to himself \\"Wow, I am making one heck of an artistic movie here\\" Well no, all you did was some weak shock and awe, full penetration, genital mutilation, come on. Antichrist, why antichrist? should just be psycho, nut job."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"MINDLESS\\" Unrated R-X Movie","review":"R-meaning violence, sex scenes, andX-meaning X rated sex scenes!The only normal part of the movie, was in the beginning, with the sex scene (including the UNRATED X scene in the shower) and kid falling out a window. The rest of the movie was a blur of simulated therapy sessions (with a couple who were more like strangers than husband and wife) violence, more X sex scenes and a twisted and sick woman, more X and then I just turned it off.It was a poor example of a movie because it was a poor attempt to make filming gross, graphic, sexual scenes an actual plot!!!Surprised that an actor such as William Defoe would have even considered playing this role!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of film!","review":"I would have given this no stars if I had a choice.This movie is terrible and disgusting.

I cannot recommend it -- but I am interested to understand what lies behind it based on all the extra materials with this disc set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indifference is not an option.","review":"Beautiful, thought-provoking, uncompromising, deeply disturbing, entirely unique and unforgettable. Pretentious, disgusting, exploitative, cheap, meaningless art-house garbage.The worst kind of art is that which fails to make an impression or sits squarely in a comfort zone. With Antichrist, indifference is not an option. No matter what side of the fence you end up on, this film will provoke a reaction... and that's always the mark of a good film. If you have an open mind and an appreciation for films as a medium of art, one that stretches beyond the bounds of entertainment, you won't regret watching this film. No matter how difficult or draining it may be, it is an uncompromised vision that is provocative, unflinching, and masterfully executed. That's a rarity in cinema these days that shouldn't be missed by those who truly love the medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"A battle between the Apollonian and Dionysian principles","review":"The negative reviews are fascinating. Some people seemed to be expecting a traditional horror genre movie and were confused and disappointed. One person was expecting a porn movie, and was very disappointed.The other category of criticism came from those who found the film \\"pretentious, boring, and dumb.\\"Although the film does not supply any easy answers, in order to get meaning from it I think the film requires a certain amount of knowledge about a variety of subjects, including mythology, feminism, psychology, and European religious history. I find it to be both a very disturbing and powerful film. At times beautiful, and others gruesome. A battle between the Apollonian and Dionysian principles. Mysterious and provocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Close-Captioning!","review":"I will not review the movie itself, but I ordered this last spring/2012, and just over therecent Holidays got around to watching it. There is no close-captioning, you know, thewords you can read on the screen. Much as I love Charlotte G, and Dafoe as well for that matter,between the grief subject matter, and the borderline mumblecore(CG can be difficult to understand under the best of circumstances), I gave up on back-tracking and getting up to stand by the TV,with the volume in High. No Close-Captioning. Now, per the setup, I suppose I could have attempted to read Spanish or French, but since I really cannot read either, well, it was veryirritating that there was no feed coming thru to accommodate Close-Captioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving, pseudo-philosophical, pretentious, bourgeois meladrama","review":"I will not repeat the other poor ratings here. This is another film that tries to offer a refined and rarefied subject, but fails miserably to deliver anything more than long dull scenes, annoying sexual content (as if that were something profound in itself!) and snobby upper middle-class characters for whom no one could give a damn. I will still give Defoe a nod for being out of the ordinary, but just as with Anamorph, the films are just rotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"chaos reigns indeed","review":"unfortunately, this movie was beautifully filmed. i say unfortunately because the plot is ridiculous, the characters are undeveloped, and the script is terrible. basically: the movie's beauty is wasted. this movie is full of holes and is excruciatingly painful to watch at parts - not just because it is so graphic but because it is so bad. i have no problem with graphic imagery if it's done well. maybe this movie is meant to have an underlying statement or metaphor. if it is, it has been smothered by heavy-handed, circumlocutory filmmaking. lars von trier is an egomaniacal idiot who somehow fools a lot of people into thinking he is a genius. i don't understand it. the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the cinematography. if you feel you must see it, you're in for a dissatisfying and pretty disturbing (with no purpose) ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not...","review":"This is NOT the uncut version, and therefore not worth the price. IFC picked up the film for distribution in the states and edited the sex/violence scenes. If you want von Trier's uncut vision you will have to get it through Amazon UK but it is in PAL Region 2 format, so there's the playability issue. Until someone in the US can get over their medieval notions of (plastic) morality we will have to purchase all region players."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange","review":"this movie was disturbing to say the least!

The only thing I got a kick out of is seeing William Defoe's character's insane wife drill a hole in his leg and put some kind of bolted grind stone bolted to it. He dragged him self around like a goon. I got a little tired of penis shots in the movie. The first part of the movie I thought I was watching a porn or something. iIn a nutshell WEIRD and BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Rental Only","review":"I can't imagine why anyone would own this movie.

Good, scary horror - the kind that doesn't feel the need to show excessive anything. The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, Lake Mungo, even Paranormal Activity. All good. This...this is beyond disappointed. Clearly the writer and/or director went for shock value. Not that shock alone ruined it...the lack of any coherent plot was what did it in.Seriously, save yourself 2 hours and watch a classic instead. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching..","review":"I was expecting so much more from this film and it just wasnt' there. I tried and tried to get into it, and the film was hard to follow at times, and sometimes, just plain stupid. It was major angish to watch till the end, however, I did and wished I hadn't. Watch if it's for FREE and don't if you have to pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Antichrist","review":"I am all for artistic freedom. HOWEVER, the film Antichrist should have been tagged with much stronger descriptors. The synopsis in no way prepares the viewer for the scenes of graphic, unspeakably disturbing sexual mutilation. Seriously Amazon? I only wish I could have gotten to the stop button five seconds earlier. I will never watch another film on instant video without first reading the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious trash. Don't bother.","review":"Utterly crap.It's shot in a very 'try-hard' style, clearly aimed at those who seek for meaning in every shot possible.The story itself is dull, pointless, and the female character in the movie is hideously unlikable, and pointlessly violent.The way things wrap up make very little sense, and it just seems very gratuitous and tries to be such in an 'artful' way for the sake of it.And the last shot is an abstract image of Wilem Defoe in a woodland, looking as women who just happen to be there, for reasons we don't know run down a hill. It makes bugger-all sense. He looks confused and it says 'fin'.My guess, is this is the director performing a practical joke on pretentious idiots, to expose them and take their money. Critics raved over this, and that just proves further that the critics are idiots.Absolute pile of over-hyped gobshite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, absolutely awful","review":"I gave this movie a shot. It was so incredibly bad, it hurt. Pretentious, dull. This is only for the worshippers of Von Trier who like anything he does, no matter how bad.

I first heard this as a kid rummaging through my big brother's record collection and was totally FLOORED. My dad, also a musician (it runs in the family), felt that this version of \\"Woodchopper's Ball\\" is some of the best guitar playing that he'd ever heard. I've enjoyed \\"SHHH\\", \\"Cricklewood Green\\", and \\"Watt\\", but this is the one that sums up what Ten Years After was all about. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin Blues","review":"Its the memories this brings back of seeing a young Alvin Lee on that smokin guitar I love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this?","review":"Does anyone know what this is? It's listed as a box set, yet there is only 1 disc. The price, to me, seems a bit steep for one disc of music that was originally released 40 years ago. The track listing shows 25 songs, some of which I know are close to ten minutes long, so it is impossible to have all this on one disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"TYA's Best Album","review":"Undead is Ten Years After best work. After Woodstock all of their albums sounded like the last. I really like them before the rock superstar thing took over. Raw and in your face.

I ordered this: I was not disappointed.Some of the cuts just sounded fine and the bonus material actually filled out the concert and I was back in '68 when TYA could make me proud that I had saved $4 to go out to hear the latest band that week.This holds up a lot better than the first lp does. Sure Lee gets into that crazy stuff that sounds a lot like listening to a food processor, but by and large, the set sounds really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is a relatively straight forward story of a man trapped in a lifestyle that he wants to leave before it is too late and before he hurts those closest to him. Goodis, however, creates a world in which there is an underlying darkness that permeates throughout with characters that are fully alive both with possibility and tragedy. The loneliness of a Philadelphia suburb, an eastern highway with flooding rain, and the crowded emptiness of an Atlantic City boardwalk stay with a reader for a long time. This is surely a 20th Century classic. It took me months to find the work at a reasonable price, but it was worth the wait and the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRACK LISTING","review":"Let's GrooveMagneticShining StarSeptemberIn The StoneGot To Get You Into My LifeLet Me TalkStarBoogie WonderlandThat's The Way of the World"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this boring book!","review":"How an interesting subject such as Operation Diadem can be rendered into a thundering bore is beyond me.

I found some of his training advice to be horrible! Just to name some things... talking about how to beat your dog. No dog should ever be hit/beat it does not make him a better trained dog. It just makes him a sad, hurt dog. You should train your dog with love... praise, NOT BY HITTING HIM! All dogs should have a loving home, NO dog should EVER be hit. Also, talking about having him in the kennel all day, only take him out to work, it's mean and doesn't make a good dog... just a sad dog, a happy dog who gets a lot of love will be a better worker! You CAN'T keep a dog in the kennel all day, and only take him out for work, or to beat him! Dogs need someone to love them, they need to be played with, taken on walks, someone to pet them... hold them... love them......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average book - seemed outdated","review":"I guess the book would be okay for someone training a Lab strictly for a hunting companion. As a general guide for dog training I found it lacking. The author spends alot of time talking about his experiences with Labs in the past and seems like a pretty miserable, ornery sort of guy. He has a few short drills concerning obedience training for your dog but then jumps into selecting a dog, training using field trials and gives references to friends in the business of breeding and training dogs. Problem is, the book was first written around 1940 with the last revision around 1977. Not too current. Again, for the hunter concerned with getting a top-quality Lab for field work, proabably a good book. For the average owner who wants a well-trained, loving pet around the house this book is not worth anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Training Text for Any Animal","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager in the late 1960s. Now I am giving it to my father in-law as a Father's Day gift.One of the other reviewers said that this was an outdated book about training a field trials dog. I don't know how dogs have been updated in recent years, but I do know that field trials are the graduate schools of dog training. It is true that this isn't the book for you if you have a wild or stupid dog. Mr. Free believed that some dogs just were not worth trying to train. You give the bad dog to someone who would love it and care for it (did this happen to you?); then you get a dog with potential.That said, this is the finest animal training book I have ever read. Don't get lost in the field trials stuff; try to concentrate on Mr. Free's principles. I think you could train anything based on Mr. Free principles.

Most of the text that is there is quoted from other sources. Information on about 10 companies only and skips some of the largest including Conn, Buescher, York, and Boosey and nothing on some of the smaller old brands like Lehnert. The valuations given are for specific instruments, and the guidelines for generalized pricing are next to useless, with statements such as: \\"Valuing antique brass instruments is like shooting at a moving target in the dark.\\" All in all some limited information about a number of companies, and many interesting old illustrations of historic instruments, but not of much use in determining value of instruments other than the specific ones in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"I have 25 years' experience in buying and selling antique wood and brasswinds, so this book was of very great interest.

Pictures are arbitrary, poorly reproduced and often too small to be useful. Commonly encountered makers (Boosey, Gautrot, Sax etc) are absent.

It by no means supplants or replaces or trumps the U.S. Constitution. If we follow our own law, but not UD, this is fine, and probably preferable: basing our actions on votes at the UN is a pretty bad idea. Whereas Chomsky will always be much more critical of the US than any other country (even though the other countries are almost universally less free), most of these other countries would be only too happy to impose their views of liberty on us.

A winner of both the Paganini and Tchaikovsky competitions, Kaler demonstrates the incredible depth of talent emerging from Russai, and not just in warhorse concertos. These Brahms sontas are very lovely, not as individual perhaps as versions from Mullova, Perlman, or Szeryng, but done with genuine feeling ad musicality. Kaler's tone is full and evenly produced, in the post-Poistrakh mode. His excellent accompanist, Alexander Peshkanov, is as good as anyone I've heard short of Richtr or Ashkenazy.

It covers at least twelve different engineering disasters in 50 minutes, and, as you might expect, gives each of them almost no depth.

The cast of sidemen also includes such greats as Barney Kessel, Jimmy Rowles, and Joe Mondragon. But while the arrangements are creative at times, they are more often completely unsuited to Lane's voice. She is at her best on gently swinging, sultry numbers like \\"Our Very Own\\" and \\"You Hit the Spot.\\" Too many of the selections are frantically paced, often with an accompanying xylophone seemingly out of a 1950's movie about the frenetic lifestyle of New York City, or Lane tries for the artistic effect, pushing her voice out of its natural range. The results are hardly pleasing, which may explain why this was Lane's only major label release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"I just purchased a Wadsworth 2 Pole 20 AMP breaker.

Decidedly missing much on the lines of brushwork in ink (not watercolor, of course) and it's possibilities, but, then, this is a book on the technical pen (not the brush). I rate this 4 stars because not enough time is spent identifying many of the basic styles and the author tends to stray from style to style in his illustrations. This makes for confusing stylization (ie: shifting from parallel line to scross-hatch to stipple) for the beginning technical pen artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Technical Pen","review":"A terrific book on technic with pen and ink.

This book has great information on the care and use of the Technical Pen and has more imaginative examples of pen and ink than Guptills more traditional (but, none the less beautiful and important) works. This book also has more on the \\"process\\" of doing an initial pencil outline,choosing pen strokes and building up patterns to create a drawing. It includes a section of problems to avoid with pen strokes and tones etc. which was very helpful to me. I would have never thought of using the patterns the author used to render some of the drawings. I look forward to playing with these in my own drawings.

Whitaker House, the publisher, has deleated many of Penn-Lewis' Biblical teachings on Christians and demonization. It is well documented that Christians tody CAN be deminically influenced. It is a shame that Whitaker House has republished this work claiming it to be authentic. To get the full message of what Jessie Penn-Lewis was getting at, you'll have to find a used copy.

Personally, I find Disc 2 of Brazil to be the most dazzling auditory journey I've ever been on. No matter how many times I hear it, I still find myself amazed by the distance it travels, the changes, the climaxes leading to new beginnings leading to different sounds and more climaxes. Freaking brilliant! Not that Disc 1 is bad - - I would give it 3 or 4 stars alone, but because #2 is so incredible, the overall effect is a solid 5 stars.

Her mysteries are fun, her way of handling history is interesting and the way she handles language makes for a lovely reading experience. I suppose I should wonder how a man as cloistered as Cadfael could possibly run into so many unfortunate circumstances, but I never do. I love the pace of Cadfael's life and the depth of his character. I love best his honor and the quality of his faith. I found this the best of the series. The character lived and breathed in his quest, and in the pain his decision cost him. We see him as a fully rounded man - a solidly spiritual person who is also quick witted and capable. But there's more to it than that - there is such love in this book, such affection for humanity, that it was a rich, satisfying read. Action for the action minded, complexity for the intelligent, and warm - for those who read to find friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Conclusion","review":"After reading Ellis Peters' 20th and last Cadfael story I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that there will be no more coming. The Cadfael novels were all finely written and satisfying as mysteries and historical novels. In this last installment, there is a murder mystery, but Cadfael ends up solving much more than a crime. In fact, the crime solving aspect is a small part of this story that mostly surrounds the relationships between a father and an estranged son. I think most fans will agree that it isn't one of the best three or four, but it was very good, and is a fitting conclusion to the Cadfael story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cosmic Joker","review":"An amazing amount of information packed into 48 pages.

This book oversimplifies the subject and leads children to believe that an adopted baby understands the journey she begins when she meets her forever family. The text is nothing like what a six year old (the supposed age of the character narrator) would use. The pictures are over simple in some parts to look as if a child has drawn and colored them, and in other parts they are something like a bizarre cross between a photo and a sketch. They are not likely to draw a young child in or hold their interest.It is impossible that this character, Rain, would have had all of the thoughts and feelings she tells her young readers she had.

The story itself is molded in the crusty fashion of a circa-1970's made for television movie, complete with horrible dialogue and one static character after another.

I had to reset it -- unplug, wait ten minutes, restart -- but it shut down again almost immediately. While the fan IS nice and quiet, it's almost useless. You have to get within a foot of the heater to feel any heat.This unit is going back to the store, where I hope to find a heater not made of plastic. My guess is that Holmes paid its Chinese manufacturer less than five bucks for this unit and most of the rest of the price to their shareholders.

It's hard to describe but you just couldn't really get into the story. Usually with her novels, you can't put the book down, but this one, you can leave it. It draws your attention in after a while, but it's not as suspenseful as her other novels. Gabrielle's guardian--Hermione was cute with her quirky staff, but things were a little too rushed and unreal. Not everything clicked. Gabrielle was a beautiful girl, but a little too predictable, which makes her character slightly flat, the same with Bryce Lyndley. The book is just okay, nothing great.

I primarily bought the product because I was interested in the Parental Controls (web site filtering). It works but it made me feel like 15 years ago when I was on a 486 with a dial up modem. Looking at Task Manager in XP I saw that the internet filtering application had sucked up 86 MB of RAM and a good percentage of the CPU time. Maybe if you have a 2-3 GHz machine and 512 MB of RAM it would run better.My solution was to disable everything and do a manual virus scan once in a while.

A support call to Symantec costs more than an upgrade and they don't support anything prior to their 2003 application, so I upgraded. Now I find that if you use Outlook with more than one profile, Norton's Antispam will crash it every time you switch profiles (i.e. users). Apparently, they've known about this since 2002, but, unlike other software companies that had similar bugs (e.g. Groove), Norton has not provided a fix.

Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago. I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.

I was considering the purchase of their latest version. Then, about one month before the live update subscription expired, I was and still am, harrassed with nag screens to renew my subscription.After several attempts to contact their technical support I was able to leave a message. I asked them to please tell me how to remove the NAG SCREENS, and their reply was YOU CAN'T !! This answer plus the negative reviews that I've read, have prompted me to not purchase their products and write this review.This review is written to warn you to be aware of their NAG SCREEN PRACTICE to either renew your subcription or remove the program completely from your computer. I can't believe that Symantec could be so inconsiderate, but thats the case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay with the 2003 version","review":"Having happily used Norton Internet Security 2003 for 1 year I needed to subscribe for 1 more year to get the virus definitions or upgrade to 2004. I decided to upgrade to 2004 Pro but now regret this decision. On my 500MHz machine running XP I continously get a Virtual Memory error and the machine is almost unuseable. On my 1.6GHz Centrino Laptop it's worked fine for 1 week but today XP returned a 'Serious Fatal Error' for the firt time in 5 months since buying it. I've wasted 3 days trying to get this product working with my older machine and have now admitted defeat. I've also lost confidence in the installation on my newer machine. My recommendation is to stay with the 2003 version until Symantec stabilise this product and the reviews start to get better.

And so is their customer service.","review":"I actually give it zero stars.I thankfully took heed and read the other reviews of this program, and I opted for the \\"try it before you buy it\\" download. I would have been irate if I had spent the money on this software, it is the biggest piece of crap I have ever used.I am computer savy and yet I couldn't even figure out the installation problems that kept cropping up. And as others have mentioned Symantec's \\"golden wrench\\" for everything is to \\"uninstall the software then reinstall\\". I did this twice and still have same issues. So I contacted customer service and ....this was just rich.....they said they \\"can't help me because I have a try it before you buy it version!!

Up until the 2003 upgrade we have never had any problems with Norton AV. I can't say that anymore. I upgraded to 2004 a few weeks ago and upon booting Windows is complaining about missing Symantec DLLs. Tried sending a note to Support. It has been 3 weeks and no response. There is no support for the product unless you are willing to spend for support more than what the product costs. I am not.I went back to Internet Security 2003 and plan to stay at that level.My suggestion is that you stay with the older versions of Norton and just subscribe to the virus updates.Henry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebuttal of Norton support agent","review":"After reading the review of the Norton support agent, I felt that I needed to expand my review. I work in an operations lab for a Fortune 500 Co. We spend millions of $ for NAV. In addition, I have installed Symantec products on every server in my lab over the last 3 years. Hence, I felt comfortable purchasing a Symantec product. NIS 2004 is a flawed software. Some isp's help consumers by blocking communication on various unused or unusual ports. NIS uses an unusual port for activation. My personal computer runs an ad/spyware scanner & a registry cleaner on a weekly basis. Until recently, I've used older versions of NAV to keep my machine free of viruses. I run Ethereal network protocol analyzer every month, because checking the activity of various network protocols floats my boat. With all my experience, I was unable to activate my product. What chance does a normal user have of using this product? Cost is immaterial. Buy something from Amazon that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activation Problems","review":"I was unable to activate the 2004 version of NIS at home. If your broadband ISP (in my case, comcast) uses any type of firewall (ie. for packet filtering and/or port monitoring), please save yourself at least a weeks worth of troubleshooting. Currently, the only way I can activate this product is by phone. My last three computers have not had modems and my cell phone acts as my only phone connection. In addition, Symantec only provides \\"award-winning support\\" if you pay $30 a pop for live support. This is a documented problem. http://service.symantec.com/pcfix"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","review":"I never take the trouble to write online reviews, but after trying this software I feel compelled to. I've been a long time user of symantec software; last year I bought NIS 2003 which gave a (probably false) sense of security after several attacks to my server. And now I made the mistake of paying money for the upgrade. Ang guess what: IT DOESN'T WORK. I don't know what's wrong, but the problem is that the online support at symantec also don't have a clue. Doing research on the web I found that I was not alone, it's not my fault, this product is flawed.

I used it for a few months till my computer crashed (I believe it was related to using NIS Productivity function, although I am not very sure.) Since then, it has been a total nightmare! I followed every recommendations on their support site to uninstall and reinstall. None of them worked. It has been more than one month and 20+ wasted hours, it is still not working. I read a piece of review on Consumer Report the other day. It turned out that Norton knew this kind of problem at least 2 years ago.

Were we ever wrong.The software would appear to install fine, but then NIS would not run, and simply trying to run it caused system resources to plummet so fast that sometimes we couldn't even shut down the computer from the start menu because the shutdown process didn't have enough memory to run (we had to turn off the power to shut it down).Norton's tech support had no internal communications -- successive techs would instruct us to do the same things, apparently not even reading our case records. Two even told us to try things we'd just said didn't work.The only plus to the experience was that we had no trouble getting our money back (we ordered direct from Symantec, though, not through Amazon). We installed McAfee Internet Security Suite instead (which has many problems of its own, but at least it runs and doesn't crash the computer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfaction","review":"To all of you who had problems installing NIS 2004 I say.... \\"What?\\"Mine installed with no problems (and I am a microbiologist, not a computer guy). If you're having installation problems, then I would say user error is involved. Not only has it caught and delt with many viruses, it has helped me catch many hackers (probably ametures) trying to hack my computer. This product allows you to track down that person's IP address so you may report it to their ISP. I have done this several times. As far as spam, I don't get any. I don't know if it is because I disabled my MSN Passport (the source of much spam) or if the NIS is working. You guys running older and slower computers probably do not want this software.

It is up and (I hope) running - at least NIS says it's running.I bought a second copy of NIS for the second machine. The install on the second machine played out every problem listed here. Man, what a lousy install - you'd think Symantec would have cobbled together a patch product by now. I went back to Personal Firewall 2003 with updates ($15), and bought McAfee antivirus. So far, that combo is working fine.I would not buy NIS 2004.

Bad idea. My new computer which clocks at twice the rate of my old system is SLOWER than my old system when using Norton 2004. Also, I despise software activation.

The trouble came when I used it. A few days after installing, a hijacker got in through the security, and I lost all ability to use my browser. According to the reports, some viruses were quarantined, which causes my other virus check to keep telling about it. As others noted, tech help is really non-existent unless you want to pay for it, and help does not come cheap.If you use a dial-up Internet service, this program will bring your movement to a crawl.

Worse, Symantec basically FORCED me to convert from NIS 2002 (which I was delighted with) to NIS 2004 in early January (See the review by Roperwin dated 1-24-04 for details. What happened to him happened to me).Rather than repeating what has already been said, I'll just recommend that you keep reading the reviews here and on CNET.com and BELIEVE THEM.It will take me days to get my computer back to normal after uninstalling NIS 2004.

Researching the Internet revealed that this has been an issue since early 2003, regardless of how \\"clean\\" or fast ones computer is. The primary association with the error has been Norton Anti-Spam or Internet Security and MS Outlook 2000, 2002, or 2003. We should all accept by now that computers are complex, and software is often released prematurely, with multiple service releases to fix bugs as they are discovered. I do have a problem however, with the attitude of the Norton Support Technician, or those in support at any other software company. Why should we consumers have to wait two years for obvious conflicts to be resolved? We spent good money on this product, and although it works OK with our faster computer, we're annoyed by the conflict with Outlook and expect to see a patch that will fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly designed product","review":"It took me a day to install this product.

I have spent hours installing, uninstalling, following their online support error codes, etc. all to no avail.

OK - this is involved but doable, I'm mildly annoyed. 7 hours later, after following the confusing instructions, it FAILED again. And oh by the way - THEY WANT $30 FOR PHONE SUPPORT.

This program grabbed all system resources and would cause a system resource error within 10 minutes of startup each and every time. I followed their generally useless 'support' advice ; uninstalled/reinstalled many times and did everything I could to free up system resources all to no avail. Finally I left NIS 2004 uninstalled. My computer instantly began to function normally EXCEPT that i cannot go back and put NIS 2002 back on. NIS 2002 did work fine (it was the anti-spam that lured me to 2004), but absolutely will not work on a machine polluted by NIS 2004. I've tried cleaning the registry, but no luck.

But NIS keeps saying I am not. Now, the same error happens on my Dell pc. I am very upset. Now, it's like I can't remove NIS and can't login. Plus, NIS makes my computers very slow.

It wasn't that easy to install, menus where not very helpful, baffling to set up and it make the computer run real slow. On top of all that, it made I.E. even slower.

The reader feels as if s/he is actually there because the characters are drawn so vividly.

Diana L. Paxson who collaberated with Bradley on one of the Avalon books, decided to take on the prequal and link Bradley's Avalon series with Bradley's Atlantis novel. She should have left both alone.Paxson cannot write. I would go as far as to call her work drivvel. It was terrible. The chacters were unsympathetic and hollow. They contained no substance whatsoever and as a reader I could not connect with them. Their speech was all wrong as well. Paxson had the characters swearing and using modern day slang!

I understand that Ms. Bradley was planning on making a book that connect 'Fall of Atlantis' to 'Mists of Avalon' and all those books, but she sadly left us, and Ms. Paxson should have left the series alone instead of tainting it.

Still, one can't fail to read the recollections and opinions of someone like Bearden who was involved with so much. The first 40-50% of the book (and it's a big book!) is hard to follow because it skips around among different persons and places; it's hard to keep them straight, especially the Russians. When the narrative comes back to someone mentioned previously, it's often hard to remember who they are. After that, as it moves into the recent decade--fall of the Iron Curtain--readers will be fascinated to read of the inside look at things still fresh in their own memory.

We have seen this story before in many spy movies. There is little substance and a lot of editorializing (which I thought was a bit heavy on the US side). At one point the author tells us the CIA boss was so wonderful even the KGB studied him for his professionalism.

Up until recently, this music was something that you could only hear at the patron saint celebrations of remote villages of Peru and Bolivia and that sort of place. I'm sure that many people have never heard Andean music in this form, played with such delicacy and feeling. I am so pleased that this beautiful genre is being preserved and spread for people to enjoy. This CD is sure hit a cord with anyone who has the sightless familiarity or inclination for the music of South America."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing experience","review":"Zamalloa has combed the Peruvian Andes long and hard to find these pieces. The results are extraordinary. Here is a cross-section of the many kinds of Andean music, played with refinement and a tremendous sense of musicality. Most Andean Peruvian music recordings tend to stay within a very narrow range. This CD is the exact opposite. All the pieces, however, manage to produce a wonderful mosaic, as pleasing to the ear as it is instructive. What an amazing gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have u seen worse? No possible way","review":"I have never been so disappointed in wasting a part of my life to sit down and watch this smelly piece of waste. This is a disgrace to the art of moviemaking. The cast was poorly chosen, the script may as well been written by a two year old, and the all around content of this movie is the worst I've seen, and I've seen quite a few. I wish I could give it no stars, but sadly, that's not possible. The only way to make a worse movie is to make a sequel. You know the rep for sequels; they always are so much worse than the original. If you make a sequel, put it under comedy, so we could laugh at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the reviews, pass on this one. YUCK!","review":"I want to thank the prior reviews for saving me words. This movie is not worth the time, or waste of time I should say. There are many good family films out there competing for your time, so keep moving when you see this title. Yes, the acting is not great, nor the overacting. Movies like this make me question why some directors bother with them, and further, put it on DVD when many good movies have not been released on DVD. I try to give every film a chance to redeem itself, even if it takes a little longer than I expect. But this one had me hitting the stop button and reaching for another DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Nelly is just plain awesome. I thought it would just be the typical remix album.

It covers the general field very well and deserves its' standing as the definitive text on EMC. It does not cover some aspects of design as well as specialist texts but gives enough of a background to get a reader moving in the right direction. If you are new to EMC or want a background to what all the fuss is about, this is the best starting point you can have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy english, easy to understand and to put in practic","review":"This book take a complete coverage on the EMC subjetc. All topics are well covered as test, regulations, design and troubleshooting. Even if you are not an EMC test enginer I highly recommend to learn something about this task, because some of the non compliance issues, really are setup and test not well done. The EMC test is not as easy to start a program in the PC and create reports, by the contrary there is a lot of science to know what we really are doing, and few EMC test engineers are prepared to do this. The book is 100 per 100 profitable, it has the honor to be next to my prefered ones.Just find a problem, I am 55 years old, the characters are too small and I can hardly read.

This is the latest offering, a 17 song album of acoustic classics (well some of them). I found this album very clean and the sound is very crisp. You can actually hear every note on the guitars. Some songs sound alot different than the originals (Like \\"In A Big Country\\", which has a country music influence) and the bongo drums make a big difference to a few of them. My favourites on the album are \\"You Dreamer\\", \\"I'm not Ashamed\\" to name a few. Stuart Adamson's vocals shine throughout the album. If your a Big Country fan then you should not go without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most played Big Country album","review":"I am a die-hard Big Country fan and I own all of their studio albums, most of the Rarities albums, a slew of live albums, and I am always on the lookout for more. Out of my entire collection though, this is the album I keep coming back to and listening to over and over.First of all, it is a great compilation of some of their best songs, and secondly it is all acoustic. Hearing these wonderful songs that I know inside and out in an acoustic format gives each song new life and impact. It really highlights the \\"musicianship\\" of the band as well - each member is so talented and capable and play a variety of instruments. As much as I like the \\"wall of sound\\" Big Country can produce, hearing every bongo and string makes it much more exquisite.I highly recommend this album for big fans of Big Country. The music is awesome enough to entice casual listeners and non-fans but it really makes for a unique and deep offering for the real BC fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"This is more like an advertisment to get you to sign up with an online poker site than teaching you how to play...

He was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" I love the description of Poirot. This is the start of one of the best sets of mysteries ever made - the first appearance of the celebrated Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.Poirot is interesting for many reasons, one of the first that he was a famous detective as a member of the Belgian police force. Due to WW I, Poirot has to move to England as a refugee, and remains. It's also the first appearance of Capt. Hastings, the sometimes narrator of the stories.Wonderful characters, great story. Easy 5 stars.This is the free Kindle version. A must get if you like mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Kindle Edition","review":"This review applies only to the Kindle edition.There are illustrations which are essential to the plot and referenced in the text. They are missing from this edition. I had to find another copy in order to finish the book. Very disappointed in the lack of quality in this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poirot's Delightful Debut","review":"This is Poirot's first case and Christie's debut as a mystery writer. It is an auspicious start to a brilliant career for both the author and her creation. It's a bit over-ambitious; the young Christie was heavy-handed with the clues in this one, and while the ending is a surprise, the last section of the book is just a bit too long for the ending to have quite the impact that Christie would achieve in later works. This is perhaps the only Christie book about which one can say there are \\"too many clues;\\" it is nonetheless an astounding achievement for a first-time author. And, of course, any fan of Poirot will want to read the case that \\"started it all.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The first in a long successful career","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was not only the first Hercule Poirot book, but also the first book of Agatha Christie's career. Poirot arrives as a a refugee fleeing from the overthrow of his country during World War I. Doing so he arrives at Styles manor where he meets up with a few people he has met and would become a great part of his career in books, Arthur Hastings and Inspector Japp. While the story relies as much on method as motive and psychology (later psychology would play a larger part in solving a murder than clues...the Sherlock Holmes approach), it is still an excellent read. For any Poirot fans or those that think they may like mysteries, the Mysterious Affair at Styles is one for the bookshelf. As far as the book itself goes, the print is larger than some paperback editions and the pages are larger, making it easier to hold with one hand or set down on a table. It doesn't take as much effort to keep it completely open for reading near the spine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing debut for Christie and Poirot!","review":"For anyone just starting to read mystery novels and particularly anyone who is new to Agatha Christie, I would highly recommend starting with this, the first Poirot mystery. Poirot has recently come to England as a WW1 war refugee. Shortly after his arrival, he encounters an old friend Captain Hastings, who serves as the perfect Watson to Poirot's Holmes. An old lady who had been of great help to Poirot is murdered and he feels an obligation to find her killer. A simple premise but Christie builds a wonderfully complex mystery upon it, with multiple suspects, several red herrings and a lot of atmosphere. The ending is a genuine shocker and the mystery is nicely interposed with comedic moments due to Captain Hastings' various observations about life and love, most of which show his intelligence to be decidedly inferior to that of his little Belgian friend! Definitely do not miss - you will thoroughly enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy and Tuppence","review":"The Tommy and Tuppence series seem to me to be among the best of Agatha Christie's works, at least partly because of their freshness. Christie's later works are better in some ways because she hit her stride later on, but for a place to start reading, I'll take the Tommy and Tuppence books every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good read","review":"liked it in general, but not one of my favourite books. Poirot is very different from Sherlock Holmes. Kept me guessing till the last chapter. The quaint charm of English aristocracy was also refreshing to imagine.

The only problem? Strychnine is extremly fast acting, and the woman drank her coffee more than three hours earlier. So thus, Hercule Poirot, the eccentric Belgian detective with little grey cells is on the case. Christie's first novel is good, although definitly not her best. It still has some serious flair, and the late Dame knew how to pull the wool over her reader's eyes. The dialouge has a few flaws, as does locations and enviroment, but the plot is air tight. Fun and fast, this is a prime example of Agatha Christie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not \\"complete\\"","review":"These are great editions of Agatha Christie's books, but it is far from complete. There are about 80 titles in the entire collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will recommend","review":"My sister in law loves Christie...so I thought I'd try one out.

I enjoyed the book and will definitely read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"reading","review":"I enjoy these type of mystery books. Holds your attention the whole way through. Unable to determine who the culprit is until the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, as expected.","review":"I am not sure if I downloaded this or another Kindle edition, but my version was missing a few maps/plans and reproductions of letters. However, I am not sure if it had any bearing on my ability to identify the murder - I got the right answer, but it was more an instinctive guess than a logical deduction. My little grey cells are obviously not up to the standard of Poirot (although they are arguably no worse than those of the narrator Hastings). This book is quite literally vintage Agatha Christie - her first published novel ever - so if you have read any of her other books, but somehow missed this one, then you will know exactly what you can expect - a limited number of possible suspects, each of whom could be the villain until you assemble the clues and dismiss a few red herrings. Christie defined the genre, and this book defined Christie. What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Way to Start the Summer","review":"Agatha Christie's first Hercule Poirot mystery is the ever-delightful The Mysterious Affair at Styles. All of her trademarks are right here from the beginning in the character of Poirot and his brilliant gray matter and the delightful Hastings (before he become completely stuffy, as in the later books). There are red herrings aplenty and everyone seems to be up to something suspicious, much like one would want from an English country house. I have taken a summer vow to re-read all of the Poirot books that I read over the past four decades but this time to read them in the order they were written. The sole advantage of memory loss may be the ability to read these books again without a clue as to who did it. Maybe growing older will not be so bad. This book makes a perfect start to the series and to my summer.

The good news is that it's free - but still, I am going to buy a different version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her Best","review":"I hate to say anything disrespectful about the greatest mystery writer of all time, but to be quite honest, I found this book as somewhat of a let down. The first two I read, Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, absolutely blew me a way. The mysterious affair at styles was nothing less than frustrating to read. All of the characters seem tainted and by the end of the novel, I didn't care who killed her as long as he/she suffered greatly. The plot was heavy and slow and the case was not only unsolvable from a reader's stand point, but a bit lagging and dull. I hate to be so cruel, but that's my honest opinion! I am glad that so many others have such nice things to say about the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!

It contains drawings of floor plans, will fragments, etc that are relevant to the story. This version does NOT include these. So I'm sort of lost a few chapters into the book. You would be better off getting the paperback rather than the electronic version. I have asked for my money back or an exchange for a version that does have the drawings. I'm not optimistic about either happening. I really kind of surprised that Amazon would overlook this sort of thing. Very disappointed with my purchase at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best- but pay attention!","review":"This is Christie's first book, and certainly one of her best! However, there are a LOT of characters to remember (Poiret, Alfred, etc.), so I would recommend the book to a friend who's alert, knows how to pay attention, and is open minded (you'll see what I mean). An excellent Christie, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fresh on a re-read","review":"Good book - Poirot's first.Clues are all in the open for the reader to see, yet it is a difficult solution to crack.

Literally, images of clues (scribbles on paper, bits of burned documents, maps of the house) that should appear in the reading are absent. Some do not affect the storyline but others make it impossible to follow the conclusions of the characters because the reader is missing vital information. Aside from that, the pages look like simple bare internet printouts. If one cares little for aesthetics in his/her reading experience, this should not pose a problem. For others (myself included) it is a deterent to a truly enjoyable read. I suggest anyone seeking an inexpensive version of this book to choose the Barnes and Noble publication. Also inexpensive, but featuring all the bells and whistles of which Hercule Poirot himself would approve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"H. Poirot is such an iconic character.

But this novel, which was a best seller in Europe when it came out in German in 1987, has almost nothing but stereotypes. There's the boss controlled by the female underling who really seems incapable of true affection. They both seem to have a mental illness or at least emotional problems. She's cold and wears lots of leather and boots; so are all her female friends, even the lesbians who are still attracted to the main male character. And finally, and most disappointing, there's the death or faked death of one of the characters.

I made it to chapter 16 of this book. That was how long it took to get to the main character's story. I lost interest in the story because she took so long in getting to it.On top of that, there was far more sex than romance. Most of it was in very poor taste and I didnt like it at all. I would not recommend this book. It is certainly not one of her better works. I would recommend A year and a Day. That book is fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Way too long, not much romance","review":"Disappointed! This book is way too long. Very hard to get through, had to skip a a lot of nonsense. I thought this book was going to be a wonderful romance. It wasn't, the sex over shadowed the romance! It's frustrating when you're looking forwarded to reading a Historical Romance and it turns out to be a rough sex book with offensive, coarse, language throughout.The scene where the Hero can't stay away from the Heroine any longer (and had to have her) did however, make sense to me because she gave him the impression that she was experienced and she wanted it. When he realized she had been a virgin, it was touching that he tried to soothe her other than that, we didn't need the graphic details of his earlier escapades with other women. I also agree with another reviewer that it took WAY TO LONG (Chapter 16) to get to the main characters story. The first 15 chapters could have been written in 3 - 4 chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language too vulgar","review":"This is the first and last book I will read from this author.

It smells funky coming out of the bottle, but mixes with water to make a very nice scent. It leaves her hair silky and clean and her scalp has cleared up also. My tweenager also uses this and we have seen a decrease in the pre-pimples on her face : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Scent...","review":"I highly recommend this product.

The soap is very mild but still produces a thick lather, which can double as a bubble bath for toddlers. It also has a mild scent. Most importantly, it is not drying to delicate skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not the Greatest","review":"We like this soap for our infant and toddler but I am not sold on the fact that it is gentaler on their skin than the regular babysoaps.

Last night when I first used it, both of them screamed when it got to their eyes!! It is not tearless at all! Also, the scent is not good, smells of \\"old lady\\" soap. I hope at least it doesn't dry up my little ones' sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' Li'l Goat's Milk","review":"We've been using this product for about a month now, and are happy with the way it's making our son's skin feel.

He has sensitive skin, and so far he has no dry patches with this new soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Like Singing in a Choir","review":"If you have ever sung in a church choir or have any desire to do so, this movie is a must. It presents a very clear picture of what a choir director goes thru to get the results he is hired to produce. Feelings may be hurt, but the choir is no place for those who can merely \\"carry a tune.\\" The tune carrier must at least know what line he is supposed to be singing from and be able to carry one of four parts. The movie is wonderful for any time of year, and the snow has little to do with the story. It is entertaining, poignant, and a rewarding watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum Yawn","review":"DVD box says a divorced woman has a clash with the choirmaster; never happened.Very little energy expended by the cast, with the except of one verbal outburst (poorly played) by a female musical snob who left the choir.Nice little movie if you need something to put you gently to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas Without Snow","review":"The quality of this film is just awful.

The only huge thing I really had a problem with was the VERY BAD SOUND AND VIDEO. One of the main problems I had with this film is that about half of the characters are really annoying such as : Murial Moore she has the most annoying laugh. (Off the subject) am I the only one who thinks that Murial(I have no idea how to spell her name) cannot read.?Another gem of a character is the Dane guy who tries to force himself on the main character Zoe I think her name is? This movie should of been called \\"A Christmas with people who remind you of your annoying relatives.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD quality not great","review":"I would love to see a decent copy of this movie. The Westlake Entertainment DVD has poor color (lots of greens), and this version by Synergy Entertainment is not much better. There are also some glitches from the mastering process.

He inspires excellence in music in stead of academics. He teaches the true meaning of the word \\"amateur.\\" The video tape as well as the DVD are not steller reproductions of the original film. It needs to be remastered again for DVD, but the movie itself is outstanding. It has the great music of Handel from Messiah, humor, real life situations for those who direct church choirs - the primadona soprano, the loving but tonedeaf alto and the tenor who challenges your patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"A real stretch of the imigination to think this was a Chirstmas movie, very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing movie","review":"I got the impression that someone who hates Christmas wrote this movie. It has none of the qualities that make a good Christmas movie. love, 'feel-good'emotion, snow, a loveable character, and so on.

Worst I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Merry Christmas Movie","review":"IN SHORT, THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY STUNK. WASTE OF TALENT OF MICHAEL LEARNED AND JOHN HOUSMAN WAS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS IN THIS STUPID ROLE.

HERE IS A DVD FOR THE YARD SALE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper","review":"As several have already commented, the print quality leaves much to be desired. That aside, this is not a \\"warm fuzzy\\" type of Christmas movie. It is a rather bleak look at the holiday, though it may be interesting to you if you have ever sung in an amatuer choir. In spite of the valiant efforts of the big name actors, this left me feeling rather empty and that is not how I like to spend my holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much horror to see...","review":"INUGAMI shouldn't even be in this collection.

I now know that he was referring to young Marie, but only found out for sure within this past month. Because of these online reviews and the fact that some had left their e-mail addresses for contact, a group of us formed a bit of a \\"fan club,\\" have been together on a Yahoo site since Oct. 29, 1999, and now have a membership of over 600! It is there that we have discovered a variety of information and have become friends as well.

It is a wonderful story of Karen and her family, back in the '40's when correct diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy was almost unheard of. Someone posted in the review section regarding Marie and Jimmy Killilea getting divorced over 20 years ago. Well, I did a bit of research of my own and found Marie and Jimmy's death records online. Marie died in October of 1991, Jimmy in July of 1994. It says his marital status at time of death is \\"Widower\\" (she died before he did). Under 'Name of Spouse' it says \\"Marie Killilea\\". Also, I checked out the updated Forward to my 1993 edition of \\"Karen\\", and Marie mentions going to the Bronx Zoo with Jimmy and their grandson Jason, in 1981. I have no idea why someone would say they were divorced; perhaps Pat O'Brien was confused at the time. Best to check resources carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that will leave an imprint on your soul.","review":"I first read Karen in junior high school and the story of her struggles and victories, the deep love and spirituality of her family, and the fun they had together as they lived life to its fullest have remained with me to this day. Their story helped influence many of my values as I developed into a young adult and still now as I struggle to parent my children in this world. Perseverance, hope, community helping those in need, sacrifice, unconditional love; these are just a few of the lessons I learned from the wonderfully written telling of their story. I wanted to order the book and its sequel for my daughter who is now in junior high and am saddened to learn they are out of print. The experience of the Killilea family is universal and very important to tell in order to share these values that will serve our society well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book on CP and on families","review":"I first read this book as a child and have reread it every year. One year, as I read, I realized my five month old daughter had cerebral palsy. The book was a great source of comfort and advice. Written in the 1940s, it tells of a time when mopst of these children were forgotten in institutions and thought to have no IQ. Karen's family not only kept her, but they raised her to be an intelligent and successful human being-a miracle for the time. I pick up every copy I find in thrift stores and give them to parents.

Too often now days things come so easy to some and they don't see the challenge or the blessing of being able to just live. I believe it would be a good motivational book for all children, expecially those with disabilities. My daughter has ADD and daily has to struggle.

Mrs. Killillea is a gifted woman in so many ways, as are all the members of her brood, including her precious husband, Jimmy. I wish I knew how and where everyone is today!I learned about many things besides disabilities from these books.

I watched 'The World at war' in the past, and I think this is a good complement to it. The interviews and historic films are highly informative and valuable. The TV series also refers to the Katyn massacre, an appalling event the former Soviet Union acknowledged responsibility of only in the recent past.

Its price is also very affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone in the West Should Watch This","review":"I did purchase this from Amazon, but have not received it yet, however I have seen it before.Many in the west, mostly Americans I suppose don't understand how much the Russian people went through in World War II and how millions of Russian civilians and soldiers died.

If you are not familiar about Russia in WWll then this will open your eyes. They defeated Nazi Germany, not the U.S. Russia suffered more than any other country losing 27 to 30 Million people during the war. To put in perspective, America lost 300,000. You need to view in order to see how great life in America is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating Images, Simplistic History","review":"My mind and imagination were captivated by the film footage. That alone makes the documentary worth viewing.There are several inaccuracies of fact, ones that should have been easy to capture as they require no specialist knowledge.The main problem I have with the film is the inordinate amount of time spent on various crimes & ills of Stalin.Not that this information about Josef Stalin isn't interesting, a-lot of it doesn't seem very relevant.And the film sheds no light on Stalin or his crimes. According to the narrative tens of millions were murdered by Stalin because he was paranoid, megalomaniac, addicted to power, etc. No time is spent at all on Stalin's ideology. It would sound pretty ridiculous if someone argued that \\"Hitler\\" killed so many Jews because he had a thirst for power or he liked violence.Lots of problems with the narrative, but the series can't help but to make emotional impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russia's two wars.","review":"This very fine PBS broadcast details Stalin's War against the Russian People and the German War against the Soviet Union. It seeks to detail these two wars and how it combined cost the Soviet Union 45 million people. Why does it matter? Because in today's world, the Germans are scorned for what they did to the world, but very little is said about what Stalin did to the peoples of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. That is why it matters and why this film series shows Stalin and his henchman for what they really were. This film is not for the weak of heart, as it shows some very disturbing scenes and talks about some very revolting subjects. I watched in amazement as people gloated over a person being hanged.This is a true horror film starring Stalin and Hitler. It shows mans inhumanity to man. This is very much worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This series is a fascinating and grim look at the sufferings of the Soviet Union during the Stalin period. It has interesting interviews with persons who survived, good historical analysis and a great many film clips from the Stalin years which, I would guess, have rarely been seen before in the West. I also was very impressed with the musical score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalin!","review":"Outstanding mini-series about Stalin's rule concentrating on the Great Patriotic War (WWII). Too deep for the general public and could be deeper for the hard core, but overall quite good emphasis. Concentrates mainly on the human drama not military strategy. It is more of a documentary than a movie, but focuses well on the Russian soul and how Stalin abused his people - not a recitation of casualties. Music which introduces each episode is excellent. Many interviews after 1990 with people who are very anti-Stalin and were present in the 1940s. Some were victims of Stalin but survived. Picture and sound quality are fine with allowances made for 1940s newsreels. Well woth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars is not enough","review":"this is one of my ALLTIME favorite CD's. I've had it for years and have NEVER gotten tired of it. The arrangements, the songs, the performances are all spectacular. I don't care what kind of music you like, you will DEFINITELY enjoy this one. It is flawless. So that being said, this is undoubtably Hugo's best album. Forget about the spaghetti western stuff, this is better. The only complaint is the length of the recording, just over 30 minutes. But nevertheless........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a warm blanket!","review":"Reading this book is like cozying up with a warm blanket. The authors provide so much detail that you feel like YOUR grandmother is sitting in front of you, recounting the tales.

So when I saw Shanghai Knights on DVD I just had to buy it. I should have rented.Sure there are creative fight scenes and Owen delivers some great lines, but the whole story feels forced and comedic timing feels rushed. The previews look like a comic masterpiece, critics praise it, but my family all voted thumbs down.Shanghai Knights now collects dust on our DVD shelf while Shanghai Noon garners the screen time. When it comes to the Shanghai series, be a cowboy, not a knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Shanghai Noon 2\\"","review":"Wowzer! My family laughed so hard after they saw this movie. It is splendid fun for everybody and their pets! Yes! Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) are back! They have reunited and have traveled to London to find the Imperial Seal of China stolen by a bad, nasty man (some English dude). \\"Shanghai Knights\\" is a good sequel, but it doesn't have Lucy Liu... I was heartbroken. I went on a fast food eating spree because I was so distraught! Anguish! Oh well, good movie otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I left the theater so underwhelmed and disappointed, having been a fan of Jackie Chan's and Owen Wilson's first movie together. What a contrast of good and bad. The acting was less than convincing (totally unnatural) and made the film look like a \\"pot luck\\" failure. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, who normally play off each other quite well, acted as though they read their lines for the first time before each scene was shot, and relied on their \\"talent\\" (which was none in this movie) to carry them through. This leads one to ponder: What happened to the director; was he asleep at the switch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not as funny as Shanghai Noon","review":"It's not as funny as Shanghai Noon.

They are joined by Chon's sister, the beautiful and equally dangerous Lin (Fann Wong). The chemistry of Wilson and Chan is as delightful as ever, but that (and the beautiful and talented Wong) is about the only reason to watch this tired comedy. Even the action scenes are uninspired. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Have To Be A Fan","review":"I tried to give these two a second chance, but they flunked. You must be dedicated fans in order to enjoy this movie. I let the \\"two thumbs up\\" trick me into watching this movie. This only proves that critics are jokes. Jackie Chan can keep his wanna be Bruce Lee movies. The good movies with Owen Wilson are the good movies without Owen Wilson as the main character.Young Ones Remember: Critic with thumb up has two glass eyes.Me No Grasshopper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I have seen both, and both are very funny. Shanghai Noon has more action, but Shanghai Knights has all it needs. I personaly like the second better, it has more jokes, that actually make you laugh for a change. They have historical characters in the movie, as the other reviewers have said. They've even made a joke out of Jack the Ripper. I think that this movie is one of the greatest in comedies, so if you are a die-hard action only jackie chan person, I'd say go for Noon, but if you want comedy in it too, go for knights."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Shanghai Knights\\" not to good","review":"...

It's action packed, funny and has a great plotline and story to it. I've never seen the first, but this one is great. Chan's acting is still pretty similar to Rush Hour and his past performances, but I still like him. With Owen Wilson on his side and chans sister to help, these guys get in some crazy stuff and make the movie a blast. So trust me, if you've never watched Jackie Chan or you think he's nothing much, you'll love this movie. THIS MOVIE IS A DEFINENT BUYER!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of my life...Gone.","review":"\\"Shanghai Knights\\" is one of the most derivative and clichéd movies I have had the misfortune of seeing in a very long time. With a thin plot, awful dialog, lifeless attempts at comedy, and typical \\"buddy movie\\" hijinks, this movie has terrible written all over it. Oh, and Jackie Chan fights with a ladder...again.

Of course it could have been better....but come on, it could have been worse. I personally thought it was a great movie! It had humor, sword fights, fist fights, and great actors. Now, this movie made me a HUGE fan of Aidan Gillen-he's great as Lord Rathbone. Of course Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are spectacular too- as are the secondary characters. See this movie. It's a great movie!!(((the DVD extras are amazing: deleted scenes, audio commentary from the director and screen writers, a music video entitled \\"action overload\\" featuring all the fight scenes, and a \\"fight manual\\" with Jackie Chan and the director(David Dobkin)...all in all...the DVD is a great buy)))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie can do better","review":"2 stars is generous, but I have a place in my heart for Jackie Chan. We rented this recently, and it left us all cold. The only redeeming qualities to me were Jackie Chan (because I'm usually a fan) and his stunts. We only laughed a couple of times throughout the entire movie, and it was supposed to be a comedy. To me it wasn't even funny accidentally. It had a very predictable but not believeable plot. It had quite a bit more offensive language and innuendos than the first movie, Shanghai Noon, so I wouldn't consider it a family movie. There was absolutely nothing likeable or redeeming about Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) in this sequel -- he was just irritating. We rented it because the first movie was so funny and fun, but my family hardly laughed at all at this one. I'm just so glad we didn't actually pay to all go see at the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Don't waste your time or money renting or purchasing this movie. It's only very occasionally funny. It is, however, consistently irritating.

The worst Chan movie I've seen by quite some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"One lead too many makes for a dull movie.","review":"I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception. It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong. These two actors were great as a team. Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot. When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring. Why was he even cast in this film? This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again nor do I recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Chan movie I could imagine","review":"I am a huge Jackie Chan fan, but this movie was just bizarre and stupid. What a confusing mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This sequel to Shanghai Noon is perhaps one of Jackie Chan's worst movies. The story is a cliche--Jackie has to rescue his sister and avenge his father's death. The twist in this story is that he has to go to England to find the killer. Of couse we have to put up with a lot of bad jokes about English food and stereotypical English gentlemen. I particularly hated the performance of Owen Wilson. I simply can't understand why he keeps getting cast as a comedian. He's definitely not funny at all. To make it worse, the character he plays has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Even Jackie Can is not at his best in this one. The fight scenes aren't as fluid as some of his other recent performances. His age really shows in his fight scenes. If you're craving a recent Jackie Chan film, you should stick with the Rush Hour series. I give this two stars instead of one out of goodwill for Jackie Chan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use on Kindle","review":"It is a good thesaurus if this was in print form.

Virtually worthless because when it works it is extraordinarily effective. The rub is that is gets tiresome resetting this software every 24-48 hours. Additionally, the Norton Suite \\"Norton Internet Security\\" is an easy match and perhaps exceeds the AntiSpam junkware.

They must be happy to just make a fortune from their very expensive support line (the only way of contacting them!).You wont be able to get a refund from them either, even though their product is not fit for purpose.

If you are looking for one book to cover it all, provide insight, and suggest ways to make the sports experience positive, this is the book you need.

These claims that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, are taken from the Gnostic Gospels, which are purely heretical and totally without validity! As a Catholic, I was outraged to see in one of the reviews of this book, that a \\"supposed\\" Catholic priest has claimed that these false allegations are true. I say, supposed, because I cannot believe that a REAL priest would condone such blasphemies!This alleged priest says that Mary Magdalene was the First Lady of the Christian Community and the Model of the Church. Get real! Those titles apply to our Blessed Mother, Mary, the mother of Jesus, not Mary Magdalene! So much for his knowledge!The Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene!

Everyone agrees that Paul wrote his letters between 50 and 60 AD. But if the Pauline letters are authentic (and no one says they aren't), then Mary Magdelene could NOT have been married to Jesus. Steve Kellmeyer's \\"Fact and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code\\" (0971812861)uses precisely this argument to demolish the substance of Starbird's basic argument. The rest of Starbird's book is equally silly bunkum, destroyed by a few simple indisputable and undisputed facts. If you want to know the history, instead of the fantasy, abandon Starbird and start reading Kellmeyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak feminist theory","review":"The book is an exponent of Starbird's feminist theory. The reason the book has been well received is because the subject is taboo although not new. It is also a great source of revenues.Many other authors have presented the same idea in more eloquent terms. Her writing is one of fragmented thoughts put together and repetition of ideas.Despite the fact that the book begins very nicely it goes downhill after the first chapter. Those of us that have closely studied the makings of the Catholic Church find the book a weak proponent of a theory without actual support. Hence, the proof provided is weak, vague, and has no merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy","review":"One of the reviews refers to Starbird as a \\"preeminant theologian and New Testament scholar.\\" On what planet? I promise you not a single Theologian or New Testament scholar of any merit even knows who this woman is. Not because some evil church empire is suppressing the knowledge; rather, her work is fantasy. If you just read the Da Vinci Code and think this is some kind of scholarly backing and you've never read any real scholarship in the field then I sympathize with you for being duped.

It sounded intriguing to me, so I began a very long and exhaustive search for the truth. What I found was that the \\"truth\\" really isn't there. Lots of opinions over time are, however. These somehow get sanctified by time, and then quoted as evidence! In fact, maybe Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, maybe they weren't. . . there is no real way to know.

I am, however, a scientist and must know where any information is coming from for it to be of any use. I am assuming this book is not a fictional work.The first chapter is a \\"story\\" about some biblical-sounding folk \\"The Lost Bride\\". However, there is no reference, background, or anything given for the story itself. Who wrote it? When was it written? Is it from the Gnostic gospels? Did the author fabricate it? Where did it come from? I.e. - why should I care about this story???I put the book down and haven't picked it up since."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Woman With Th Alabaster Jar","review":"There are numerous works out now exploring the theme and person of Mary Magdalen. Unfortunately this is not one of the better ones. Unconvicing, surprisingly dull and sentimental. Too much goddess worship. A far better work is the one by Susan Hoskins. Mary was truly the disciple to the disciples and an example of the radical rediscovery of women in society, but the rest of this is tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"This work explores some fascinating ideas about the identity and role of Mary Magdalen.

Those well versed in theology might possibly have a different take."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Bird Ain't No Star","review":"Pretty poorly written, repetitive, confusing, seems slightly bootlegged and almost too contrived. The author is too deeply rooted in orthodox Christianity in order to even make a run for the alternative. I love the subject matter though - that's why I bought this book. I am slightly disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR SCHOLARSHIP, misses the obvious","review":"I cannot tell you just how many times this author misses the mark. But just the title alone should show you how poor the research is. The Luke 7:37 clearly says that the woman was from that town. That excludes the Magdalene. The same passage says the woman was a sinner. That excludes Mary of Bethany (sister of Martha and Lazarus). The Passage from Mark 14 is unnamed, if it was someone as important as either Mary of Bethany OR Mary Magdalene, it would have been mentioned. It goes on and on from there. This is clearly a book written to capitalize of Dan Brown's better researched, but brilliantly written fiction, the Da Vinci code.

The author has obviously done her research, but I sure wish she could have presented it better. I found parts of it very repetitive (where was the editor?). I found many of the \\"connections\\" to be very very speculative at best. (When someone takes words from one language, reverses the letters, and points to the similarity to a word in another language, I get very nervous.)

This book completes the picture. Clark was the steady, get-the-job-done, go-to guy, who complemented the mercurial Lewis. Where Lewis made only occasional journal entries, Clark is the principal source of our non-botanical/zoological information because he reliably performed the journaling function. The only criticism I would have of the book is the repeated drubbing of Clark as a slave holder and his perceived mistreatment of York. It seems that Foley feels he has to apologize for Clark, who lived in a different age with a very different view of slavery.

The speaker phone sucks. It is very difficult for anyone on the other end of the call to hear me.- The caller ID will NOT work with rechargeable AA batteries.- The speaker phone button is annoying. In order to answer a call with it, you have to press and hold the button for two seconds, then release it.

Though Rick's experiences of alcoholism are interesting and self-reflective, the weaved in literary criticism of Hawthorne's parable attenuate any emotional potential of the memoir. We can feel bad for Rick, but we better shut up quickly and think deeply about his examination of what the black veil means. Also, as one reviewer pointed out, Rick just seems wordy here. He actually writes sentences like, \\"i don't know how to describe this...\\" Well then don't!Ahh.... . the days of The Ice StormHowever, after reading the first chapter of this book (even the first page), you will think you are in for a treat.

Unfortunately, after I slogged through one-third of it, I paged through the rest trying to find something to restore my initial enthusiasm, but without success.

If there is a lesson, it is probably that depressed people are depressingly uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"remakes the memoir","review":"The \\"digressions\\" part of the subtitle primarily refers to the fact that this is not only a memoir but also a sort of family genealogy, or an attempt at one. Moody finds that he may be the descendant of a Reverend Moody who was fictionalized as the title character of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Minister's Black Veil.\\" Digging through obscure histories and travelling about New England in an attempt to find out more about the man behind Hawthorne's self-loathing minister, Moody creates a sense of very powerful parallels to his own struggles with severe depression and drugs.

The dialogue is not as horrid as the later sequells either but is kind of well developed. I love tackleberry the Vietnam craze and all the other steroetypical charachters in this movie. I also love the blue eyester bar scene. The rest of the movie is filled with typical 80's stereotypical view of society which was normal at the time.

Wong Fei Hung, Clubfoot and crew jump around performing martial arts and then shooting people dead. It makes no sense whatsoever and is totally out of character for Fei Hung who, in one scene, shoots a woman in the eye and kills her. Then there's the fact that the movie drags on and on with TERRIBLE comedy scenes that make you wish someone would shoot you in the eye and end the misery.

As emphasised by other reviewers here, firearms are fairly prevelant in this episode; although they complement rather than overshadow the martial-arts action. Personally, to see WFH dodging bullets while kicking heads made for lively viewing in my opinion.Man Cheuk Chui plays Wong Fei-Hung pretty well, but in the acting/charisma stakes, he's obviously no Jet Li. Where he does shine is in the well choreographed action scenes. Spinning and kicking for all his worth, here he does give Jet a run for his money! In fact all of Wong's sidekicks are given space to show off their martial moves, with Clubfoot in particular displaying some powerful kicking.In conclusion, while it doesn't reach the epic heights of the earlier Jet Li chapters, OUATIC 5 is a well-paced kung-fu movie that provides action, comedy and drama in equal measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The OUATIC saga hit rock bottom with this fiasco.

The story looked like the writers had a little too much to drink when they were developing the plot for this weak entry...what a shame...this series deserves better...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara, we will miss you.","review":"Barbara Olsen's last book documents in detail the excesses and avarice of the Clinton's final days in office. In her usual pithy and clear-sighted way Barbara sums up the Clinton years and exposes their desire for control and power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score one for the Clinton haters.","review":"This was a very eye opening book. I always knew that the Clintons were self serving, arrogant politicians. It amazes me how the Clinton supporters just write off everything as a \\"right-wing consipiracy\\". If you ever notice, they never have an answer for anything. No answer for \\"Travelgate\\", \\"Filegate\\", Vince Foster, Whitewater, Rose Law Firm, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Jennifer Flowers, the China connection, Marc Rich, on and on and on. Well, Barbara Olsen does have some answers. She reveals the true nature of the Clintons. The Marc Rich pardon is the most fascinating section. It proves, completely, that Bill Clinton had no respect for law, morallity, the presidency or the American people. It's very interesting reading, but it will make you angry. Unless, of course, you are a liberal Clinton supporter. At wich point you will cry \\"right-wing\\" consipiracy and insert your head back into the sand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Partisan Definitely...........Genuine absolutely","review":"I found Barbara Olson book quite unimpeachable. Though most of her research is nothing of earth shattering headlines it is easy to believe Bill and Hillary Clinton did spend their final hours trying to sabotage the incoming administration. Unfortunately this might be the Clinton's legacy.Not for those who are compulsively obsessed with the Florida recount. Most people will enjoy it as it reinforces their sentiments about the Clintons a year after they have left the Whitehouse.Clinton supporters will be unable to put it down. The unceasing frustration will rendering them into a stupor momentarily but hoping for a chance to find some chink in the authors evidence they will scrutinize every chapter looking for vindication of their champion. All in all a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better sources","review":"As a writer Olson lacks the dedication to detail and fact checking that are the mark of a good historian. I've done quite a bit of studying of the Clinton years and I've read a lot of books about his abuses of power. However too many of them lose site of the truth in their quest to convict. Now I don't like Clinton one bit - but there is no point inventing facts when the truth is damning enough. If you want to read a factual account of the Clinton scandals with a conservative viewpoint, dig up some old National Review magazines at your public library. This book does more to help the Clintons (by including so many glary errors and off topic rants) than to impress the reader on their crimes. A sorry state of affairs really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsessed with the Clintons","review":"As I started reading this book, I thought Olson was writing about another first family. It's clear to see Olson's obsession with the Clinton family all through the book which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I found it amusing how she ranted on about the pardon issue, avoiding the draft, how Hillary ran health reform behind closed doors, but neglected to mention the pardons given by the previous presidents. Clinton was elected for two terms as president of the US., guess that shocked them all. Sorry, I couldn't recommend this to book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT criticize unscrupulous liberals...","review":"Why is it that reading reviews is such an interesting passtime? Because you can spot a Blind Liberal review a mile away. They seem to have only one pattern for reviews of their beloveds- like Bill & Hilary. That pattern is pointing out Republicans who have also abused power as the justification for ALL in the future to not only repeat that, but to improve on it. I would like to know how liberals got the label of being the open-minded crafters of a better society. Look at America's state of affairs since WWII and whose leadership precipitated our great declines. At least Clinton has a loyal, ugly, and equally greedy co-dependent wife to enable him to carry on his lifestyle with no fear of repercussion! Certainly not from his loyally BLIND constituency anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book","review":"Yes, I am a democrat. Yes, I voted for a Clinton three times (President twice, Senate once). This book is an wonderful romp (and wonderfully, sometimes laughably, skewed to the right) that gives you one person's view of Clinton's last days in office.Barbara Olsen has made virtually made her career bashing the Clinton's and she brings out the claws and starts scraping away in this book. Trust me you can't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but unconvincing","review":"It is of course tragic that Barbara Olsen perished on 9/11, but nevertheless I must say that while I looked forward to this book because I want to believe the worst about Bill and Hillary, and while it was entertaining for putting them in a bad light, I didn't really find it convincing from a research/evidentiary point of view. For one, the author's bias was all too evident; for another, many of the points seemed to be just rehashed public domain material or speculation. Put another way, sure the Clinton's probably did some bad stuff in their final days, but this book hardly lives up to its promise to show them as serious abusers of power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara seemed like family","review":"Barbara was a regular on Larry King and other TV talk shows, she seemed like part of the family because she was so in tune with our values. When 9-11 happened we were very saddened to hear of her passing. We wanted to somehow continue our contact with Barbara. Her story of the Clinton's last days is so typical Barbara, remembering her feisty style when expressing her conservative views. Anyone who enjoyed Barbara will enjoy her book. You continue to see her smile throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY A MUST READ","review":"I was enthralled with the investigative work that went in to this account of the last days of the Clinton White House. I believe the facts presented are ones that the world needs to know about. It is evident by her resources that Ms. Olson speaks the complete truth. I am very sad that her voice has been silenced. Why are people afraid of the truth? Because it exposes their darkness, maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political pamphlet","review":"Where this tome may provide some entertainment on a dull flight, don't fool yourself into thinking that this is a 'Book'. Political pamphlet is the better term and a rather crude one at that. The author's extreme right wing philosophy drips from every page (no exaggeration)thereby destroying any credibility her statements might otherwise have.No biased rumor is too vague, no 'liberal' intention too suspicious to serve as a reliable basis for pointing the finger at another 'liberal outrage'. That the man, Clinton, might have any redeeming value at all is too preposterous to contemplate.No matter what your political views are, this is a junky book, probably written in less time than your flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about two topics: pardon and donation.","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Yes - yet another book for those who can't get over the fact that Bill Clinton is no longer the President. Barabara Olson writes several facts in her book, then proceeds to fill the rest of the book with distortions, half-truths, and innuendo. The most shocking fact in the book is that it's labeled \\"non\\"fiction. If you're a fellow right-winger, grab your wallet. If you have a brain, on the other hand, look for something that really is nonfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hatchet job","review":"This book is nothing more than a poorly researched vendetta against Bill and Hillary Clinton. I would rather not speak ill of Ms. Olson, who died very tragically on Sept. 11, but the fact is that much of this book puts words and thoughts in the Clintons' minds that are pure speculation.There is a legitimate case to be made against Bill and Hillary Clinton, but if you are interested in a fact-based and fair-minded effort, then you've come to the wrong place.If you want a piece of work that reinforces your own negative impression of the Clintons without challenging any of your assumptions, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Right-Wing Tool","review":"While I'm not a fan of political books, this one was good when Ms. Olson stuck to the facts. There were a few times that she seemed to go off on a \\"Rush Limbaugh-type\\" tangent and had no evidence to offer for what she was speaking of. A few of her bibliography references weren't accurate or were taken out of context. It is clear from reading this book that this author was biased and VERY Republican. That took away from my experience.Just to be fair, if you insist on reading this book, you should also get \\"Stupid White Men\\" by Michael Moore. While Ms. Olson may talk about the \\"abuses\\" of the Clinton administration, you should read the abuses of the current Bush administration! It wasn't as if Clinton were the only one to abuse his powers while in office, and I'm sure he won't be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash from a has-been","review":"The late Barbara Olson reveals nothing new in this book---precisely because she has previously made no secret of her hatred for the Clintons both politically and personally.Everything that has been printed can easily be found in other authors works on the same subject, and therefore only accomplished the task of depleting a forrest and printer cartridges. While this assessment ironically does lend credence to the idea that anybody can become published in this country if they are sensational and partisan enough, it also reveals a very embittered spoiled woman who was almost fanatical in her disregard for the very concept of ethics she was bent on investigating others for violating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"Barbara Olson seems to be a good writer who can't get her emotions under control. The tales in this book have already been reported and many of them have been debunked as either completely wrong or slanted in a way that makes the story inaccurate. The Clintons deserve the scrutiny they are under, but we want to know the truth, not just listen to a Clinton hater throw everything bad she can find into a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Time for Hate","review":"If you are considering buying this book, you might want to first fill your heart with hate (if you haven't already done so) and stop by for that brainpickling appointment that you have put off for so long. Otherwise you might find it difficult to understand how someone writing such an obviously biased attack could actually get published. Nobody's saying Bill and Hillary are sqeaky clean here, but if Ronald Reagan receiving a multimillion dollar house in Bel Air and million dollar speaking engagements just post presidency doesn't set off alarm bells, why should we worry about amateurs like the Clintons?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another conservative frustration.","review":"Ms. Olson spends a great deal of time trying to convince everyone that the Clinton's and the Democrats were nasty people. She forgets that although Clinton was impeached he was found NOT GUILTY. I guess eight years in office was just too much for any conservative to swallow. Olson repeatedly tries to tell us how bad things were. No so, we really enjoyed some good living while the Clinton's were there. I believe if she went back in time other President's, i.e. Nixon, would make the Clinton's look like a bunch of amateurs. At least Clinton didn't try to distroy the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Days Of America's Worst President Exposed","review":"I would like to say to the last reviewer that he has a lot of nerve to complain about the \\"hate\\" in Barbara Olson's book (without once documenting any specifics) and then in the same breath declare how glad he is that she was a victim of the tragedy of September 11 because it means that her voice has now been silenced. It's that kind of perverted double standard in the ranks of the American Left that people like Barbara felt the need to speak out against, and in her last work she does a masterful job of showing how the stench of corruption that was the Clinton Administration carried up to the last minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Price","review":"That the citizens of NY could be duped into voting for Hillary Clinton still amazes me.From Co President Bill Clintons pardoning of the Puerto Rican terrorists to ostensibly get the N.Y.Puerto Rican vote for Hillary,to her vote dealings with the Hasidic Jews in a quid pro quo affair where the payment was made in Bills final day in office,should turn every freedom loving American's stomach over.That the American media wouldn't cover this ,can only be explained after reading another very good book,Bernard Goldberg's\\"Bias\\".Read this book then buy a copy of \\"Bias\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on","review":"After almost 2 years of the Bush administration, do you can you really believe a word this woman had to say? Read David Brock's Blinded by the Right if you want to know where she is coming from."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Days","review":"This book was a juicy read. It grabbed my attention right from the start. The author was prepared all right, prepared to blow the doors wide open on all the disgusting, dirty little secrets covered up by POTUS AND LOTUS. There is Hillary's remarkable interest in Communism and leftist ties not to mention all the little details about how the bribery for the Marc Rich pardon came about. Also included are the many pardons of some of the most criminal elements society has to offer not to mention their friends and family members. And last but not least is their midnight runs and the \\"looting of the nations \\"White House\\". There for all the world to see is their greedy, shameful and disgusting rise to the top. It makes you want to be careful, very careful who you vote for."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better!!","review":"Hallelujah!Ditto to mostly everything in the reviews so far... from the lack of \`cabbages' to the more in depth study of the, up until now, minor characters. After loving the 8 books of the Cheney series, the first book in The Inheritance was seriously lacking. (Which, most of you already know) This book is a serious effort to redeem the faith we readers have given the authors in providing us a great story line, complete with morals and believable characters/character flaws. If any of you had doubts about picking up this book after reading \\"Where Two Seas Met\\" then please just give it a try. You will be will be pleasantly surprised at the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I have this set of good clean books that hold your intrest so well.

Around the turn of the century the Thonet company produced modernist furniture designed by members of the Vienna Sezession, Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Kolo Moser, Marcel Kammerer. Some of which can be seen in this catalog; their number and place in the catalog is pointed out in the introductory essay. The book is a valuable resource if you are interested in antiqeus and early 20th century design. Thonets designs are the prototypes of modern furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"great inexpensive cables.","review":"I have bought a couple of packs of these as my pedal collection has grown, and you can't beat the value. 2 short cords for between the pedals, and a longer cord to run to amp if needed.

To date, it does not operate smoothly. I have tried it on 3 different surfaces. Oddly, it will work fairly well for awhile then become unsatisfactory. Move it to a different surface, same thing again. I have been in contact with Logitec a few times and have reviewed the online manual to no avail. I'll try for another day or 2.

It's a comfortable mouse, it fits well in the palm of my hand. The buttons on the side are comfortable and responsive. The scroll is very nice and feels like an expensive piece of hardware. But the mouse just doesn't work well. It stops working at the most inopportune times, somehow fixes itself only to break once again in a couple of weeks. I liked the mouse when it wasn't sucking. My experience with logitech products has been very good, until I encountered this mouse. I was extremely disappointed with the mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"liking it so far","review":"just started using it a couple weeks ago. so far, it's been pretty good. i would like it if the mousewheel gave a little more resistance on each turn/click, whatever you call it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept Losing Connection","review":"This mouse kept losing its connection.

I have to say that I was extremely disappointed. First of all, the Logitech Control Center for the Mac is buggy, and Logitech still has not fixed it. More frustrating though is the wheel on this mouse- it's extremely loose. It constantly slides around even when not being touched causing web pages to scroll when you don't want them to. It's very annoying. Even setting the mouse to the \\"precise\\" mode did not correct this problem. I would have returned this mouse if I could've, but I waited too long. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Mouse - Bad software","review":"Using OS X and Logitech's driver. The mouse feels comfortable, scrolls easily and I like the wireless aspect. However, the Logitech software (most recent is 2.3.1) is terrible. Lag of 30 seconds or so occurs when \\"waking\\" the mouse from an automatic shut-down due to inactivity before the computer responds.As an alternative, I reverted to the previous driver 2.2.2. While the lag somewhat disappears, there remains functional problems with the software. My alternative is to use a 3rd party driver such as Steer Mouse or USB Overdrive, which adds to the cost of the product.BTW, Logitech support is abysmal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Mouse With Lots of Features","review":"The MX620 is one of Logitech's newest mice and is loaded with features. This includes a fast scroll wheel, battery meter light and programmability for 5 buttons (although it has 6).I use this mouse with a Mac and was skeptical of other reviews here which stated that the mouse could not be programmed with Macs. These reviews were posted before Logitech offered an updated download dated July 7, 2007. I downloaded these drivers and was perfectly able to program the mouse to perform keystrokes, open applications, etc.One of the coolest features is that it has a \\"Search\\" button which lets you open your favorite search engine. For Macs, this is programmed by default for \\"Spotlight\\" but you have the option of changing it.All-in-all a mouse loaded with almost all the bells-and-whistles you will ever need--even with Macs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeps too much, poor surface support, poor range","review":"I bought this mouse to replace my Microsoft Wireless Mouse.While it's a comfortable mouse, it either has transmission problems (wireless), sleep problems(too much battery saving), or doesn't like my desktop (laminate).It will just not respond to movement or buttons until I shake it, or move it to different area.At first I thought it was me, or the desk was too shiny? or something.

However, still trying to find a surface it's compatible with. Does NOT function on most surfaces. Standard mouse pads, 3M Precise Mousing Surface, wood & shiny paper are all out. Works so-so on paper (a little slow) or shiny plastic (a little fast).The mouse does NOT have wheels, but DOES have flat rubbery 'feet' (for want of a better word) - which accounts for the difficulty.Haven't owned it long enough to know about the battery. And, unless I can find a surface to use it on, I might not have it long enough to know if it lasts the year that it claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I've had this for about a year and a half now, and it still works great. I've dropped this hundreds of times and there's no signs of damage.I love the extra buttons, too. I never use the free scroll, though.It's not wonderful for really really long periods of use, like literally all day long for multiple days in a row, but I think you would be hard pressed to find one that was.The battery life is great, too, I've only had to replace the batteries once or twice since I got it, and sometimes I forget to turn off the mouse and leave it on all night.Overall a great buy and I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mouse","review":"I've always been a fan of Logitech products, and this one is no different. The MX620 is a very well-constructed product with buttons in all the right places. The mouse fits my hand perfectly and is spectacular for long-term use. I use it for such detailed tasks as 3d rendering, and it's also an excellent gaming mouse.The battery life seems to be quite good, and there is no sluggishness in the responses at all that I've been able to tell.

They removed both the volume buttons and the notifications lights for emails and IMs. Instead they give you the completely worthless look up button which lets you highlight a word and search for it, whoopty freaking do.The only nice thing about it is the surface of the side grips, that is a slight improvement.

There are many other wireless mice with less features that stow the receiver on the underside.

Obviously, quality control was inadequate at both Logitech and Tech-for-Less.We also had difficulty establishing communications with Tech-for-Less, either by phone or email. Phone messages were ignored and email messages were deleted. Only after emailing Tech-for-Less through techforless@amazon.com was there an immediate and frantic response to remedy the situation to our satisfaction but only after much time and effort on our part.One piece of advice for customers of other vendors through Amazon.com; if you have a problem with the product you receive from a vendor, I suggest you communicate with them through vendor_name@amazon.com if possible. That should get their attention quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you're using a Mac","review":"One would think that a Mac logo on a box would imply compatibility with a Mac, but Logitech thinks otherwise.Upon plugging in the USB receiver, I realized that I could only point and click. Scroll wheel and the two left side buttons did not function at all. After installing the Logitech Control Center, the software didn't even recognize the mouse. Tried removing the USB receiver and plugging it back in, and the act of just removing the receiver gave me the gray screen of death: My Mac froze and crashed. Uninstalling and resinstalling the software did nothing and trying to remove the receiver again caused my Mac to crash.I've always been a fan of Logitech mice, but this is just horrible. Only being able to point and click with a mouse? I can get more functionality from a ten dollar no-name brand mouse. I had high hopes for this mouse. Logitech: this is absolutely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine, poor package, looks like second-hand item","review":"It works fine, but I have to mention that this one is SELL AS IS but they didn't highlight this point when I bought it.

It is a nice reminder of the beautiful music of nature, especially out where we live when the sound of crickets in the summer can be deafening.

Can he make friends and influence people among the callous commuters? Can he find musical fulfillment in a noisy subway station? Well, Chester is an excellent musician (who regretfully acquires a guilded, oriental cage) but how can he be heard in his new environment?Honest and grateful as well as talented, Chester wants to help his hosts--the Bellini family--at their struggling newspaper stand. But will his noble ideals be tainted by metropolitan animal riffraff? He is bombarded by contrasting values: greed and compassion. Most of all, how can he reach an understanding about his personal freedom, without hurting the feelings of the gentle boy who cares for him? Or will they both be exploited on some TV talk show? A cute story which will amuse the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I bought this book for my 9year old for Christmas remembering how much I had liked it when I was young.

But on the other, I can't get LiveUpdate to work at all (even after using 'Intelligent' Updater), despite following every single piece of advice on the technical support web site - and I suspect that paying for phone support would be similarly futile.This feels like a piece of software which hasn't been tested to a useful level - get a fix out asap, Symantec, or you'll continue to deserve to lose customers!

The 2004 version promised to catch spyware and adware in addition to viruses. To cut the long story short, I uninstalled this software and went back to the 2003 version. This is a perfect example of how some companies can take a great product and make a horrid mess out of it. The key problems: (1) unreliable, (2) slows a bleeding edge PC with 2 gigs of RAM down to a crawl...a total resource hog that made normal tasks like using Word and checking email intolerably slow, (3) it actually missed a virus and spyware (I found it with Search and Destroy).

Minor problems include Live Update not updating, slowing down your e-mail download into Outlook Express, creating strange pop-up windows (such as \\"your AOL Messenger has quit unexpectedly\\"), and generally making you more worried about viruses after you install it.Major problem is it really slows down your Internet speed and makes you frustrated. I had tons of problems getting streaming video from yahoo after I installed this program. Videos would stutter at first and eventually stop completely.

If Microsoft, Symantec, and others are going to require activation of software we purchase, they should at least make it an easy process.

It's been pretty solid, maybe a bit slow. I thought an upgrade to the latest version would be routine. How wrong I was! The product activation has a bug on Windows XP Professional that makes it \\"forget\\" that it's been activated. And after you activate a few times, it locks out your product key leaving your computer completely unprotected.

Norton on all workstations was setup exactly the same way.There is no free tech support for installation. Symantec puts out a buggy program and expects the user to pay just to talk to them. So you'll pay $40 to buy the software and $25 to talk to them and maybe get your problem resolved. Anyway, 2004 pro is terrible in my opinion. Besides that Symantec wants to charge for installation tech support.If you need antivirus for your home computers use AVG from grisoft.com.

It turned out to be an amazing looking film with a lot of heart! The animation is stunning and the characters are funny with great voice work by the cast. I would love to see 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' done with CGI animation.I have to deduct one star for the DVD as the two disc special edition is really a one disc edition with a digital copy being the only feature on the second disc.

Throw in a funny story with a genuine moral message and a heartwarming ending and you've got a movie that's the kids will both enjoy and can learn from. I often wonder whether it makes a difference having big name actors do the voices-after all who cares about the voice if you're not seeing the face behind it. In this case though I don't think anyone would have been better matched for the voice of the off beat Horton than Jim Carrey. One of his best comic performances even if you don't see him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adaptation","review":"This story is a classic Dr Seuss and it is very well done (a notch higher than the Thorax). Carrey does an outstanding job, along with the rest of the voice cast.

I was hoping for something along the lines of\\"Madagascar\\" which, while on the silly side, had enough adult humor and some sense of SENSE. \\"Horton\\" is an absolute mess of non-stop jabber, stupid dialog, and humor only a child could appreciate. There are a few funny lines but they are lost amid a swarm of rambling, pointless dialog (which is over-voiced by everyone except Carrell) and dizzying colors and shapes horrifyingly reminiscent of \\"A Bee Story\\". It's a wonderful movie for kids with a short attention span but if you're over the age of 11, you'll be squirming in your chair counting the minutes until it's over.

This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages.

The fact that the set claims to have an audio CD is a fallacy, and the CD and the plush toy were the selling points. The enclosed plush toy hardly qualifies as a plush toy but at least it's here.

An accident that Hannah caused forever changed the life of Gabe, yet they still found true love with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"The not so \\"Good Old Days\\"","review":"The most striking features of this little dark gem of a film that make it emminently watchable are the beautifully composed black and white shots, often rendered through unusual angles, and the simply elegant soundtrack composed of classical tracks mixed in with modern classical/folk. I found myself being pulled back in time as the film unravelled its stories and slowly steamrolled me over by the sheer volume of misery experienced by the northern immigrant communities. It makes one wonder how much of the small town, everyday life variety of American history is glossed over and forgotten about. Sadly, I think you could have made this film about any number of areas of the US and the human experience between 1850 and 1950 and you would find similar tales of suffering, strife and moral collapse. This should be required watching for those who still believe that there ever was a such thing as the American dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description VERY Misleading","review":"This is NOT a story about Black River Falls, as the description indicates. It is a film about stories from around Wisconsin as reported in a paper from Black River Falls, with some hokey footage of modern (1990's) day Black River Falls.There are very few photographs from the period and the film footage is mostly an attempt at what I can only call \\"modern art\\". Cut out about 20 minutes of \\"filler\\" and this would be a somewhat better film.Basically, it's a collection of \\"strange but true stories\\" that have no connection to each other, except they took place around the same period of time and took place somewhere in the state of Wisconsin. And the modern footage makes no positive contribution at all. In fact, if I was from Black River Falls, I would be upset about how the town is portrayed.A complete waste of time and film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photos of dead people, sad and disrespectful....","review":"I thought that this \\"documentary\\" sounded great. It's not. Private photos of children's dead bodies, poorly reenacted suicides, and a dry narrator reading old healdlines, made this awful for me. Very broad definiations of insanity, alcholism, and no antibodics is the story here. Which could have been spun in a good but still interesting way, like look how far we've come, instead of taking a small town's troubles and trying to make an X-file like documentery. Bad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new thought, rambling","review":"This book is a rambling collection of opinion and assumed facts. It is very poorly edited (one chapter ends in mid-sentence) and there are way too many subheadings and bold extracted quotes that give the book more of a tabloid feel (and expands the number of pages -- maybe there wasn't enough material??). A lot of the \\"You should know\\" sidebars are statements of opinion dressed up as fact. There are some interesting factual tidbits, but it is almost too much effort to wade through the chaff to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings By a Non-Expert","review":"Don't waste your time or your money.

After reading his book, I am lesslikely to believe a word the Brother Jed says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha!","review":"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!This book is ridiculous.

They say that if you're going to say that the Bible is a load, you should at least read it. The same should be said of people who preach it. He denied vehemently that the Bible says \\"All have sinned and come short of the glory of GOD;\\" (Romans 3:23) I mean, look it up. This guy doesn't know his stuff. I started asking him questions and I made him feel stupid so he started walking away. I followed him all the way to his car, correcting his inaccurate statements about the Bible all the way. I chased him right off my campus, and I'm proud. His book is funny, though. If he gives you a copy take it and skim over. It's hilarious. But don't pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confrontational Evangelism defended?","review":"It's hard to judge whether to rate this book with a one or a five. If one judges it on serious religious content, then it gets a one, if one judges it on whether it makes the reader laugh outrageously on the floor, then it gets a five. A fair number of college students will know Brother Jed's type: they're the extreme evangelistic Christians who stand on the lawns of campuses bashing gays, calling women who wear shorts skirts \\"loose\\" or \\"fornicators\\", and call men with long hair \\"sodomites\\". He assumes every college professor is a socialist, and that they somehow all preach \\"anti-american socialism propaganda\\" to their classes. (Where God became Pro-American all of a sudden is beyond me.) These are the types who become the caricature of Christianity we see in the media or editorial cartoons. Dangerous stuff, and should be locked away. This type of intolerance to other humans only appears in these fringe types."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful little gadget.","review":"I bought this for my father who has recently been put on regular medication. He is a very active businessman but tends to get focused and forget to take his pills so I thought this might help. It has. The E-Pill Cube is not exactly the coolest looking thing, but it is loud and easily concealable. The compartments may be removed to make it smaller, for example, so it will fit in a desk drawer or a briefcase. It is also very easy to use, which may be a factor for older folks or people with arthritis. If E-Pill came out with something that didn't look so institutional, I would give them five stars, but this thing is just too ugly, even though it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"St Francis of Assisi by G.K. Chesterton","review":"I thought I was buying a modern typeset of Chesterton's work, and was VERY irked to receive a OCR scan of a public domain printing, with brand new typos. This was a present for my daughter, who wants to keep it -- otherwise it would be returned. I've seen similar scams -- uh, scans -- labeled as available in public domain by Amazon, and can only assume I wasn't paying sufficient attention. Other buyers, beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book; only a pity...","review":"Chesterton did a wonderful job, exploring St Francis' life and bringing his personality and faith to us. There is only one thing that spoiled the book for me: truly appalling printing errors - it appears there are no proof readers anymore... : it starts on the back cover where you can read \\"Assini\\" instead of Assisi and it gets worse inside the book.Still, I can recommend the book and if you can find a different edition, all the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"chesterton or francis?","review":"Chesterton is undoubtedly a fine writer and one can't help admiring his style. As a biographer, though, he is inadequate. True, Chesterton is not writing a traditional biography; he is writing an extended essay, full of meditative insights on a prominent Christian saint. However, a good biography should combine both facts and insights, with the latter deriving from the first. Chesterton's insights come mostly from himself; consequentially, this book tells us much more about its author than its subject.This book has some value because it gives us a peek inside Chesterton's head. It's an interesting view, even if we see a few things that aren't very pleasant. But if we want to learn about Francis of Assisi, we'd best go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Francis's image survives this book","review":"Chesterton loves the sound of his own voice, and does not complicate matters by offering any logical or insightful discussion about St. Francis. The author's verbosity gets down right annoying from the very start. He does, however, make one interesting point about Francis: he says that the Saint praises God much in the fashion of the troubadours of the day. Francis's love for God, suggests Chesterton, is almost like the intense feeling one has for one's beloved. Francis obviously was able to have an intense passion for God and man, a passion that was strictly spiritual in nature. This book's only saving grace is that it is about one of the most complicated, awe-inspiring men who ever lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambles too much!","review":"This is not a biography of St Francis as much it is a tangent by the author. There are only tidbits of St Francis mentioned in this book along with a lot of hot air by the author. We are told that St Francis was a soldier who upon adopting the way of life of a monk takes off all of his clothes (except for a hair skin shirt) and wanders off on his new journey. In addition to a few other facts, the author proceeds to restate in several different ways his analysis of the current period in question along with similar situations in other periods throughout history. This book is 158 pages that could be boiled down to about 10 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a misleading title!!","review":"WARNING! Tis is a trap. This is a book about G.K. Chesterton HIMSELF. St. Francis of Assisi was used to flavor his personal ruminations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Overbearing","review":"This book was arcane and verbose which made it very difficult and unenlightening. The author digresses often and seems to add-in superfluous commentary on unrelated subjects. His references often point to \\"current events\\" which have long since lost relevance and the entire text has a dated, maze-like feeling.If you're looking for an account of the life of St. Francis of Assisi, I would not recommend this book. If you are familiar with the life of St. Francis and are looking for a commentary on the events of his life you may find this work helpful due to its supposed eminence among works about the saint."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a rambling essay embracing questionable ethics.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I wanted biographical information about the life of St. Francis of Assisi. What I got was a very biased ANALYSIS of his life and times. This author says of the euthanasia or ethnic cleansing of pagans from Europe by the Church \\"...she had cured it in the only way in which it could be cured\\" (page 26). This author speaks well on behalf of good work done by the Spanish Inquisition! I believe St. Francis would be quite horrified to find his name associated with the promulgation of these ideas. There is little history of St. Francis' life and absolutely NOT ONE quote from his work in this book. I would try to get my $ back on this book if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in memory","review":"I read this in the English translation. It took 2 readings--finished the first 60 pages in the first sitting, then stayed up all night to finish it for SEVEN HOURS. The book was so good, I couldn't bear to go to sleep and stop reading.

Not exactly easy. However, the quality is poor. The fan burned out in about 1 year and the company does not offer an out of warrently repair program (even though I was willing to pay). After many calls to support where i repeatedly recieved incorrect information, they basically said too bad, I have to fix it myself. In addition, the fan is a \\"special\\" fan that has to be ordered from a 3rd party, but Buffalo does not know the part number for the fan - so good luck getting it from a distributor. IF you are putting data on the drive that you dont want to risk losing then I suggest avoiding the product and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo Linkstation Network Drive","review":"So far, it has performed flawlessly.

I had a question about the network printer setup, emailed Buffalo support and their response was prompt and helpful. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This drive is everything you could possibly want in a network drive. You have the ability to set up users and permission levels and it works flawlessly with XP. I have all of my music (80+ GB) as well as other media on this drive and I share it between two computers. The downside is that since it is network attached it is not as quick as a local drive, but it streams audio and video flawlessly. Also, since this unit is Linux based, you can do a lot of modification to the firmware. In fact, there is a group that actually writes alternate firmware and software for this device. Try a search for linkstation wiki and see for yourself ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but security and reliability are problems","review":"I actually have the 120GB Linkstation.I have had problems with the networking part of the linkstation. It seems to take my Windows 2000 and XP machines up to 3 minutes to begin talking to the Linkstation. Very annoying.Also, the linkstation only accepts 8 char. passwords. That's also a problem for me. It would be acceptable if it would ignore the characters after 8 but it doesn't. That forces me to enter my password every time I connect.Initially, I could not get the device to work with security enabled.

Unfortunately, it was only a 30-day trial version (which is freely downloadable from Memeo's website, by the way), and there was no license key included with the product. What's worse, my inquiries to Buffalo's Tech Support to attempt to obtain a key for using Memeo were ignored. I hope nothing goes wrong with my drive, given the lack of response from Buffalo'ssupport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy but limited","review":"One of the better bargains out there, but software is limited.

I got one in September. Within a month, it stopped responding after 1-7 days of working. I applied to support, and they suggested to replace it, so I sent it back to them. The LinkStation came as a replacement was a used unit, and in addition I had to pay taxes as if it were sent to me (Canada) from Japan, not the US. I complained again, and they suggested me to exchange it with a new box. Just when I decided to leave the used one and do not deal with BuffaloTech anymore, the unit just died and didn't start up. So I sent it again, of course. The second replacement I received was a new box, but it's crashing even more often than the first one, sometimes twice a day.

I love the fact I can get some of the clutter off my computer and onto this drive. Initial setup was easy. Plugged it in and mapped drives on my computer took about 5 mins.

Purchased it for my 3 year old son as a Christmas present. I'm pretty sure this thing is best left in the box. Short of that, he should be taken out of the box with care, affixed to his platform, and placed on a high (out of the way shelf). Within 10 seconds, one leg had broken off, in another 10 seconds an arm had come off. Basically he was just articulating the arms and legs not pulling them or squeezing them. Where the pins fractured the plastic looks ridgid and glassy. It's a huge disappointment, I wish I had known it was not for play, hope this post saves someone the trouble. This really stinks because my son loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Experience","review":"Writer Auchincloss usually writes tedious family-history novels but here he writes a book wherein each chapter is about a separate unconnected character. The result is insightful, different, and fascinating. I held back one star in my rating because I just don't care for books about the well-to-do; they seem (as this one sometimes does) pretentious and self-congratulatory. But the characters here are fully realized and will hold your interest. The book has the added advantage of each character having said just enough about him/her, so that you do not get tired of the personality. If you're looking for something a bit different, that you can pick up and put down, this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting change from the usual.","review":"Many stories have predictable plot points that are rehashed with new characters and settings. However, this book exemplifies Auchincloss's ability to tell a story without falling into the trap of one of these expected archetypes. Each chapter in the book corresponds to one person in the narrator's life, including family members, co-workers, school buddies, and family friends. Each character sketch is thoughtfully presented with delightful details. Although these portraits are totally unrelated in that each does not refer back to details in the previous chapters, they come together coherently to tell the story of the narrator, who not only ages with each chapter but also matures in his opinions about each character. The language flows easily, neither being too fast paced, nor too dry. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first Fantastic Voyage","review":"As the previous reviewer points out, the first Fantastic Voyage was not Asimov's story, but merely his novelization of the movie plot. So Asimov decided to write his own story on the same theme. Unfortunately, his was not as good as the original.Asimov had an enormous ego (if he was called \\"The Great Explainer\\", as the previous reviewer notes, I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn that Asimov gave himself the title. He often bragged about the huge volume of output from his typewriter. The problem is that quantity does not equal quality, and much of his writing wasn't worth much. This book falls into that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I could not believe that this is indeed a book by Asimov and double-checked a couple of times. It is barely scientific, totally lacking logic and the finale is very predictable. I figured out the \\"surprise\\" ending in the first half of the book. The characters get developed during the book only to be completely shattered at the end. I really feel that I've waisted my time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh what a Knight!!","review":"Loved this book. Did not want to put it down.

I recommend it highly if you are embarking on a warehousing project."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best IT books I've ever read...","review":"...I'll be short after so many comments. What I like especially about this book:- The business/industry based approach which leads quite naturally to different concepts per business (as the CRM outriggers due to the very large customer dimension). Nevertheless, as the authors point out, these concepts may also be valid in other businesses/industries. It is only a best practise example. I like very much this open connection between businesses and concepts, this is exactly how our world is like. I had so many deja-vus reading the book, now able to sort-in issues and concepts I encountered at my customers.- It is EXCELLENTLY written, a real pleasure to read which I could not really stop since the beginning - like a good piece of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a good book.

I found this thing impossible to read. SCD is referenced in the index for page 201 with no other references in the index but the real explanation is on page 403. I think the author is sick in the head and should definitely stop writing books. That is why this one is not a New York Times Bestseller. Scaring 'techs' away with a first chapter like that does not help ideas get across to the reader. I definitely vote that this is badly written. Probably best quoted by literary professionals as do not be bothered with buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of unwanted content","review":"This book does not cover the core dimensional topics.Lot of unwanted topics like internet security etc hassimply made this book bulky.Also the examples in Dimensional modeling is incompleteliving it up to the user to search other sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad....","review":"whatever pioneer or genius he is in the DW industry, the book is pretty bad, i wouldn't recommend it at all. the way he tries to convey concepts, explain techniques....very bad organization, not clear but confusing sometimes, and very poor logical flow... he tries to make a big deal out of DW, when in fact it's not such a fancy or intellect intensive subject. very simple concepts are even hard to understand. someone else would be able to write a book more powerful and straight to the point in 100 pages MAX, and be much more useful....it sucks when leaders don't know how to express themselves, maybe he was looking forward to have readers learn enough in DW to get projects started but not be able to do squat, and get some business from consulting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter Moon - lacks closure","review":"I am a huge Koontz fan, and the whole time that I was reading this, I was enjoying it. The characters were okay, the plot was not bad, but the ending was horrible. I can't express in words the dissappointment I felt after completing this book. Many of my questions were not answered when it was finished; there was no closure. I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what the monster was...this is undoubtedly my least favorite Koontz books out there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"Perhaps the most worthwhile part of this meager offering from Koontz is his bleak perspective on the downward spiral of civility in our society. There isn't much more to recommend after the first hundred pages. Koontz quickly switches gears away from the MacGarveys' struggle with the living, breathing monster that is L.A., and concludes with a tired alien/ghost story. The lackluster and unsubstantiated ending is particularly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put your brain on hold","review":"A thing from another dimension enters a ranch in Montana and explores us. It can take over animate and inanimate things, and doesn't know the difference, so it animates corpses. This would make a good short story, and it was once. It makes a mediocre novel. He just fills in extra words to reach novel length, with no new substance. All in 8th grade English. The one bright spot is his technique of keeping you reading on by stringing bits and pieces of expectation in front of you. Otherwise, it's not imaginative, original, or especially entertaining. Sorry, not recommended in the face of so many other better novels on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT highly recommended","review":"I must say this was the worst Koontz book Ive laid my hands on. I thought the plot was thin, and the characters boring. I wouldn't recommend picking this one up; at least not as your first Dean Koontz book; because your first impression wouldn't be a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernaturally Scary","review":"Koontz manages again to take a supernatural story, and scare the pants off of his readers! Well, he managed to at least scare me!Winter Moon takes place in the woods, in a cabin, among all of the creatures who live in the dark- that picture he paints alone is enough to freak anyone out! But when strange things start happening, it's nail biting time.Winter Moon wasn't my favorite of Koontz's, but it certainly left a lasting impression. That alone earns it some stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Peeked at the Ending","review":"Koontz is my favorite writer. I found Winter Moon as thrilling (start to finish), as scary (maybe scarier!), and hard to put down as all his others. But, with about one-fifth of the story to go, I began to suspect an ending I wasn't going to like. So I peeked, and there it was. BOOOO!!!Without that ending, this would be 4 or even 5 stars. I'm referring to the terribly disappointing relocation, not the resolution of the plot. Shame on Dean Koontz. Can I demand a rewrite?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz at his worst","review":"I have read numerous, maybe even all of Koontz's books, and this one by far is my least favorite. The characters were all set up well, but the plot went nowhere. It wasn't creepy at all and the ending was a huge let down. Nothing was answered. Not worth the read in my opinion. Very slow moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Koontz's best.","review":"I enjoy Dean Koontz's writing very much. He really has a style and prose all his own. The book was easy to read and started out suspenseful and the main characters were likable enough, but about halfway through the story, I realized that he was stretching out what could have actually been an interesting short story, into a 400-page novel. Although his demonic aliens were somewhat bland and unimaginative and the ending was weak, his writing style saved the book somewhat. \`Winter Moon' will surely give you something to do if you're just looking for something easy to read, but it's quite far from being considered one of Koontz's better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY horrible","review":"I've read this twice. The first time I read it was the early 90's.. apparently I forgot how much I disliked it, because I picked it up and read it again in 2000. I hated it. Halfway through, reading it became a chore. It was mostly just a bunch of senseless babble with no real plot. You knew what was going to happen from the very beginning.I'd suggest picking up one of his better novels. Start with Lightning, Strange Highways I was real fond of too. Plus the Fear Nothing and Sieze the Nights books were pretty good.Stay away from this one is my opinion. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"There were some scary, suspenseful parts in the book but overall I didn't think it was very good.

Jack McGarvey is one of my favorite Koontz characters even if the story seems a bit odd and difficult to read at times.It's strange the way life plays out. And this story is no exception. Jack McGarvey's life has always played out rough. Two partners lost in as many years and anything that can go wrong does go wrong....UNTIL...He inherits the farm upon the death of his dead partner's father...But is this the blessing in disguise it first appears to be?Well if you've ever read a word of Koontz you know that all is not as it appears.But in the end, ol' Jack is a better man for all he has to endure.And that makes this story WELL worth the read.

The characters are one-dimensional, which isn't surprising since the dialogue is cardboard too. This is the kind of book you thought of writing in 6th grade, but you never made it past the first 5 pages; it looks like Mr Koontz is a little more perseverant, but that's not necessarily a good thing.

This would have made a tight, suspenseful short story, but is stretched way too thin to be a successful novel. Nearly a hundred pages given to a subplot involving a drug shootout and the neurotic exploits of a cop's wife? Come on, was that really necessary? This subplot has no bearing whatsoever on the remainder of the story. The plot was unfolding in Montana not in LA. No, it didn't even lend itself to advancing character development since the characters are very boring and stilted (Ed being the exception). I found myself skimming through much of the first half of the novel. I believe this book is a good example of cut-n-paste editing in order to meet a deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Dean Koontz delivers exceptional writing in the majority of his novels.

I do prefer Koontz's books that have a bit less of a supernatural theme, but even the others that I've read I liked more than this one. The main characters were okay, but the alien monster really never went anywhere and too much was left unexplained. The book ended far too abruptly with no follow-up on the characters afterwards (I was sure there'd be something made of how heroic the boy acted in particular), and there were parts that I laughed out loud at how absurd it became. He included a golden retriever as so many of his books do but the dog seemed totally unnecessary to the story, and introduced a glaring plot hole (why did the alien not just take control of him as it did other animals??) Overall, not his best work and a book you can skip without really missing much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably my least favorite Koontz book.","review":"I found the first three-fourths of the book boring and slow moving.

I have visited visited many studios and been lucky enough to find one that truly centers on the concept of spirituality versus exercise. I search for this \\"feel\\" when I am searching for good yoga books. Doug's ability to effortlessly float through vinyassas is perfectly translated and easily understandable in this book.

Doug encourages us to move gently into a whole or possibly raw food diet by first starting out with juicing. He emphasizes raw juices and a diet of almost 70% raw foods in a do-able way. How many yoga books have new information in them? They can introduce and inspire us to read the sacred texts, and that's important to us all. But as far as asana and pranayama go, at best, we can discover innovative vinyasas and sequences, and this is what Doug delivers. Plus, he demonstrates them beautifully! Doug has successfully created a whole body system for someone not new to yoga, but possibly new to wholistic health.

Growls of some kind that you can actually make out or understand, shredding guitars and machine gun drumming brought on by the new drummer Daray, who I must add is an excellent replacement and made his appearance on Revelations. (The drummer Doc left due to an injury, I think) the majority of the record is pretty standard Vader except that the unusual tracks The Sea Came at Last and Choices bring some experimentation.

There was too much violence in it (although mild, my children ages 6, 5 and 3 did not want to watch it again). The angel of Easter past did not display much kindness and had quite the attitude. I was really glad we borrowed it from the library before we wasted any money on it.Yes, it did have the redeeming message of Easter in it, and the end was beautiful. But it wasn't a really enjoyable movie like many Veggie Tales.

I have been a Veggie Tale fan since the begining and am very familiar with all of the videos. This has the quality story and fun that we have come to trust from Big Idea. I love Rebecca St James, her song was perfect and wonderfully done. Since I have been a fan of Veggie Tales since the begining my wife and I noticed the improvement in the animation not huge changes but subtle improvements that created an even better video. I do agree with another reviewer that the time concept with the past, present and future Easter's was difficult to follow. More time to develop that part of the story could have helped. Theologically it is all good. I liked the correction by Nezzers Grandma that she was a vision and not a ghost. The video does communicate the hope we all have in Christ but is very sensitive to the young audience of Veggie Tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, yet meaningful","review":"A beautifully crafted masterpiece that gets to the heart of the real meaning of Easter.

No silly song, and minor roles for Bob and Larry, but those are minor issues, the DVD is fantastic. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ideal movie","review":"Our six year old daughter loves this movie as she does her other VeggieTales videos. For a while this was her most watched video and even now she goes back to it. I love how it puts a Charles Dickens twist into the plot by having Ebeneezer be visited by the 3 ghosts of Easter.

Get ready for more Grade-A cheese in KILLER TOMATOES EAT FRANCE, the fourth and final film in the KILLER TOMATOES franchise. John De Bello and friends put their own silly spin on The Man in the Iron Mask, with series favorite Steve Lundquist playing out the duel roles as both Igor and the future king, Louis the XXVII. The tomatoes have retained their animated features from the third film for more goofy fun as they take to the stage in a rocking music number before heading out to the battlefields to squash more humans. The groan-worthy gags and outlandish humor still make for more guilty entertainment, while you can expect every possible French cliché to be properly exploited.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul of Oysterville!","review":"I read \\"Skulduggery on Shoalwater Bay\\" while doing book research in Oysterville and the surrounding towns. The delightful folks at the Espy Foundation gave it to me as a gift and I've re-read it many times.The poetry is engrossing and haunting. You can close your eyes and hear the voices of the pioneers telling their stories to Espy from beyond the grave.Oysterville is probably my favorite place in the world. If you're lucky enough to visit this historic town, be sure to look for Willard Espy's stone bench, facing the bay, just up the street from the old church. Get a copy of this book and sit there at sunset to read, it's quite an experience.If you're REALLY brave, read it up at the old Oysterville Cemetery, in the shadow of the Espy monument!I would recommend \\"Skulduggery on Shoalwater Bay\\" and Willard Espy's many additional works, to any lover of poetry, history, and just good fun stories!Blessings,Perry P.

It identified some files that needed to be deleted which I did. Since then the whole system has been acting up. I tried several times to uninstall and re-install NAV 2004 with no luck. With info from the Symantec site (they have been no help at all and are obviously still denying there is a problem), I have tried everything. I have even now returnred NAV 2004 and purchased NAV 2003. This will also not install because of changes to files that NAV 2004 caused.

MyDoom response was far too slow. The nice GUI and buttons and features many are just not needed and more for user entertainment. I guess really novice PC users like it but really it does take a good amount of system resources vs some other solutions. I dont care for McAfee much either. One I found that works well is F-Secure Inc. They dont sell boxes in the stores but its a bit less bulky and they update really often. That lil Finnish company has been first on many of them. They have an auto updates through backweb. Its pretty nice..Norton needs to get back to basics and stop trying to design its Av software like its a playstation game. My 2 cents..

After the machine was restarted following the install, the computer was locked up until I killed the program called 'cfgwiz'. I assume that is the program that takes you through the steps of scheduling scans, updates, etc since I was not presented with these options.

Already a great deal of this book is obsolete because so much remediation has already been completed.

Halfway thought the novel I realized that absolutely nothing of any importance has happened yet. I pushed on and found that the mystery came together nicely in the end.

Last year, in May, i had to wait for over four hours to get to him. I think this explains everything - this is simply a terrific writer. \\"Marriage os sticks\\" was slightly different from the rest of his books, but for those who'd been his fans for years, like myself, it'll be a real feast. Yes, it was very confusing, which certainly makes it a good Carroll book, and adds to its charm. I never tried to figure out what the author wanted to say, simply enjoying the beauty of \\"Marriage...\\". It's filled with magic, suspense, absurd...poignant. Worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful gift.","review":"Every Jonathan Carroll work is like a precious gift and this is no exception.

The cover had caught my attention originally; the jacket synopsis held my attention a bit longer. Still, I probably would not have bought the book, being unfamiliar with the author. But I needed something to read for the moment... and I was amazed to find myself sucked in as early as the second page. I can't even explain why exactly I loved this book so much, or why I'm loving every word of Sleeping in Flames. All I know is that after welling tears and goosebumps and occasionally laughing aloud, I put down this book and knew that I had a new favorite author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"Clearly I'm in the minority here, but I did not enjoy this book at all. Part 1 just did not ring true to me. First, I found the characters to be completely one-dimensional. Miranda reads like a female character written by a man. And Hugh -- handsome, philosophical, patient and willing to leave his wife! -- read to me like a man's idea of a woman's idea of the ideal man! Second, I had no idea where the book was headed and frankly, didn't much care.Then, Part 2, the weird stuff kicks in. I didn't care about the characters in the first place, so I didn't much care what happened to them or why. I had literally no interest in deciphering the events/visions/ghosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I wanted to like this book. The reviews were mostly very good and it sounded like a very intriguing read....intriguing is not the word for it. I have to disagree with other reviewers as I found it one of the most bizarre reads ever - and really, a waste of time. Maybe science fiction fans would enjoy it more. I am a huge fan of thrillers, crime drama, mysteries and the like - this is none of those. I find Dean Koontz a fascinating writer and he definitely does not fall into a specific genre but does write some way out there stuff - even being a fan of his often \\"suspension of disbelief\\" writing, I was NOT a fan of this book or writer. I won't be able to bring myself to try anything else by Carroll. I did NOT care about these characters, the plot was at best bizarre and I did have to force myself to finish. Not my cup of tea for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I didn't care for the book because a good majority of it was back and forth between present day and past and was confusing. Other authors have a better way of distinguishing different time periods. Also, I felt that the main character made a few poor decisions in her lifetime, but paid for them too drasticly. The end of the book made me feel very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Picking it up at an airport (ok, so I have only myself to blame), the reviews on the cover looked quite good, promising strong plotline. However, it didn't take me long to get bored with a light stile of writing, a plot that never picks up speed (it just plain never gets going), and uninteresting characters. He works so hard describing Hasidic Jews in New York, but only makes it sound like he's trying too hard to make it interesting. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BLAZING flaw in the story!","review":"I just finished this book and I agree with everyone about the character Will. Not likable. This book was painful to read...too much information presented as confusingly as possible. But my main criticism is this...****SPOILER ALERT****SPOILER ALERT***The premise is if the 36 men who uphold the world are all killed by a certain day, the world will end. As these men die naturally, new ones replace them so at all times there are 36.An unborn baby is not a man...so how could it be the 36th?DUH?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"This book starts off quite promisingly, and then descends into the worst trip I have read for many years. I would not be surprised to find ou that this s Dan Brown under psuedonym. I don't particularly like Dan Brown, but if this is him, then he has used the alias because it was not up to even his weakest piece of work. By page 250 I was getting so angry with the characters and plot that I had to give up.

Then his wife is kidnapped because of what he knows. His investigation brings him in the heart of the jewish orthodox community, where he learns a lot about the kabbala, the end of the world and the lamed vav, the 36 righteous men.I give the book 4 stars because for once this is a religious thriller that has nothing to do with Mary Magdalene or Jesus Christ. Thank God ! You also learn a lot about judaism and the story of the lamed vav is very interesting. It is a nice read.But... some things are just too good to be true. Isn't it a coincidence that Will's ex-girlfriend is jewish? And that his best friend is a computer expert? Not ! The end is also incredibly predictable. When you have read half of the book, you will know how the book is going to end.Nonetheless, people who liked The Da Vinci code will like this book. I know I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have nothing better to do then read this book.","review":"This book is the equivalent of the movie you should wait to see on DVD, but only if a friend loans it to you, and then only if you've seen everything else.In the hands of a more competent author the premise might have resulted in a fascinating and thrilling story. However, there's nothing more painful than figuring out a story's ending and then reading 200+ pages for the supposedly bright and talented protagonist to figure it out also."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining book","review":"Similarities to Da Vinci Code do exist in this book, however, the plot is much lighter - despite what it says on the jacket cover. Instead of an inside tour through Catholicism, we have an inside tour through Hasidic life, which I found fascinating. The plot was woven enough that the ending was a bit of a surprise, although one knew with all the pointing of fingers, that the ending would not be what was expected. Character development was good. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to other books by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty bad book","review":"I do a fair amount of reading but usually don't end up writing a review. Just (10 minutes back) finished reading this book and it was - just bad - so much so that I decided to write this review. Basic and absurd storyline - badly developed lead characters, and an implausible bad guy for shock value. Will Monroe Jr. going from being in the right place at the right time all the time in the beginning to being in wrong places at the wrong time consistently. Everything happens in NY for lack of imagination. Search for 36 people among 6 Billion and 3 are in NY. Save your time and pass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting concept, but please skip","review":"I bought this because I wanted something to read on a long flight and the plot seemed interesting. But its so poorly written and drawn out that it fell apart on its own. I didnt give it one star because I did finish it (maybe I just wanted to say I gave it a chance. Pros are it flashes to the actual righteous men of the world getting killed one by one and their stories make you feel good and actually want to perform good deeds of your own. The cons are: he does such a poor job of expressing a husband looking for their kidnapped wife and his emotions. He has to write in that he is getting angry he can't find her, are you kidding me? And the whole ex girlfriend thing is ridiculous. He talks about her smell and their afternoons spent indoors about 40 times.As for a spin off on da vinvi code, I dont really see any similarities at all. Including da vinci code was good and this was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"good beach read","review":"I really enjoyed this. I am sorry butI do have to compare it the the DaVinci Code. I like learning about the 36 righteous men. It held my interest to the end. It gave me something to read and I wondered what would happen next. I rarely read these kind of books. I usually read women's fiction. But, I like the delving into the kabbalah and the righteous men. Something I don't know anything about. Maybe, because I am jewish it held my interest. And you never hear anything about the ultraorthodox(Chabad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and cozy","review":"I read this book in no time at all.

This is an early film featuring Bogart that would surely be forgotten if he wasn't in it. The other actors are melodramatic and the story, even with its \\"twist\\" ending, is a bit too mechanical to enjoy. Bogart is the best thing about it, but people didn't seem to realize it at the time and his role is not that big. As usual at this time he played a gangster type, and I don't want to give anything away, but I swear that Bogart got shot to death more than any other actor in the 1930s!I'm a huge Bogart fan and I've sought out anything I could find with him. This is worth seeing once if you also love Bogart, but if you're just a casual film viewer, avoid it.

I can remember being in amateur theatricals like this when I was about 16 or 17. The director has a few visual ideas; eg, the wooden bars of a staircase banister turn into the iron bars of the condemned cell. Not that there's a lot of point to that one. The upshot of the story is that it's right to pursue the letter of the law, no matter how unpopular it makes you, or how strong your psychological empathy with the accused --- even if she's your own daughter. Quaint, in a way. Yes, Bogart is in it, just about.

The main thing that I like about it so much was not the plot but how accurate the story was portrayed. The author did a great job of portraying how cowboys lived and felt back then. He showed the type of men they were and described in detail the way a man would go about things in the old west. This story had a great start that grabbed your attention and had suspence around every corner. It left you woundering what would happen next and if the main character would live or not. I enjoyed every part of the book except for one. The only chapter I did not like was the 9th because all it did was tell about the brothers of Sackett finding out what happened to him.

(LOL, this movie ...!) HAHAHAHAHA I can't stop laughing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was OK, I guess.","review":"Code of Honor wasn't too bad. It had some action, but mostly it centered around a U.S. General named C.B. Lane who is a cowardly bureaucrat and the main character's of most of Coyle's previous novels who are fighting a guerilla-type war in Columbia. There wasn't nearly as much action as in the author's previous books, and the end left a lot of business unfinished, but it was still an acceptable read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Item was as described, in good shape.

I'm not just against this album because its not \\"old\\" VNV, i am a fan of Matter and Form, which after a couple of listenings gets to you. This album however is lyrically depressing, and not 'good' depressing, but dissapointingly depressing. Ronan seems to have run out of inspiration on this one, almost like he knows what will work and just pounds it out of a cookie cutter. musically it doesnt really push hard, but face it, not too many people would listen to VNV if there were no lyrics. Without inspired lyrics, which is what draws most people to them, there really isnt much there to drive the music. sorry, but you should skip this one and put your money into somthing truly inspired like Coded Message: 12 from [:SITD:], which is probably the least known classic of the newer electro-industrial music.sorry Ronan, better luck next time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"We bring destruction, we bring war","review":"Fresh from the mailbox to the computer to listen again and again.

Definitely refreshing from Matter+Form, which I never quite got into. Unfortunately no stand outs like \\"Beloved\\" was, but how many times can brilliant lightining strike? Fans of VNV will be pleased. Sniffy critics who like to look for \\"fresh\\" sounds will content themselves to look elsewhere. Yes, this does seem like a suitable followup to Empires.

They have let down true EBM clubbers for sometime now. I don't hear much from them in the club scene either. If any songs get played from this yester-year wonder, It's from Pre-Futureperfect era of VNV. I find the Judgement CD whiney and overdone. Maybe VNV needs some cheese with its whine now? I've been active in the EBM scene for over 12+ years now and still wonder how a great band like this turned so bad? Seriously pass on this CD. I highly doubt you will hear any of Judgment or their past few CD releases at any EBM clubs in time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different that all previous VnV","review":"It is not what i expected, but i grew to love it. It's hard for me to pin down... but i think that its because even though the lyrics are a bit darker, the instrumentals are a bit \\"poppier\\" I think thats what initially put me off.I picked up the cd the week before seeing vnv live. I will be honest, my initial thought was oh no, what have they done? However its one of those rare cd's that the more i listen to it the more i love it. I also think seeing it performed live that pushed me over the edge.Ronan was fantastic at the show we went to and really made the songs work. If you get the chance to see them live its worth every penny and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Not as good as empires, but it introduces a new sound to the VNV arsenal. The instrumentals are profound and the rest is great to listen all the way through. I find myself skipping certain songs, but the CD is great in its entirety.

It seemed like they were aiming for a sound that is dancefloor friendly or regurgitating sounds from past songs (one song, \\"Momentum\\", even sounds like \\"Interceptor\\" from Matter + Form). Also, these are the worst lyrics Ronan Harris has ever written. When it's not uninspired, it's laughably strangled (from Descent: \\"Limitless are the ways of mankind in its virulent capacities\\". Huh?).

This means that all of the software and data files that you have added will be removed and all of the space-hogging software that HP provides (and which you probably removed to attempt to recover some hard disk space) will be restored.HP claims to have stopped providing recovery CDs because of its contract with Microsoft.

They're barely faster than the Athlon XP 2000+ workstations they replaced. HP cut several corners with this model:- There are no available internal or external drive bays- The power supply is only 250W- They skimp on the RAM, using DDR333 instead of DDR400 despite the 800FSB processor- The hard drive is mounted in a bizarre plastic vertical bracket which isn't very secure and tends to vibrate- There are no CDs included with the system (except one Microsoft Works disc). There are no restore CDs, let alone Windows install discs (but my Pavilion ze4240 notebook I bought a year ago came with both--shame on HP for backing down on that).Since the systems shipped with XP Home and we need Pro, we reformatted the hard drives.

The absence of recovery CDs, used when you need to format the HD, is not a source of problems at all, once you can create the CDs set very easily(there is even an application for that included among the provided softwares), as long as you do not make a mess of the HP Recovery Drive.

It is scholarly, fascinating, and yet easy to read and to understand. I imagined my being in a small Paris cafe and talking with her over a latte. She has a wonderful conversational style, and covers in-depth subjects and ideas with ease. I never realized how many aspects there are to the world of stripping. Professor Roach is not afraid to discuss her own misgivings, questions, and thrills with the reader. Her sense of humor is palpable and I frequently laughed out loud at her comments which she inserts into her main topics with ease. This is a must-read for any woman who has wondered about the world of stripping, any woman who is morally opposed to it, and any man who wonders what really goes on in those sultry, sirens' minds. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"QiGong is not like fast food","review":"Five minutes of even effective, intensive Qi Gong exercises can hardly help much. I recommend the series (Exercises to Heal) by Lee Holden, introduced on PBS. The exercises are exquisitely taught in the midst of a moving stream with soft music -- the movement of nature matching the movement of the exercise. Also excellent and more academic in approach is QiGong Beginning Practice (a two disc set) with Francesco Garripoli. The first disc has an introduction and the regular set of exercises, from which one can choose a few or do all. The background is misty and high in the mountains. The second disc is an award winning documentary showing history of QiGong, its role today in modern China as preventative medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving in Harmony","review":"What a wonderful way to achieve balance and relax.

Unfortunately, many of the texts are cut down to such tiny snippets that major parts of the essential arguments and even some widely-quoted passages (e.g. in Plato, Bell, Bullough, Kant), are missing. On the other hand, there are long essays reprinted, with virtually no cuts, which are not only not \\"classic\\" but which strike me as quite absurd.

In this audiobook, her words are conversational but there are some very profound insights about Femininity and our roles as women in society.While there are lots of books on Female Wisdom (including much recycled knowledge), what Sobonfu Some reveals about women in her culture is more specific and rather unique. Hardly any indigenous women have revealed the secrets and understandings of their culture to the Western world. (Men like Malidoma Some and Martin Prechtel have made some inroads from the male perspective.) I found her views helpful in bringing a richer dimension to being a woman in our culture that expects women (and their concomitant biology) to conform to expectations set by spiritual amnesiacs.Don't expect her to sound like a scholar or a deep-throated wise woman.

Also, the plastic at the bottom of the grater started cracking from day one, and worse of all, the snap bottom keeps falling off, to the point that I have stopped using it at all.

Rather, it looks like residual stress left in the plastic from when sheet metal was hot bonded to the plastic.

The Window at the White Cat was the first Rinehart mystery I read (The Circular Staircase was her first published novel) and I liked it so much that I began to read virtually all of her mystery novels -- many of them more than once. The White Cat in the title is the name of a seedy political hangout in which a killing occurs and the story is a mixture of political shenanigans, romance -- and, above all -- mystery and suspense.

Get On With Your Life, Winter Killing, On Falling, The Morning Belongs to the Night and The End of a Love Affair are stand out tracks. But the others are good too, not a dud one on the album. The same cutesy, whimsical fragile voice which seduced us in And She Closed Her Eyes hasn't lost any of its charm.

I couldn't believe how bad it was.Today I learned why it's so darn bad - Nuno Bettencourt is the lead guitarist! You know - that hacky schlockmeister behind Extreme and the insipid \\"More Than Words.\\" Once this is known, the unlistenability of this album makes perfect sense.No matter how much you like Perry - stay away from this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun album.....and Nuno plays on it!","review":"Perry Farrell has created a fun album of funky tunes that make you want to dance. He's supported by a good group of musicians who help him bring the songs to life. Most notable of these musicians is one of the most awesome guitar players the world has ever known - Nuno Bettencourt! Nuno also helped with production duties, clearly helping to give the songs that funky groove he's well known for and adding a few great guitar riffs and solos here and there to spice things up. It's safe to say that this album is not groundbreaking in any way but it certainly offers you some good sounds and fun grooves to help liven up your next party. Favourite songs include the groovy \\"Wish Upon a Dogstar\\" and \\"Celebrate\\" which has a bit of an Extreme (Nuno's former band) influence to it and the nice mid-album ballad \\"Awesome\\". Play it loud and have some fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on...","review":"There are some good moments, but yeach, its offset by some miserable doss, thinly veiled disco, derrivative hooks (you invented a great sound, Peter, but some new rifs are past -due -mate) You want to disagree - play AWESOME track first... really annoying and tragic misuse of talent and opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"begining of something","review":"i hope this marks the begining of a new avenue for perry ...this sound could provide a rich texture much like janes did for all of us years ago . this a good cd more like 3 1/2 stars but not a 3 . not a waste of money . good house party tracks on here as well as some good stuff to add to your playlist . i would recommend it , great summer music....not angry like janes was ...but that fit the time much like this does..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A *very, very* useful book","review":"I completely disagree with the review below from 1/29/01. The most important tool to overcome repetitive strain injury is awareness of how you are using your body & how you may be injuring it by the way you move (or by not moving enough!). The exercises in this book help you become much more aware of your posture, body tension, & awkward movements that may be causing your problems.

Though, I feel like it could have been longer and included more information, what it DID cover was amazing. At the end they bring people in who had modifications done by Steve that they wanted to get removed, and people whose lives changed enough by their experience with the modified world, that they changed their ways. I thought it was a very fitting end, rather than just being a documentary praising everything that modification is. It gave the lifestyle a different viewpoint, which was really nice because people tend to neglect those who change their minds.For anyone interested in finding out more about Steve Haworth, this is an amazing find.

Even though the presentation is alright, these audio books are extremely abbreviated versions of the originals. This, in my way of thinking, is very sad, and constitutes a poor product.

The man exuded power, decisiveness and self-confidence. I've never come across a tougher-sounding weakling or less convincing alcoholic in any screen presence. Scott just wasn't very good. Nor was Stanwyck. These were unreal, unlived-in performances. Heflin, on the other hand, in spite of the haphazard direction and poorly managed scene-setting, delivered his lines well, in a relaxed, natural and easy manner. He seemed like a professional actor, who knew his job. The story was very interesting, and kept you going until the end. Some of the lines were quite sharp and even witty.

Honestly, I thought Stanwyck and Douglas's performances were laughable. Douglas looked like he was just happy to be there and I don't know what Stanwyck's problem was. Van Helfin was okay but it's Lizabeth Scott that stole this one. She was the only character that came close to being believable. The young actors in the begining of the film were great, but the adult versions just fell flat. And this screenplay was nominated for an Oscar? Jeez. Must have been slim pickin's that year.

The screenplay of Robert Rosen is based on an unpublished story \\"lovelies bleeding\\" by Jack Patrick.

The only thing a person should be prepared to do is have a press to get the seal and bearing out.The bearing was heavy duty and the seal..... welll was just a seal..... it will work fine and was slighty different then the factory seal but at this point after riding through water and mud it is doing just fine.i plane on buying a couple more of these kits.

There's more melodic tunes, if you have \\"Infest\\", you would find this CD very different from it. There isn't much rapping, other than in the hit song \\"She Loves Me Not\\". Their first song on this album \\"M-80 Explosive Energy Movement\\", contains a really punky tune and really fast guitar playing, it still displays some power packed in their first album \\"Infest\\".In my opinion, \\"Time and Time Again\\" \\"She Loves Me Not\\" and \\"Life Is A Bullet\\" are the best songs on the cd.So, what are you waiting for?

Sorry \\"Jacoby Shadix\\" but this one doesn't make the grade as far as depth. Lovehatetragedy seems to be a very pop-centered album made to attract the 14 year-old girl audience. The rap element is more prominent, and that coupled with, I'll admit, very catchy choruses round out the album. Overall, this CD is too short (time-wise), over priced, and seriously lacks the energy in that of infest; after all the hype, I was very disappointed to find out what I had paid for.

For one thing, Coby Dick is now going by his real name, Jacoby Shaddix...and there is a lot more singing going on this time around. By now you have probably heard the first single \\"She Loves Me Not\\" on the radio, and this is your typical P-Roach tune, which I just love the chorus, and overall a very fine track. The rest of the album is fairly good, although it lacks the ferocious energy \\"Infest\\" had, in my opinion. Thats my reasoning behind the 4-star rating. \\"Decompression Period\\" really shows a softer side to P-Roach, as does \\"Black Clouds\\".

Amazingly the musicianship went down from their last album, boring guitars, bleh drumming and bass? Jacoby Dickens or whatever he decided to change his name now decided to drop the rap ability and decided to sing melodically, problem is, he is a terrible singer. The songs mainly comply about problems about relationships that failed and his got old quick, my daddy did not show me enough love tyranny.

Well, I gave them a chance, and listened to the CD at a local shop. It's just more of the same people. I had some hope for them, but I guess this album just isn't my thing.

He seems to have relied heavily on previously published biographies of the Duke, the Duchess, and the British Royal Family in general, all of which a serious Windsorite will have already read.

This is statistically significant and is no accident.For although the authors fail to mention it, the main reason for this discrepancy is that the public schools are basically amoral. God, prayer, and even american tradition are absent from them.The separation of church from state has not kept religion out of the public schools. Far from it. Rather amoral secular humanism has become the de facto form of worship there.Among other things, this has removed much of the inner self restraint that traditionally kept students in line which in turn has lead to school shootings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shooting","review":"This book, gives a new perspective on school shootings. The author creates a new theory behind the roots of these happenings. It gives the background, accounts of students, faculty, community officials, and community members perspectives to these shootings as well. Overall, it helps the reader to put school shootings into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and insightful on the topic.","review":"This was a very interesting read on numerous issues surrounding guns and violence in America and more specifically as it relates to our children/adolescents. A lot of background and specifics about several individual school shootings take up a good portion of the book, but I find it all very engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't come","review":"I ordered it after I saw the author on TV after New Town. As psychotherapist,I was impressed by what she said about these teen boy mass murderers. I ordered it as a Christmas present for my step-son who is an assistant principal in an elementary school, but it was sold out. Guess a lot of other people had thesame idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A readable study on a difficult subject","review":"With the thwarting of yet another rampage shooting making headlines in Massachusetts, and one that allegedly involves the son of a chief of police, the relevance of Katherine Newman's study has been dramatically underlined. I read the book as the parent of teenagers and found it both chilling and informative. Chilling because it appears that the discovery of such plots is still often fortuitous. The excellent analysis of why these shootings occur gives no easy reassurance but does offer some help for us to understand and, hopefully, points to some ways in which we can help abort other shootings. \\"Rampage\\" is informative because the authors study not just what led to the news headlines but include an examination of how the communities coped in the aftermath of the tragedies. The book is easily accessible to non-sociologists without being sensationalist in tone. I hope it is being read by many educators and parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"Very bad product. Not work. The company say that is a new tecnologic but is not a good equipment.

One reviewer claimed that it was slightly more explicit than a standard \\"Playboy\\" film. It is not. It is less. There is no more explicit nudity than what could be found in a rated-R movie. It's just more frequent. This is also not a good movie for couples since it involves arguments and cheating. Only one scene was related to voyeurism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xtras better than the show","review":"This DVD was a huge disappointment. The acting is cheesy and the plots dont go anywhere. This title has more talk then scenes. It switches back and forth during the talking to the skin scenes that are like 20 seconds of viewing which acts like a cold shower to the viewer.

This movie franchise pushes more you-know-what than an incontinent elephant. OK, this one doesn't have Vin Diesel (who gets my award for Worst Actor Ever), but it still has all the social significance of the Anna Nicole Smith show. I mean, really, was that car getting run over by the tractor trailer supposed to look even REMOTELY real? It looked like it was made of plastic. Also, let me guess: no plot? Didn't think so.

He is that bad.But beyond that the movie is semi-watchable.The Skyline race at the beginning was the highlight of the film and the rest just went downhill. The cars rocked in the first one from old school muscle to tricked Civics and Supras. What do we get in the sequel? Two Mitsubishi stinkers.Did Mitsubishi pay off the director or something to have their dying car lines in the movie?All in all it was an ok popcorn movie but it is a total waste when compared to Diesel and the first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fast and The Furious is way better than this one","review":"I cannot feel the quality of the film, although there are expensive cars. The story line is so so and the charactors didn't put much effor during filming. In The Fast and The Furious, I can feel the love, the friendship, the leadership and the emotion of Dominic's heart. In this movie, I felt that those racers are more like \\"gangs\\" rather than \\"teams\\". The friendship between 2 main charactors is just too weak to hold the story up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Vin!!???","review":"This film seriously lacks the prescence of Vin Diesel. It gets by without him, but most of the coolness that was Fast and Furious is gone. Paul Walker can't carry the film, and Tyrese is a substandard Diesel replacement, he's okay is his part, gets a few laughs, but he's got nowhere near the presence, nor the wry smile.The plot, well it's just a silly drug runners and cops story that becomes ridiculous by the end, heck even Tyrese said as much in the outtakes.The cars - They suck, I'm sorry but the Supra in no.1 kicked [rear] over the big Mitsubishi product placement that is 2Fast 2Furious... I mean the Lancer EVO 7??? hardly gets the blood running, it looks like a compact family car.The girls - There is a well freaky looking chick in this film that drives the Honda S2000, sigh, where is Michel Rodrigues, she was kewl (and a great match of Vin).Anyway, it's still ok, but they should have just paid Vin whatever he wanted, it would have been a better film for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"There was a lot more street racing in this, but it sucked.

Just sit back and enjoy the thrill of the race! Excellent visuals and special effects and I ain't just talking about those fast cars either, I mean the hot fast men too. Paul Walker is to die for a total babe-magnet - sex on a stick!! mmmmmmmmmmmm! He is a very talented actor and oozes charisma and charm. He keeps your eyes glued to the screen and your bott firmly on yer seat. Tyrese's character Roman, is a lovable rogue whose boyish charm and sexy smile leave you wanting more. It also had an element of playground humour between Brian (Paul) and Roman (Tyrese), which was comical at times, this also made it fun to watch. A definite MUST SEE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...","review":"I watched this movie because...to be honest...I was bored andmy husband recently bought the DVD.

Why would people put 800 pounds of junk like stereo equipment and playstations on a race car. Weight robs speed.Also I love the ricer graphics.

Also - there are many scenes where people aren't wearing seatbelts. This is supposed to be marketed to young people, and I don't mind the illegal racing, but at least wear your freakin seatbelts people! I know street racing is alive and well, but the movie doesn't seem very realistic - they weren't even winning enough money to cover the damages on their cars from the race!

This is not the kind of movie anyone should consider their favorite, it pan handles to the audience, merely repeats the first films action (fast cars + trucks = crash) and dares to go on without Vin Diesel. To say the least the first one was also a steaming pile of hollywood excrament but this one surely takes the cake on useless and horrible sequels. If you are so sorely in need of seeing cars watch Nascar or for the luv of pete play a racing video game, those two things combined will feed your need for speed without giving into movies such as this.

I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars!

Is nothing short of brilliant.What I liked most was the raw honesty in this book. From the compelling beginning where the parents admit they \\"never had a clue\\" (scary) to the denial that anything was really bad to admitting that life was never going to be the same again.A wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"I wouldn't have bought this book on my own, but I picked it off my girlfriend's nightstand and read it cover to cover. My little sister is an addict and though it was really hard for me at times, reading Mia's parts gave me hope and a better understanding of what my sister's going through and how I can maybe help her. I was also really surprised to find that a lot of the things Mia learned about herself in the specialty school she was in apply quite a bit to my own life - gulp :)I rarely read anything besides comics and the sports page, so if I'm saying to read this, you know it's gotta be good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching, and fantastic","review":"This is a wonderful book. Hard to read, especially when you're a parent of teens, but beautifully written by the mother, and heartwrenchingly written by the daughter who went through hell and back.I loved the book and got a lot out of it. I would recommend it to any parent of teens. Amazing !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"This story saddened, surprised, shocked and touched me. When my book club read this early last year, I wasn't able to attend, so I shelved the book. Am I glad I dedided to pick it up a year later. I feel like I learned a lot about relationships from hearing this mother/daughter story. It reminds us all to hope and stay strong in any family crisis because afterall, blood is thicker than water!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Situation Critical: Parents, Read This Book","review":"This memoir by both a mother and a daughter rivals the novel \\"Cost\\" in its picture of the way drug abuse ravages a family. The entire family must heal in order for the child too find a way to change, accept, feel safe and loved. This was an amazing book that I recommend to every parent before the kids hit their teens, to all families coping with drug abuse, and to those in recovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopeful","review":"I found this very true to life.

Passionate, heart wrenching and unflinching in their honesty, this talented mother and daughter take us on an intimate journey as they literally go through hell and back to reclaim their true selves and each other. Their unforgettable story unfolds through Claire and Mia's interwoven voices with resounding intensity, honesty, humor, and courage.Kudos to Claire and Mia Fontaine for breaking the silence that all too often shrouds incest and drug abuse, and for having the courage to open up their hearts and lives so that others may know that they are not alone. A must read for every woman! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mother Daughter book ..... EVER.","review":"This is a wonderful book about the healing process between a mother and daughter. Healing this relationship (mother/daughter) can be quite challenging and this book will give you the hope and the peace that it is quite possible.It is a well written, reflective book about how even as a Mother you may think you are doing everything right... only to find you have lost your child. It is also written from the daughters point of view, that when you need the most help and you feel lost, reaching out to your mother is possible (hard, yes) but possible.This mother daughter team is brilliant. They are working in an area of relationship that every woman can relate to. Why? Because the mother daughter relationship is quite hard. But important. And quite powerful.This is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should know","review":"I bought the book because i have a 3 year old daughter and i was excited to read a book about a mother daughter relationship, especially one that covered the difficult teen years that I have to look forward to! What I didn't expect after just reading the first chapter was all the disturbing parts regarding her 3 - 4 year old being sexually molested by her drug addict husband who obviously grew up in an environment that made that horrendous behaviour seem permissible. Had I known I was going to be subjected to reading that, I would not have bought the book. I understand that if you have a child going through drug issues it is probably an insightful book to read. But I would have liked to have known that there was incest involving a toddler in this book before I bought it. I found it too troubling to read. Just a heads up. Maybe it wouldn't offend others as it has me but I thought I would at least put it out there. I am returning the book tomorrow as I can't read anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy subjects but very interesting","review":"Although this book touches on some very serious and heavy subjects (incest, drug use, run always, rehab), it does do in an interesting format.

Basically the whole story is about 12 year old seventh grade student named Elizabeth Norah Chapman who got her with after desperatly wanting to attend a boarding school after reading many books about children her own age and younger who attend one. Eliza excepts a normal peaceful school but those thoughts crumble after her roommate Helen Beauchamp starts the daring game involving her other roommates, Pam, Carrie, and Jean a.k.a.

Excellent!:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daring Game, The","review":"This book is the worst i've ever read. It moves much too slow and doesn't live up to its title, The Daring Game.

Since there's no power switch on the charger this can only be accomplished by unplugging waiting 10 seconds and replugging the charger. On top of this, the batteries give very short run time and a full charge barely lasts 2 days when left unused in the drill. The LED is easily turned on with the user being unaware and will run down the battery in a short time. Drill works great, batteries/charger do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Funny, Funny !!!!!","review":"My husband and I can't get enough of this book.

We are planning to get more copies to give as Christmas gifts. Check it out, you won't be disapointed :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of marriage jokes grounded in bitterness","review":"This book is another one in the very long line of lengthy jokes about marriage. Many common words are \\"defined\\" in the context of marriage and to maintain the joke, they are almost exclusively negative. Some examples are:Imaginative - Any idea you come up with to enliven sex which your spouse funds too gross.Jello - The only food that your husband ever learned to cook.Joint bank account - Checking account which allows you to spend your spouse's money any way that you want.Period - The five days of the month when your wife does not have PMS.While I acknowledge that some people will find these jokes funny, I did not. I find marriage jokes to be grounded in a sense of bitterness that removes any humorous aspects that they may have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship, love and faith","review":"How do friendship, love and faith carry us through when life throws us a curve we were not expecting. Leslie Gould has written a powerful first novel, telling the story of two best friends, Jill and Caye, and how they deal with the every day issues when illness threatens the very existence of the life they have come to know. What happens when Jill finds out she has cancer? What is the secret she is keeping? How does Caye and her family cope when she devotes so much time to Jill? These are all questions that Ms. Gould answers with real candor. Anyone who values the importance of friendship, love and faith will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, good price and somewhat fast delivery","review":"I would like to rate the whole experience positively, because I was pretty satisfied with the order.

Isn't there enough dishonesty in the world already? I quote, \\"Serendipity is putting a quarter in the gumball machine and having three pieces come rattling out instead of one--all red.\\" Does this mean when I pay for my groceries with a $10 bill and the clerk gives me change for a $20 bill it's \\"serendipitous\\", and I'm not supposed to point out the mistake and return what's not rightfully mine? Teaching \\"those only knee-high\\" that it's their right to get more than they deserve will only lead to more dishonesty and \\"you owe me attitude\\" in the world. What was she thinking? Honestly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too graphic....","review":"I must admit that I only watched about 45 minutes of the first episode, but that was because the torture scenes were WAY too graphic- hence the low review. I love BBC crime dramas and am not squeamish at all (loved \\"300\\", \\"Prime Suspect and \\"Cracker\\" for example) but some of these scenes were so over the top that I was unable to enjoy the movie; it made me sick to my stomach. I realize that the episode was about a serial killer, but I have watched many other movies with similar themes that did not cross the line like this one. I do wish I had sampled one of the other episodes to see if it was a little more watchable. I did like both the leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CHEMISTRY","review":"Wire in the Blood is a good crime drama with a psychologist and detective inspector working together to solve crimes. I like the show, but calling it fantastic or brilliant is over the top. Robson Green and Hermione Norris work well together, and the chemistry is good. In fact, that chemistry is the best part of the show. The \\"pilot\\" story is the best of Season 1. Stories 2 and 3 were not as tightly written. Even in the pilot story, though, the gruesomeness is more implied than visual, possibly a reason that 2 and 3 are not as intense as 1. But, probably nothing can live up to the image of a psycho wrapping a cone-shaped object with foil and barbed wire (You can't understand this statement until you've seen the show.).I bought Season 1 and have watched it through three times. I see on the internet that Norris leaves after Season 3. Don't see how that void can be filled. Buying Season 2 next.Note that a series is three stories, each divided into two parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The UK are the best","review":"Wire in the Blood shows once again why the UK are masters at crime and police procedurals. Robson Green is absolutely amazing as Dr. Tony Hill. The crimes are graphic, torturous, horrific and dark. They show what pure evil truly is. This is the type of programming that we will never find here in the U.S. since we are considered much too soft, prudish and I guess they just figure we can't handle it. Wire in the Blood is dark and gritty and it's a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegantly Odd","review":"A quirky irresistable series essential to true mystery loversand psychological thrillers. Brilliantly produced and acted, every episode isa teriffic night at the movies. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent series...","review":"Green's character of Tony Hill, written by Val McDermid, is a wonderful blend of intelligence, compassion, single-mindedness and utter obtuseness when it comes to interacting with people who are NOT serial killers. These videos bring him to life in as clear a manner as John Thaw's \\"Inspector Morse,\\" but in a much more graphic style.The stories are all well-written (with a complexity reminiscent of the Prime Suspect series) and the cinematography is griping and memorable. The scene in the first series of wind turbines viewed from a passing train is one which I will always carry with me.I've enjoyed Green in previous series, but nothing has come close to The Wire in the Blood, for pure quality writing, acting and impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic torture and terror murders","review":"I found the Wire in the Blood series too graphic and full of torture for my taste. Homosexuality and torture are parts of every story, and mystery is overshadowed by a sense of deviate behavior. Not good viewing for healthy minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"One small addition...","review":"I wrote an earlier review...This is still a series worth buying. I did notice on Series 1, the dvd is in full-screen while it was aired in wide-screen on BBC America. Most people would never notice this, but composition is off in some scenes and lighting is blown-out in other ones.It's a small and subtle change to certain portions of the episodes.Still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"If you are not a fan of Robson's, that's your loss. Everyting he does is well written, well acted, filmed and edited. He's courageous for bringing jobs to the NE Region of Scotland, and works tirelessly to keep his region in the news. If you are adventurous and not afraid of what goes bump in the night, view the entire series of WITB 1-6. Series 7 is in production as of November 2009, and I cannot wait.Cheers to all of Robson's fans and to those I think will become fans.A loyal and grateful watcher of British media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sickly Entertaining!!!","review":"The writers for this show must be psychopaths.

I wanted to direct it, or at least play the part of Chip. Hmmmm. Any takers?

As with The Boys From Brazil, Levin's \\"This Perfect Day\\" would seem prophetic if written today, and is astounding considering it predates 1970. Before picking this up, I had no idea Levin had written any science fiction, and was pleased to find this book as thought-provoking and thrilling as his others. The writing was tight, the characters realistic (even for the future), the tone modern, and there were twists throughout. It also ends on a happier note than do many of Levin's other works.Incidentally, \\"This Perfect Day\\" reminded me a little of (Heinlein's) Stranger In A Strange Land in terms of its sexually cavalier mores (it is surprisingly passionate), and- as with Stranger's \\"grok\\"- in the way some of its catch phrases should be (are (?)) a part of the science fiction vernacular (\\"Fight Uni\\"; \\"Christ, Marx, Wood, and Wei\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need this book now more than ever!","review":"This book is a perfect example of a governmentally controlled, utopia gone bad. \\" This Perfect Day.\\" Find it and read it and if you can, pass it on to young people. \\"This Perfect Day\\" may help others to think for themselves. We need this book now more then ever. Politically correct thinking, loss of personal freedom through fear of terrorism, wanting the government to take better care of us. All of these trends are on the rise and lead to totalitarian life.Ira Levin though writting \\" This Perfect Day\\" in 1969 was telling us and warning us about a world that is a possibility in the not so far away future. We are on the internet! Can the imagined Uni be so far behind?It is a crying shame that this book is out of print. It shouldn't be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!!","review":"This is my favorite book of all time, I own 3 hardback copies of this book and am so thrilled that it is now available for the kindle.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book In The World","review":"First Ira Levin book I ever read. I read it first when I was 13. I have since read it about 6 times. It still manages to be the best book I've ever read, and I doubt any book will ever touch it. Yes, it is similar to Brave New World and 1984, but similar is all it is. It is its own story and it is SO SO SO SO easy to read.

It will make you a rebel! FIGHT UNI!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I was looking for a really good book and naturally went with one that I found in the \\"top rated\\" category. Maybe it is just my morals but I'm pissed that the hero of this book is basically a pig. There is an instance of rape in this book which I understand won't bother some people, but others it might. So heads up.Also, if you're one of those people that finds flaws in storylines (\\"this could never happen because of this\\") then this book will drive you insane.I love dystopian novels but this was not one of them.

Yeah, beat the viewers over the head since they are too stupid to get it that he's traumatized.Several scenes started or ended without explnation. Scenes of, say, a card game, a game of catch with a soccer ball, and others - were supposed to be on different days but were clearly all shot the same day with actors wearing the same clothes, positioned the same and with props in the same place.I could go on but why bother.The story concept was a good one and needs to be told, but this was an embarassing attempt and casts a terrible light on Korean cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray CD, The Other Side","review":"My sister was pleased with the CD, The Other Side, by David Gray.

I was thinking it would be about bodywork in general - therapeutic touch in the sense of massage, chiropractic, structural work, etc.However, it is more about the 'laying of hands' or just simply energy work - no touch involved.

I really enjoy learning about Washington and politics and Denny Hastert seems to be your every day kind of guy who has inside access to real power in Washington. His September 11 story is worth the price of the book alone but the story about how an average school teacher turned Speaker of the U.S. House almost became President of the United States is unreal. HOW COME NO ONE KNEW THIS?!!?!Amazing. Gotta read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"state of Japan's parties 1960","review":"The book provides a usually rather dry snapshot of post-war Japanese political parties, stopping at 1960. There are some prescient statements, \\"...the Liberal Democratic and Socialist parties are likely to dominate the national scene for the forseeable future.\\" Not a bad prediction, considering the Liberal Democrat takeover was only three years old in 1960, and the \\"one-and-a-half\\" party system lasted another 24 years after 1960.It's hard to get a lot of post-war Japanese history in English as \\"history\\" rather than \\"current events\\" (John Dower's excellent Embracing Defeat is an exception) so I like to pick up outdated current events books like this one -- unfortunately, the book is awfully dry and technical, lots of raw data and charts. Some interesting analysis, but I ended up skipping a lot of pages. Cut to the chase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great PR book!","review":"Another book that once I started to read it got me hooked all the way to the end.

This time I viewed the inside of the book that is provided, and compared the Spanish to the English and it was the correct version. What i got in the mail was merely a small Analysis and study of the author, work and his age. This is not useful to me, and I was falsely led to believe I was getting a book that I didn't receive.

As an academic, I was very pleased with the author's thorough examination of the history of women and dance. It was enlightening -- filled with numerous facts, perspectives, and accounts that I had not come across anywhere else. And the photos/pictures!! This book tells a beautiful story through images and words. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman Dance!","review":"This is a wonderful book for any woman who is searching to uncover her own hidden \\"feminine\\" gifts thorough dance, or for one who is searching out all woman history to re-build her own.

Much substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman Dance a renewal of sacredness","review":"This book is very informative and wonderfully and intelligently written. I recommend it to any one that is interested in connecting with the ancient art of sacred movement. The illustrations are beautiful.

Its time for women to unite and bring peace back into this world..This book is a great place to begin in understanding the importance of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite superficial","review":"I do not want to talk about how the author handled all other \\"sacred dances\\", but, since I am well-familiar with the Indian classical dance, I do have a clear impression that the author, although apparently quite intellectual, has a very superficial (typical of a western rationalistic mind) idea of what the real classical Indian dance practices are about, and has no idea at all of what is Natya Yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losely Understood","review":"As much as I want to rave about Tertium Organum, I can't. The early chapters of Tertium Organum build such a grand beginning with expectations that a deeper understanding would be found. What I discovered is a light weight conclusion that gave way to a religious experience that only suggests the author couldn't answer his own question. I can not recommend Tertium Organum. The author is well educated and has a talent for expressing his opinion in lanuage easily understood. Yet, what he promises for the reader at the begining, is not what the conclusion resulted in. I advise caution when attempting to embrack on this quest, and warn that though the author makes strong points, I felt less sure of my understanding of what I read and more upset with the lack of ability to end the conversation strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscience. Beware!","review":"I wrote a longer review, but it got deleted. So I'm writing a short one and hope to post a longer one later. I believe Ouspensky should not be taken seriously, because there are parts in this book where he treats objective subjects like mathematics and makes grave errors in reasoning to support his ideas. This is more disturbing in light of the fact he is called a mathematician. He mentions Aristotle, Bacon, and Einstein, but this does not mean his thought is on par with theirs. The fallacies in his logic cannot be excused by saying that people in his time were naive. After all, Einstein must have understood his own theory of relativity. Ouspensky even makes a mistake to the effect of, \\"If a square has length x, then it has area x to the xth power.\\" (It should be x squared.) If his mathematics cannot be taken seriously, why should his philosophy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is indeed pseudo-science","review":"I agree with the previous review. The math is faulty, the philosophy the same. Ouspensky is a hack. This book is a mere curiosity, nothing more! Reader beware: The Fellowship of Friends, an international cult uses Ouspenskian philosophy as its centerpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for higher dimensional truths","review":"P.D. Ouspensky lucidly and along definite philosophical reasonings guides the reader from our 3-dimensional world to higher dimensional realities. As humans we perceive the \\"World\\" not as it is, but rather as our perceptive faculties communicate it to us. Therein lies the difficulty of comprehending higher orders (our own hard wiring). Ouspensky's greatness is his ability to elucidate higher truths by straightforward analogy and reasoning. The author marries the ideas and teachings of many great thinkers into one multifaceted format. Mystical teachings are explained from a scientific slant and revolutionary scientific Ideas lead to a mystical end. The ultimate aim is to lead the reader to the ultimate truth of \\"THOU ART THAT\\" or \\"I AM\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best book of morden world.","review":"Best book must read .We will find many things that is impossible to find in another book.

The authors seem self-absorbed and must think that everything they say is really cute and dripping with insight. Maybe \\"cluetrain\\" would have been prophetic had it come out 5 years earlier, but I was left feeling \\"so what?\\" and \\"that's all you could think of?\\". And if it was all they could think of, they were successful at delivering in the most stupefyingly annoying way. Reminds me of some over-the-hill pot-bellied geezers who hobble with their guitar to the stage with the assistance of walkers and beller \\"ARE U READY TO ROCK?\\" and fall down. A joke compared to truly visionary and skillfully crafted works like Gilder's \\"Telecosm\\", this sad drivelly rag should be propelled to an obscure cut-out bin and their website disbanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite thought provoking","review":"While this book was a little too earnest and revolutionary for my taste, I no longer rate books on their overall style, delivery, etc... If I get one or two ideas that turn on a lightbulb in my head, that's good enough for me. And this book more than did that. This book was like music for the soul. I had long ago realized I was burned out on empty, disingenuine sounding marketing rhetoric and that the idea of conducting business without decency and ethics just did not work for me. So this book was like balm for the soul in that it a) reassured me I was far from alone in the deaf ear I had developed toward 'marketsy speak\\" b) convinced me that a new age of business is dawning - one that will promote honesty in how an average company conducts its affairs internally and externally and one that will restore dignity to the average worker.

It puts into words what many of us have understood, but up until now have been unable to articulate. The problem I have with this book is the tone that assumes that no one else is smart enough to have figured this out and their continual references to \\"scared middle-aged white men\\" is boderline militant feminism and racism. One last comment is the fact that they act like they have all the answers and the way current business is run is all wrong. Well companies have been doing pretty good long before this book came out, so they are doing something right. Lastly the way they promote openess to information amongst people and companies borders on communism. \\"Let information be free\\" they cry.

This is 'Wired' at its earliest, headiest and most childish. In fact it was Kevin Kelly, the editor of 'Wired' whose writings in the early nineties were naive, perhaps, but fresh and challenging. But now that's just old hat. The world has moved on. At precisely the point where the 'new economy' has to get real and start thinking about serious issues of business models, legal framework, and value creation, these authors treat us to an incoherent and intellectually lazy diatribe about how everything's different.

It seems more like a plea than an analysis. It's obvious that the authors would prefer a world where they can just work at what they think is fun, chat with folks online and not deliver anything that the customer cares about.They do make a few good points, but, unfortunately, that's overshadowed by the incredibly stupid remarks that they toss in frequently. It's very clear that they have no idea what management is really like, or what the real purpose of business is. It's too bad.My recommendation is not to waste your money.

A lot of rhetoric that sounds great, and it may make a lot of managers happier to read this and think they're suddenly savvy 21st century marketers, but I think all in all maybe you should just get the less pretentious Tony Robbins book that this so desperately wants to be. That's the category this book fills for me: Books people read to feel smart, that don't really have insights that are as great as they think they are.After all, if this book really was revolutionary, would it really be selling to the very businesspeople it aims to educate as much as it is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets throwup on their brain","review":"Nail the thesis to the church door, unfortunately the four pluperfect authors are still marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like, duh.","review":"I originally bought this book thinking that it might contain some useful business information.

A marked drop in discomfort levels! However, after a couple of miles/hours, the heat generated by my feet seems to cause even these highly rated orthotics to fail.

If you take the insole out there is room in the shoe, but you don't have any sole or cushion in the front of the shoe, and the transition from the orthotic to the sole of the shoe is uncomfortable.

Many doctors prescribe these by the Spenco Number, 0, 1, 2, etc., not by shoe size. So, when you try to order, you are not sure you are ordering the correct Spenco number that your doctor wants you to use. In my wife's case, the Doc want's her to use a #1, which is supposedly for women's shoe size 5/6, even though her shoes are 9/10! See the problem? The vendors for these products should show both the Spenco numbers as well as shoe size info to avoid confusion and facilitate ordering the correct one.

It gives a history of the language from its introduction in 1887 to the late 1980's. It also has a textbook for learning the language and a small, but good dictionary. Perhaps its greatest strength is that it combines these other elements with a selection of short readings. If you are only going to buy one textbook on Esperanto then Teach Yourself Esperanto or Step By Step In Esperanto would be a more complete choice.

Its history of Esperanto has no information of anything happening since 1981 (despite the renaissance that the Internet has given the Esperanto movement), and the glossary has no computer/Web/electronic terms. The only difference I could discern between it and the second edition was a one-paragraph biographical note about the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice for your _second_ Esperanto book...","review":"This book is divided into four parts. First is an extended essay on the language and the movement, past, present and future--good information for the newcomer. Second is a ten-lesson \\"basic course\\" that covers the gramar and hits the high points of usage--the lessons are acceptable, but not outstanding. Third--and the real strength of the book--is an intermediate-level reader of texts, with notes and commentary. Last of all, a word list that makes up a reasonable \\"my first Esperanto dictionary\\" before buying, say, the Wells dictionary. There are better choices for a first book on the language--in particular, the Teach Yourself entry--but I think this book is hard to beat for the _second_ book you put on your shelf, to expand your skills and deepen your understanding.

There are not nearly enough examples and the chapter on ADO.Net is woefully inadequate.

Though it had its moments, to me it was more like the cheesy, low-budget after school specials I remember as a kid, and it lacked originality and believability. What's more, it had a predictable ending. Stevenson Robertson did a convincing job, but his overdone and overly loud voice grated on my nerves as did the way that his friend interpreted everything he said. Yet in some important scenes, the actors' voices could barely be heard, such as the scene where the doctor is talking to Robertson near the end about his friend's condition.

No-one would argue that parents should avoid fostering their children's intellectual curiosity, or discussing with them such topics as dignity of every human being.In the last chapter (about God), Boteach disregards other religions and world-views in favour of Judaism. To make things worse, he includes lenghty political tirade praising America for being \\"quick to take its vision of faith, democracy, and government to all corners of the globe, by force, if necessary\\".

So I knew what to expect with the 'Sheep Chase' but I was terriblly disappointed. The writing seemed amateurish throughout most of the novel. The 'Sheep Chase' has characters that seemed to just drop out of the book suddenly for no plausible reason (The Girl with the Ears). And the strange power of her ears is never fully explained or even demonstrated in the book. The first chapter of the novel doesn't really seem to have anything to do with the rest of the story. Several of the characters seem to do things that are 'out of character'. For example, the mysterious 'Boss' Assistant' who is so powerful and rich (with a host of servants) and demanding agrees to take care of the protagonist's cat. This just seemed somewhat peculiar. Also, the 'Sheep Man' is one of the most unconvincing characters I've ever run into in a book - even one of this type.

Well, maybe an in field home run. His effortlessly fluid voice and cross-sensual similes will satisfy your brain. I will say though, The Wind-up Bird Chronicles was a little more ripe than A Wild Sheep Chase. I'm not sure if it's the writing or the English translation (Wind-up Bird translated by Jay Rubin; A Wild Sheep Chase translated by Alfred Birnbaum). If you want to read your first Murakami novel, I'd recommend The Wind-up Bird Chronicles to start.

I found the ending quite unexpected and it left me hanging with a few unresolved issues.

It's like an incredible roller coaster you never want to end. This is an entrancing plunge into the vast world that exits just below the surface of what we perceive as the everyday, a world brimming with delightful insanity and flavor which, though never acknowledge is what truly adds flavor to our lives. Murakami's everyman protagonist is plucked out of his mundane existence and shown first hand how bizarre and deep this mundane world can truly be if you're willing to peer beneath the surface.

I must however give him due credit here for this book, the first Murakami book I read, though I'm not sure I would read it again if that makes sense. I think I was uncomfortable the whole time I read this book, but perhaps you will love it.This book is pure entertainment. The reader will be quickly immersed in a trippy, nightmarish wonderland of modern Japan. Perhaps its comparable to Alice in wonderland where \\"Alice\\" is a middle-aged Japanese man and \\"Wonderland\\" encompasses an acid-trip OD of neverending hallucinations, mysteries, and metaphors you probably won't understand.

This was the first book of his I read, but I read quite a few others since. This is one is still one of my favourties. I really liked how westernized the heroes were in their daily actions and habits, yet how that made them only more non-western, more japanese, more human. Contrasts of all types abound. Writing is strong, Mr. Murakami is a great writer and Alfred birnbaum did an amazing job translating. The language is fluid, forming itself on my mind and adding an atmosphere and context all by itself without the use of words for descriptions, thoughts, and feelings.As with many other books, the story itself is somewhat secondary, the quest is more important than its result. In this book, however, I did not even thirst for a climax. I just savoured each page and hoped to find more of the same in other books by the author. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Knew Sheep Were So Interesting?","review":"While I didn't like this novel as well as IQ84, which I read first, I did enjoy the novel.

I realize this is probably the Japanese version of magical realism, but for some reason it was a tedious read.

In fact, Norwegian Wood is one of my favorite novels in general - check that out if you are just starting with Murakami."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disapointment","review":"This book contained far to many loose ends, extended descriptions of scenery, unrelated characters, to be a satisfying read.

It showed nothing of the expertise of Finnish troops defending their own country and there knowledge of local terrain that was a distinct tactical advantage to them against the Russians.I was not impressed with this movie, it could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking hubs","review":"I ordered for my vehicle and they didn't fit so I had to return them at my expense.

I highly recommend this one for anyone who is looking for a thriller with brains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A THRILLER WITH GUTS AND HEART","review":"I don't usually read this kind of book, but it was recommended to me, and to tell the truth, I found it riveting the same way \\"Vertigo\\" was riveting. From a web of lies Jones has constructed an intricate and subtle plot, believable yet larger than life characters, and a hero, Chris Neilson, who can actually rival the villian in brains and courage.The kidnapping of Chris' son and wife and the compromise he works out when no one believes him is sheer inspiration, and the thrills come a mile a minute.

It appears the author did little, if any, research, and just assumed the reader would would share his naivete.

They have a big brother called Big Joe who has problems. They also live with their mother Mrs Peaceful. Their dad dies in the book.Charlie and Tommo go off to war and fight together very well until Charlie braks the ruls just to many times and he gets the worst punishment there is.It is nice the way they all meet at the beggining.Sometimes it gets a little bit boaring.Over all its a great book and I would read it if I were you.By Ria Age 11"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and haunting","review":"Flew through the very good \\"Private Peaceful\\". It's a story about making difficult decisions and standing behind your decision. The story takes place leading up to and during World War I. Two brothers in England, very close but very competitive, decided to enlist to do their part, in spite of other obligations (one has a young pregnant wife, the other is only 15 years old, was secretly responsible for his father's death, and vowed to look after his mother). Neither are prepared for what awaits them. The English Army is not portrayed in a very friendly light in this book, and the reader will often marvel at the stupidity of those running the operation. In all, a bittersweet story but an easy read and poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful At War","review":"Michael Morpurgo's book, Private Peaceful, is an excellent work of historical fiction. The book was a bit slow at first, but once the novel continued on, it was a lot more interesting and engaging. I was impressed with how Morpurgo wove in historical details throughout the work. His descriptions of the trenches and the physical effects of being gassed, shot at, and other hazards, made the novel more real. The realism continued on as the reader also got an idea of the mental effects of trench warfare and the toll it took on soldiers. I think readers will appreciate Morpurgo's honesty in the portrayal of one of the worst wars in the world's history. He does not gloss over the difficulties, and yet the book is still suitable for adolescents as young as middle school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe this was canceled after only one season","review":"This is a clever time travel/police series, can't understand why it did not take off, very well written.

Comprehensive and well-researched, it divides this vast topic into sections dealing with the rise of the pilgrim tradition in Christianity, the most poplular sites and some not so well known, the joys and perils of the journey, the hopes and motivations of the pilgrim, signs and symbols, and the decline of the pilgrimage in the late middle ages. While I enjoyed reading this volume, which is beautifully illustrated, I also noticed numerous errors in vocabulary, choice of words (eg, \\"parody\\" rather than \\"parallel\\"), and proofing (someone was reported to have drunk the blood of St Thomas Becket!) These signs of sloppy editing were frequent enough to be distracting.

The acting is terrible all the way around. Jackie Mason is not funny (and in my opinion, never was), Robert Stack eschewed whatever dignity he had left when he agreed to take the part of a snobbish country-clubber, and one gets the impression that Dyan Cannon is only there for window dressing-or to make a few bucks. Dan Ackroyd was somewhat funny, but that doesn't redeem this worthless, bloated carcass of a movie in any respect.I'd give that fetid piece of dung of a motion picture zero stars if I could.

However, I strongly feel that this sequel has broken through all barriers of poor sequels in the past. The hilarious comedy has captivated the true cult era of the 80's, and the relaxed layed back manner of all the cast in the fresh surroundings of Bushwood Country Club, gives the perfect atmosphere for all viewers. Jackie Mason (Comedian) is simply all class, with his mumbling jewish accent. He is portrayed as a rich man who lives in what he thinks is style. When he attempts to join Bushwood, he is faced with extreme predjudice. I feel that this has one of the best casts since \\"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\\" Any questions...give me an e-mail!

Randy Quaid is by far the best thing in this movie and his negotiation scene about the(The Peter Blunt System)zoning laws is hysterical. Jackie Mason is no Dangerfield,but he does have a few moments.

The funny little gopher was funny to watch but everything else was horrible. This movie is full of senior actors and this has to be all of their worst work. Robert Stack is somewhat funny but not near of what he was like in Airplane. The worst has to be Dan Aykroyd he is an absolute terrible addition to the movie. He is a pretty good actor but I could not believe he acted this way in this movie. His role is so annoying and he sounds terrible and unfunny. This movie is an embarrasing mess to watch. Brace yourself for Dan Aykroyd though he is at his worst at a time where he was at the heat of his acting career."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ABOMINATION","review":"This film deserves no rating.

Jackie Mason shows he is a mediocre actor and should stay on stage with his one-liners. This film is supposed to be a comedy, but it isn't; it's a dull, sophomoric tale of a construction firm owner taking over Bushwood Country Club and turning it into a miniature theme park.

I purchased these shoes on August 23, 2007 in time to take them with me on vacation to Italy. I did a fair amount of walking through multiple cities and towns, probably more than two hours each day, always on pavement and in dry, mild weather. After the third day the metallic-style mesh on the side panels began to tear and unravel. After the fifth day the panels had multiple tears and stress lines were forming on the plastic cross-straps. After the seventh day a plastic cross-straps on one of the panels had parted, and others were cracked. The shoes were amazing in terms of comfort, ventilation (obviously), and grip.

Bought a pair for my husband who has problems with his arches and requires shoes that support his feet. ECCOs are the best fit for him. He wore them to work, which consists of him sitting in front of a computer all day, so no wear and tear on them. Within two weeks the mesh was torn and coming apart. Called Amazon, they gladly sent a new pair and we sent the old ones back. Within a few weeks, the second pair was falling apart and had to be returned for a refund. Amazon was awesome to deal with and we had no problems at all, but now we are shopping for a new pair of shoes for my husband. Too bad because he said that they were really comfortable shoes, just like you expect from ECCO.

Not pleasant, especially when you can find no one in the great city to vouch for your alibi! The police arrive, and their suggestion that you may be the culprit is enough to give you the creeps. And the police detective in charge happens to be a good friend from way back, who also does not seem convinced of your innocence. So, you have 24 hours to prove yourself and the clock keeps ticking into the moment when your life may very well be through! This great thriller/ noir author spun many hard boiled tales where the lead character seems guilty, and has to prove his innocence, a nice twist on the \\"innocent before proven guilty\\" idea on which our system is (supposedly) based.

It was an eye opener also that some of the innovations of the modern US aircraft carriers were designed by the British. However, I noticed that the jeep carriers of World War 2 were not included and that although the Forrestal class was discussed at lenght, the Kitty Hawk and JFK class of aircraft carriers were not part of subject. The Enterprise is a class of its own and the Nimitz class ships were very detailed. I would have preferred though that the latest and most modern and recently commissioned Ronald Reagan included in the film. The LHAs and LHDs were also not brought out when one can see that they resemble the carriers, they still are by and large aircraft carriers. Otherwise, the documentary was very good and I look forward to other films about modern ships not only of the US but also with the former Soviet Union."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone","review":"I have to participate on a lot of early morning and late night teleconferences so I bought this phone on sale for use at home because my portable phones never seemed to have enough battery life to make it through a long teleconference.

So I can rock it myself right? BARELY! It has very little motion and when it reaches its furthest point it makes a knocking noise that is sure to wake napping babies.

WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM THIS MANUFACTURER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chloe in the Afternoon","review":"The final installment in Rohmer's \\"Six Moral Tales\\" series, \\"Afternoon\\" is a wonderfully acted, deeply thoughtful meditation on the idea of marital infidelity. Frederic and his alluring afternoon companion voice every possible perspective on this ubiquitous temptation, enlightening us as to whether it is a desirable choice or not, and keeping us in prolonged suspense over what will happen between the two of them. Rohmer's understated, emotionally intelligent handling of this platonic affair makes for a thoroughly compelling \\"Afternoon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Chloe in the Afternoon","review":"The lackluster direction of Rohmer doesn't match the intensity of the themes involved. It's like he's trying to imply a movie instead of making one. Everything looks frayed, but it goes deeper than mere understatement: nobody in the movie has a spine and it's as if they're being held upward by strings. The movie has such a soft mushy feel to it that the erotic scenes don't feel erotic. It's like he's trying to take away all the fun, but wants to tease us at the same time. And that's okay in itself -- Bergman's Persona is the ultimate tease -- but here you're not sure who is in control, and the experience just becomes tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrappers are NOT what you're looking for!","review":"If you want to tell your boss you've mastered the Direct3D engine, just DON'T DO THAT!But you're free to tell him that you have a great knowledge with the wrapper classes the author wrote!And I'm sure that's NOT what you're looking for.However, using the author's wrapper classes is very clear and straight forward, and you may get to know some of the fundmentals of 3D graphics and Direct3D.Anyway, you won't get much informatin about the real world of Direct3D!!! And that's just too bad!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god it's out of print...","review":"If you want to learn the author's framework, then it is a passable book.

The characters are flat, and the Europeanized American protagonist makes it difficult to finish the book. Indeed, Vidal's leftist commentary on American history gets tiresome here. For better Vidal, try \\"Julian\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a newspaper article","review":"I approached this book hoping that Vidal's writing would make it a worthwhile read; nothing bores me more completely than politics. Unfortunately his writing rarely rises above the level of mere journalism and a passionless chronicling of powerplays undertaken by tedious old men. It was impossible to really care about the narrator and his hopes for his daughter for he was as shallow as anyone in the book (which is to say appalingly shallow) if only slightly more intelligent. Although the initial descriptions of New York City being remade were fascinating, the rest was simply tiresome to read and completely lacked vigour and narrative drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run of the mill","review":"Poorly written, poorly conceived and quite boring, maybe he wasn't well when he wrote this book....Gore -> you are not Thackeray!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Blood Conversation","review":"If you move in high circles and/or want to sharpen your conversation repertoir, this book is for you.

Otherwise you will find this book boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read unless you are a History Fanatic","review":"I couldn't get through this book because I found the characters uninteresting. Unlike Myra Breckenridge, which I couldn't put down and finished in two days. This one, though filled with facts regarding this time period, was boring. The characters are not interesting enough to hold you, and the history of the events clouds the motivations of all that are involved in the story. Read Myra Breckenridge, or his other books. Some other reviewers said Burr was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining History","review":"A great novel by even a greater author. Vidal writes with a lyrical tone that imparts a dual lesson in history and a women's struggle (desire) to advance. Perhaps Vidal's greatest triumph is that he draws you in with unsurpassed structure, content, facts, and tone that leaves the grocery store authors gasping for air. I bet you can't read just one of his books. 1876 will just be the beginning...Empire, Hollywood, and Lincoln will soon be added to your library. Of course, if you think Stephen King is some kind of genius...then you probably won't enjoy true literature.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to showcase a fascinating genre","review":"David Byrne's good taste and perceptive commentary introduced me to Brazilian popular music, and for this I am grateful. But his take on 'blip hop' -- these days, most people are calling it 'click-hop' or 'glitch' -- is surprisingly weak. There isn't a single track here you can't do without. It fails to show you why you should care about this really amazing sub-genre of electronic pop music. For a much better introduction to the genre, buy anything by Andreas Tilliander, who also records under the name Mokira."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perceptive, well-written time-travel baseball novel","review":"Darryl Brock has hit a home run with this well-crafted time-travel novel that revisits the early years of baseball in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Brock is transported from contemporary San Francisco to 1869, where he encounters the first great professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The resulting story is engrossing and is chock full of information and lore concerning the early years of our national pastime. As a bonus, Brock writes perceptively about social and cultural customs and attitudes from this earlier time, and this renders *If I Never Get Back* more than just another baseball yarn. The romantic aspect of the story borders on the corny at times, but within the context of the overall novel a bit of schmaltz is certainly forgivable. All baseball fans with an interest both in good reading and the history of the game will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Time Travel Book for Baseball Lovers","review":"Is this science fiction? It is science fiction in that If I Never Get Back is a time travel book like you have never read before. This book takes Sam Fowler from modern San Francisco back to the early days of baseball (post-Civil War) and the newly formed Cincinnati Red Stockings. What makes this book so interesting is the description of how baseball was played in 1869 - so different than what it is today even as to the way pitchers pitched.Sam Fowler begins riding the rails with the fledgling Cincinnati Red Stockings and their trip around the U.S. to play other early baseball teams. It also goes into the atmosphere of the time, as in the description when the team played in New York City in a park that now is no more in these modern times.Ah, but then it is also a love story. But is it unrequited love? Is it a lost love? And does Sam ever find her again?Great baseball book and would make a great movie also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman and Not a Baseball Fan","review":"I picked this book up at my Mom's yard sale, and had a hard time putting it down. I've been to a few baseball games, so I can visualize the game, but I'm not a fan by any means. Still, I enjoyed the protagonist; he is a rough and tumble guy--very masculine, and it was fun inhabiting a man's world for a while. I mostly skipped over the details of the ball games, but enjoyed the glimpse of 19th century life. I was convinced he was there, I was even persuaded that Mark Twain would have talked and acted as he was described. I think the author did his homework. Very enjoyable and highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time travel and the history of professional baseball","review":"If I Never Get Back combines the best qualities of both Jack Finney (in historically set novels)and George Will (in baseball history). At the same time, Brock includes the likes of Samuel Clements and the Fenians to add bredth to the story. The best of baseball history and time travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"This is one of the greatest baseball novels ever written. If you like baseball,time travel,romance and \\"rooting for the good guys\\" this is a book that will never get old. I'm sorry they never made a movie if it. However I doubt Hollywood could do it justice. Superb!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you appreciate fantasy","review":"The device used in this book to recount the saga of the Cincinnati Red Stockings is a good one, I suppose, if you gobble up fantasy. But the idea of present day person living in 1869 and knowing all that has happened since is a difficult one. Conrad Richter uses a similar device in The Waters of Kronos and I liked that book. But the author here did not succeed in making me believe in the scenario, and this got in the way of enjoying the book. But I suppose the scores and the like are authentic? The author could have at least given us a bibliography, if there is one. Thus those who wanted to know about the winning streak could check on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story that I read every year","review":"Like a few others, this one of the few books that I regularly read every year. All winter long, I look forward to the springtime so I can read this again (along with Two in the Field, which I think is is great as well). This is perhaps my only baseball fiction in my library of baseball books but it is my very favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will built up your interest in 19th century baseball","review":"I'm not the type of person who reads fiction or novels. But I like baseball, and I thought I could try a baseball novel.Right off the bat, this is a very nice work about 19th century baseball. If you wish to know what was it like to be a baseball player when the game turned from amateur status to pro, this novel will show you exactly how it was. Even if I know my baseball history very well, the book made a strong impression on me, regarding the lifes and time of Asa Brainard, George Wright, Andrew Leonard and so on...The story around Sam Fowler, a reporter taken back in time against his will, his also very good. It is well written, and your interest will built up pages after pages.Bottom line, if you like fiction, time-travel and baseball, this book was written for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I man goes unconsciousness and finds himself in 1869.","review":"The book, If I Never Get Back, is an extremely excellent book that will leave you at the edge of your seat the whole time you're reading it. It is a mind-blowing novel about a man from modern day San-Francisco with a horrible life. One day at the train station, he falls into deep unconsciousness and finds himself in 1869. He meets up with America's first all-pro baseball team, The Cincinnati Redstockings. He meets up with some pretty odd characters and even meets his hero, Mark Twain. I highly recommend this book about a man and his travel through time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"This is not only the best baseball book I've ever read, it's the best book I've ever read period.

Even considering the book was written in 1999, it is woefully outdated. No C++ strings, no C++ standard headers, no STL. Further, the book clearly targets Visual C++ 6.0 users. It has little value if you use a modern C++ compiler, whether that compiler is a more recent edition of Visual C++, or whether it is gcc, Borland C++, or any of the other options.Even ignoring those problems, the book claims to be for intermediate or advanced programmers.

It has handy pronounciation guideds and easy quick find phrases. The problem is most people in Wales speak English and so this book is really no use to a serious learner of Welsh.

I drill lots of 1 inch diameter holes to countersink the bolt heads that hold the rails on so I figured that it would make sense to get a carbide Forstner bit since it would last practically forever compared to the regular steel bit I use.I used this bit once and then put it away because it left a terrible, jagged edge on the hole and seemed to tear, rather than cut the wood fibers. I'm giving it two stars because the wood I use is fir which is quite prone to having long fibers tear all over the place so it's likely that this bit works great with hardwoods and the like, but really, my regular steel Forstner bit cuts a MUCH cleaner hole than this fancy-pants carbide door stop. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is for Amazon","review":"I got this on CD from Amazon and it was blank !so i really dont know what to do about it.Rom Tom was my friend and i really wanted to read his story :(*sadness*"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this hamburger","review":"My 5 year and my 1 year both love this hamburger.

I am sure Tibetans love it for it had been popular in Tibet for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"8th Edition the best ever","review":"This is a fantastic improvement over the excellent 7th edition. The author has added lots of data on the newer cars and updated various parts of the earlier cars (such as the latest data on the 911SC). There are many new photos and the layout again is improved, with bright and clear photos. If you want to learn the maximum amount about the Porsche 911 (and now the Boxster also), this is the book to buy. Clear, concise and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Size Fits All","review":"My review title may seem a bit odd, but it has significance to this work. The Used 911 Story is indeed a book for all Porsche enthusiasts--not just for those looking to buy their first used 911. Although having owned Porsches--mostly 911s--since the late sixties, I found lots of things in Peter's book I never knew about. He is very, very knowledgeable with regard to these cars and he has a unique and very readable style by which he shares this information with his readers. In short this is a great book if you're buying your first used Porsche, if you already own a Porsche, or if you're just interested in the marque. I recommend it most highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great place to start","review":"I recommend this book for anyone intested in Porsche. The model summaries alone are worth the price of admission. This book is written in a very easy to read style and one begins to feel almost as if a conversation is taking place with the author. Peter Zimmermann is very honest and generous with his copious amount of Porsche knowledge and the 8th edition is the finest version of the book yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow I am glad I read this book","review":"I have been a passive 911 shopper over the past several years and finally pulled the trigger on an 88 Coupe, I have read Zimmerman's book cover to cover many times and it really helped me narrow my choice of the year model that was right for me. It is an easy read and has invaluable information concerning the PPI (Pre Purchase Inspection). I think I bought the best car for my budget and this book helped me make informed decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"good practical information","review":". Good practical infomation. Well organized by year. Wish it was bigger with even more info. Probably not that useful for the advanced Porsche owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Guide for First-timers","review":"Though the author is clearly Porsche-passionate, this is a well-balanced primer on what to look for, what to look out for, and how to determine if buying the object of your desires is a good idea. The cost of this book is a very small investment that can pay big dividends down the road. It won't tell you how to perform a true pre-purchase inspection, but it will tell you how to decide whether proceeding to a PPI is a waste of time and money. I'm shopping for a used P-Car, and I find myself referring back to this book over and over. Combing internet forums and reading enthusiast magazines taught me a lot, this book filled in many of the remaining (and considerable) gaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read if you're considering a 911","review":"This is a must read if you're seriously looking to buy a 911, or just want to learn a whole bunch about the features and problems with each year. Zimmerman paints a very stark picture of what it is you're getting yourself into. In a way it made me think \\"gee, do I even want one of these?!\\" He documents all the common problems with each year. That said, it's a great reference for what to look for when purchasing, and what is involved with repairing some of these issues. Again, if you're buying, I would HIGHLY recommend you read this - it's a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porsche 911","review":"Excellent comprehensive book, well written and easy to understand. Good investment to read before you buy a used 911....I decided not to purchase a 911 after reading this entire book. Repairs can be dauntingly $$$$ so buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of the reviews","review":"After reading the reviews I came to the conclusion that this is a great book. Not only did the reviews confirm my fears of purchasing a used 911, ultimately saving me tens of thousands of dollars, the reviews were so good I also saved $25 by not having to purchase the book. They scared me to another car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy before you buy","review":"I bought Pete's book before I got my SC. The best thing about the book is that it does not pull any punches-it's like talking to your neighbor who's had 10 or 15 p-cars from each era and knows them all well. So there's little or no wishy washy language. My only complaint is that it could be a bit deeper and less broad but I understand that Pete was trying to appeal to all Porsche buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal Info","review":"This book has next to no valuable info on late model 911's. If you're in the market for a 997, 996 or 993 I would look elsewhere. Overall, I would not recommend this book as there really doesn't seem to be any useful advice most buyers of this car already wouldn't know. Not sure why it received so many \\"must have\\" reviews as the book itself isn't very impressive, photos are black and white and the amount content is equivalent to a magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulligan At His Best.","review":"Mulligan had an excellent back up band for this live set and the music just rides along on the energy of these muso's all enjoying themselves.

A powerful trip through modern culture that really holds nothing back. I was in a daze after reading this book but am so very glad I did. It gave me a whole new perspective on why modern society is so messed up. It condems the social construct that allows people to hurt and even distroy one another and our home the earth with out remorse. I totally love this book and wish more people would read it.Do Not read this book if you are attached to the cultural ideal of Men being automatically better than Women & that they only have worth if the are dominating somesome.I just wish I could write a review as brilliently as Jane Caputi writes so more people would check out this awesome book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Research & Great Writing","review":"This is an incredible book that appeals to more that just the local Colorado area in which it happened. The extensive research that went into this book is incredible. The writing is fascinating and extremely well done. Historical data is accurate and this book uncovers a tragedy that changed many lives. Also check out Mr. Secrest's other Colorado historical book Hell's Belles - great book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping true story","review":"For anyone interested in Colorado or prairie history, this is a must read. Using many sources, including interviews from the few remaining survivors, the writers detailed account of the thirty-three harrowing hours trapped in a bus with cardboard back windows and no heat, the resulting deaths and the aftermath, are a chilling account of a forgotten history. Included are the medical details, how the press exploited the ordeal, those who came to help and finally, what became of all 'The Children of the Storm'. Anyone who reads this book should also try 'The Children's Blizzard' by Laskin. Both clearly show what danger prairie children lived in on a daily basis, even into the early twentieth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one!!!!!","review":"This is a really stupid movie--acting is fair at best and the plot is very routine.

Now I am worried about buying any DVDs online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves less than one star","review":"Although delivered in a timely manner from the seller, the quality of the DVD, quite frankly, stinks. The video is very poor - almost like someone used a camcorder to record it from a TV broadcast and then burned it to DVD. The packaging looked as if it was nothing more than Saranwrap with the ends heated.Two stars for the plot and acting would be very generous. Jerry Reed could never be considered an actors actor but he is generally entertaining. Not so much in this one. Thankfully, Tom Selleck and Morgan Fairchild improved with time or their careers might have been pretty short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Magnum Sellick; best forgotten","review":"This 1979 made for TV film preceded Sellick's great and deserved success in the long-running TV series Magnum, PI. It recounts the adventures of two ex-cowboys who have left their ranch to see the world.If you are a fan, you might well enjoy this routine plot as they are mistaken for detectives and agree to search for a missing girl in Nashville. There is as much country music flavor to the film as can be fit in between episodes of their misadventures which may please lovers of country films.All in all, not a positively painful film to watch for someone trying to fill part of an evening, perhaps more enjoyable for someone with a particular interest in the star or the setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor script, direction, and acting","review":"Some well liked actors not doing well. Poor direction and script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concrete Cowboys VHS","review":"Bad Acting, Bad movie, Cool Car and some scenes, too bad, I should have known!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of big stars but ....","review":"This movie has lots of big stars, but I barely managed to stay awake to finish it. Tom Selleck makes a great cowboy, and Morgan Fairchild was good. But the movie was boring - I had the plot figured out halfway through and I'm normally not good at guessing - it was that obvious. Sure glad I purchased a used copy so I got it for cheap. I'll give it to Goodwill ... you couldn't make me watch this movie twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp cutter","review":"When I use a forstner bit, I appreciate those that cut cleanly to help prevent overheating.

Spend a little more for extra quality, and expect great results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Harvest of Fine Poetry","review":"I usually find contemporary poetry to be cryptic and deliberately obscure, but this wonderful, moving book of poetry avoided these characteristics while being elusive enough to be evocative, full of feeling, and suffused with moods perceived on the threshhold of the conscious and unconscious. The poems are warm and alive with the varied textures of life in mid-20th century rural Kentucky and yet this very concreteness opens up into the universal themes of the human experience in a quiet, understated manner. It is the mark of true inspiration, talent, and craftsmanship to strike these balances just right like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"WYSIWYG - item received is what was described and pictured on-line.

Get this album, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - An up and coming Star!","review":"Anne Heaton's music is wonderful.

Received many complements on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel, Great Translation","review":"I had four days to read this for a class, so I budgeted my time and decided to read around 70 pages a day. But this book was so enjoyable that I couldn't put it down, and I ended up reading 90 pages on the first day and the remaining 190 on the second. This is an engrossing story of devotion, betrayal, ambition, humility, crime, and innocence, told at a pleasantly brisk pace and peppered with profound observations on human nature. Goriot, Rastignac, and Vautrin are amazing characters, right up there with the creations of Dickens and Shakespeare.As for the translation, I don't know French and therefore can't judge Henry Reed's faithfulness to Balzac's expression. But as English, Reed's prose is flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience","review":"This is a great novel. Read it for an English course and enjoyed it. Great experience ordering book and was a great price. Recieved it in a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't feel compelled to read the classics","review":"While Balzac is clearly a genius and Reed does an incredible job translating, this book is not a good story, but just a platform to get the author's views on society and human nature across. There are exhaustingly long descriptions of places and characters, and endless monologues. In the end we don't find out what happens to one of the key characters, and it just seemed like a grand waste of time to me. Also, some of the prose is written in an unnecessarily flowery way making it a slow read where you are not even sure what he is talking about. I would have preferred to spend my time bouncing a ball off a wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Cookbook!","review":"This is my favorite cookbook for so many reasons. It has a variety of gourmet meals that cater to all appetites, the recipes are simple, quick, and healthy, and everything that I've made from it is delicious. In fact, I am ordering other books in the series right now, and getting another copy of this book for a friend.I would recommend this cookbook to anyone - beginner or expert cook. It doesn't require a lot of effort to create impressive meals quickly. Favorite recipes include Thai Chicken Wraps, Scallops with Bacon and Spinach, Honey Glazed Tuna Steaks, and Pork with Sweet Cherry Sauce.

Unfortunately, many chauvinistic Cubans have attributed to Marti qualities that simply were not there. One of them is that this novel by him was a masterpiece which, in reality, was nothing of the sort. In fact, Marti himself admits to it being an inferior work on his part, written simply at the orders of his editor as a filler for the newspaper that he was working. It says much for the author that he admitted the deficiencies himself. As such, the work is mostly of historical worth rather than a literary one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anemic.","review":"Alright, the singers hit every note perfectly, and it's ALMOST a complete recording, but this is one of the least moving recordings of Godspell I've ever heard. \\"Tower Of Babel,\\" the opening number, is particularly lifeless, especially compared to the version from the 2001 National Touring Cast CD. Get that one instead of this and you'll be a lot more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"GODSPELL... a (...) amateurish production cd.","review":"This is the worst recording of GODSPELL it has ever been my misfortune to own. I listened to it once, and promptly threw it away. I LOVE this show, and the new touring 2001 updated show... but this one. Did people get paid for this? It's so amateurish, it's ....

Really, this is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Recording","review":"I saw this cast during the off Broadway run. The approach to the show was fresh and the cast was solid from top to bottom. This is near the top of all the theater experience I have ever had. It was hilarious, sad, inspirational, and I'm not even Christian.Listen to the energy of Prepare Ye into God Save the People of this recording and try to sit still - you can't.If you have listened to the original cast album for 20 years or love the movie I can understand that the new take could be difficult to adjust to. Give it some time and you'll probably come to agree that this is the definitive recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool musical updated for 2000!","review":"this is a great version of this show. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that traditionalists who are enamored with the original \\"sound\\" of the show may not like it. The voices in this cast are truly amazing. This is not a basic piano accompaniment, but a true rock band. Some of the songs are done in really unique styles as well such as calypso, reggae, gospel...There is much more dialogue then in other recordings of the show as well. Definately worth getting if you're a fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This recording STINKS!","review":"After listening to the CD once I was incredibly disappointed. I listened again to give it a chance to grow on me, but it just confirmed my initial disappointment. Don't buy this CD! The eclectic mix of music styles incorporated into the \\"updated\\" version of the musical results in a CD that is just iritating to listen to. Read the other reviews and be sure to read between the lines (\\"takes time to grow on you\\"??).

This book explains all the basics in an easy to follow question answer form. Yes, O'Neil does make many references to his newspaper \\"Investor's Business Daily\\" but, \\"24 Essential Lessons...\\" is such an abridged version of his other work, it only makes sense that he would direct us to his other publicatons so that we can read his elaborated thoughts on any and every topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ad for O'Neil's IBD","review":"Bill O'Neil is certainly an experienced Wall Street trader, but he, talking bussiness, \\"tends\\" to use his books as an advertisement campaign for Investor's Business Daily, a newspaper he created and own.

Yes, it is really 10 mm! That is, about 1/2 inch. When worn, it is more dainty and tiny a pendant than I had expected (yeah, I saw the size listed here, but I don't think in metric!).On the plus size, this onyx and gold pendant seems to be high quality, has a nice weight to it despite the size, and nice craftsmanship.

As one reviewer noted, this one is a little soft and slightly dark but the images are clean and the color while slightly muted , takes on a kind of rembrantian hue and darkness; but not so dark as to spoil the color or mood. in some odd way it improves on the theme of the film.But it is not sharp; i dont think you will find that anywhere you look for this gem.

Again Amazon has failed to screen the product for an accurate assessment of what the customer is buying. This happened to Amazon's offer of \\"The Warlord\\" with Charlton Heston and now this.

Brando and his co-star, Carl Malden, are in their prime in this film about two bandits on the run from the law. Rio (Brando) ends up getting caught and going to prison in Sonora. Dad (Malden) escapes and betrays Rio. He ultimately turns respectable and becomes the sherrif of a small town. When Rio escapes from prison, he sets out for revenge.Malden is particularly good in this film. His homely intensity plays well against the Brando's concentrated sensuality. The chemistry between the two men is mesmerizing. Ultimately it is a tale of redemption, since Brando must leave his wicked ways in order to be worthy of a respectable woman's love. This is a terrific western that is now classic but must have been very unusual for its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD copy a disaster","review":"DVD much worse than VHS version.

I have only experienced the Madacy edition -- that's the one where the cover has the original poster, surrounded by a white outline and the actors' names below -- and it's terrible. I will be sticking with my laser disk until (or if) Paramount releases a studio version. My two star rating is therefore an average of a \\"zero\\" for the technical quality of the Madacy DVD and a \\"four\\" for the movie itself (which features some of the most memorable dialog ever in a western, which I understand was in no small part due to Ben Johnson -- Brando would ask him, \\"Ben, what's a better way to say that?\\" and Johnson would come up with some wonderfully colorful expression like \\"I hear there's dirt between ya\\" or \\"Don't be doin' her like that\\"). So pray for a studio edition, as this movie certainly deserves first class treatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some kind of samurai classic???","review":"The theme for this movie could be one of the classic samurai stories.

I really enjoyed this movie for its great cast--Brando, Malden, Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, Ben Johnson and others, the magnificent scenery of the Monterey Peninsula, and the revenge factor.

I actually play this everytime I'm in my car there are just a few song I like to skip though (the second song for instance but that's my taste)The delivery was quick and the condition the CD and DVD were in was spotless and great. The only gripe I have with it is that the CD doesn't play in all CD players, especially the old Australian ones due to it being an enhanced CD.Don't let the cover art of truANT throw you off as it is a rather good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Let Down","review":"I bought the album truANT thinking that it would be as great as ANThology.

Very easy to install, as well -- and I'm a newbie at this kind of thing (pumping gas was the extent of my mechanical know-how).

As a minimum, clean off after use with turpentine or mineral spirits, or other solvent, dry it, lightly oil, and wrap in a paper towel. It will last a lifetime.

I have been thinking the same thing the past year or so that I've owned this.It makes me think that we are truly living in a sad age when music is done on the cheap, and that fans seem to be just as apathetic as the musicians themselves.Not all is terrible, at least metal is on the upswing again, but its releases like this that are truly showing its a scary time in music.The album? Its classic early thrash seasoned with some incredible hooks and vocals.This \\"remaster\\"? It seems like they took the original songs, compressed them into mp3 format (or similar) and smooshed them onto the cd.I am 100 % serious with this assumption.

Original singer Neil Tubin's only disc (before being replaced by Joey Belladonna), his vocal performance ranks up their with the genre's best. Also in the band was bassist Dan Lilker, who went on to to form S.O.D. Nuclear Assault and Brutal Truth. The disc is a thrash metal classic with balls to the wall tracks \\"Deathrider\\", \\"Metal Thrashing Mad\\" and \\"Anthrax\\". Maximum damage done despite the terrible, hide-the-guitar production from Carl Cannedy (who at the time was fronting his own band called The Rods). Without question, this was Anthrax's finest hour (\\"Among The Living\\" running 2nd) and an essential disc to have in your thrash metal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Beginnings of True Thrash","review":"This is one of several albums that started the thrash metal genre. Along with Metallica \\"Kill Em All\\" Slayer \\"Show No Mercy\\" Overkill \\"Feel the Fire\\" and Megadeth \\"Killing is My Business\\" this was a revolutionary style in 1983-1984. I was in high school at the time of these releases, and they influenced me and millions of others to become diehard followers of this music. This is not Joey Belladonna singing. It is the raw voice of Neil Turbin who gave Anthrax a true edge. Even though I prefer the Belladonna Anthrax, this album deserves a place in metal history. \\"Deathrider\\" and \\"Metal Thrashing Mad\\" are classics. 20 years later, and I still listen to these songs with the same passion that I had when I first heard them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The origin of the New York thrash metal movement","review":"This is not only a classic album, but one of historical importance to 80's metal. There is some great material here and in my opinion, it has stood the test of time. Thrash is both heavy and fast and we find that here. I believe some of Charlie's greatest drumming is found right here and Scott Ian was a hungry axe slinger who was out to show the west coast that New York was down. 'DeathRider' and 'Metal Thrashing Mad' are standouts that are classic tracks in the metal genre. Throw in a blazing cover of Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" and you got a well rounded album that is fit for the pit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Thrasing Classic!","review":"Fistful of Metal is undeniably among the first Thrash records to ever break through. Highlights include Death Rider, Metal Thrasing Mad, Soldiers of Metal, and Death From Above. The band's best songwriting occured during this era, which was of course the Neil Turbin era. Neil offers the most towards this effort, as his vocals are truly wailing, reminiscent of Judas Priest's Screaming For Vengeance. Anyone who is a fan of this intensity, should go pick up Neil's new cd \\"Threatcon Delta\\" which kicks so much ass! I got it off his website (www.neilturbin.com) and for 15 bucks, I was brought back to when Anthrax was still capable of delivering the goods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great re-package of the vinyl version of the beginnings of anthrax","review":"This review is for the Vinyl 3x10 inch version of Anthrax-Fistful of Metal. What this truly is the same as the 2000 Fistful of Metal/Armed and Dangerous re-master CD that came out, but spread across a unique approach to vinyl, three 10\\" red vinyl records. The sound is what one expects from how they recorded back in 1983, loud, fast, and with a lot of treble. Overall, though, classic songs like death rider, metal thrashing mad, and soldiers of metal never sounded better. The Armed and Dangerous is also the same as the CD listing, and I really like this version of armed and dangerous on this album. Finally, the package on this I though was cool. It is a bit difficult to get the vinyl to of the slip sleeves, but the head with a fist coming out of it's mouth is cut out on the first flap and overlaid onto the anthrax logo on a black background, very cool.

Julie's father buys the town's newspaper business, to try to bring it back to life. The family suffers through many trials such as poverty, flood damage, and disagreements with other town folks. Because the story is realistic, it provoked different emotions within me as I read along. I felt a love for Julie and an appreciation for those who were involved in her life.

Julie now becoming a fine woman is dealing with her emontions of both a family and romantic nature. The main conflict in the story is within Julie herself, but the physical climax is when the area dam breaks. After this the whole town must pull together and become one again.

In an effort to make it water tight Momentum has made it very difficult to set the time, date and alarm. First you have to unscrew the crown. After that you pull the crown out to the first position for date/alarm or second position for time. Unfortunately, the positions are difficult to find and the first position overlaps with the screw threads for the water seal. What you'll find is that the date will get messed up whenever you attempt to make any adjustment -- time, date or alarm -- and it's very difficult to set and keep the alarm setting, because when you attempt to tighten down the crown it changes the alarm setting.Cute watch. Just don't try to set the time, date or alarm and you'll get years of happiness from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The stretches in this book will help you with almost any activity and the instructions on how to do the stretches are straight forward and easy.Its worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stretching for more than the athlete","review":"This book is great. My 17 yr old son requested this book after his friend called it the stretching \\"Bible\\". The simple directions and illustrations make it easy to follow, target specific muscles, find a daily routine, or stretch for a particular activity such as biking or gardening. Perfect for athletes (like the boys) and for those of us with aches and pains we want to stretch out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Pre-Yoga Experience","review":"All athletes can benefit from better flexibility, and this guide will show you how to get there.

Love all the very clear diagrams and the way the book is divided into topical sections"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"As others have said, this book is a wonderful title and is worthwhile to have no matter what you are doing, from sitting around and just going through daily life or focusing on a sport or activity.It is laid out well, with clear instruction and you can find a strech for pretty much anything.As in any physical endeavor it takes time to feel results, so remember to be careful and not force yourself into a stretch if it is new to you or your feel tightness anywhere.I recommend this to people I see so they have a quick reference for items that will help them rehab injuries.On reviewer mentioned that a spiral bound version would be nice tohave, and I agree. But that slight shortcoming does not take away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"I highly recommend this new edition of an old standby. Anderson's update on the best ever book on stretching is amazing. I wasn't sure how they were going to improve on the original. (I've been using the first edition for years.) The illustrations are easier to follow with the two color format and the groupings for task/sport specific stretches is expanded. This is by far the best, most authoritive book on stretching ever written - Also the most easy to understand for the layman. This book would be a great gift for a chriropractor or phys-ed student or anyone who wishes to have and keep their body healthy and flexible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best stretching book out there.","review":"I've owned and used this booK for over 30 years. It's the Bible of stretching as far as I'm concerned. The simple yet thorough pen and ink sketches by Jean Anderson have a 'homey' appearance harking back to the seventies, when the book came out. The descriptions are easy to follow, there are stretches for every muscle in the body, and routines for various sports and every day activities. There are many glitzier stretching manuals out now, with high gloss photos and price tags to match. If you own this one, you'll never have to buy another stretching book. Mine started to fall apart, so I took it it apart, punched the holes and put it in a three-ring binder. I still use it, so it's not going anywhere. Get the accompanying DVD and you're set for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"StretchingStretching Bob Anderson","review":"Great book. Easy to follow. Easy to create a program.

Does a great job of breaking down the exercises for each body group or part. Well written and illustrated, easily understood.

At the time, I was a weekend warrior playing on a softball team, and my friend was a very experienced weighlifter and martial artist. The sport-by-sport organization is really useful, and the illustrations for each stretch are simple but easy to follow. I also like that the part of the body where you should feel the stretch is covered with dots, making it easy to identify. I recently gave the book as a gift to a couple I know: a police officer in his late 30s who plays rugby on the weekends, and his wife, a runner who has also taken up horseback riding. They both love it. I highly recommend STRETCHING for anyone who plays or trains for any sport--especially if you are just getting into the sport, know you should stretch more than you do, or you just really can't risk injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stretching: 20th Anniversary","review":"This is the second copy of this book I've owned. I owned the first publication 20 years ago and lost it along the way. Being older now, I've rediscovered the benefits of stretching and this book is the best I've seen.

It teaches you to stretch certain areas of the body: lower back, front of shoulders, etc.IF you are looking to stretch SPECIFIC MUSCLES, this book is totally worthless. For example, because of a medical problem, I need to stretch a specific muscle, which of course is not to be named or found anywhere in this book.IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM AND YOU NEED VERY SPECIFIC INFORMATION, YOU WILL NOT FIND IT IN THIS BOOK.This book is written for children or the general population looking for a General Stretch in general areas.IF you are looking to stetch specific muscle groups, do a search on the internet, don't waste your money on this book!!

I hope The Book Community can fix this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"This method of stretching is not the best way to get flexible and relieve pain or whatever you're trying to do. It is about relaxed stretching, the actual lengthening of your muscles. Everyone is already capable of doing the splits, their body just doesn't know it yet(your muscles are plenty long enough already). You do not need to stretch anything. You must make your nervous system believe it's safe to move into that new position. It is also dangerous because it messes with your stretch reflex.

Many illustrations help the reader understand and execute the movement. The three pillars of fitness are strength, agility, and endurance.

At least 80% of the movie is an old 70's Hong Kong kung-fu flick, with new faces and voices inserted. And yet the director manages to create one of the most memorable comedy characters ever, in Master Pain. Or Betty, as he prefers to be called. While some of the gags get annoying, especially some of the more over the top voices, I laughed harder during this movie then during dozens of other, better known comedies. I think it's vastly superior to Super Troopers or Dude Where's My Car. (Both of which I liked). So long as you don't go in expecting too much, it's a real riot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie.

And I was right! The jokes are VERY silly, predictable, and I don't think they worked very hard on them. The only reason I saw this movie is because my friend kept quoting from it and telling me I should watch it. So we did. It's a good idea to edit the actors into old footage of kung-foo movies, but the parts that they made themselves (i.e. when he fights with the cow...) are very dumb. Obviously the people that made this have brains that work like this:FALLING DOWN + STUPID FACE = FUNNY. I don't agree with that logic. I mean, just look at the cover of this! Gopher-chucks? Why? I just don't get it! Really, don't waste your time on this movie unless you like really goofy and predictable things."},{"rating":"2","title":"But, isn't Betty a woman's name?","review":"One of my all time favorite comedies. I use to have it on vhs tape, but I lent it to someone & never got it back. This is one of those movies that's just so fun to watch over & over again. It's also fun to quote in daily life. Its especially funny when you say a line from the movie & someone says \\"what does that have to do with what we were talking about? \\" & I say \\"I don't know. But, I'm bleeding, making me the victor.\\" & then I turn into an orca whale & follow Ling's father & the chosen one down a waterfall. You gotta love a movie that takes the entire audio track out of an old kung fu movie & inserts it's own dialogue. It's movie magic & it's fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a few laughs, but not worth the $20","review":"The previews made it look funny; but ofcourse, the previews show the best parts! You don't have to be a kung-fu movie fanatic to get the jokes, you just have to appreciate a satire. Some people who don't understand satires and just saw it as a regular comedy will laugh but they will find the wacky antics a bit strange. The movie pokes fun at the voice dubbing by having annoying, high-pitched and deep voices replacing the actors own, but the joke gets tired halfway through. It has all the obligatory kung-fu characters: the old wise man, the evil, snickering enemy and his backup enforcement and a brave man avenging his master's death. The play on stereotypes and fight scenes were the funniest elements, but the film soon runs out of gas and ends up mocking itself. Not the worst movie but not worth the $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Betty...","review":"This is the most out there movie...well out there. It is harilous and everyone who I leant my DVD too has laughed their heads off at it.

Hysterical Karate Spoof!","review":"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist is a wonderful movie. Did you ever watch the Japanese movies on saturday afternoons? This is the spoof to end all!

Writer-director Steve Oedekerk has taken an old Japanese kung fu movie, and using digital wizardry has placed himself in it and added new footage to come up with a movie that is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Just when you think the movie's overstayed it's welcome, Oedekerk pulls out another hilarious moment and you find yourself both impressed and entertained by his silliness. With none of the dialogue in synch with the character's mouths, it's just proof at how campy and bad these earlier Japanese movies were. Most hilarious are some of the noises that the characters make, especially Ling, the heroine. A sequel is coming out next year and I'm sure it'll be just as insanely hilarious. If you're in the mood for a silly silly movie, but one that is undeniably entertaining, KUNG POW should fit your bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen","review":"Ok, I'm a huge fan of Monty Python, Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the \\"Naked Gun\\" movies, so you can imagine how easily entertained I am. This movie is dumber than anything I've ever seen before. Yes, there are a couple of laughs in it, but they are few and far between (seen the trailer for this film? Then you've seen the laughs). The only funny part throughout the film is the fact that the bad guy insists on being called \\"Betty\\". Save your money and wait until this comes on late night cable and you left the remote on top of the tv while you're laying on the couch...that's the only reason I can think of to watch this waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've seen in a while....","review":"It was a bit funny in the beginning, the fight with the baby, the fight with the cow, and the use of gophers as weapons... all of those scenes will make you smile. It's also a very creative idea of how this movie is blended in with a few old Kung Fu flicks. But, after about 15, 20 minutes tops, all of the jokes get old, especially how all of the characters' mouths move after and before they're talking. Funny at first, it continues throughout the whole movie, and becomes very annoying. After some good jokes early on, it all just goes down hill, making you wish the movie was only a skit on Saturday Night Live. It had its moments, but in the end, it just isn't worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Trailer, Hidden Cheese","review":"I really went into this movie with an open mind and a belly ready to be tested by its humour. But KUNG POW didn't make my belly ache once. Not once. This film was SO annoying. You had to wade through embarassing, stupid gags just to get to the slightly funny moments. Take all the unfunny, poorly executed segments in every Mel Brooks movie you've ever seen; splice them together with all the really bad SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skits; and presto! You have an idea how painful and frustrating KUNG POW is to watch. Nice idea. But dumb, remedial script."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this . . .","review":"... but it was just too stupid. Few things are more annoying than a great idea that's as poorly executed as this.I agree with the spotlight review that the best jokes were in the trailer. Yes, the digital work is quite well done, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the dialogue sounds like it was done by a class clown from the 3rd grade. Oedekerk had a great idea - he just should've had someone else write the screenplay. He has a good feel for sight gags and physical comedy, but he doesn't have the chops to make anything SOUND funny. A complete disappointment. Martial arts parodies abound, but a thoroughly successful one has yet to be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kung Pow! Enter the Stupidity","review":"Steve Oedekerk made Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (the sequel to Ace Ventura: Pet Detective), which was a riot. So, I thought his next work would be good as well. I thought WRONG.The problem with Kung Pow! is that it uses too many recycled jokes that are already overused enough in today's stupid comedies (e.g., Adam Sandler). A Chinese woman tells him that he's the \\"chosen one,\\" but he was so absorbed into her chest tat he didn't hear her. How many times has that been used? And, ironically, she DOSEN'T EVEN HAVE much of a chest to stare at. Other jokes include french kissing dubbed over with nunchuk-cracking sound f/x, or yet ANOTHER Matrix parody. This time, a cow shoots \\"milk bullets\\" at Steve in slow-mo while he dodges them in the same style Keanu did in The Matrix. Okay, so this was funny when it was first done right in Scary Movie, but after that it got SO OLD.And, I didn't laugh ONCE....."},{"rating":"1","title":"99% not funny","review":"Dont' buy or rent this movie. I can't think of a stupider movie which I've seen than Kung Pow. I would rather watch an hour and a half of the Golden Girls. I rented it after reading the good reviews on Amazon.com; these reviews were misleading. The voice-overs were occasionally funny, but they got stale and begged to be stopped. This movie is not funny to sensible adults, It wasn't even cheesey; Kung Pow was pitiful. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews by FreaK","review":"This movie doesn't even deserve a star. It deserves 0. It was so pointless...I fell asleep. About half the theater left in the middle of the movie (i'm serious) and my bro just rented it and could only stand to watch 15 minutes of it. You must be pretty messed up to give this movie 5 stars. I didn't smile once...it isn't my kinda humor. Sick, disgusting stuff isn't my kinda humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten Up! It's a Great Movie!","review":"Honestly I can say that even quoting this movie makes me double over in laughter. I originally saw this in the theatre, not knowing what to expect and laughed through the entire thing. I couldn't wait for the DVD! My roommates, co-workers and I can hold hours conversations based on this movie alone! All I can say is critics lighten up! It's a great movie, worth seeing again and again because you catch more and more every time. I absolutely adore Evil Master Betty. He's the best part of the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Mash-Up... deserves Python-esque adoration","review":"As DJs now throw together different tunes for explosive new effect, so Steve Oedekerk uses visual tricks to insert himself (and a new plot) into a po-faced '70s Kung Fu movie.The result of all this madness is Kung Pow, a no-budget film with a few slow spots but many moments of priceless hilarity.All but one character's voice dubbing work is Steve. Steve did the editing, re-shoots, writing, and plays the lead character \\"Chosen One.\\" He hunted countless scratchy old Hong Kong movies to deconstruct, eventually buying and restoring \\"Tiger & Crane Fists\\" for this movie.So Kung Pow is really a labour of (deranged) love, and a genuinely entertaining experience at a time when 100m budget films can be so overly slick and competent they leave zero impression.An inspiration for our affordable-tech generation. Get the DVD for a few precious out-takes, like the Evil Betty \\"so sparkly\\" scene, and Chosen One hiding in the giant bell."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our family laugh out loud movies","review":"A funny spoof of an original movie.

This is a spoof to end all spoofs and if,as I heard, most professional reviewers didn't give it the time of day, then who need's their pretentious misguidance anyway? Of course it's stupid, but it's meant to be! And whilst it won't have you rolling on the floor, it will bring a smile to your face as you remember every bad Kung Fu movie that smeared our screens over the past two decades. I loved it's goofiness, the intentional bad editing, the atrocious dubbing. You'd have to watch it twice to catch all the humour. It sure beats the corny Airplane and Naked Gun movies for it's sense of parody. Loved it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a man too, you know...I go pee-pee standing up!","review":"To describe Steve Oedekerk as a brilliant comedic genius would be a gross understatement.

I could not sit through this movie without laughing out loud incessantly, so much so that I was bawling out in pain afterwards from the continuous laughter. Thank God for Steve Oedekerk.Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"Oedekerk's admiration and respect for those old Hong Kong kung fu movies shines through this great parody. Listen to his commentary -- he repeatedly praises the original cast & crew of Tiger & Crane Fists. This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. The extras are well-done, and Oedekerk's commentary provides a lot of interesting background info. Be sure to listen to the alternate audio tracks: The original Mandarin, along with new \\"gibberish\\"; and the Long Lost Book On Tape.Funny stuff and worthy of repeated viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"THAT'S A LOT OF NUTS!!!\\"","review":"When I first bought tickets to see this movie, I was a little skeptical.

Most of his movies are super! But this movie was so bad I still have flashbacks of sitting through it. Holy God, it was so not funny. It dragged on to the point of making me fall asleep, only to find when I woke that it wasn't over yet and it wasn't funny yet. My husband LIKED this movie. I still tell him he owes me big time for making me sit through this completey asinine, unfunny, tedious excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.","review":"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist (Steve Oedekerk, 2002)Good lord, what an awful movie this is. I expected it to be bad, but I wasn't expecting ninety minutes of Kung Faux with the addition of actors and scenes.If you've never seen Fuse's show Kung Faux (or this movie), the basic idea is this: take old martial arts movies. Add in your own dialogue. Hilarity ensues. Well, okay, in very small doses. A full episode of Kung Faux is usually too much. Ninety minutes... ugh.It did, however, make me want to see the original film used (Tiger and Crane Fist), simply to find out if the original is as bad as Kung Pow.A * , because there are a few one-liners and sight gags that are worth a chuckle. At the end, though, you're likely to be wondering why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life when you could have been doing something more productive; for example, covering yourself with honey and tying yourself to a nest of fire ants."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has no point","review":"This movie is just not funny and stuff. For one thing, there is some lame kung-fu cow, supposed to make us laugh, I guess. Steve Oedekerk does NOT know how to act, nor does he know how to fight. I had to waste good money to go see this movie, which I thought would be cool. Well...it wasn't. Of all the movies I've seen that tried to be funny, this was one of the most miserable failures of any of them. This movie [stinks]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely Awful","review":"This film was not even funny. Anything that you saw in previews or ads was the best parts of the film. Please, don't buy this film.

That would be less of a disappointment.It needs negative stars, not one star..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Funny...","review":"Ended stupid. I didn't even finish the movie. Sure, it was funny in the beginning, what with the \\"Chosen One.\\" After awhile, it was pointless, good for a few laughs. After that it all went downhill. It WAS funny, but it was SO stupid that it wasn't even funny anymore. I thought the beginning was okay, but, as far as I got, I got really bored and none of it was really funny. Basically: It was SO stupid that it was even FUNNY anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Game, Just Lame!","review":"This movie was so lame. I recently picked up a dvd titled \\"Kung Faux\\", which ended up being one of the funniest things I have ever seen and is now one of my favorite dvds of all time, and then when I was telling someone about it, they asked me if it was called \\"Kung Pow\\" or \\"Kung Faux\\", which is when I found out about this dvd, so I thought I should check it out too. Man, what a waste of money. This movie has got no game and is content to serve up the same bad gags over and over again to fill up enough running time to be able to call itself a movie instead of the lame one note wonder gimmick worthy of only maybe a short web clip on a cornball website that it really is. If you want to see a truly hilarious dvd of dubbed kung fu flicks that you will want to watch over and over again, do yourself a favor and pick up a dvd titled \\"Kung Faux\\" and get lifted for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could salvage those two hours","review":"this was a horrible, arrogant, and mostly unfunny piece of work from Steve Oedekerk. one review said it looked like it was made in junior high, and the quality of humor shows. The jokes are mostly crude and though there is a funny part here and there it is mostly dull and juvenile. not that I dont' mind juvenile humor, but it has to be done right. The only thing that was done right about this movie was it was done cheap.Avoid this, if you want something juvenile rent Say it 'Aint so, or Van Wilder, the cast has more charisma and the jokes are crude but funny. if you want good satire go with the older Mel Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Tiring","review":"This is first time I have written a review for the deliberate purpose of giving a movie a one-star rating. Normally, I simply forget about the movie and move on to the next one. But this one really irked me because I had expected it to be so much better. The \\"dubbing\\" grows tired very quickly as a gag, as do the repetitive fight scenes that employ the \\"thousand meaningless blows\\" kung fu fighting style. Some of the sight gags and dialogue are a bit amusing in the beginning, but I found myself waiting and waiting for the real humor to begin. This type of concept is more deserving of a 10-minute SNL skit than it is of a 90-minute movie. It's sort of like eating a bowl of pudding. If it's for desert, then it can be a joy. But if you're served it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, then it very rapidly becomes something you want to walk away from. Unfortunately, since I rented it, I can't 'walk away' from the money I wasted to rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"I've owned this movie for many years. I was just looking to see if they ever converted it to blu-ray. Apparently not.This is a fantastic movie. It's just unbridled idiocy at its best. People who take themselves way too seriously will hate this movie. People who simply don't appreciate slapstick or \\"literal\\" comedy will hate this movie. The rest of us seem to find it hilarious. I never saw the 2nd movie. A movie like this doesn't need a sequel. Sequels quite often ruin movies for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"generation Y spoof","review":"I had never before seen a spoof movie which actually was made of footage of the movie being spoofed. The old Chinese martial arts film was seamlessly combined via green-screen with the new actors. It was hilarious! It included scenes similar to the Lion King, the \\"I Like Big Butts\\" song, \\"nun-chucks,\\" a fight with a milk-cow, and extremely ridiculous dialogue which sounds like it was written by a third-grader. The first time it was the most funny. How many times can you watch a spoof before it isn't as funny anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"kung pow enter the fist","review":"The disk great condition when I received it, but the case was a little sun worn, like it had been sitting in direct sunlight for a couple years. Amazing movie, if you haven't seen it, you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy cow! I mean... That hardly even seems possible!","review":"This has to be one of the strangest, funniest spoofs of martial arts I've ever seen. I watchedKung Fu Hustle, but really didn't find it especially funny. Kung Pow, on the other hand, had us laughing just about from beginning to end.The long and short of it, for people who don't know the schtick, is that the movie's creator basically found an old 1970's kung fu movie and either used green screen or reshot parts of the movie to put himself into the action. He also revoiced much of the dialogue to completely remake the movie into his own twisted vision of a kung fu spoof. The end result is occasional hilarity, occasional groans, a few slow moments but an overall great spoof.If you love kung fu movies, you'll probably appreciate this spoof of the 70's revenge genre. If you haven't watched any good martial arts movies, why are you watching this? Go rentCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,House of Flying Daggers,Hero,Iron MonkeyorThe Forbidden Kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I had already seen the movie and watched multiple times in the past.

I was right. This movie is so stupid it's funny. I laughed almost continuously. You might ask \\"how could you find a martial arts performing cow funny?\\" Perhaps, it's because It was so outrageous. The female lead was so sweet, as she ended each line squeeling \\"wee, wee, wee\\". There's plenty more stupidity to make just about anyone laugh. Fasioned after Woody Allen's \\"What's up Tiger Lily\\", with its out of sync voice over and stupid lines. I'n not sure if it will be as funny the second time I see it, but it's certainly worth seeing once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dubbing, laughs, and a whole lot of confusion","review":"I enjoyed watching this movie. It had very funny lines and dubs. It had the gopher-chucks, the cow, and a whole lot of funny moments.

Then WATCH THIS FILM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the overdubbing of Master Pain alone","review":"OMG this movie had me rolling numerous times, and I've watched it a few times a day recently.

That in itself is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung Pow: Instant cult comedy classic!","review":"A movie like \\"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist\\" is one of those types that seems to come along every decade or so. Honestly, Kung Pow is probably the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. But, I don't think that I have ever laughed so hard in my life! This movie is basically an old kung fu flick who's rights were bought, and then chopped up and re-edited and re-dubbed. The whole movie was intentionally re-dubbed with the lip-sinc being totally off just like an old kung fu flick. Certain clips are also used over and over again but with different dialoug giving it this goofy look. I have watched this movie at least 5 times now and it just gets funnier and funnier because, Since I'm so busy laughing, I miss out on some parts. All in all, if you're the kind of person who likes Mystery Science Theater 3000, this movie is right up your alley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"This movie was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.Every few seconds I was cracking up!I don't know how much the budget was for the film and it did not seem to be a very expensive film.

It's so bad it makes it as a good \\"B\\" movie. It is very predictable so go with no expectation, and you will find some good laughs. I caught the last show there were five people in the theater and we all had a good time. Also what helps is if you find a really good matinee in a tacky theater. I will add it to my collection when it's released on DVD. It's mindless fun.Mooooooooooooooooooooooooo"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I was twelve when this movie came out, and immediately knew it would forever be one of my favorite comedies. The story is absolutely off the wall and completely absurd, but a riot through and through. The self-awareness of the film is what really makes it hilarious, as it often makes jokes about modern product placement etc. The DVD itself is also very well done, with the picture and audio quality still being above par even today. The extras are a nice touch as well. The menu itself is even worth a laugh or two. Overall this is a no brainer for the price, for anyone who is a fan of slapstick comedy or satire.

And more importantly, how is that supposed to be funny?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorless and painful to watch","review":"I now regret having wasted five dollars renting this movie. There are a couple of funny parts but most of the film is just plain irritating. It makes fun of every crummy kung-fu movie on earth with silly martial arts battles and terrible dialogue.

Instead it was rather like watching a bunch of home videos strung together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever... uggggh!!!","review":"There was only a very few movies I wanted to walk out of and this is on top of the list.

I've always been a huge Mystery Science Theater fan, etc. Kung Pow is one of the best parodies I've seen. Perhaps second only to Thumb Wars, the Star Wars spoof also by Oedekerk.

My only caveat is that if anyone should have a problem with a trial watermark (was a major problem with 3.0), it means that they have not properly activated the product (i.e., upon installation ScanSoft's computer gives the user's computer some kind of 'key' removing the trial watermark) and should do so again -- while connected to the Internet.

(i.e., putting kids in Daycare before the age of 3).She talks about the dangers of kids who come home from school and are alone until parents return from work.She also devotes considerable time to the rise in childhood obesity and how the above factors contribute to that.This is certainly not a mere \\"Blame the mom\\" screed as some might call it.

It's is still a great book, and the author does not disappoint with witty, funny dialogs, steamy bedroom (and not bedroom) sex scenes, suspence and action.I was reluctant to even buy Suzanne's first contemporary title, but I'm so glad I gave her a chance.

This author seems to confuse modern romance with the need for excessive amounts of profane language. Apparently, it is not possible to be extremely wealthy, extremely gorgeous, and extremely attracted without being extremely filthy-mouthed. I don't happen to agree with that assessment [in fact, enjoyment of the romance dies for me], but the author does apparently believe it with all her heart.

As soon as I took the disks out of my mailbox I started watching. And I won't be sleeping till I've seen them all. Every episode is like visiting old friends you haven't seen in years. My biggest concern when I purchased this set was wondering if it had every episode or was just the \\"greatest hits\\" version of the series. YES THEY ARE ALL THERE!!! I have wanted Cowboy Bebop on DVD for a while and haven't been able to afford it. All the sets I was finding online were cheap copies or outrageously expensive. Needless to say, I am beyond satisfied with this set.

I'm glad I did. Everything about this release is top quality, from the picture, audio (you get the original japanese track and the excellent english dub, BOTH in 5.1), cool boxart, and intelligent packaging. Menus are easy to navigate and cool looking as well. I especially enjoyed the commentary tracks on a few of the episodes, was a nice (and interesting) touch. I would recommended this to my friends, and any fan of the show who wants to own it on DVD, you can't go wrong with this collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Monica and Eric! Worst anime ever!","review":"Where to begin on this stinker? For some reason, everyone likes this crappy anime, failing to realize that it has no plot, crap voice acting, cheesy violence, and no nudity, unless you like man-boobs. Every episode involves some sort of emo anorexic named Spike who goes around hunting people while getting shot many times, only to die by getting slashed at the end, Faye, who is just there for some eye candy, Jet, who is useless, and Edward, who is some sort of an autistic savant boy who has spent too much time on the internets. Also the music is crap. Why would you listen to jazz? If Nickelback played music on this show, I might give more stars.For good anime, check out anything that 4kids, the best anime company ever, made."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows period","review":"Cowboy Bebop is an awesome anime that combines both a jazzy film noir with a futuristic setting as it follows a group of bounty hunters. The episodes range from funny, serious, and some incredibly heart wrenching. If you enjoyed this I recommend looking at Samurai Champloo as well, another one of Shinchiro Watanabe's masterpieces.This particular DVD set is affordable with a bunch of extras that any fan would enjoy watching. The packaging is a nice box set with two flaps that fit the six discs comfortably. My only qualm is that it doesn't seem that there are any wide screen versions available at all for Cowboy Bebop. But overall, if you're going to invest in the series, this is the best affordable option you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video quality is disappointing","review":"I bought this with high expectations of finally having a good source for this fantastic anime series. But I'm very disappointed with the video quality: it shows dot-crawl and rainbowing everywhere. I was expecting the video to be resmastered and professionally cleaned, but all they did was some sharpening and color correction. All it was required to clean the dot-crawl and rainbowing was to recapture the LaserDisks and pass the image through a comb filter, as explained here:[...][...]Thus, being a basic problem with a well documented solution, the presence of those artifacts on this DVD-set image is a great disappointment.The audio quality, in the other hand, is very good, at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Rendered Classic","review":"Cowboy Bebop is an Anime Classic, and this product packages it together nicely.The animation isn't ground breaking, but it's serviceable. The things that set Bebop apart from the crowd is the laid-back bluesy soundtrack (which sounds nice in this release) and the general sense of fun that pervades the series. While there are serious moments aplenty, there's an underlying sense of humour that always made this series appeal to me. The English language voice talent is very good, and I never feel the need to switch to subtitles that I have when watching some other shows where voice-overs were not well done.Please note that while the box set includes the entire series, the Cowboy Bebop movie is NOT included in this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"It's great having the entire season available at a very reasonable price. I got to re-live each episode with the wonderful music and quirky characters that we all know and love so well. This was the best dubbed anime I've ever come across, even to this day and that's saying something considering this anime is around 10 years old in the U.S. I highly recommend this series to anyone, whether new or old to the anime industry and I can't stress enough how much the music made this series so great for me (I own all the soundtracks to it too).I would caution that this isn't a series for young kids. It's not Sailor Moon or Naruto. It is violent and has many adult themes that are probably better for people 13 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang.","review":"Here is why you, the reader, should buy Cowboy Bebop; Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels, and Episode 25-26, The Real Folk Blues (part 1 and 2). Coolest s*** I ever did see to put it crassly. The other great thing about Bebop is that they get to the point and do not drag on, the final climatic showdown between are beloved protagonist and reviled antagonist takes only about two minutes of screen time; unlike Dragon Ball Z where it took planet Namek thirty something episodes or what not to explode (after it being stated that it had \\"only five minutes left\\"). So yeah short and sweet, plus they glorify smoking, even in 'non-smoking' areas (especially in 'non-smoking' areas)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Awesomeness","review":"Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime series I have watched, If not the best. It is an excellent choice for longtime anime fans or newcomers alike. Its gritty, film noir feel makes it very accessible to western audiences, I think. The animation is excellent and the American voicework is spectacular. This is one of the few amines where dub beats out sub hands-down. It is well-translated and feels very natural - another reason American anime virgins might want to give this series a try. Plus, the voices are just COOL. The writing is both funny and emotionally engaging. You will really start to care about these characters. Fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly will start to feel at home in this universe very quickly, I think. Lastly, I can't talk about this series without praising Yoko Kano's AMAZING soundtrack. The music of this series will rock your world. It sets the mood, laying the background and harmonizing the elements of this show, which taken as a whole, is a remarkable work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy Bebop Remix: The Complete Collection","review":"My son has an obsession with Anime Legends, and this is one of his favorites.

The music is amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impartial Review","review":"While I may have gotten this box set elsewhere, I can tell you more about it. First, the commonly known stuff: it's 6 DVDs for a total of 26 sessions (episodes), it's got English and Japanese audio in 5.0 and 2.1 but only English subtitles, and it's total run time is 650 minutes.Now for the juicyness: some episodes have commentary from the staff. What does this mean? It means that the voice actors themselves commented on the episode. Some episodes have more than one commentary. For example, the first episode has two commentaries, one from the Japanese voice actors of Spike and Jet and another from the English voice actress of Faye. If that weren't enough juicyness, it also contains a bonus Episode: Session 0, which I am not allowed to spoil about.So, aye, if you liked Cowboy Bebop and were waiting forever for the box set to come out, then why don't you have this yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"title of review","review":"Pretty much my favorite anime, so who could argue with better sound quality and picture.

I watched a couple of episodes and I have been a fan ever since. I already own the boxset and it comes with a healthy set of extras including commentaries, sketches, and the sort. I always felt the series ended on an odd note ( no spoiler here ) but for 20 bucks you will not find a more complete series that will burn up the weekend. You will find yourself hard-pressed not to walk away at least liking one of the characters in the show. Spike and Ein (the Dog) top the list. It definitely satisfies both the anime and non anime fan. The stories, even the very few fillers, will leave you thinking about things in real life. Story is definitely relevant to current events now.And did I forget to mention the soundtrack rocks the house and has great integration with the overall anime.

I expected truely airtight canisters to keep coffee and tea in....these are going right back to Amazon.The silicon seal is a poor design and will not seal air/liquids. The closing mechanism is cheap and inadequate...it does not align properly and bends easily. The wire loop clasp distorts (bottom of the loop opens) when closed...so much so that it easily slips out of the clasp when pressure is applied during closing. If you're handy, you could probably braise or solder the loop shut to solve that problem; however, that would still not solve the inability to seal."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 1 month, little improvement","review":"I had heard many good things about this product and thought that maybe it would be worth the $$$'s.

I continue to take Phosoplex and will do so for another month until my supply runs out. Then I'll see if I'll order it again.

I've even send a bottle to my brother in Seattle who has knee problems also.....I used to purchase this at Costco, but they stopped carrying it, so I was very glad to see that Amazon is carrying it so I can continue having a relatively pain-free day.

The sex-oriented humor was the main staple of course, coupled with an adventure styled game. Magna Cum Laude has none of the adventuring, and the humor is far less subtle or inventive. The game is made up of several mini-games, and while they are mildly entertaining for about 15 minutes, they do not a Leisure Suit Larry game make. Sierra should be ashamed of itself. On top of that, now they want to release an \\"uncut and uncensored\\" version. Who are they kidding? Most of the options are in plain text files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad.","review":"Sierra brought us many wonderful titles over the years, including the Kings Quest, Hero's Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry serials. In most cases, they did a good job putting together creative, cute, situation driven puzzle games. Here, they delivered an appalling blend of poor graphics, bad language, and simplistic game play.Gone are interaction with characters, puzzles, and good writing. Instead, one plays simple 2-D mini-games and views poorly developed cut-scenes.The game is a bizarre blend of exceptionally childish \\"humor,\\" such as fart jokes and random acts of not-very-clever profanity, coupled with 4 or 5 mini-games so shoddy and simplistic they recall the days of CGA. Too simple for those over 10, too profane for those under 16, this game would not be worth playing if it were free. At $50, Sierra sells their reputation and little else. I will think twice, and read some reviews, before purchasing another Sierra product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Al Lowe when we need him?","review":"What a travesty! And it's a good thing for Al Lowe (the man behind the original LLL series) that he had nothing to do with this pathetic loser of a game. Leisure Suit Larry was meant to be an old fashion \\"adventure\\" (roll playing) game, the fun was in the interactions, the discovery of the use of various items you found, not to mention the humor of the game. Okay, we have the humor (kind of)..but we have just about nothing else. Shame on everyone for this rip off of a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this game!","review":"I was a big fan of the old Al Lowe games, so I was a bit hesitant when I went to but my copy and was told Al Lowe wasn't involved. However, after just a couple of hours of playing I can tell you that this game is without a doubt the funniest game I've played in a long, long time. Also, if you are not a hardcore gamer you'll should have fun with the minigames, even though they do get a bit repetitive. This game was well worth the $30, some of the stuff that Larry says had me busting a gut. Great game to wind down with after a bad day at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will bust a gut...","review":"as many others have said, the mini games will get dry after playing them so many times.. eventually you will start to master the game of quarters and figure out ways to get out... now for all those who have played LSL8, i know that i was sore that Larry Laffer was not the main character and Al Lowe was also missing.... however sierra did do a good job on this game in terms of awesome graphics, gameplay, and nudity. (btw you can hex the file to unlock nude mode early in the game)... it is well worth the 30 bucks compared to the newer games out there and i would reccommend this game.. even my g/f made her own save and started playing.. she busted a gut laughing on the jokes because she never played a LSL game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Game!!!","review":"I ordered the Uncensored and Uncut Adults Only Version and recieved the mature version, if i wanted that i could have bought it at wal-mart.

Here's the simple truth - if the genius creator of LSL's 1 - 6 is missing, then this isn't an LSL game at all - just a cheap rip off.Message to pointy-haired bosses at Sierra: You can buy the LSL concept. You can buy Larry's image. But if you don't have Al Lowe, you don't have anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christ almighty...","review":"Who are these people who review and praise a game that hasn't even come out yet! Yeesh.The reviewer below says that it should be as good as the previous Larry games well there's something you should know.The Leisure Suit Larry series was created by Al Lowe who made every title until he and hundreds others were fired by Sierra.Al Lowe had NO contribution to this title, (Even though Sierra said he would be involved!) this title is the concotion of a third party developer who have never made an adventure game in their life. From previews I've heard the game is alright but it's obvious that is hasn't got the distanct influence Al Lowe gave his games to make them personal and fun. Another critcism I heard is that it relies too much on nostalgia.For what it's worth, I'm not getting the game until Al Lowe gives his apporval.

Like everyone has several machines to do their game testing. Oh I could send the dick (game ) back...at my expense. JUST DON\\"T BUY IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but repetative","review":"The game has good dialogue and jokes but the game requires a few mini-games to be played over-and-over to succeed at any task. A big flaw is you look more at a mini-game (directing your swimming sperm around conversation obstacles) during dialogue than watching the animation. That same game can be used for entertainment because hitting certain obstacles can lead to a very funny conversation. It's much like to LSL's of the past but with better graphics. I'd give it 7 out of 10, fun but can be annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the PS2 Version! 12 year old gamer","review":"I rented Leisure Suit Larry being as it takes about one week to beat while playing one hour a day. This game was a mediocre game and didn't live up to the others. On the PC version you have to download patches online via google for nudity which is the driving force for most people including myself, but there is nudity in the videos. My mom was watching over my back so I often had to go back and watch the videos when she wasn't home. But this is a fun game and can be interesting at times, but the minigames are repetitive!! How many times is it fun to toss a quearter in a cup? But I definitely wouldn't buy this game, rent it!! And Nigel (the guy you can buy the nudity from) is all over the game.

I am a fan of realistic, gritty neighborhood stories be they in Boston or New York or New Orleans or wherever. The relationship between Gennaro and Kinzie is utterly believable (and I have had a problem in the past with male authors writing in a woman's voice)and realistic. Be forewarned: this book is darker than the others in his series, especially the subsequent ones. It is scary, morally complex, and graphic. It is also filled with a wonderful cast of characters from Gennaro and Kinzie's neighborhood, especially \\"Bubba\\". Those who have never read Lehane but enjoy a gritty neighborhood thriller, wait no longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I have read all of Dennis Lehane's books. I started with \\"Sacred\\" and read backwards. This is one of the best books of this kind that I have ever read. You felt drawn in with the characters. It was a very scary feeling. Patrick and Angie are great together and their supporting charaters are just as good. I recommend all of Mr. Lehane's books and I cannot wait for his new release in June!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This man can really write...","review":"Dennis Lehane was not familiar to me until I saw the film, Shelter Island. When I got my Kindle, back in March, I decided to see if there was a book version of the movie. Lo and behold, I discovered that Dennis Lehane was a fairly prolific author, and opted to read a book of his with which I was not familiar. It was a real page turner. I can't praise his skills highly enough. Great read!! Looking forward to his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb reprise!","review":"I had the classic conflict that comes with reading a good book: Couldn't put it down and hated for it to end. Lehane has both the eyes and ear for the street and the talent to bring them to us in this very enjoyable and quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lehane does it again","review":"As I write this review, 55 other people have already reviewed this book. I agree with most of them, that this was a fine book. Out of the five Kenzie/Gennaro books in the series, this is perhaps my favorite. It leans a little more into the thriller/suspense genre than it does the PI genre, but that is OK, because I know it is a series and not a stand-alone book.Some reviewers (a few) have panned this book as derivative and in one particular spot too much like 'Silence of the Lambs'. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I would just say that almost everything is derivative in some way, and Harris does not have a patent on prison visitations as a plotline.Dennis Lehane crafts some of the best sentences I have read in this genre, so you should read the entire Kenzie/Gennaro series starting with 'A Drink Before the War', and if you have already read it, then read 'Darkness, Take My Hand' NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost too dark","review":"While I thought the book was very well written, and I enjoyed it, it really was almost too dark for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a mystery should be","review":"If there were any justice in the world, Dennis Lehane's books would be monster sellers. Beautifully written sentences, a dead-on ear for dialogue, the shadings of emotions so wrenching a dead man could feel them . . . \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" is no exception. Patrick and Angie have already become beloved friends to me, and Lehane's eye for detail can genuinely creep me out. Lehane is also one of the very few mystery writers who doesn't telegraph who the ultimate culprit is. Definitely not for the light mystery reader, but Lehane ranks up there with Parker and Paretsky. Great, great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing, very unpleasant page-turner","review":"The primary purpose of my review is to echo the review provided by C-C-Peterson. I, too, started with the first novel in this series, and found the violence in that novel to be excessive, but appropriate to the overall plot. However, the gore, sadism, and the time spent being dragged through the muck of human evil in this second novel left me repulsed and gloomy. The killers in this novel are evil personified, and if the author is to be credited with anything, it is that he accurately portrays what might happen to those who survive such an encounter. I felt a little like that myself when I finished the book. I read noir for entertainment, but I think I stumbled into something darker than noir. I finished the book to be sure they got the bad guys and that they would all die; I think I stayed engaged for much the same reason people stare at an accident on the highway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped.","review":"I don't really know where Lehane got his reputation as a great author. I thought the characters were two dimensional, the mystery not very mysterious, and the scary parts not very scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, filled with suspense - hard to put down.","review":"Once again,in Darkness, Take My Hand, PI's Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro agree to take up a case. This time they really earn there money, in what is a very dark, chilling and page-turning second novel. After first agreeing to try and protect the son of a promient psychiatrist, they soon find themselves immersed in a web of horrific executions. The dialague, especially between Patrick Kenzie and the FBI agents assigned to the case, is taught, lean and adds to the suspense which for me, made this book hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great novel","review":"Dennis Lehane shows that you can have more than 1 hit in a series. Theis book was amazing it put togather old friends and new enemys unlike moast thriller novels it was not predictable and the outcome will suprise you. You'll find out things about the characters you didn't know in the previous one. Once you start you can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This is another great early Lehane book. His ability to build characters, create tension, and propel an interesting story make this a good novel that foreshadows the great novels (\\"Gone Baby, Gone\\" and \\"Shutter Island\\") to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"AHHH- I wish it wasn't over","review":"Oh man this is one good read! I can't believe that I didn't know about Patrick and Angie earlier. I am an avid reader and only heard of Dennis Lehane's series last month. I have read \\"A Drink Before the War\\" and now \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" in the past week. I was late to work on Sunday because I couldn't put \\"Darkness\\" down. Oh I love the characters. How wonderfully human they are. So full of fault and virtue. The story is dark, moody and riveting. It moves at a fast pace. Almost too fast since I was sad that it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too over the top.","review":"seems to me that all the characters were psycho killers who had no social values.

This is a thrilling novel that keeps you guessing right to the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"Lehane is a great writer, but in this one he let his writing capability get in the way of telling the story. Terrific descriptive passages, but the reader is lost looking for the story line. I finally gave up reading it and put it aside unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers who were disappointed. This is the last of DL's books for me. By that I mean I have read them all now. I left this one for last because I knew it was going to be dark and involve serial killers. Dark is one thing. This book is gruesome and horrible. Yet pretty ridiculous in many parts. We know there are at least two killers coming for our heroes yet we put one lone cop to guard them out in the street. We all know the electricity is off but we don't wonder if the killers are going to get through the electrically locked door? The two detectives are slow witted as are the police and the FBI. I think I could do a better job protecting them. And that endind scene - so far from reality- the bad guy swinging an infant around. Just to much. Compared to his other books I consider this one to be a loser. Pass it up for Sacred or one of his better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding and Varied Series","review":"Lehane's second novel in the series is, like his first, impossible to put down once you start. The identity of the villain may be a tad disappointing because this character seemed somewhat underdrawn, but that's a minor quibble. There are ample complexities and surprises in this fast-paced, well-plotted story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness Take My Hand","review":"Lehane is able place the reader in the neighborhood I grew up in. I can see the streets, stores, and other buildings that he is writing about even if he change their names. Great reading and makes you not want to put the kindle down until you have finished the book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme violence mars complicated second Kenzie & Gennaro tale","review":"We're not usually contrarians, especially when a book is very highly rated by both the public and by close reading friends, but Lehane's second in the Patrick Kenzie & Angela Gennaro set is so extremely violent, so twisted and dark that we were more anxious to finish just to get it over with rather than discover all the resolutions to the vicious action and closely concealed bad guy identities. A very complicated plot features the hunt for a duo or trio of serial killers, who remain active throughout the story to the point of nearly adding our protagonists to their long list of horribly grisly murders. And while there was some excellent probing of the issue of the violence Kenzie brought into the life of serious girlfriend Grace (and daughter Mae), as well as developments in the ongoing sexual tension between our two principals, we must forego the remainder of this set as just too over the top gory to suit us. Sorry \`bout that."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good","review":"Reset was a real punk band and it's so sad that the celebrity and the money make them broke up simple plan will never be reset.

My oldest child even enjoys preparing some of the simpler recipes with me! Though we are not a vegetarian family, most of the recipes in this book are geared for vegetarians. I have found that these recipes are a great way to get more veggies into my meat loving kids and I have shared many of the recipes with my vegetarian friends.

The bottom line is my daughter has enjoyed every recipe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good healthy recipes for baby","review":"I really like this cookbook and appreciate the recipes and ideas for feeding a baby that don't involve just opening a box or jar of pre-made food from a factory. Some of the recipes are a little too complicated or time-consuming for me (i.e. if it takes 45 min to make rice cereal, you might rather just stick to oatmeal), but it is a good source of ideas. I have mostly just steamed and mashed veggies and fruits when I have had an infant to feed. This has good recipes of that kind, but also more ambitious kinds of healthy foods that kids will like."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I bought this and Mommy Made because of all the great reviews. I missed one towards the end that said don't buy this, several of the recipes call for ingredients such as sea kelp, sea vegetables (I didn't know there was any such thing), or things like tahini, millet and quinoa. I don't even know what those are. I should be able to buy the ingredients in a regular grocery store. It also goes to the other extreme (also noted in a previous review)and actually gives recipes for juice pops (pour juice into an ice cube tray). I mean really. There are very few actually usable recipes in this book, and it is a very thin and small book to begin with. For the most part this book will be under the Mommy Made book. Buy that one, its much thicker, has much more recipes and uses regular every day ingredients. This one was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"EsMummy","review":"I was disappointed with this book due to a) the lack of suggestions for first foods (and I have enough to do without making rice cereal myself), and b) some of the ingredients I also wouldnt know where to buy or what else to do with them. There are many more foods infants can eat when they're starting out than was suggested in this book.If you or your family are not solely whole foods eaters this might not be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I will be trading this book asap. Several of the recipes contain ingredients I don't use, such as low sodium soy sauce, miso, and Sea Veg Mix. I am not particularly trusting of additives such as Sea Veg Mix or salty additives such as soy sauce or miso (even in the low sodium form), so that doesn't leave many recipes left in the book for me to use.

Children are in need of so many things in their beginning years, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. I bought this cookbook to learn how to make more natural and more healthy babyfood for our children. Not to learn how to avoid meat products and get a philosphy lesson on the principals of vegan and vegetarian diets.I am sure the author is very well educated, I am not questioning that, I just don't think we are on the same page. I also think that alot of the food ingredients are not available at the \\"corner grocery store\\" thus limiting the application of many of the recipes in our household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little help or direction","review":"I was very excited to start feeding my son solids.

The recipes in this book calls for things like sea kelp and other things that I know are not easily available in my town. The recipes were gor meals that I wouldn't make for myself. The author preaches about the neccessity for organic and whole foods. While I think that we need to feed our children the best possible foods, I don't think that I need to be lectured to. I was looking for something easy, and I found something that made making my son a healthy meal more difficult. It almost makes me want to go and stock up on jarred foods.

For me it's a dark interpretation of human culture and unwarranted. His theory - incidence of homosexuality has to do with power (and subjection, humiliation) or is primarily to be studied in those terms - is way too blanket across cultures for my trust; he seems to me to treat vastly different cultures as almost equivalent. The evidence he hangs on is often loose, and the fact naively given away in his sentence structure: that is, you can easily read through to: 'although there's not a lot of data on this point, my theory holds'.Sorry, my skin crawled; I have less negative beliefs. For your guidance, he follows Foucault, he scorns Walter Williams' The Spirit and the Flesh (too happy, too gay. I love this book).

All three CD sets; Maximum 70's, Maximum 80's, and More maximum 80's, contain a pile of remixed material, not the original vinyl mixes from the period. Many of the tracks have extra techno beats added on from the 90's and 00's. The mastering of the discs is also flawed, as much of the material contains heavy mid and low range distortion, a result of over-peaking recording levels in the studio.

I had to put a screw in my other 2 headsets now they work great.If you get this headset, take good care of it. Leave it in the SAME SPOT every single time you put down your controller. That's the only way you're going to keep it alive for more than a year. Know where it is at all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk","review":"I only got about four hours of use out of the headset before the plastic piece that holds the earphone on it broke. This thing is a piece of garbage.If you need a headset for Live do yourself a favor and don't buy Microsoft's. If you're just getting onto X-Box Live you'll be better off buying seperate a subscription card and a third party headset than buying the X-Box Live starter kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Headset, but needs improvement","review":"Well, this headset looks cool, but really, it's very cheap. Mine has not broken yet, but it is on the verge of breaking. As everyone else said, these are very fragile, and uncomfortable. The plastic is very flimsy. Sound quality is good, and it has a sound control too, so if someone is screaming, and you can't mute them at the moment, you can turn your volume down until you can mute him. The headset comes in three pieces, the microphone and speaker, headgear, and Headset to controller connecter (which looks sort of like a memory card). I would recommend you buy the Plantronics GameCon Halo 2 headset over this one, because it is more comfortable, and bit more durable. It surpasses this headset by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken 3 of them...Uncomdortable","review":"It does function well, however, I have broken 3 of these things. Replacement options have been limited in the past, but there are now more options available and I will replace my 3rd one with a 3rd party option (I'm thinking of going wireless).Additionally, I do not like the fact that I can not lean back in my chair because of the behind the head band on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all.....","review":"Crappy headset made for smaller ears. Found out the adapter it came with did not fit the most current wireless/wired controllers due to form factors.....I bought this head set for one reason. Voice Morphing capability but found im better off just buying a turtle beaches tango headset.I would get this for a 10 year old but for serious gamers, this would be a waste of money..... xD I hope this helps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully lacking in sap!","review":"The main thing that distinguishes this anthology from many other books about adoption is its literary, unsentimental approach. Unlike the usual humourless depictions, this book goes for depth instead of decibel level, mind over melodrama. It also includes some oft-ignored perspectives such as that of a birthfather, birth-grandparents, adoptive grandparents and adoptees whose reunion stories are not the spangly stuff of the 6 o'clock news. As a contributor to the anthology, I am proud to find my work in such good company. As a reader, I appreciate its literary treatment. As an adoptee, I'm moved by the unflinching accounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, not for adoptees alone","review":"This is a wonderful book also for readers who don't have any experience of adoption. I was swept away by the sheer beauty and quality of the writing. An impressive and diverse array of writers such as Chitra Dvakaruni, Isabel Allende, Alison Lurie, and George Rabasa all explore different facets of parental love, family lines, and belonging. This is the best book I have read since GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"As the grandmother of 3 adoptees, I was eager to get thisbook an was sorely disappointed. It did not give me anyinsights...........a lot of it I just could not relate to.I made myself read it through to the end, hoping thatI would find some thoughts that would connect me to thepoems, etc. Fortunately, my precious adoptees are allaware of their beginnings, know that God makes all children andis the glue that holds all families together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be something she is not","review":"Jazz singers of the 1920s and thirties did not stretch every note out into 10 syllables like Christina does. I can't even listen to Aint No Other Man because she is literally screaming from beginning to end. She's got a great voice, she just doesn't know how to use it in a way that is pleasing to the ear..The \\"oversinging\\" was good on her first CD, but she began to do that annoying growly sound on Stripped and it continues on Back to Basics. It sounds like she tries to make her voice sound deeper than it really is, and it just comes off sounding like she has a huge wad of phlegm in her throat.The only two songs I like are \\"Makes You Wanna Pray\\" and \\"Welcome\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics with Christina","review":"I applaud Christina for her efforts on this CD. Her voice, and her style has matured marvelously on this double-CD set. Her voice has become very powerful, and her control and styling is amazing. It is a welcome change from friend Brittany's breathy performances that lack a great deal of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Music with Big Band Sound and recognition to pioneers","review":"Back to Basic is just that. It not only provides the listener with sounds reminiscent of the pioneers of modern music, it also provides the listener with Christina's emotional energy. Christina sings about both serious and youthful topics with her usual flare. I have enjoyed listening to this CD enormously. I think you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is Good!!!!","review":"Christina has stepped up her game and has a variety of music and melodies on this CD. Songs that can hit any club and songs that my grandmother can actually get into--it's got that 50's feel... I love the diversity! It's great to have a little something for everyone!!! If you're even thinking of buying I highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Double Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this has been an amazing album..!! i've waited so long 4 this album...generally when I bought 'Stripped' was OK but must of the songs that were on that CD I used to skip them...hearing this album i've listened to every song!!!!!! I haven't found any boring song on this album and I think it's great!!!! I kinda see predictions on the GRAMMYS 2006 ;) Christina you go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a very good - she is very talented with a good voice- this is the first CD from her I've ever bought I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take It Back To Basics","review":"A rather good album by Christina. However, i found that Stripped was better. Highlights on the album include : Disc one: Understand and On Our Way, Disc Two: Welcome, Hurt and Mercy on Me. I think it should've been one CD as both discs have the same basic make up. I love her voice - still as powerful as ever. I think this was a fun and exciting project for her and it shows in many of the songs and interludes. Good album but in future i'd like the modern Christina back. I think Stripped is her best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...","review":"I've always respected Christinas voice, but this cd takes it to an entire new level.She is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Album Of The Year So Far","review":"There's no doubt Christina can sing. No matter what her image, she'll always be able to sing any kind of note she wants to pull off. So, here it is: her long awaited third album and by far her best yet. There are so many songs that could be single releases from this album, and there's something for everyone. It's a mix of pop, jazz and soul, and if you like this type of music I'd strongly reccomend this album - even if you're not a fan of Christina.My faves:Ain't No Other ManUnderstandOh MotherStill DirrtyHere To StayCandymanNasty Naughty BoyHurt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina's great comeback","review":"\\"Back To Basics\\" is another great album from Christina Aguilera. It looks like she had some inspiration from songs from the 20's 30's and 40's cause it has an old-fashioned feel to it. My favorite songs are \\"Candyman\\" and \\"Ain't No Other Man.\\" If you liked the singles on the radio then you'll love \\"Back To Basics\\" another hit from Christina Aguilera. She never ceases to amaze me. She puts Britney to shame! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection","review":"I am not a big fan of the pop princess sounds, such as Britney, Jessica or even Avril, and thus I do not particularly care for most of Christina's work. I will however say that Christina unlike the others has a very remarkable voice and I really enjoyed this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"I have always like Christina. Her cd's get better and better. She is always reinventing herself and I like that. You don't get the same thing all the time. This cd was good. You can't compare it to the other ones because it is totally different. I can't wait to hear what she will have in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little much, but still worth the money","review":"I have to admit, it took more than two listens to get into this album, but it was well worth effort. I could have done without a few tracks (On Our Way, Without You, Here to Stay, Thank You), but overall, there are plenty of potential radio hits and memorable tracks. I don't think Christina really reached her goal of a \\"concept album.\\" Most of the songs are retro, but they harken back to the 70's or early 90's more so than to the 20's, 30's, and 40's. The only tracks that sound obviously like songs from the target era sound a little like what someone who doesn't know much about that kind of music thinks it should sound like, like \\"Candy Man\\" and \\"I Got Trouble.\\" Either way, the song \\"Understand\\" alone is worth the price of the double-disc.Stand out tracks:UnderstandSlow Down BabyStill DirrtyNasty Naughty BoyHurtSave Me From MyselfAlso, make sure to get the physical copy of the CD because the booklet is the best I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY OVERRATED........","review":"I just don't get all the praise for this cd. I approached this project very enthusiastically and was very disappointed.Granted, Christina can sing - she has a very powerful voice but I find each song to sound alike and starting with her same range roving wail. It gets old fast.If I heard this cd and didn't know the title, BACK TO BASICS would never have entered my mind. A true homage to the greats of the past this is not. I expected a tour de force selection of more modern turns at old time styles putting Christina's range and ability to use. That this is not.It is a mishmash of songs and now I rarely play it. Also, the song to her fans was very self gratuitous. Should have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Christina I Don't get this Album","review":"She is amazing and talented, there is no question about that. I am a huge fan of her both for her music and her as a person. I was so excited to hear the new album was finally out. I love \\"Ain't no other man,\\" so I was excited to hear what the rest of it sounded like. I don't get it. I listened to it and was like \\"ehh, it's different.\\" Everything sounds the same and is more like a journal entry then a song. Unlike \\"Stripped,\\" it didn't feel like a journal entry that was made into a good song. It was missing the personal touch of that album. It felt like an attempt to make a themed album in a particular genre and just didn't feel like all the material even connected with her.\\"Candyman,\\" sounds like a sample of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\\" to me. Hopefully I'll like the remixes. Sorry to all the other xtina fans, I don't mean any harm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tribute!","review":"Christina is going old school with this CD and boy does it work. The first CD is more modern songs, my favorite being still dirrty and back in the day, but the SECOND disc is awesome. The whole second disc is worth the price of the CD. Candyman, Hurt (new single), Nasty naughty boy are among my favorites. If the CD was cut to one disc i think it would have been much better. I tend to skip most of the first disc. I am normally not one to argue about more material being on a disc, but there is just too much on these two discs. Still, this is a must have for anyone, who likes christina or wants to go more old school in their music or likes the older style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"love her or not this is a great CD","review":"even if you calim not to be a fan, if you listen to it for the musical value you have to love this double CD,for me I can get enoughChristina Rules, she is a real singer , and she just looks awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Basics","review":"Christina has what is arguably the best voice in pop culture. She really shines on the first disk with throwback vintage and samples of hip hop and rap tracks. Things start to go downhill after the first disk. The second cd was in my option thrown together which she should have stuck to the basics. With that said because of the first disc I highly recommend what is Christina best effort to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW ! Christina Aguilera bring back to basics","review":"I have to say this album disturbs 5 stars there ain't no other woman that can be any powerful than mrs. Aguilera! I love this album but I do at some points miss her pop act on stripped but I love this album! third single is CANDYMAN! yea I love this song fast tempo call fun dancy! CHRISTINA AGUILERA you are my CANDYWOMAN hehe! I love u CHRISTINA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Surprised","review":"I was very surprised I would liek this album since its completly out my favorite genres! Its really good although I didnt like the seconde c.d.! Its worth buying cuz it gives this whole new feeling when lsitening to it!Hot Tracks:1) Make Me Wanna Pray2) Back In The Day (This is pure fiyah)3) Ain't No Other Man4) Understand (Omg amazing)5) Slow Down Baby (Makes ya wanan get jiggy)6) F.U.S.S. (Interlude) (THIS IS A DISS TRACK BABY!)7) Still Dirrty8) Here To stay9) Thankyou (Dedication To the Fans...)10) Candyman11) I Got Trouble12) Hurt"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 for 1 - and both are great!","review":"You get 2 CDs with this and there are good songs on both CDs. Linda Perry is all over the 2nd CD and it's good stuff. You can definitely tell Christina was heavily involved in this creation, in more ways than providing the amazing set of pipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike Britney, Christina shows God given talent","review":"As a 38yo man, I have always been impressed with Christina's vocal talent more than her actions to impress her teenage fans. She has a God given talent that few other singers have. I don't believe a single member of the Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, 98' degrees, any rapper and especially not that marketed female known as Britney, have any real talent that will give them success when they're 30, 40, & 50. Christina on the other hand is the exception. Back to Basics shows that talent and it also shows she is more mature than any of her competition. For her to give nods to the music of the 40's, 50's & 60's shows she has class too. This CD is 100% 5 stars. Buy this cd today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I have NEVER like Christina before, but a friend of mine turned me on to these discs. I must say, she is so much more talented than I gave her credit for. Disc #2 is especially awesome, even though she's doing what Madonna did 15 years ago with \\"I'm Breathless.\\" And Christina actually crosses more genres than Madge did, from the '20s to the '60s.Anyone who has a problem with this album needs to check their musical taste meter. This proves that the trashy girl has an amazing command of her voice and every song she belts out. Go back and listen to the greats like Etta James and Billie Holliday and see if this doesn't rank up there with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and soulful","review":"For someone that never buys pop, I have always respected the fact that Christina can REALLY sing and that along with Mariah Carey makes me veer into the pop world every now and then. I appreciate someone that really knows how to belt out a tune in a sea of wanna be singers. Christina has a lot of soul and for people that think she's like other blonde pop stars they will be pleasantly suprised by the old school soul and r&b sound she has. Her first one was the same way, you thought to yourself... hmmm I didn't expect that. She delivers a smooth album with heck a voice. Not too many others can match her all around talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Great album","review":"I am a huge fan of Christina and she is starting to go back to her roots. This album has some really good vocal abilities by her and it also has DJ Premier"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Love the new/different sounds of Christina's latest albumFavorite tracks:Disc 1:3. Back in the Day7. Oh MotherDisc 2:1-36. Hurt9. The Right Man"},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Christina","review":"A friend of mine recommended I listen to Christina saying \\"She's got pipes.\\" I'm glad I did! The sheer force of her voice and the differing moods of the tracks are a great combination. I'm a new devotee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Songs Are Really Good","review":"My husband hates pop music but he actually likes this album. I am still getting used to it. Some songs I loved immediately and some I don't really care for. Most of it is definitely set in an older style.My favorites are Candyman, Hurt, and Save Me From Myself. I also really like Ain't No Other Man, Slow Down Baby, Understand, Oh Mother, Nasty Naughty Boy, and Still Dirty. I HATE the track Thank You. It is annoying and pointless. The other songs that I didn't mention haven't grown on me yet.One Complaint: I think this album should have been put on one cd. There are really not enough songs for a double disc. Shania released a single cd with about 20 complete songs. That is how this should have been. Otherwise, I like it. Highly Recommended....Buy It Right Now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy buen disco!","review":"Aunque no soy un auténtico fan de la Aguilera, quiero comentar que este disco está muy bien. Sobretodo el cd2 que tiene canciones preciosas. Recomiendo a todo el mundo que lo escuche y que se haga un hueco de tiempo para disfrutarlo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To Basics is a MUST!","review":"I recently bought this item and I must say this is by far one of the best albums Xtina has ever made. My favorite songs are Ain't No Other Man, Hurt, Candyman, Nasty Naughty Boy, and a couple others. If your a new fan, or a long time hard core Xtina fan then this is the album for you. Both discs are completly different from each other and thats what makes this album unique and in so many ways different from her other albums. One word..BUY IT! You will NOT regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goddess Does It Again!","review":"Christina Aquilera. Two words: the voice. This c.d. is amazing. Christina has totally re-invented herself, and in the process taken us on a crazed trip into the past with all the glitz and that Hollywood vibe. If you are thinking about buying this c.d.-DO! It is Christina Aquilera. You know that you are getting something that everyone wants to get. Christina Aquilera took her time with making this c.d., so of course it sounds extremely good and well done. So I say purchase it. See Christina Aquilera live in her Back To Basics Tour 2007...it is nothing but pure awesomeness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid release","review":"For the money, this is a great a deal for two discs. At first I thought I liked disc one better than two, but then I realized that it's just too much music to try to listen to in one sitting. You sort of get over it by disc two. But there is no denying Ms. Aguilera's talent and you definitely have to admire the guts it took to put something so different out. I love how she put her ex-collaborator Scott Storch on blast with F.U.S.S.-which according to the internet rumor mill it stand s for (expletive)U Scott Storch-who refused to work with her because she wouldn't spare additional 20k for a private plane on top of his $3 million production fee. They agreed to the fee but not the plane and he threw a Hollywood fit. Interesting.Overall, it's a good CD with good music. It's good to see an artist growing as oppose to sticking to the same old schlick. Looks like she's the real graduate from the school of Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"this girl can sing","review":"I always knew this girl could sing. and she is singing great on this CD and most every song is worth a listen. but did she have to make a double disc that sucks it makes it to hard to decide which one to play first."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed.","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the drop of this cd, only to find that this is not the Christina I know, love, and can sing along with. I lovelovelove every one of her albums, but this one is simply a total letdown. As previous reviewers have stated, she's got the voice, the look, etc., but she's got no hits on this album, I'm afraid.Christina, get back to the Top 40 music that we love to listen to, sing to, that inspires us to get up and dance, even if we're mid-thirties-mamas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Girl, Hated her CD","review":"I love Christina's voice and her personality, yet, her CD is more than dissappointing, too many slow songs, the 1st single is the only catchy song on the CD. It has a couple of good slow songs...but buying a CD for 2 songs is a let down. Get Jessica Simpson's Public Affair, so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just cuz you can SCREAM REAL LOUD doesn't mean you should!","review":"Don't believe all the hype...this album is terrible. You will like this album if:1.You enjoy the sound of a screaming woman singing endless scales...over...and over... and over again.2.You love songs that go on and on about how great the singer is and just how wonderful she has managed to touch everyone's life (the last track). It's really pathetic.3. Sophmoric oversimplifications on what it means \\"to be a woman\\".That said, there are two good songs on the first disc. These are:Back in the dayStill NastyBut I have to tell you, you get pretty tired of playing these two songs over and over again....best thing is just to download them. The second disc is pure superfluous junk, with a few good songs to make it interesting.Both discs would have made a decent single disc. Don't waste your money without listening to the whole thing first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time And Money","review":"There is no substance to this wreck. Absolute pap. She should go back to bouncing that sweet body around, chirping stupid, pre-pubescent lyrics and leave serious music to grown-ups. I hope that I can dump this dog as \\"played once\\" and hope it will never again be in my earshot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of the Year.","review":"This is the best CD i've heard in awhile. All the songs are amazing and different. Christina really done it this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love that Christina paid homage to the stars of the 20-40's era. I love the music and each song tells a different story. I think she could of toned-down her vocals on some of the tracks. I love the outfits and colors in the booklet. I still think her Stripped album was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"She still got it....","review":"wow....she still got it....This woman's voice STILL gives me the chills...all it took was one listen to \\"Right Man\\"unbelieveable...she still got it after so long. I honestly thought she could never outdo 'Stripped': boy was i WRONG.Listen for yourself. I won't blab much or select which songs you should listen to...go cop it. i need not say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm going back to basics.","review":"23 songs ,two cd's, one great voice. That's what 'Back to Basics' is. One of my favorites cds. Thank you Christina, that's how music should sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics - My 2 cents","review":"I've always been an admirer of Christina, especially after seeing the VH1 \\"Behind the Music\\" special on her life. That said, I never had any of her music in my collection . . . until now. My first impression: this girl can really sing; she is the real deal. It reminded me of how I reacted the first time I heard Whitney. Let's just hope Christina doesn't follow that route. I will spare all a disertation on Back to Basics -- it's already been done . . . quite well I might add and most of which I agree with. If you enjoy good music, great talent (both in front of and behind the mic) get this album. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"When I heard the first single(Aint no other man)I thought it was hot for Christina to take it back old school. Of course this track is hot so I thought the rest of the album would suck. I sampled the album online and was impressed. She has some hiphop tracks on it as well which actually sound hot and Im an owner of alot of Old School hiphop. Nice album Christina, much love for bringing it back to the roots, Jazz,Hip-hop and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um..........no I don't think so","review":"This cd is a dissapointment. I regret not listening to it before I bought it. I'm not into jazz and blues music so I couldn't appreciate the vast majority of the songs on either cd. It seems like a blast from the past that I am not interested in. I think there are about 3 songs I could maybe get into and they are not that great because I can't even remember the titles. I was hoping that the second disc in the set would be a little different than the first and while it is to a certain extent I still wasn't impressed. I absolutley loved Stripped (2003) so I assumed this one would be great as well. My advice to Christina fans: LISTEN TO THE CD BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina's finally won me over!","review":"This woman can really sing, and it's a pleasure to hear such diversity from her. The songs are great, the back-ups and instrumentation are outstanding, and it's pure joy to listen to this CD. I hope this influences other artists to work on original vocal technique and presentation. This CD is a shining star, and so is Christina Aguilera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total letdown","review":"This CD had only 3 good songs out of about 20.

I've always loved christina for her voice... she's got one of those rare voices you can't get from anywhere... like mariah... but when i listened to this cd, i just fell in love with her GREAT ballad \\"Save Me From Myself\\"... this is dedicated to her husband and all by herself... I LOVE this track.... it is so fresh... and i love how sultry it sounds... christina really turns my head on this one... thank you for this song! i dedicate it to my husband too... because it is sooo how i feel too.. and that track 9 also... right after it, the Right Man... great power..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing flowery is really necessary...","review":"I'm listening to Xtina's album right now on Rhapsody and wanted to write a review. However, after reading a couple of glowing remarks wrought with flowery description, I realized the best way to sum it up is BUY IT! It's good music. There's really nothing more than that. Lyrically. Production-wise. It's better than anything else out. Christina Aguilera understands her voice better than anyone else, and it is a pleasure to hear what she hears in her head. It's absolutely breathtaking. She really respects you as a person to have put so much heart, soul, and care into two albums, equally amazing. For that alone, you have to buy this double CD. Just BUY IT! I'm ordering mine Friday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"I have been a professional musician all of my life, this woman has a god given talent that nobody in my meetings has come close to.

She kind of soyunds like a young mariah and whitney merged together. Great great album this time around. I like the soulfulness in her voice this time around. YOu can tell this album is not over produces. Standouts are \\"Save me from myself, Candyman, Oh Mother,Slow down baby, mercy on me. Overall this is album is worth the purchase. We are gioing to see how bias the Grammy's are and watch how much grammy's she gets thi syear. I don't know why. Back on topic this album is worth the listen. Great vocals and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very blah coming from Chrisitina.","review":"Stripped was a far better cd. As a matter of fact, stripped was an excellent cd. I give her credit for trying to be different, but this cd wasn't her best at all. And I expected better since she had a few years since stripped was released. In that time, I felt she could've done something better. I basically only bought this cd because I am a huge fan of hers and would like to have everything she releases, but luckily I only paid $9.99 for this cd on it's week of release. Unlike the $20.00 I shelled out for stripped a few years back, however it was worth every penny.Now with this cd you get a double disc. In my opinion disc two has a few cute songs on it while disc one is just a waste of time to listen to. However, this is not a freshman album and I expect better than cute songs from Christina. Hopefully she is already in the studio working on the next one and trying to make up for this mediocre cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Get it Christina, You Love Your Husband","review":"How many songs can one person write about their husband? In Christina's case, almost a whole disc's worth. Almost every song on the first disc is about her husband. Couldn't you write about something else? There are two songs about how she is still dirty. Please, who cares. And she doesn't even say she's dirty in a nice way. If you don't agree with her, then she insults you. The second disc is remakes of old songs, and songs that belong in another decade. I don't mind hearing songs like that, but could you mix it up a bit. What happened to the Christina that made fun songs, and songs that told an important message? I wish I didn't pay the $18."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back To What?","review":"I was intrigued by this concept album and bought it on its strength. I'm sad to say that although there are some fun moments on the album where everything gels nicely, mostly it feels overbloated and surprisingly, a bit directionless.Christina mixes in some old sounds and horns to conjure memories of the past, but never goes far enough. She stops short at conjuring the innocent fun and musicality of teh time. Instead she samples which I find a bit shallow. All the songs definately sound of this era and not of the past. Add in the trite pean to fans \\"Thank You\\" and the cloying \\"The Right Man\\" along with \\"Save Me FromMyself\\" and you begin to see the half-hearted effort in actually paying respect to the past and building upon it.I applaud the idea (and wish it was done more often) but the execution on this album fails to live up to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The advancement of the commonaire","review":"I bought, I listened, I threw away! Tough times in the music biz. Hip-Hop has hit another stalemate. Even in the attempt to advance they have managed to circle around and bump each other on the head. Let's take Christina out of the equation for a second, the fun boy producers did a pretty good job at creating another common album. Good attempt at getting your money from the project. Money Money Money. Putting Christna back in the equation. Her cat screach of a voice has gone on for two albums too long. she should probably give it up at this point. You've made your money. It's time to retire into the depths of the mainstream tabloids as another failed marriage and an eating disorder. I'm not impressed. there isn't too much I can say. The rest of the unsold CD's should be ground up and used as insulation on newly constructed homes in Louisiana. That would a better use of the plastic. Way to be common!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I'm a really big Christina fan. Hands down, she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there. This album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics. It would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role. Although there are a couple of good tracks, the rest are filler. I was really disappointed with the outcome of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slutina Uglyaira","review":"She tries too hard to copy every other diva and she has no originality what so ever.

Hate this so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Review","review":"I have alwyas been a fan of Christina but never purchased any of her music until now.This was a great start with a wide range of subjects for her tremendous voice. It has been very nice to see a young lady these days be sassy without being trashy AND have so much talent and use it wisely!I hope she continues to thrive and maintain her integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I was very pleased that she went the extra mile and included 2 CDs worth of music. All the songs were perfect. I loved every single one of them. I would recommend this for men, women, and any age older than 16. Some songs contained sexual content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina is an amazing gift.","review":"Every blue moon the universe sends us a musical protégé to inspire and move us in ways that only music can. Christina is a gift, and despite what one might think of her on the surface, her musical genuis cannot be denied. Just listen to the track \\"Without You\\" on the first CD of this gorgeous and delicious collection of music. Her vocals sore, tempt and tease throughout the track, even the production and arrangement captures you in ways music rarely can. I often like to sing along when I listen to great music, but I find myself, when listening to Christina, sitting in quiet awe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! (as usual)","review":"I love how Christina takes on a completely persona every time she releases an album. Some might be irritated by her constantly shifting musical style, but I think it's good that she experiments. She's gotta find her groove! Even though some of the songs weren't really early 20th century inspired, like she said, they're still good. There are only a couple of songs I don't like too much on the whole album, which is pretty amazing.I also was happy to find a dedication from Christina to her fans, entitled \\"Thank You.\\" I wish I could have participated in that song.Overall, Christina can no longer be shoved into that corner with Britney, Lindsay, and all the other crappy female singers out there. She has true talent, and she isn't afraid to show it! Go Christina!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"Christina Aguilera has the most amazing and powerful voice I have heard in a long time. I was hoping this CD was going to show off her talent for singing jazz. I had thought that this CD was going to have her singing some old tunes. Instead she took old tunes and put her pop twist on them. I would love to hear her sing like she did on the Herbie Hancock CD that came out last year. She was amazing on that CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She should market her voice, not her sexuality","review":"What a shame. A wonderfully talented young woman with the most outstanding female voice in pop music today, and she still hasn't figured it out. I don't want to listen to an album filled with lyrics - some explicit - about sex. Whatever happened to songs that had meaning and could move you like \\"Hurt\\"? This is perhaps the best song on the album because it showcases Christina's awesome voice, and the lyrics are powerful enough to move anyone to tears.I'm begging today's pop artists to cut the sex talk and get back to real music and lyrics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Basic","review":"I liked this one even better than I thought I would. It is definitely PG-13 if not R lyrics-wise, but SO much fun to listen to. I was impressed that Christina was involved in all of the song-writing, and she leaves Jessica, Mandy, Brittney, et al light-years behind vocally. Slick way with a lyric, catchy melodies, good merge of classic and modern vibes."},{"rating":"1","title":"back to P.O.P...please?","review":"i grant christina the courage to reinvent herself in the music arena each time.But i think this time she overdid it.She should have stuck to the pop formula or the rock one of her last album.This one move proved too ambitious for the chart.The Linda Perry supervision can't savage the album concept from being tooooo much for the casual listener, and also i do believe for some hard core fans.Again, hats off for the road she chooses to take on..as Pink she really knows what she wants and she's not afriad to take the charge, but the project is too odd for my likings.Let's see what happens next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing sound....Welcome back to the charts Christina!!!!","review":"What a refreshing sound. This album has something for everyone. With this album, Christina toys around with the sounds of blues and jazz along with the pop sound of today. She pulls it off well. Christina was executive producer on this album and co-wrote all of the songs. Way to go for her!!! For anyone who says Christina can't sing, must have their ears plugged or something. This girl can sing!!! To compare her vocal ability with Britney, Hilary, Lindsay, Ciara, Janet even Madonna is obsurd. This girl is in the league with Mariah, Celine and Whitney whom all have vocal chops. Where many of the pop sounds today are all sounding the same, Christina has stepped it up and pushed the creative envelope once again. All the songs are refreshing and enjoyable. However, my favorites are: \\"Ain't no other man\\" \\"Candyman\\" \\"Hurt\\" \\"Oh Mother\\" \\"Back in the Day\\" \\"Mercy on Me\\" and \\"I got trouble\\". This is a must have album!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to Barfing.","review":"Yeah she has a \\"great\\" voice (whatever). But she so oversings everything that it completely ruins anything she is trying to achieve musically or emotionally. Too much is too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype abou this album???","review":"I really tried to like \\"Ain't no other man\\"..gave it many listens and just couldn't bring myself to like it...While the instrumentation was interesting and different, her constant oversinging really gets in her way, especially when I know Christina does have a good voice, which is apparant on her other albums. Unfortunely, I didn't even like the only song that had any prayer of being a hit (mentioned above). The other songs on this album are more of the same; oversinging, no restraint to the runs and lack of good hooks to draw the listener in.Christina's Stripped album was far better than this, as was her first album. Christina should be saying her prayers to the MTV fairy for all the publicity which I'm quite sure had a hand in making this album so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"U GUYS R JUST JEALOUS","review":"Everyone who says that this album isn't what it was \\"promised\\" to be or that she sings too many notes or that she needs to hold them.. or that she over sings (BULL) is just jealous. AS IF you could do even 5% as much as she's done with this album.. or sing like her. In my personal opinion, she is the best singer of her generation. Plus, who do u ppl think u r critizing her?! She IS a real human being who cares about what other people say about her.. and she did work extremely hard on this album. Its great.. get over it... get lives. <3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low amperage","review":"The packaging claims this is a 6-amp switch, but it smoked and melted after about 20 minutes on a 55-watt headlamp load (at 14 volts that's 4 amps).

The story involves a struggle between Fowler and Pyle, an American undercover operative and Fowler's romantic rival. Pyle and Fowler hold opposing views of the war, love, God, and democracy. Whatever matters to man, they disagree about. Fowler, whose vision of reality stifles his belief in ideals, emerges as a romantic and ideological rival of Pyle, whose ideals blind him to reality. America's Cold War policy in Southeast Asia is critically presented in the person of Pyle. Masterfully written, Graham Greene confronts us with two flawed, stereotypical characters and leaves us to determine the hero and the villain. I still have not made up my mind. A work which can leave the reader in such a quandary is a great work of art. Read and form your own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Used book but arrived as new.

I wanted an historical novel about Vietnam and this gave me some background before the Vietnam war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have recently re-read this classic book, and it is both a marvelous exploration of the human condition and an incisive look at how dangerous the ignorant idealistic zealot can be--the sort of person who can excuse the deaths of innnocent people in a country he has decided to bring democracy to by saying that they were \\"just war casualties\\" (regretable but inevitable) and also that they \\"died for democracy\\"--whether they wanted to or not. This is as timely now as when it was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about premonition","review":"This is THE story about the beginnings of America's involvement in the mess that became the Vietnam War. Graham Greene had future vision and even in 1955 knew what would happen. He both explains and predicts the future in The Quiet American, a beautiful book set in Vietnam in the 50s. The book is told from the point of view of Fowler, an aging British journalist. Fowler's beautiful but opportunistic Vietnamese mistress, Phuong (who is herself a metaphor for the country itself), is coveted and for a while, claimed by a seemingly innocuous American named Pyle. Slowly, Pyle's real purpose in the country is discovered, and Fowler's servant upsets his determinedly neutral, uninvolved stance by saying, \\"There comes a time when you must choose sides.\\"Absolutely wonderful, profoundly thought-provoking, multi-layered book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quiet American.","review":"\\"The Quiet American\\" is a skillfully written book, by one of the most underrated authors of our century.

This is a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet American","review":"This product arrived in great condition unfortunately the narrator lacks expression when reading. I was disappointed in this and turned it off. How do you describe the character Phuong as a clink of a tea cup or as a phoenix without changing the tone and expressiveness of your voice.I doubt if I will listen to any more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and-a-half stars is probably more accurate","review":"This is my first ever book by Greene. I did not care for his writing style -- very dry, and he did not make the characters come alive for me.It is hard to read literature without having current events impact on what you're reading. For me, this has been especially true post-9/11. This book was filled with anti-American sentiment, which really bothered me.I only read this book because I wanted to see the movie with Brendan Fraser. Of the actors working today, Fraser is my second-favorite actor after Tom Hanks (way, way second, because Mr. Hanks is of course far superior), but second-favorite nonetheless. The movie was actually in some ways better than the book, except Caine was too old for the role, and Fraser was also miscast, IMO.But back to Greene. Despite my very lukewarm response to this book, I will still read one other novel by him. I never give up on anybody who is considered a major novelist without at least reading two books by him or her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme My Opium Pipe Baby!!!","review":"It appears to me that Mr. Greene repeats his Theme of The Use And Abuse Of Power in every one of his books. One could easily go so far as to say that he has been writing the same book for the past 30 years. The main protagonist in his book is an Opium Addicted Serial Monogamist named Fowler who has become jaded by his involvement in the Vietnam War and seeks solace in the Arms Of Morpheus or his Vietnamese girlfriend Phuong. Then he meets an idealistic young man named Pyle who decides he can make a difference to what is happening in their world. The rest of the book explores their relationship with each other and it comes as no surprise to the reader that Pyle falls in love with Phuong with the promise that he can give her a better life.I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I am totally bewildered by the fact that it is considered to be a so called \\"Modern Classic Of Literature.The jaded antics of an opium junkie holds no atraction for me to read ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, prophetic, deep and a terrific read","review":"Graham Greene lambasts both the old colonialism of the French and the British and the naive paternalism of the Americans.....The narrator is a caustic British cynic observing the crumbling of the French regime with indifference. The eponymous American is an energetic idealist convinced that Indochina is a less civilised Nebraska in need of a dose of American redemption. He sets about changing the world with disastrous effect. This book is an absolute classic. An ascerbic and prophetic analysis of Vietnam, strong engaging characters, a sarcastic wit and a scintillating story to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Greene's novel portrays the beginning on America's entry to the Vietnam war from the point of view of an English Journalist, Fowler. It is full of flowery speech, lyrical and smooth and portrays a novel of sexual intrigue, espionage and the horror of war in a superb fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant novel. Read it.","review":"First, let me say that this novel is brilliant, insightful and lyric. It manages to be thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time and is just a true joy to read on so many levels. That said, the reading of \\"The Quiet American\\" in this audio book format leaves something to be desired.Joseph Porter has a lovely voice well-suited to the narrator, and even well-suited to the main female character Phuong. However, as soon as the titular quiet american breaks his silence, the feigned American accent Porter reads with is simply appalling. I found it beyond distracting. I find that if you can't do an accent well for a public reading, best to leave it alone and read in your own voice. Joseph Porter could be forgiven for reading the lines of the American characters with a British lilt. There was no reason to forge ahead just to decimate the reading so awfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Graham Greene","review":"Forget the bogus religiosity and sentimental notions of redemption. Forget also Greene's dubious morality and instead thrill at the story and the quality of his writing. The 'Quiet American' still hits all the right buttons - great characters (not even Michael Caine, in a recent screen adaptation, can ruin that!), thrilling plot and close historical and geographical detail making his evocation of French Vietnam on the eve of the (disastrous) American involvement fascinating reading. Greene at his best. Top read. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All is fair in love and war","review":"I think that cliche best sums up this book's theme. Greene makes one of the best arguments in favor of cynicism that I've ever read. This should be a must read for presidential candidates or just any guy who has ever competed with another guy for the love of a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivations","review":"What does Greene's personality have to do with whether the book is good or not? Greene's personality is irrelevant. Also irrelevant is whether certain readers interpret Fowler as sympathetic. I found him pretty repellant as a human being but thought his character was well drawn and totally believable. He doesn't have to be likable. I'm a bit confused when people use an author's personality or other people's interpretations as their reasons for liking or disliking a book. That seems pretty superficial. Judge the book on it's own merits -- if you thought it was well-written and interesting, give it five stars. If you didn't, pan it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment.","review":"I am a fan of Graham Greene; he is one of the few writers I have ever read who deals with issues of hope and dispair in real and honest terms. After reading works such as The Heart of the Matter and The Human Factor, I expected more of Greene than a shallow and naive allegory about America's involvement in Viet Nam. Greene is far more adept at revealing the frailties of the human heart than he is at reducing the complexities of world politics into individual characters. In The Quiet American, Greene tries to do both but succeeds at neither. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graham is a Great Writer","review":"The story is a fantastic master piece. It speaks about two men who are in love with a Beautiful, and Voluptuous Asian woman[Phoenix-Phuong]. The story takes place in the country of Saigon. It also deals with a war. It is Fowler who wins in the end and gets the girl, but Phoenix's heart is not his but Pyle's. Fantastic!

Heck, Greene (at least here) isn't even enough of a wordsmith to convincingly evoke l'Indochine in the 50's, so it's not even much of a travel book. I found myself doing much of the work in that regard.Obviously, the characters as \\"representative\\" of their nation's philosophies (the Brit as cynic, the American as idealist, etc.) is well-taken, though I thought the device was heavy-handed and unproductive.Another thing that, I think, had this book rolling on a flat tire was Greene's \\"in medias res\\" beginning, in which he reveals Pyle's death, etc. Although this intially seemed competent, in retrospect it robbed the rest of the story of whatever interest or suspense it would otherwise have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"greene classic","review":"A classic whose truth seems not to fade:\\"I hope to God you know what you are doing here.

Alden Pyle, the quiet American,has been said by Greene biographers to be a takeoff of Edwin Lansdale, the model for William Lederer's \\"The Ugly American,\\" a favorable account of America in Asia written contemporaneous with Greene's novel.

The idea of a pair of cat-like telepathic aliens uncovering a sinister plot certainly has possibilities. But I was more than a little disappointed. Most of the characters are cliche from head to toe. Far from being good sci-fi, the villains seemed more the type you'd expect to find in comic books, and their plot had all the cheesiness of an Austin Powers movie without the humor. Tim and Verna, the two primary human protagonists, are boring, and they're the best human characters in the book. The only characters I really enjoyed reading about were the two cats, whose clever and amusing scenes were too few and far between. The plot has huge holes in it, and seems to have undertones critical of how science approaches paranormal phenomena. I'd recommend it only to readers who enjoy books that are so bad they're funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still waiting for the sequel","review":"I really enjoyed this book--the premise, the cats, and the other characters--and how they worked together.

Terry's group are treated like they are a danger to the community. People curse them and call them names while they have they're own children on their shoulders. Some of the \\"christian\\" individuals in this video are kind of frightening. It reminded me of the Salem Witch Trials that took place so long ago. Some things never change. One of my favorite parts of the video are the original songs put to video footage. They include: Are We America, Children of the Circle, Lady Liberty, and Pagan Man. This is a one-of-a-kind video.

When Darcy was speaking it was all mostly word for word from Austen, or a paraphrasing of what he said in Austen's work. I thought there would be some extra scenes, and though there were a few thrown in, they were rather dull. I did gain some insight into Darcy as a person, but I felt it was more of a telling, not a showing.

I give the book two stars because it isn't really \\"bad\\", it's just boring.

The aspiring writer is urged, \\"Show, don't tell.\\" This book has a lot of \\"tell\\" and very little \\"show.\\" The last section, when Darcy and Elizabeth finally come together, is a little better, but this does not redeem what is, in the end, an ill conceived bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware nit-picks!","review":"I really cannot comment as to the plot Darcy's Story since it reproduces P&P; so exactly (in fact, a majority of the language is lifted directly from Austen's novel.)

The narrative is plodding and somewhat repetitive, and neither particularly pleasant nor unpleasant to read. Its greatest virtue may be its brevity--it is readable in a single sitting.My major objection to this book is the shoddy copyediting. Elizabeth is alternately referred to as Miss Elizabeth and Miss Bennet (in her elder sister's presence,) and other characters are sometimes referred to by the wrong name/title.

If it had been 1/4 to 1/3 as long as it was, it wouldn't have felt so contrived. As it was, its one of those books that is mostly filler. The heroine is 20 but acts about l4. The hero, who wallows endlessly in self pity is, frankly, irritating. The supporting characters are fine, but add nothing. They pretty much enter the scene, say something, flutter about insignificantly, and exit-stage-left, like in a bad high-school play. The premise of the story line is cute, but can't carry a full length book. I couldn't form an attachment for either of the leads and kept wondering if they'd ever grow up.

Bluestocking heroine adoring from afar? Check. Late-night drunken passion in the study? Check. More passion in the huting cabin during a rainstorm? Check. A near-death that makes the hero come to his sense? Check.

My favorite aspects of her other books are the humorous conversations and likeable characters. Neither was to be found in \\"The Secret Diaries...\\". Turner came across as mean-spirited and a bit useless. Miranda's love for him seemed out of place considering how he acted towards her. Miranda also seemed unable to put a coherent sentence together, and mostly used snarky little one-liners to get back at Turner. The supporting characters also seemed like they had been tossed in to the mix for a bit of humor, but were not people I hoped to see in upcoming books (unlike the Bridgerton books where I actually looked forward to reading each of their installments).

If she could just contain herself when writing dialogue, I would be more pleased with her books. As it is, the reader has to force herself to make it past the first 150 pages. Quinn tries so hard to write witty dialogue, but in reality, it just comes across as stupid. And for some reason, she seems to shove all this stupidity to the beginning of her novels. You want to give up reading long before wading through the inanity to get to the good part. She often redeems herself somwhat in the last 100 pages, as she does here, because Quinn finally becomes serious and moves her characters along without allowing them to talk as much. But, really, there is no reason to spend your good money on a Quinn novel. Go pick up a Mary Balogh or Jo Beverley book if you want to read truly gifted Regency writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down","review":"I like Julia Quinn a lot.

ABout the only one I was interested in was the heroine's best friend, Olivia, who also happens to be the hero's little sister. 4.)

And while it wasn't as good as The Viscount Who Loved Me, When He Was Wicked, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton and all her really early work, it was an enjoyable read. I liked Turner right from the beginning and I liked Miranda but eventually she began to grate. They were going to get married after he compromised her and that was fine with her but then everything confusingly shifted when all of a sudden she wouldn't marry him unless he loved her, not at all understanding that he'd been burned once and didn't want it to happen again.

A great read if you like clever, well written, historical romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Diary....","review":"If you want a riotous historical romp about wine, debauchery and adventure, this book isn't for you. However, if you're after a gentle tale of love (with a bit of sex thrown in for good measure), then The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever will keep you entertained for hours.The story takes place in 19th century England, and is a predicable tale of unrequited love. Miranda is our heroine - a shy and quiet country girl who yearns for the love of her best friend's eldest brother (Turner). She writes daily in her diary of her longing to be with her beloved, but unfortunately, the dashing Turner has no interest in the plain and awkward Miranda.The reader will know exactly how it's all going to turn out, but don't let that put you off. Like any good romance, there are still some surprises along the way, and the author has done a marvellous job of keeping the pace light and entertaining.A relaxing weekend read.Zara StevensBoy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Rehashed Romance Novel","review":"There was absolutely nothing that stood out for me in this novel. I am very disappointed. SPOILER ALERT- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED- How many times does a romance writer have to use the whole, the couple is at a house party routine, gets caught in the rain then has sex in the wood shed...? Then dum dum dum....the heroine gets pregnant. I mean oh my god, that's as predictable as a soap opera. I've come to expect better from Ms. Quinn than this!

I've even played her in a few school plays. Therefore, I have read so many books and publishing about her. This one was interesting in the fact that it had her speaking for herself. Even though it may have been narrated, I still felt as if I could picture her speaking the words written. I also like the letters from others regarding her and how she conducted herself. This book did not seem like a far fetched fairy tale. There are even a few actual photos of Harriet Tubman. The photos look very clear and sharp on the Kindle Fire. I would have given it a 5 if there were less letters about her and more stories coming directly from her. Even though I enjoyed the letters describing her.

You now have sound in both ears. It's not stereo sound; it's monoaural sound in both ears. It does what it's supposed to do. Mine came in a labeled zip-lock bag, no real packaging, but I throw that stuff away anyway.

I contacted te seller again, and I guess of the holidays it took a few days for them to replie back, they stated to me. Would have to talk to their tec about the nonworking adaptor. I wanted for the tec to contact me but heard nothing. I ordered the adaptor from another seller got it fast and otked lie a charm.

I have a somewhat unique problem in that I am deaf in one ear. Therefore stereo headphones where the source is truly stereo cause me to lose 1/2 the music, or hear it as very muffled and far away. Solution: a mono adaptor. This one arrived with the plastic housing cracked. I didn't notice that at first and plugged it in to my computer to listen to jazz on Pandora. Although it worked, it required that I bring the volume WAY up. The sound was so washed out that it was like listening to an ancient transistor radio.

The sound quality is not good, it is not a quality guitar. I eventually changed out the cheap low cost tuners and replaced them with premium tuners. I also changed out the cheap plastic nut and bridge and installed a bone nut and bridge. These changes made the instrument bearable for a while. In time however, after I got used to the instrument, as opposed to a normal 6 string guitar, the lack of sound quality became insurmountable.

It was the first time I read about women in Canada that had a realistic feel without any stereotypical canadiana themes. The various short stories portray people with whom the reader can identify because they are presented as women dealing with many of the problems our society presents today, like divorce and its ramifications. The heroines are usual everyday people dealing with family, children and emotions in a courageous manner without becoming melodramatic caricatures.

I listen to a lot of rock music, and the songs on this album could have appeared on several other bands' discs. There are a few very solid numbers (lead-off \\"Into the Dark\\", the amazing \\"If I Told You This Was Killing Me, Would You Stop?\\"), but on the whole, this CD has a very strong 'been-there, done-that' feel to it.

I'm guessing that this was an attempt to get famous, which the band most likely regrets; because I recently read on the Tooth and Nail website that the band themself ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS AGAIN.

Or is that the other way around? Oh well. I think that this is a very musically complicated album, and I appreciate the Juliana Theory's use of eighth notes. It's much much better than using stupid sell out 16th notes (Knapsack). Brett Detar frightens me, and so does Not Brett Detar.

And I think it really hits the mark sometimes. But 95% of the book is semantics and wordplay. And I think the book really stretches to fit some things into the \\"nothing is everything\\" theory. You'll wait at least 50 pages before you start learning real science. It must have been fun for Cole to play with the idea of nothing in riddle-like prose, but it really takes away from the science of the book. I say skip to the bibliography and read the books cited.

It is a deep look at an elusive, yet centrally important subject, presented with eloquence, originality and charm. It amazes me that Cole has been able to take us to the frontiers of physics, exploring questions that physicists sstill puzzle over, and yet still make it entirely accessible (and, yes, even fun) to a complete novice like myself. I have read about ideas like string theory and the strange \\"repulsive force\\" that seems to be expanding the universe, but never before were these ideas so clear and appealing to me. Her writing is so fresh and lovely, it takes your breath away.

This whole album kicks serious butt, but the reason for 4 stars is would be for the fact the monsters from radio constantly replays the usuals on this set of his live concerts from 1975. The highlight of this album as any classic rock lover would know is Do You Feel Like I Do, all thirteen minutes of it, don't ever get sick of that. I grew up hearing Show Me The Way, and of course another favorite on this album Baby, I Love Your Way. The other tracks on this album are packed with a punch too including Shine On, (I'll Give You) Money, and slower pace Lines On My Face.

Perhaps you are unwilling to deny the past. In either case, this Original Master Recording by the now out-of-business Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab does rightful justice to one of the most popular and exciting live recordings ever. This particular MFSL release utilzes the company's Ultra Disc II, The Gain System, process of mastering directly from the original master tape and finalizing on a 24-karat gold CD.

The cd cover is the same as the album cover but you get a booklet inside. The four extra tracks are great and the sound is much better. All around a very good package. Peter Frampton is still one the best guitar players/ composers still after all these years. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 5 live albums of all time...","review":"in my opinion...even with the fact that it IS the best-selling live album of all time. Any person that wants to sit back and relive a moment and time in history should put this one on to listen to the rock sounds of the mid-seventies. No album better defines this genre than Frampton Comes Alive. Peter Frampton - master guitar player, singer, and songwriter. Nothing better than live music. Put them together - ***** all the way. Great roadtrip music or tripping music, either way you look at it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frampton 'Still' Comes Alive","review":"I purchased a copy of this CD because I had gotten tickets to the 'Comes Alive' Anniversary Concert. I hadn't heard it in soooo many years and it brought back the memories of the great tunes and his guitar skills that we took for granted back then. What an amazing man/artist! Thanks Peter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Live Rock Album ever","review":"This live album is a masterpiece.\\"Do you feel like we do,\\" is the greatest 14mins.you'll ever hear on your Stero.Five years ago I was at a gas station,and this song was blasting from a truck in front of me. When the song was over with,this 65year old guys comes out screaming,\\"Man,WDVE is jamming tonight.\\" All ages love this record. This was the first time I heard a talkbox in a song.It sounds like Peter's saying,\\"I want to F you.I could play this one song untill I die and still hear new cords.Even after 14mins.you still want this song to go on. \\"Show me the Way,\\" was another hit from the Album along with,\\"Baby I love you way.\\" After this record,Peter Frampton didn't have much luck with his other recordings,but if I was Peter,I'd be so proud of myself for recording the greatest live album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still misty after 30 years!","review":"Oh my gosh after 30 years 'Do You Feel Like I Do\\" still brings tears to my eyes!

Frampton is a superb guitar player with a unique sound (this album made it famous); an impeccable songwriter as well as a charismatic and, ok, good looking lead singer.when you go past this album, you realize that frampton has a solid track record of pop songwriting & impeccable musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED","review":"This is not that great. I grew up in the 1970s and alway thought it was over rated. You know why this album got big, b/c the casual music fans (especially girls) that were really not into buying albums...this was their live album. They never knew about classic live albums w/energy like Deep Purple \\"made in japan\\", LEd Zep \\"song remains the same\\", Stones \\"get your ya yas out\\", Who \\"live at Leeds\\", Thin Lizzy \\"live and dangerous\\" and every 70's artist that released the obligatory double live album, they didn't know about these classic works.Frampton's music is decent (\\"Do you feel like we do\\" is great!) but the other material is not that great.You make think I am wrong but maybe that is why Frampton came quickly and tne went just as quickly. He was a corporate pushed fad!Frampton was always a quality guitar slinger, legit artist but this just is not that great of a live album. Does anybody really listen to this from start to finish?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was duped; thought it was the double CD","review":"This was a single cd, I thought it was the double cd or else I would not have ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated album ever","review":"For years this album has been highly placed in the \\"best live rock albums ever\\" stakes. I 've read glowing reviews of how fantastic it is. I'd heard two songs from it \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\" and \\"Show Me The Way.\\" I'd thought that they weren't exactly rock and indeed they were usually played on easy listening stations.So I took the plunge and bought it. What a let down. I can't even begin to fathom how such lightweight, overdubbed, easy listening rubbish has wormed it's way into the \\"great live albums\\". Doobie Wah, Wind Of Change, Penny For Your Thoughts etc wouldn't be out in a hotel lobbyI'm not denying Frampton is a good guitar player, but don't assault your ears with this pap, you'd be far better off with Humble Pie's Rockin The Fillmore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't remind me","review":"I've been racking my brain to come up with an album, other than something really obvious like a Bay City Rollers record, to illustrate just how awful 70s radio music was, and what we kids had to put up with.And then I remembered this.To quote another shocker, Stephen Caratzas (May 10 2000) took the words right out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not rock'n'roll!","review":"Can I take away stars?

Rather than being a musical touchstone it was more like an infestation. The mere sight of this album cover makes me want to decapitate a small furry rodent. I'll show you the way, Peter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Benchmark For Any LIVE Album","review":"This is one of the coolest and one of the absolute greatest LIVE albums EVER! Frampton knows how to please and this cd is proof even though you arent physically even there! All the songs are great but the highlight of the album would be \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" which is, in my opinion, one of the best LIVE songs ever done period. It is just so cool when he is wailing away on the guitar and then starts going at it with the voice box, the whole crowd gets very enthused. Anyways if you're looking for a good LIVE album than this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decades Later, It Still Works Magic!","review":"Woowie Zowie! This recording is still fantastic 30+ years down the line. Clean, bright - just plain enjoyable! \\"Do you feel, do you feel like I do...?\\" If you want to start over with a fresh, clean version of this double CD, Amazon came up with good prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say that Peter Griffin did not already: this album was a monster! Tell me, who didn't own this album?","review":"Great album, really one of the great live albums of all time. Yes, the mouthpiece distorter on the guitar was done to death in the subsequent decades, but at the time of this concert it was still new and fresh and done by the best.I would definitely recommend this two disc set as it has been re-mastered and features the great Do You Feel Like We Do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mindless guitar rock","review":"For a listner who first experienced rock and roll two decades after this double cd was published, I was pleastenly suprised by what I found in Frampton's music. The lyrics are a different story, serving only to weigh down what what otherwise be great rock instrumentals. Don't purchase it expecting Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell; the best talking Frampton delivers comes from his guitar during the epic \\"Do you feel like we do.\\" Do expect some of the best rock of the 70's, music that would move entire arenas even today"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I thought I was getting the entire album. I only got the second album of the recording. I should have bee informed it was not the entire album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I could never understand why this album was so popular when it first came out and still can't, after all these years, understand why this live performance is so beloved by so many people. It's annoying in the way the audience responds so admiringly to the mediocre performance. So pretentious and corny. I swear everyone must have been high or brainwashed on a Peter Frampton acceptance drug given to them before the concert. Boring. And to think that this is one of the top selling live records of all time.....jeeez."},{"rating":"1","title":"peter frampton live is the best live album of all times","review":"THANKS PETER FOR THIS GREAT MASTERPIECE. I HAD TOO RATE IT 2. BECAUSE OF THEM USEING THE HDCD. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE DECODER ON YOUR EQUITMENT TO HEAR THE TRUE SOUND. ALSO I NOTICED SOME DROP OUTS IN THE RECORDING.

My first bad experience with Amazon, but it truly stunk -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookmark for the 70's","review":"I just finished watching ''Behind The Music'' on VH 1 about Peter Frampton and I thought it was one of the best ever. It brought back so many great memories from this incredible album/cd. Along with Fleetwood Mac's ''Rumours'', The Eagles ''Hotel California,'' Boston's first and Bob Seger's ''Night Moves,''this was 70's rock at it's finest. It's a real shame he could'nt continue with great follow- ups although I thought ''I'm In You'' was underrated. For all of you ''babyboomers,''go out and buy this cd and rediscover again what a great cd this is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still rocks !","review":"This release seems to never get old. I still consider this a great live album and I never seem to get tired of listening to it no matter how many times I also hear the songs on the radio. I got to finally see Peter Frampton recently and I got to sit in the front row. I was blown away. Frampton, without the hair, put on a great show. See my review also for Frampton, Live in Detroit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lively Live Album, Indeed","review":"What can you say that already hasn't been said about this album? Maybe that the recording itself is so good that playing this on my first cheap little stereo system back in 1975 made it sound like more like a $1000 system. Some of the songs are very good while others are simply okay. But what really gathered me up about this live album when listening to it back then is Peter Frampton's guitar work. Some of the solos he plays on his Les Paul, especially the first and last ones on \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" and both solos on \\"I Wanna Go to the Sun\\" are just so incredibly vibrant and spectacular. And his band sounds pretty good as well. This is, overall, a marvelous musical work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"With the Christine Bennett series getting stale, this is a wonderful alternative. With Jane being a NYPD detective, the stories are a lot more plausible and the writing just seems to be on a much higher level.The only thing I don't like about the series is Jane's relationship with Hack. She comes across as such an intelligent, self-sufficient heroine in the books that it's disappointing to see her acting like a lovesick schoolgirl over a married man. Hopefully, as the series progresses, Hack will become history and Jane will find a real romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel music","review":"This is a good CD of travel music that does NOT drive my husband nuts. We call it the 'Arthur' CD, as the first song is the Ziggy Marley song that is the credits song for the PBS series (\\"And I say HEY! What a wonderful kind of day...\\") I appreciate the mix of artists and 'listen-able' music. PLUS it's for a good cause. A CD that my first grader and 3 yr old both like to listen to. And it doesn't make daddy crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"Read this one in an afternoon and it kept me entertained throughout. It has a lot of highly amusing Joss quotes. The guy is genuinely funny. It was nice to learn about his movie career because I didn't know too much about it. It has a lot of great Buffy information but it could have used more on Angel. It has a section on Firefly even though it was written before the show aired. The section on Joss' Fray comic convinced me that I need to go buy it now. My only major complaints are that the writer misspelled a character's name and the lack of Angel information. Despite those flaws, any fan of Joss Whedon will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Joss Whedon fans","review":"Candace Havens does a brilliant job of pulling back the curtain on one of the most creative minds in film and television. Her style is informative, clever and engaging. While Havens is clearly a fan of Whedon's work, she maintains journalistic integrity as she reveals behind-the-scenes facts and fresh tidbits for the most rabid fans. Treat yourself to a great read and buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One fine read","review":"I totally love it.As a fan of Buffy and Joss, and also a huge fan of the screen-writing/filmmaking itself I really enjoyed it.This book reveals a lot of stuff.Joss is so unique. The author really broken down Buffy as a show and Joss's vision and how he approaches many things: screen-writing, directing, twisting plot and why he does it,etc. Book also narrates his story as a person, from child to recognized name in the industry. Some humor applies.Hardcore Buffy fans will find lotsa trivia for themselves, from episodes trivia to actors trivia to romance and on - all in Joss's words.Only one remark. I hate it when people write about someone in a fashion where they are absolutely praising the guy. I mean, Joss is God, yes..then again, keep it down a little.Still, this is definitely one fine fine read about a mind-blowing genius that Joss is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Yoga Becomes","review":"Lilias takes the maturation of compassion and wisdom into a practice that can be simply used.

The main character in this novel is the Angel of Death. This black-clad angel is the object of both respect and fear in heaven, but we soon learn that she is alone and isolated from the other angels in heaven. I really loved the concept of time to the Angel of Death and how she could move through time and jump from planet to planet. I also loved how Joshua was worked into the novel. I like the chapter on past encounters and how they had been brought together through a divine plan. This is a very different and fast paced novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells like old lady","review":"The description sure sounded nice. I opened it and my son said 'smells like old lady'.

It was interesting. It was entertaining also you can picture it in your head like you were in their shoes. The characters were pretty average people. I think the ending was a surprise.

While the premise is interesting the execution (so to speak)leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps, being charitable, this is because it is dated. Its appeal (being charitable) seems to be in its evocation of nostalgia. However the ending involves a fish (which the children in the story view as a pet) being dispatched by a mother wielding a club on the kitchen table. This does not inspire warm feelings about Passover. My son and I were both upset by the ending. I am not a vegetarian, but this book could well lead me to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Impressive Local History","review":"This review applies to the 1973 1st edition.Big, comprehensive, and attractive.Large format, heavy paper, 286 pp with about 80 black and white illustrations.

The views expressed in this book are the personal views of the author. They do not constitue a definitive statement about the meaning and purpose of Subud nor do they represent the views of the Subud organization or the majority of its members.To people who are already in Subud, I would recommend saving your money and going directly to the source, that is to Bapak's books and talks, which are now freely available in both text and tape (audio) format on the internet ( www.subudboston,org ).To people interested in learning more about Subud, I would recommend personal contact with a Subud group as the best way to get information about what Subud is and what it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subud The Coming New Age of Real;ity","review":"Like many books written about Subud, this one is \\"Subud as seen through the eyes of the author\\". Subud is a very individual experience. The \\"Subud\\" experienced by S Monbaron is not the Subud that I experience. So,readers need to find out if Subud as described by S Monbaron is what it really is by talking to Subud members,and perhaps joining Subud to have their own experience. It's also difficult to tell who Simon Monbaron is writing the book for: Subud members or non-members. His vast disapproval of the Subud organization surely would not attract non-members to come and join! In conclusion,anyone wishing to join Subud should read a variety of books,and then talk to members."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"This book is a very detailed account of one person's experiences in Subud and his beliefs. It is not however representative of what Subud is. I really do not think this book would be helpful for someone who is new to Subud and wants to find out more. Even for someone who is well aquainted with Subud, I think you'll find this book confusing and incorrect. If you are interested in a very extensive description of one man's experience -- this is perfect for you. If you want to learn about Subud, I'd receommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's Fundamentalism Not Shared by All in Subud","review":"I joined Subud 30+ years ago because, as affirmed by the author, (2) Subud has no dogma and (2) it is a spiritual path that is inclusionary, not exclusionary. So it is disturbing to find fundamental dogma being interwoven in this book with various bits and pieces of information about Subud. The founder of Subud always said \\"to experience truth for yourself.\\" The author misleads readers by expressing his personal truths as truths about Subud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful pictures, wonderful local insights!","review":"I read Sue's book after returning from my first Alaskan cruise.

D.W. is fine with this at first, but soon realizes it's a problem.This story is totally relatable. I'm something of a picky eater myself --- like D.W., I don't like tomato sauce on spaghetti.

Rabelais might not have invented toilet humor, but he stretches it out about as far as it can possibly go (which ultimately, isn't that far). The constant references to glands and bodily fluids get old real fast. I suppose that in the 16th century, the fact that people poop, pee, spit, vomit, sneeze, fornicate and fart was cause for endless laughter, and those things can still be funny, just not for 700 pages on end. The whole thing is a colorful and inventive mess, but a mess none the less. If you're looking for something to read from this era, try Don Quixote instead, it's got plenty of toilet humor but actually has good characters and a delirious narrative structure which really puts this bloated thing to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have spent a little more on the Olympus original.","review":"I was really debating whether to try this inexpensive battery out.

The supposed \\"mystery\\" was never solved or even built up to be any significant part of the story. The overall story could have been written in a magazine article. \\"Woman goes to Saudi to be with husband who we never get to know.\\" \\"Neighbors seem odd but we never get to know.\\" \\"Saudi people have strange social customs - particularly regarding women.\\" \\"Air conditioning man dies and the story ends and everybody disappears and we don't know why.\\" So what was it I missed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I bought this book reccomended by Amazon,and found it to be a letdown.Although it had its moments of paronoia in a foreign land and the reader gets insights into Saudi Arabian customs;its a plodding read particularly when listening to the characters rather boring afternoon teas.The ending is also a disapointment.If only Ms. Mantel would have given Her characters more life followed with more action and thrills,this book would have been a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross exaggerations","review":"Saudi Arabia is extremely difficult for Westerners to live in. It is restrictive. However, most of the information about Saudi Arabia is grossly exaggerated. Women cannot drive but they are free to take a taxi alone at any time. Western women don't bother covering their hair and they often allow their abbays to hang open. The book is a shallow adventure story that plays on people's ignorance of the East in order to create tension. The characters are flat and the environment is lacking in authenticity. Take a pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and exaggerated","review":"I base my opinion on Mantel's novel from 18 years of living in Saudi Arabia. In defence of this book it is obvious she writes from first hand experience of Jeddah and she suceeds in creating an uneasy atmosphere from the start. However, the characters are, without exception, somewhat bland, empty people, lacking strength or depth. This may well be Mantel's intention together with the lack of substantial conclusion to the plot. Mantel dwells entirely on the negatives in Saudi and very little on the positives, such as the genuine friendships one acquires by getting to know people from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures.The success of this novel must surely lie in its negative sensationalism rather than its literary credibility. It would be tragic if readers were put off visiting Saudi Arabia on the strength of this book which portrays bigotry and ignorance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endorsing other people reviews","review":"I must agree with the others reviews.

God created us equal but not too equal. I am a Californian who has lived in the South for 16 years; I have been trying all that time to understand the Southern perspective and have found this book to be a real help in understanding a part of our country who. we know, suffered in a way the North never suffered after the Civil War and into the 20th Century,but still could never admit they were wrong about the war or that slavery and later segregation was evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killers of the Dream","review":"I was given a copy of \\"Killers of the Dream\\" by an aunt, a college professor.

In this book, we are challenged to radical conversion, to turn away from our own comfortable assumptions and wisdom, to \\"get off the bus\\" we have been riding in all our lives and to get off at a new and challenging stop. The surprise is that the new and off-putting stop is heaven. The even greater surprise is how hard it is to get us to accept the gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully imaginative & thought provoking","review":"A short fantasy about various souls being sorted out after death. He specifically says he's not trying to describe what he thinks happens immediately after you die, but instead gives you examples of other people's troubles and how they make choices (even those choices made by people who think it's an option to not make a choice) about their afterlife; don't try to make theological sense out of it. He's instead trying to show you that the choice is yours to make now, before you die. You don't have to, and shouldn't, wait for purgatory (if you happen to believe in purgatory). It's definitely worth reading, especially since the investment in time isn't that great (under 200 pages)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven & Hell","review":"Imagine being in hell, and offered a bus ride to heaven.

I have attempted to read the Narnia classic, but having not grown up with it and now an adult, I find that I quickly lose interest and never finish the first in the series. This book was different than what I expected. I enjoyed his creative descriptions of the worlds found in this book, but what excelled for me was the very thoughtful discourse that transpired in the different encounters between the visitors of heaven and its inhabitants. I found new insights into the nature of man and the thought patterns of different types of people and what inhibits them from embracing their creator. Having been an atheist up through college, I find it very refreshing to read thoughtful works from intellectual Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into the Great Divorce","review":"I have found the Great Divorce to be a book for all time. I saw so many people on that bus that I recognized and after a while, I recognized most all of them were a part of me or my life. I got some great insight into how we think when we think of others and how others must see me. Often we think in terms of who will be going to Heaven and who will not in our own human and limited way of thinking. C.S.Lewis puts an interesting and very introspective point of view on this often discussed theme using Christian theology in allowing us to ride in and off the bus with so many others. I think I saw how narrow we can be in our judgement concerning who will or will not be allowed beyond the gates of Heaven. Great book and one I recommend hightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not myt favorite C.S. Lewis Book","review":"Other than a very good portrayal, as Lewis imagines it, of the sort of people who may likely inhabit Heaven or Hell, this book is not very uplifting or enlightening as compared with other of his books I have read (Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity). His doctrinal suppositions, woven together in a fanciful tale of a bus full of visitors to Heaven from Hell, are nonsensical. The whole book reads much like a bad dream, with no clear direction or point, except for the basic premise that human beings ought to love one another and learn to get along together. And, I suppose that is his main point in writing it, although the reader is left to himself to decide that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great divor ce","review":"It was a good story but I would like to go through it with someone who can interpret Lewis' works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is C.S.

Maybe someone else who is a much deeper thinker than I am would enjoy it. This is the only C.S.Lewis book I have read, so maybe this is how they all are.

It is not as good as Screwtape Letters, which is my favorite book of all time. The imagery is well-done and the sense of how people choose hell is thought-provoking. It is important to remember that this is fiction, and that Lewis is not a theologian, so the images should be viewed as just that and nothing more. And Lewis makes some theological errors too (such his belief in a type of Purgatory) and those errors are in clear view in the book. But if you can get past that, there is much to be learned from it.

The story of Noah is presented as if all parts of the fable are established facts, including his incredible knowledge and longevity. There is no dissent regarding the accuracy of his existence or what he supposedly did in his life.If you are a believer in the literal truth of the Christian bible, then you will most certainly enjoy this story.

Picked this up on the off chance, and was pleasantly suprised. Imagine! A woman who actually participates in the solution of her problems. Wow! What a revolutionary idea. And not just participates, but contributes valuable skills and knowledge. At best, these books usually involve a woman who knows alot about a subject, but a man who knows more (Nora Roberts, sexist extraordinaire, is the foremost example of this). But Enoch lets the female be strong and sexy, and the male be strong and sexy and it all works beautifully.I ran out and bought a couple of her other books. DOWNER! They are just as I thought!

I however thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent book.The heroine does a few stupid things that cause the reader to laugh as well as the stupid things the hero does. It takes place in the United Staets which is also a step away from normalcy for Ms. Enoch.

The tension/conflict between the characters was well done. If you enjoy romantic suspense, with a billionaire and thief thrown into the mix, you'll enjoy this one. If you want something grittier, more intense, check out the In Death series by JD Robb (starting with Naked in Death)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised","review":"This book kept my interest the entire time and the characters were very likable.

The point is made adequately in the introduction and first chapter, however, and the rest of the meat of he book just belabors the point, often repeating the same points in the exact same words.The appendix on examples of information appliances is fun, as he finally gets to what he thinks will be the next generation of devices to replace the PC. This is what I was waiting for through the whole book. Unfortunately, this part is the thinnest of all with only a few obvious examples.Also, I sometimes found his arguments about market forces and the business model of the technology industry simplistic, even naive.

It draws very heavily in its early chapters from the book \\"Inside the Tornado\\", I think by Moore.Inside the Tornado was a book adopted as Marketing Bible by my previous employer, an entrepreneurial venture in the digital imaging industry that may yet sink, but not because of the book. Inside the Tornado is right, but if you've absorbed it, you'll be irritated with the first half of this book.For people who read and appreciated his earlier books and are looking for interesting theoretical or experimental stuff on or near the topic of cognitive science will be disappointed.

Though the action was amped up, the story was toned down (presumably to allow for more action). Also, it was a little too similar to the first in terms of tone and presentation. There girlfriend who always does silly things, still did silly things, and is still constantly complaining about jackie. Jackie himself still played a nice guy, who has to save the day doing amazing stunts. The film even ends with the same song playing over outakes as was in the first.

But nothing really forces the flapper back to closed position when the water stops flowing, not gravity (it weighs nothing), no spring. It can just hang open.

This time, it's LORD OF THE FLIES and how contemporary its themes remain. It's this little extra that Gillian Roberts always adds, this something that makes the books about more than solving the crime at hand, that I enjoy. Which is not to say that this book isn't fun. CK is as adorable as ever, and while there is less Macavity than I would have liked, there are the charming MacKenzie parents added for entertainment. And Amanda's sharp observations about teaching and Havermeyer are always great. Only one complaint -- I figured out the who in this whodunit LONG before Amanda did. The \\"why\\" was pretty clear early on, too. So as much as I enjoyed it, I came away feeling a twinge of disappointment. If only she'd spent as much time on the plot as she did on the atmosphere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better container.","review":"I took this kit on a seven day kayak trip.

Cooperation, Howard Rheingold argues, was the founding Internet weltanschauung; now, aided by tiny computers, sensors and transmitters embedded in the environment, mobile ad-hoc social networks might make for more profound social change. These are \\"smart mobs\\" - groups who use technology to coordinate their actions in unpredicted ways. American college students, Tokyo teenagers, Al Quaeda and WTO protestors use mobile phones and peer to peer file sharing today, and tomorrow will likely use geospatial bulletin boards, mesh networks and reputation systems. Smart Mobs tingles with provocative prescience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid","review":"Rheingold is very bright and full of profound insight. He is abysmal at communicating those ideas. This book is so heavily referenced that reading it is a torment and a slog.He is certainly right. Wireless, wearable computers will create a world very different than the one we have known. Privacy is disappearing. Anyone-to-anyone communication is already changing our world view and according to the research he cites ad nauseum, young folks growing up in this Webbed world are changing fastest of all.Rheingold would have immensely profited from the expertise of a thoughtful editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biblical story of Moses, with illustrations & commentary","review":"This 50-minute program from A&E;'s \\"Biography\\" series tells the biblical story of Moses, illustrating the story with footage from relevant locations in the Middle East and with artists' depictions of biblical characters and episodes. Jewish and Christian biblical scholars and others add background information, explanation, and interpretation.One commentator seemed overly confident that he knew what was going on in Moses' psyche, but other than that, I found the commentary interesting and helpful, and it didn't overwhelm the simple telling of the story.This video does a good job of bringing the story of Moses to life. I have used excerpts from it in teaching Judaism and Christianity to undergraduates and high school students, and I think it would also be an excellent resource for Bible study groups.(Also recommended: Orson Scott Card's \\"Stone Tables,\\" a novelization of the life of Moses.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken, Replacement Arrived Cracked Because of Poor Packaging","review":"Both dishes were in cardboard boxes with no cushioning materials of any kind.

He does not know much about the tarot. For example, the proper name for card no.1 is the Magician, but he calls it the Juggler.Williams gives evil intent to some of the cards. This is ridiculous. Each card has deep meaning, and none is evil.In the book Henry creates a terrible storm with the cards. Such a thing cannot happen. Novels on magic are fine, as long as they have a genuine occult basis. In contrast to Williams, Dion Fortune wrote excellent occult novels based on a thorough understanding of the subject. To anyone who has studied the tarot, Williams presents a confusing and downright wrong picture of the tarot."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dragging dance","review":"I was ever so excited. My love, Tarot, was about to meet my other love, reading novels, and dance together to the sounds of life going by...But it was a boring dance; the musician did not perform well.

He does chew on it some (though it specifically says that it is not a teething toy), but other than a few teeth marks, he has inflicted no damage. The premise of the book is good for little ones, as it focuses on opposites. it is a good beginner book for learning to place \\"puzzle pieces\\" in correctly.Cons: The only criticism is that my son, as well as other children who have played with the book, have difficulty understanding which piece to place in each slot.

I have seen and enjoyed some really bad films in my days (Slam Dunk Ernest, Bad Taste, Pokemon) but this is hands down the all time worst film ever made. EVER. Don't take my word for it - see it yourself! With a running time of just over infinity, a cast which includes a talking orangutan and a computer which urges an uptight scientist to \\"be a clown\\", and 2 aliens that would Fox Mulder want to give up his search for the truth, this movie will have you begging for mercy and praying that you will go blind before its over. Only for the bravest of souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"And there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth","review":"This movie includes a scientist who randomly decides he wants to be a clown, a talking monkey, and an angry nun. It also contains a fine example of an african tribal jury and instructions on how not to fly a helicopter (by example).In other words, this movie is wonderful if you want to torture yourself and your fellow viewers. I recommend it only if you are able to selectively supress memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-blowingly Awful! See it for yourself!","review":"I'm a lover of bad movies, and I'm convinced this is the worst movie of all time-- not only that, I've watched this turgid monstrosity countless times and I'm in awe at how freaking awful it is. It takes awhile for the effect to run off-- I'll be at work or in class thinking about how awful this movie is after a week of when I saw it last.You don't know what \\"the worst movie ever\\" is until you've seen this.The world needs to understand that a movie like this can come into being when it shouldn't exist!

Nukie is none of the above.Nukie is a painful experience. How could this be written? How could this be directed and filmed? I pass this as a warning...every second of this movie is unwatchable. I certainly wouldn't let my kids watch it - they'd get nightmares.I don't understand the reviewers here that gave this movie a positive rating, unless maybe they had a copy to dump.

Because it had both mu-Ziq and Aphex Twin as musical collaborators I purchased it without hearing a note, simply based on their stellar resumes. The songs are so beneath what either were doing solo at the time, hardly innovative, and quite embarrassing. I know both of the artists involved often inject humorous elements into their own work, but humor in the tracks here don't work because the music is so mundane. Not a total loss, at least the album cover and packaging was well done and more entertaining than the music contained within."},{"rating":"2","title":"reading","review":"It was an excellent book, I got it in the few days after my order.

Tells not only the story of this small coastal county but tells the real story of the founding of this nation and the triumphs and hardships of the founding fathers. Not afraid to point out the excesses good and bad of it's inhabitants this book is a must read for the serious reader as well as a casual reference. Not many books can say that.

I didn't realize it when I bought it but it is NOT an Animated Storybook. The still pictures hardly keep my daughters attention. Kid's like things that move and this storybook has minimal movement. The other disappointment was that it is narrated by one person instead of the original character voices. These things have meant that mine will be sitting and collecting dust. It was a complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"Mr. Milton is without a doubt, a liteary genius! I got intrested in the book from a quote, which I read in John London's The Sea Wolf. Even though, I am only 17, the views presented in Paradise Lost, as well as Paradise Regained could still be used today. I highly reccomend this book to ones who want to know where it all started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, but worth the investment","review":"Milton's masterpieces are heroic complements to the Book itself, portraying both Satan and God in a humanized manner. The story and its essential questions are known to us all, but here they are delivered in full, in the style of Homer. The book is challenging, however. The langauge is dated, and the time investment is steep. For anyone at all interested in Christianity, either personally or historically, there are few better ways to spend your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing book, Terrible book quality","review":"The star rating is given purely for the edition of Paradise Regained published by First World Library. This book is every bit as fascinating as its predecesor Paradise Lost, however I highy dissuade you from buying this particular edition because the words are in size 14 Times New Roman, thus extremely difficult to read, and it is much too expensive for an edition of its quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise Lost is much better","review":"Paradise Lost is my favorite Christian literature of all time, in my opinion even surpassing the Authorized King James Version of the Holy Bible in its poetics. Paradise Lost is also one of my favorite poems of all times. Unfortunately, this poem was nowhere near as good as its prequel. On the plus side, there were a handful of good lines here, but over all not the strength and beauty of Paradise Lost. Which is unfortunate, from a Christian point of view. Paradise Lost concerns the fall of grace of mankind, while Paradise Regained is mostly about the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the desert. One would hope the poem focusing on Jesus would be better than the one focusing mostly upon Satan, but not so in this case. Ah, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Epic Poetry","review":"This is not a literal portrayal of the beginning, but it is an emotional portrayal of the greatness of God, the sentiments and fragility of mankind, and the forces of evil at work. Although Adam and Eve had to leave the garden, it leaves us with the promise that God's love and our hope in Him can never be quenched. It is so beautiful and passionate that it almost seems like a lost book of the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare's Successor","review":"Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare were indeed grand masters of literature for all time. \\"Paradise Lost\\" and \\"Paradise Regained\\" is enough to put John Milton in the same category. Like Marlowe and Shakespeare, Milton demonstrates extreme scholarship and a superb mastery of the language. It is interesting how Milton takes figures that are mentioned briefly in the scriptures and turns them into major characters. It is also frightening how Milton was able to make God and Satan 3 dimensional as opposed to simply good (in God's case) and evil (in Satan's case). This book is not for everyone. But if you do not mind an unorthodox portrayal of God and Satan and if you want to enjoy beautiful language, superb images, dramatic confrontations, and powerful images, you must read this masterpiece composed with superb and delicate skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle","review":"The work itself is of course brilliant- the Kindle edition is abominable. I selected this edition above other Kindle editions for the footnotes. Not only are the footnotes not included in the Kindle edition, there is also not a table of contents. As I am in the midst of book IV in my paper copy and was purchasing the Kindle edition as backup while traveling, this is unfortunate. I do not care to leaf through over 100 pages looking for my place. Poor form, Amazon, poor form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel","review":"What should've been a fascinating story of a historical saint becomes in this author's hands total, boring drivel.

Readability apparently was not a prerequisite. The text is hardly free flowing, most of the writing indeed is quite tortuous. Perhaps the volume can be appreciated by an exegete."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting little stories, in the long going nowhere","review":"Each little scene is often interesting but if you're waiting and hoping that the whole thing comes together and makes some kind of sense, you'll be waiting a long time. For Kosinski, there are better choices..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly disappointing.","review":"I came across a used hardcover and decided to give it a try, having really enjoyed The Painted Bird and Being There. Right away the writing seems somewhat tired and worn, with the same vignette style as The Painted Bird but without the freshness or vigor. It picks up after a while, making you think it will eventually cohere with some twist or another, but it doesn't. The author relies on the shock value of some scenes intended to disturb the reader, but they don't come off as all that impressive -- somewhat stale, especially today with modern understandings of sociology and sexual psychology that incite boredom at Kosinski's numerous revealed dysfunctions. Some of the stories are genuinely compelling, but tainted by a sadistic mind that is not at its most creative. I'm sad to say this is one of the most horrible novels I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Place a razor blade in your mouth and hold it there for a few hours. Shift it around carefully, mindful of its cool threat to your tender flesh. This is the experience of reading \\"Cockpit,\\" which tempts and seduces, but ultimately mangles your sense of peace. Much like his earlier \\"Steps,\\" the book turns on what the desperate (or the simply sick) resort to when there is little to lose. Although I became sick to my stomach at some of the violence portrayed here, the book is worthwhile - even quite interesting - at times. Not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derangement in the Cockpit","review":"Few books have made me as irritated as \\"Cockpit,\\" as Kosinki episodically unravels one nightmare after another. There is just a minimal spine to hold the narrative togther (American spy becomes filthy rich through his manipulation of others), minimal dialogue, and no resolution of character or story line. And to think Kosinki also authored \\"Being There\\" and was (is) a university professor! Good thing I invested just a dollar at a used-book counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"As I read the book I kept hoping that at some point there would be a moment of enlightenment. That there would be a place where things fell together and started to make sense. Where I'd feel like all these snippets of a guy continuously bragging about his life would have greater purpose that would make me forgive the author's pure drive to shock the reader. Unfortunately this never occurred and at the end I found myself convinced that my time would have been better spent doing or reading just about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Too Can Lose Sleep Tonight!!","review":"If you enjoy reading unconnected, plotless, sometimes titillating, always depraved vignettes, than this is the book for you. While I enjoyed some of Kosinski's sometimes lush prose, I prefer an interesting plot with at least one admirable character, and so this work rates as the very worst novel I have ever read. That can't be true, can it? I'm thinking. I've read some time-wasters, but no, this is the biggest one of all. Very disturbing as well. The soft cover advertises that 'Tarden is the \\"ultimate secret agent\\". I see him rather as the ultimate demented mind. Very twisted. Tarden makes \\"dysfunctional\\" seem like a worthy goal.The jacket promises that \\"the silently suffering are quietly rewarded and the unjust are mercifully punished.\\" Horsehockey. Tarden punishes those who do not do what he requires; and I saw little evidence that anyone is \\"quietly rewarded\\" except those readers who pass this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"And what we have here...","review":"Oh lord.

This is the type of stuff that your parents can't listen to because it's too xtreme for them to handle. Not only is this hardcore anti-mainstream punk rock, it also has some of the greatest instrument work evar. I think only Kurt Cobain and Avril Lavigne can play guitar better than these guys. People bring names of unknown posers like John Petrucci, Jason Becker, Michael Romeo and Al di Meola, but fact is they suck because I've never heard of them (because they don't play their songs on TRL. That means they are a load of ass). The bass player is equally amazing, showing losers like Victor Wooten, Tony Levin, John Myung etc how to actually play the bass. And the drumming!! this guy is brilliant, and I don't mean like the so-called \\"brilliant drumming\\" of poser losers like Donati or Portnoy or Cobham or any of those losers. I mean REAL talent. And where do you find talent? MTV and TRL of course!! this rocks almost as much as Ashlee Simpson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"First of all, I wanted to say to all those metal fans who call this band posers and that tell us how Iron Maiden and Metallica are so AWESOME...I mean...Honey, you're honestly in the wrong section...This is where music is...Trash is over there...Next to wannabe Roling Stones.This cd unlike some say is well written for a start, Pierre has improved his voice and the songs are more mature. Songs like Welcome to my life, crazy and ME Against the World show that. They also managed to do something amazing. We can actually relate to their songs.

OH BO HOO, do you realize that there are people living in other countries who are starving being mutilated etc.. or are faced with many other horrible and depressing situations? Oh no lets all cry for your woes BOO HOO HOO. Not only is this cd filled with annoying moans from this pussy and lame singer who claims hes punk but the guitar work is horrible.

People love labeling things, such as this band is a emo band nothing more and nothing less, these guys can not perform punk music even they went back in time and toured with THE CLASH for several years. Its just not in them and they have absolutely no potential to even transition themselves from a whiny emo band to a hardcore punk band, SO TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO THINK SIMPLE PLAN CAN DO PUNK, THEY CAN NOT and also niether can GOOD CHARLOTE or Yellow card. Also whats the difference between these guys and good charlote NOTHING AND I MEAN NOTHING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not Getting Any...

Although I don't want to say it..it did \\"mature\\". However, it still has the same up-beat tune Simple Plan is known for. \\"Untitled\\" is a new sound for the guys and I love it! This track is among one of my favorites. Everyone can relate to at least one song on this album.I love Simple Plan so much. This is truly amazing and I'm really proud of what the guys have produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Not Getting Any, a rockin Album!","review":"This album is some what different from their first one, it seems to be more mature and that just shows that they are able to do so much more than most bands could ever do!!

Look at me! I'm a member of Simple Plan. My life is the worst in the world, even though I'm a crappy punk-poser millionaire. Everybody listen to me! My life sucks! I hate myself!As an added bonus: I can't write music, play instruments, or sing for s***! I think that if I wear all black I can somehow become Green Day and actually make GOOD music. My fans are a bunch of eight year old girls that think radio disney plays real music. Wow, my hair is spiked-I must be really, really punk!I want to be depressed so innocent little kids will think I'm punk and buy my CDs. See? My lyrics are all about hating the world! I hate myself!

After listening to their songs, it just makes me want to scream, \\"Quit whining!\\" (i probably spelled that wrong. woops). They seem to think that the world revolves around them and their stupid little teenage problems. I would much rather listen to something interesting like Green Day. The lyrics are all about pointless things. Take, for instance, Welcome To My Life. What good song have you ever heard that is about being unpopular in high school? Every teenager goes through their own problems, and it's fine to write about those. But this song is just so obnoxious and sounds like it's coming from a spoiled 5 year old kindergartener. Besides being whiny, annoying and pointless, they are a bunch of posers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh... my.... god.","review":"I really can't stand Simple Plan. You know why?1. No talent2.

I bought the CD...and then i had to spread the word..so i bought one for my friend! The vocals are stronger...the lyics are more powerful and the sound is absolutly amasing.

Good Job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tradesman battle away","review":"Simple Plan are rock's true tradesman. Very little talent but through sheer hard work they have become a renowned band. All the people who flame them have to understand these guys are just trying to carve a career like you or me and guess what? they are suceeding. The fact that I'd rather eat glass than listen to it is not the point, because of their approach they will constantly improve as musicians and songwriters. For now though appreciate this album for what it is a fun album by young, uncomprising males who refused to give ground and are now reaping the benefits.

I definitely think that the band is maturing, and that just makes me like them more.I hate when a band puts out a second album that is just a big disappointment, but this wasn't that.My favorite song is Untitled which is about someone who drives drunk and gets into an accident and ends up killing the other driver. I didn't know what it was about at first, but it really touched me. If you like them, you should check out the video on their website.Other songs that I liked on this cd were Jump, Shut Up!, Perfect World, Promise, Welcome to My Life, and Me Against the World.Perfect World seems to have multiple meanings and that made me like it more.Me Against the World and Welcome to My Life both talk about struggles and I could identify with them.The rest of the songs are just fun.Thanks for a great album Simple Plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"s'ok","review":"ok, honestly, \\"welcome to my life\\" has got to be the CRAPPIEST SONG EVER!!! pierre's voice is 100% WHINEY and it's just HORRIBLE. however, a much better song would be \\"shut up\\" which is fun and not so disgusting. the only problem i have is, simple plan better get some new topics to sing about. i mean, all their songs are basically, \\"my life sucks, nobody understands me\\" i mean, it gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album ROCKS!","review":"simple plan is a great band and their new Cd rocks. i strongly suggest buying it. the dual disc is awesome too. buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this punk?!","review":"I grew up when punk rock was invented. Good punk bands always had a certain edginess to their sound. This CD is good and fun to listen to, but I can't help but think that it sounds as much like bubble gum music as it does good punk rock.

Instead of just singing about girls and relationships and being mad at Dad. I also got really tired of the 1st cd because of Pierre's voice. Surprisingly, it's not nearly as annoying now. proly cuz hes growing up and stuff. Their first single \\"Welcome To My Life\\" isn't the best song on the album, its OK song, but i dont know why thye chose it as their first single.

Wait, no I'm not."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as bad gets","review":"This is quite possibly the worst schlock passing itself off as emo I've ever heard. This isn't emo, this isn't punk, this isn't even rock music. This is what you get when you give the Backstreet Boys electric guitars and distortion pedals.

My brother saw them live and he said they just stunk.

When you hear Shut up (for me anyway)it made me want to scream shut up to anyone who made me think skinny is beautiful or that photoshoped was hip. Some teens like myself might be able to feel word for word but snooty prissy ones may think differ. Good and better than their freshman album.

Second, if you can listen to the singer's voice without throwing up, then ur gifted cause i can't stand this guy. Bands like simple plan, good charlotte, and yellowcard are crappy pop bands that teenage girls buy and say are punk. If you want good punk albums check out offspring's smash, any of green day's cds, and rancid's out come the wolves. those are just some bands that own these geek losers... but alot are better than \\"simple plan\\" and such.Take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't ROCK nearly enough!","review":"I heard these guys were a pretty good Canadian rock act but when I got the CD into my stereo and pressed play all I heard were power cords and singing that sounded put to tape without rehearsal.

This music is just a rehash of everything on the first CD, and all the songs on this current CD sound the same. On every track they are still complaining about how people are trying to put them down, and no one knows how it feels to be them because their lives are so hard. I just think that this is very lame considering that the band is rich and famous, and shouldn't be complaining about these same \\"highschool like\\" problems.

You want decent musicianship? christ buy almost anything else in the cd store. You want emotion? hell do the exact same thing.If anyone seriously thinks these guys put a lot of effort into making this, they are seriously dilluded. Those vocals were probably recorded while he was sat down enjoying a mug of hot coffee. What's the point of the rest of the band too? It's pretty obvious that the youngsters that buy this only buy it for 'catchy' vocals and not for any form of instrumental exhibition. You cannot hear anything but a blend of fuzz from the guitars and what sounds like a pan being rattled by the drummer. Who was supposed to have influenced these guys too? The cast of Baywatch?I dont know what this is supposed to be, or how it could possibly appeal to anyone with an ounce of respect for music.

Don't you feel like the world and everyone in it has become materialistic?-\\"Crazy\\".

It totally blew me and my expectations away. As their sophomore album, they've grown up a bit, but stay true to themselves, their sound, and, most of all, their fans. That means a lot to us!\\"One\\" has got to be my favorite song, because it has feeling and emotion without losing its rock vibe. Not to mention it totally expresses how many of us feel.\\"Crazy\\" also explores a much more sociological angle, discussing the media and its affect on the youth of today. Finally, SP have found a message! YAY!The last thing I have to say is that if you liked their first album, you love this one! They're still fun and upbeat, but this time there's more depth and meaning, bringing these five guys closer to their fans than ever before-unless you've seen their DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Plan effin rock","review":"This CD is awesome! THe songs are amazing and a great step up for Simple Plan.

Plus, they still stick to some of the stuff you'd expect from them like their songs \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Jump\\". This CD is their best yet! I'd totally recommend this CD to everyone!

Look this isn't an insult, its a cry for help. This band is just incredible immature. But don't take it toooo hard, i do have some friends who listen to this stuff.

Everyone knows that it sucks, but they listen anyway, and soon, they don;t know what music is. So what happened to the music? Man, the clash would probably try to go and take a big crap on these rich posers heads. In conclusion, this is not a band, it's a group of rich losers who sing about their girlfriends dumping them, who know nothing of music, don;t know how to play music, and are a disgrrace to the name of Punk Rock, (which they consider themselves) these guys are anything but punk.PEACE!

I can think of nothing more suiting then death for these guys, something I think they merit ten-fold. I wish these guys, Good Charolette, Yellowcard, and the lot, would just stop, or at least stop trying to come off all hardcore.

The vocalist sounds like he has got his balls cut and the rest of the band just don't got any talent at all. My friends and ppl around me always play this crappy music and claimed that, Simple Plan is what punk rock is and \\"Welcome To My Life\\" is punk rock masterpiece (holy sh*t!!!).

While on the topic of there fan base, it is worthy to note that this music cannot appeal to ne one ecxcept ppl who are between 13 to 15 yer old. The lyrics are really plain and even an 8 year old could write such stuff which is inspired by small teenage problems such as bad relationships and controlling parents. To be homest i bleve that sp has a decent sound and could really have done much more with there music if they were able to dig deeper and write good inspired songs. I dont think they wud even know some of the more serious problems that most teenagers go thru. Having heard a good amount of this album on my 15 year old sisters cd player i cant say much that wud make sp seem like a good band in general let alone a good punk rock band."},{"rating":"1","title":"this music makes me wanna slit my wrists","review":"God I hate this band. They're nothing special and sound just like every other wannabe punk band out there.

I happen to be in high school as probably many of the kids are that reviewed this, i am a sophmore, and i also happen to stay as far away from music like this as possible. you fans of this say its \\"punk\\" and the songs are \\"catchy\\" and \\"help\\" you. you obviously havent heard much.

That way, people wouldn't be tortured by their boring, unoriginal lyrics and laughably elementary music. Plus, they would stop disgracing the real punk bands of the underground because, for, some God awful reason, people throw them into that category. Simple Plan is a joke of a band who seem to only write whiny songs about their \\"hard life\\". Why don't they just grow up, stop writing immature albums (Still Not Getting Any?

All of Simple Plan's songs are relatable to and Simple Plan is one band that's not worried about their look and looking cooL..they just wanna have fun! Their songs are a mix of Pop-Rock and are appealing to ANY pop-rock fan- their songs are just too catchy and fun to resist. This version of the CD also comes with a DVD which has Behind-the-Scenes footage which shows just how fun loving Simple Plan is!

First off Simple Plan have been sell outs from the start. One of my old friends told me that Simple Plan was top of the line punk, but they're top of the line poser pop trash. These guys sound like the backstreet boys. This is a discrace to punk. If you think your a punk then you should get rid of this garbage and get some true punk bands like Rancid and NoFX.

We all go through this at some point or the other.The DVD: Making of the record was hilarious. I had a good laugh. I love the fact that they write all their own songs. We can see from this video that it isn't always an easy task to find lyrics but they always manage to write a good song in the end. The photos are awesome.I love everything about this CD. It's one of those CDs that you wanna listen to and you wanna pass on to your kids.

But seriously, maybe these guys have something to offer, but it will take a lot of good material to outbalance the harm done by this truly wretched song.

I'm not sure what all the one-star people were expecting, but maybe you'd be better off with something else. I can see why other people don't like them as much as I do. Sometimes they can be a bit emo; like the song \\"Untitled,\\" but I definately prefer that to the happy cheesy pop you hear mostly. Also, a lot of people think that they're just another stupid \\"pop-punk-emo\\" band- though I think they've made it painfully obvious that they're just doing what they do and don't care what anyone thinks of them.So, yes: I love this CD, but I can accept that other people don't.

Good Charlotte has numerous songs of their dad walking out on them, and Simple Plan's 'Perfect' is almost identical to them. People confuse Good Charlotte and Simple Plan.

This is the type of music that sixth and seventh grade girls listen to because \\"the lead singer is hot!\\". Simple Plan has no talent. They are 100% pop, you cannot even call this punk-pop. All of the songs sound the same, and they all sound like every other band out there. They started out as a \\"funny\\" band, and now that it is the \\"cool\\" thing to do to go all dark and moody as a band, they jump on the bandwagon and all of a sudden they're supposedly dark. And the song \\"Welcome to My Life\\" is the biggest load of bulldookie I have ever heard. They are all a bunch of rich snots who don't know how much they have, so they complain that they don't have enough. Kind of like Good Charlotte's song the \\"rich and the famous\\".

They've even given up on making things rhyme. Seriously Pierre, you've got to be twenty something... will you stop writing about high school kids who just hate life? They're not even his life experiences. So I'd say save your money and don't get this stupid album. I finally get the whole simple plan is a poser band thing now. I've pretty much given up fighting it, cause it's true damnit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"So I'm not saying that I just sit in Starbucks all day drinking Frapiccinos and writing up reviews about how rock is being ruined by wannabe bands such as Simple Plan, (mainly because I haven't been around long) but this CD isn't a good investment. The first two songs are basically the best, and naturally, the singles(not including that other single that I never even bothered with). ALL the songs sound the same past the point of \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Welcome To My Life.\\" \\"Jump\\" was just making me sick by the way. Those shouts of \\"JUMP!\\" running over the chorus ruined the song. I regreted buying this CD and so did everyone I know. They wouldn't be bad if they could make their songs sound different occasionally, but they don't, so Pierre's whiny voice gets monotonous. The same on their debut album, which had two good songs also. I'm serious, unless you want radio Disney 8 year old disgruntled rock, please, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many \\"pop-punk\\" bands must there be?","review":"Simple Plan is a bunch of lazy, MTV sellouts. The only thing that keeps me from giving this album a one is \\"Untitled\\". It has a lot of emotion, and it reminds me of Straylight Run. (Which is'nt a bad thing, because they are so much better than Simple Plan.) Too bad a song that powerful was wasted on such a talentless band."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD does not disappoint","review":"This CD from Simple Plan is a great step towards becoming an established group. Their songs are catchy, and mainly CLEAN. Song writers feel more often now that using \\"dirty\\" language will sell their CD's. Simple Plan does not use this language and it is appropriate to play infront of all ages. \\"Welcome to my Life\\" is one of those songs that if you really listen to it, makes you think. Many of their songs are catchy, but this song in particular can strike your buttons. Along with \\"Promise\\" this CD has taken a drastic step forward from the whiney complaining teenager idea that people were giving them when they first became big, and I look to see steps forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Plan rocks!!","review":"Simple Plan has done it again, they're second cd Still Not Getting Any... is the best yet. On the Dualdisc you get a CD and DVD in one! The footage is is really cool, it shows behind the scenes look at recording the record. On the other side is the CD featuring upbeat in your face type songs such as Shut Up!, and the new single Welcome To My Life. Then there are other songs that are more guitar spotlight and a slower pace such as Perfect World and Everytime. This is no miss. Simple Plan has done it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're BACK!","review":"Wow! The rich pretty boys are back on stage. This time they found more things to conplain about. Such as how hard their life is. Wait a second though. They are rich. What do they not have that they want. When was a celebrity ever thrown into the dirt as mentioned in the song \\"Welcome to my Life.\\" Well here we go again. More crapy teeny bobby music is on its way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks","review":"Simple plan is a bunch of pop punks trying to say there punk, when labels are stupid. I see pictures of them and they try to hard to be punks or whatever you people call them, Its the wrose album ever, and there on MTV..And what were they thinking when they made Bad religon song?..IF you like this, then thats fine, But i really dont understand it..but thats my thoughts..and MTV ROCKS..Most of the bands u named from back then are not posers..Cause there on mtv means jack..Get a life"},{"rating":"1","title":"You very sad people","review":"It is really amazing that this album is successful. No talent to make this album basically. Please, please listen to real music instead of this trash. I don't care if its Mozart or Guns n Roses, but please, anyone with a ounce of taste should find something else to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sweet.....","review":"People know that these guys aren't punk and that's not the only reason that they get bashed on the internet or anywhere else for that matter. The thing is, these poppy so called PUNK sell-outs stole the bad boy punk image and took it to the mainstream leaving the punk roots behind. So, if you're a fan of these guys or any other pop singing wussies, please understand why we're so upset........I give this album one star for them trying to look punk, but not actually representing it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD...even for just one song","review":"I don't mean the rest songs are bad,but this one-\\"Untitled\\" is so outstanding.I wasn't a SP fan before,even I've heard their previous singles,and maybe like them but just a little.And you know here in China,this CD isn't released,the hit singles\\"Shut Up\\"&\\"Welcome To My Life\\"just didn't make me buy this CD,you know an import.Till I heared their lastest single \\"Untitle\\",so unluckily, I didn't notice this song before,and then I went out and bought this CD,althought a Japan-import's price is about five-fold as much as a China-made CD is,but it's worth,anyway,the other songs aren't bad.Is that punk or what,who cares,just buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Horrible","review":"Simple Plan returns again to damage the ears of everyone who hears their 'music'. Their first single \\"Welcome To My Life\\" is the most feminine song that I have ever heard. While 'singing' the lead vocalists voice sounds like a woman, young boy who hasn't reached puberty, or someone who has clogged nostrils belting out annoying songs about how the world is so harsh to middle class white teenagers. \\"Shut Up\\" is another horrible song off of this album, which my friend just had to listen to in my car one day. Afterwards, I promised my car that I would never allow sewage like that to be played through its speakers ever again. What happened to the good rock music? Remember Def Leppard, Metallica, and Van Halen? They have sadly been replaced by pop punk and emo garbage, as well as idiotic death metal. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this disgrace to rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's easy.","review":"how to make it big in the rock and roll industry1. Dress up like anarchists, but write songs about how crappy it is being an adolescent in a middle class society in Canada2. write a bunch of songs for the radio and if you get the big paycheck, do the same thing for your next album, only change a chord or two.3. get on TRL and have your customers also pick out selections from Ashlee Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up!","review":"Please simple plan, shut up, like your song says. You are not meant for the music industry, unless you think complaining about your \\"horrible\\" life is good music. I would not reccomend this album, or their other album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Plan=whiny, annoying posers","review":"Simple Plan is, to me, a bunch of posers. The songs are whiny and I think that this band fails to take in the big picture. They also call themselves \\"PUNK\\", which really annoys me. The songs, though annoying, are not that bad. But they are definitely not punk. Punk is Green Day, Good Charlotte, Bowling For Soup, etc. By calling their music punk, they are basically admiting that they are a bunch of posers. The songs are kind of pointless, and I think that my dog could write better lyrics-atleast his might be interesting.If you are thinking about buying this CD because you read or heard that this is a punk band, and you like punk, I'm going to tell you that you really shouldn't buy this, because they are definitely not punk. If you're looking for punk, take a look at Green Day and such. But hey, if you like SP, go ahead and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERATTED!!!!!!!!!","review":"thIS IS TRULR CRAP A BAND THAT ALWAYS SUCKED SUCKS EVEN MORE NOW THAT THEY REALEASED THIS CRAP.

Good lord, how can a band suck as much as this one. Seriously, how can anybody listen to this crap. It's not music by the way, it's just a bunch of whiny girls in their twenties wishin' they were men. All the songs on this album flat out suck. I hope this band is through. The lead singer Pierre, what a stupid name, is such a loser. I have never heard a more annoying voice in my life. It's like finger nails on a chalkboard. It sounds like all the members are porn-addicted masturbators. Btw, if you're a guy (I am) and you do this, you're a loser, plain and simple.Also, Eliza Dushku is such a gorgeous woman. I thought it was so awesome in the video to the horrific \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" (only seen it once) when she dumped these wimps, including that stupid, loser bandgeek boy, at the end. It's reassuring to know that a beautiful, intelligent, and strong woman like her won't fall for immature, pathetic babies like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band sucks!","review":"No one should waste their time listening to this trash. They have to be one of the worst rock/pop bands ever. This music is gay and I recommend listening to pretty much any other musican. Simple Plan almost makes Ashley Simpson look like a pretty good singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"How anyone could consider this band even remotely mediocore is beyond my comprehension.This is a waste of plastic,money,time,trees,plastic,and human beings.Obviously a boy band with a nose ring and guitars,utter vomit considered music.Should be quaranteened"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this product...","review":"I don't care what you use it for. This is a bad product. First, the ear piece is very uncomfortable. In fact, it hurts my ear canal. And it doesn't isolate sounds at all. The sound you receive using this is less than what you would get from having your ear next to someone's chest wall.I do have a better quality stethoscope and wanted this one to play a back up stethoscope role when I don't have the other one in handy. But it just isn't usable. It's on par with kids' toy stethoscope.

Just a warning though, this book has a quite a bit of bad language in it, but the story is still absolutly magnificent.

What is interesting is that I just read the book for the second time, at 60, the first time I was 17. That was 1964. Many of the reviews stated that it was required reading in school....I have to laugh. The book was banned reading in my high school, and we risked school punishment if we were caught in possession of _The Catcher in the Rye_.Think about it.....Vietnam was just two years later, and the world changed forever for us. And we were not allowed to read Salinger's book in 1964."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"What was I thinking? I think I heard a brief review of this material on NPR and it sounded interesting. I was mistaken. This is one of the most boring pieces I have ever listened to. I suppose it is just not for me.

The explanations of classical set theory and fuzzy set theory are simple, clear, and not too hard to understand. I would have liked to have seen some answers to selected problems in this text. Still, for anyone who wants to learn fuzzy set theory or review the basics, here is a very excellent place to go.The book discusses alpha cuts, strong alpha cuts, classical set theory, fuzzy set theory, classical relations, fuzzy relations, classical logic, multivalued logics and their fuzzy systematization, and more. It also contains a short reference list for further study."},{"rating":"2","title":"for absolute beginners","review":"I use this book for a course in the first semester. The students are not familiar with deeper mathematical ideas (not even with the one of a limit), but still thanks to Klir's book they are able to follow a kind of up-to-date mathematics. One of the advantages of the book is that all the principal ideas (operations, relations, logic) are firstly explained in the crisp case and then in the fuzzy case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Police Story (1985)","review":"This film is Jackie's best film ever... even he admits it!

Never a dull moment, fast paced, action packed and full of comedy. It has Jackies 2nd best fight and his top two stunts (from his autobiography 'my life in action'). There is a lot of glass smashing and people getting hurt, but the film is just brilliant. Willie was driving Jackies stuntmen to the hospital on a daily basis, so by this film so their effort was not in vein."},{"rating":"1","title":"jackie chan police story","review":"Awesome movie crappy DVD.

Also the dvd pixalates (breaks-up) quite often, not even worth a $ 1 do not buy or you will be very dissapointed. Hopefully someone will realize that this movie was released with an english soundtrack and re-release it properly along with The Big Brawl. DO NOT BUY!!!!!Well they re-released this awesome movie and it looks great BUT they changed the dubbed voices so now everyone sounds different including Jackie they also changed some of the dialogue not quite what I wanted but hey I guess it's out right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folks, it don't get no better than this!","review":"Jackie shoots!
