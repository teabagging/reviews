Alarm, stop-watch, and it TELLS TIME. Controls are easy to access. The only problem I have with it is.... I am a big man, and the band is really made for someone with a smaller wrist.

I bought it again for nostalgia and it's a good watch, but it isn't as comfortable as it should be. The band is too thick and the buttons stab the back of your hand. Other than that, it does what it needs to do, it's waterproof and......that's it. Oh, the night light isn't nearly as effective as modern indiglo watches so if nighttime viewing is important to you I would pass on this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.

By July 2004, the 2 other chairs followed suit. We can't take them back to the retailer and can't find the manufacturer. We have tried contacting Raynor Marketing with no response.

Teri Polo in particular shines as the impetuous and headstrong photographer who comes to Wyoming on a whim when her friend answers a singles ad for her, and finds what she never expected to. Andrew McCarthy is utterly convincing as the blunt, hurting, and rough-edged cowboy she finds there, and the chemistry between them, clear from their second scene together, is so exquisite you could cut it with a knife. A lovely, lovely film, with surprisingly good dialogue and a captivating story of two people drawn reluctantly together. I would absolutely recommend this to any lover of romance - better than even the usual Hallmark movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"East meets West and WOW!!!!!!!!!","review":"Being a sucker for a fun,well acted, well written story, I really liked this one... This one reminds me of some of the old movies that first came out of Hollywood where guy meets girl, guy looses girl (usually his fault) then guy finally gets it and gets girl...

OK, it is a chick flick but if you guys are smart and watch it with her you will be wayyyy ahead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"The movie was good on TV but why is the DVD $44?????

Like for instance \\"Cold Mountain\\", it was an EXCELLENT film all except for the love scene between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. I was appalled!The makers of these movies these days treat us as though we have no imagination whatsoever and definitely no morals.So with all this in mind, I found this movie to be a very good movie.

Each time I've watched it, I find I like it more and more. However, I would have loved to have seen more story/character development and a little more romance, perhaps even a wedding between Tyler & Jordan (reason for 4 & not 5 stars). For instance, the scene outside the barn after Tyler has turned away & ran from Jordan, he says \\".. I never expected this\\" It's not clear at first exactly what it is he wasn't expecting.

Would be great if a sequel follows!???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining viewing","review":"This relatively short film has the following good features:* The story is believable* The script is very good* The scenic views are beautiful* It has a good romantic story without being 'sloppy'* The lead actors of Teri Polo and the male lead are excellent* The Film Director made a good piece of workOn the downside are:* The story could have been extended by some 20 minutes* It would have been better if the end scenes were back in Wyoming* There are 2 pieces of ham acting by 2 minor characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a movie that you start out watching and end-up feeling.","review":"If you can watch this movie and not be touched by it, I would be greatly surprised.

What I'm wanting desperately to find out is the name and artist who sang while Teri and Andrew were slow dancing. It sounded like Clint Black singing \\"Nobody rides in a cowgirl rodeo unless you're wearing cowboy boots.\\" I've searched online in \\"lyrics\\" and couldn't find it. I love the song and want to know what it is. This movie was believable and Teri Polo and Andrew McCarthy make a good team.

So, can anybody help me with the name and artist of the song? Please HELP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Western Chick Flick","review":"Wow, has Andrew McCarthy grown up since \\"Weekend at Bernies\\"!

He shows real depth in this movie.And I loved, loved, loved the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight From the Heart","review":"I just watched this sweet movie tonight and went straight to amazon.com to buy it! So it won't be one of the great classics of our time...who cares. It was heartwarming, and incredibly romantic! A lot of women fantasize about being with a strong handsome cowboy, and Andrew McCarthy has a quiet strength in this film to pull it off just right. Teri Polo was a lovely match from the start as the feisty city girl. A wholesome romantic movie that I'll watch over and over and never tire of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"I was thrilled to find that I could purchase this movie; I had seen it before on TV and loved it.

I am trying to find out the artist and also the title"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild Profanity and Non-Family Values","review":"I bought this movie based on the rave customer reviews. This definitely isn't a family-friendly or moral story. The lead actress is from New York and is proposed to move in with her long time boyfriend. The only reason she doesn't like the idea is because she wants a greater commitment (marriage) but not because she feels moving in is wrong. Also a friend encourages her to lie non-chalantly at one point when she feels out of place in Wyoming. We bought the movie on the pretense that there were no cuss words but H*** and D*** were sprinkled throughout the movie and only took away from what could've been a decent film. Even outside of the non-family values and cursing it was slow moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I barely tolerated this movie. The storyline is too shallow and predictable. I gave this DVD away, too stupid to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting a story of considerably better quality. I should have known to avoid DVDs where the 'scenery' and 'photography' are described more positively than the script, characters and quality of the viewing experience. Certainly not worth ordering all the way from New Zealand! I imagine this would appeal to the over 60s age group. Better to spend your time on a classic film like 'Map of the Human Heart'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Value For The Price!","review":"The cable appears to be made fairly well. The wire itself is very flexible providing good freedom of movement while playing. The connectors are a standard nickel plated surface connector with slimline, easy grip molded outer shells.

Cable comes with a pack of colored identification rings to change the color code ring on the plugs if desired, and the standard Monster Cable guarantee. Overall, a nice cable for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid cable, purchase here and not at GC!","review":"The angled/straight ends are convenient. Sound preservation is as good as it gets. Also, the cable maintains a pretty good shape (no twisting tendencies like some cheaper cables). Comes with colored bands which is nice for coordination purposes, but they can fall off pretty easily.

I have to say, surprisingly, it's holding up just great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Great imagination and play potential. It was fun while it lasted. Unfortunately, we played with this outside. With the hot sun, it faded and the supports warped in about 3 weeks beyond repair. I have a 4 year, petite daughter who is not a rough & tumble kind of kid and it was trashed! A MAJOR disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of true love found the hard way!","review":"Missing memories, switched personalities, obsession and tight writing all add up to create a good read from an equally good writer. Kleypas' characters all tend to be internally tormented by one thing or another, but love found in the end truly conquers all in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I found this book too cliche for words. The fact that it was poorly written with weak character build-up/descriptions/relationships only added to the drudgery. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SWEET ROMANCE","review":"I have read almost all of Kleypas' books and I enjoyed this one the most. The heroine did not have to fight any ghosts from the hero's past as in many of her other books. There are no emotional memories of a dead wife or dead fiance which the heroine has to overcome. The plot revolves around love the first time around for both characters. A simple romance with no complicated baggage. A misunderstanding yes, but I don't want to give away the plot. I highly recommend this book. Give her other book \\"Dreaming of You\\" a peek too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow Street Runners","review":"Each of her series which this is one of her latest, is always interesting. Her books generally have intrigue, humor, and of course love. She consistently writes quality material. I can't wait for the next Bow Street Runners novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"thickheaded hero","review":"Yuck. One of the worst Lisa Kleypas books so far, at least for me. I am surprised as L.Kleypas is definitely one of my favourite authors (her Wallflower series and some of her Hathaways are my all-time favourite romances). But this book was...well, dull, cheesy, unbelievable.I mean, how stupid could the main hero possibly be. I put two and two together waaaaay before he did and he is supposed to be a smart guy. And he didn't even think about the possibility that the heroine talked true. I was so frustrated with him, what a thickheaded bore he was. I am glad I read the sequel Lady Sophia's Lover before this book as I liked it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Ms Kleypas fair (in a good way.)","review":"When Grant pulls a 'bloater' from the Thames, he is shocked to find the woman is still alive. But when he recognises the near drowned woman as the infamous courtesan, Vivian, a woman who once humiliated him in public, he has a novel idea for revenge.This book is an intriguing read and fairly standard Ms Kleypas fair. As ever the author can be relied upon to provide great characters with sexual tension and a satisfying plot. One or two glitches spoilt the read for me (such as 'electricity' between the H/h - which considering this is a historical was a little out of place) but it wont stop me seeking out other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, a true romance novel","review":"Have you ever fallen in love with the characters in a novel, like so much that you wish you were them, or you wish you had what they had...well then this is the story to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooring","review":"SPOILER ALERTNormally a huge Kleypas fan but this one wasn't great. I was disappointed, though not at all suprised, that the lady in question turned out not to be a prostitute.I think the book and the characters could have had a lot more depth if she had gone the other way. We could have discovered the reason she had become a prostitute and gone through his struggle to come to terms with her past. It would have at least been more interesting than the typical shy virgin being seduced by the worldly and virile rake. Why can't the girls ever be bad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This is probably the best book Kleypas has ever written. If you've never read her before start here. The characters are so clearly written, the dialogue sparkles. The only real problem is the villian could be stronger and it wrapped up a little too quickly. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say why but I did","review":"I really liked this book. The story captured my attention from the get go and I couldn't put it down. The ending I find very noble. I was really caught up in Grant and Victoria's relationship throughout the book. It is not the best book I have ever read but enjoyable just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you get too critical, think about it...","review":"Reading some of the reviews here so far made me pause. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I don't criticize. But I thought this novel to be entertaining. I didn't find Victoria to be a spineless girl - but a girl not experienced in the ways of the world. That's why Ms. Kleypas depicted her as a loyal sheltered daughter to an aging scholarly father. Yes, the hero seduced her - but they both really believed her to be an experienced courtesan at the time of their initial 'encounter'. After that what difference did it make? The damage was done. And as for the weather - don't you people have anything else to do? I live in an area where the winters are brutal. That doesn't mean there won't be a day or two where the temps will climb to the 70's. It happens. Fiction is the suspension of disbelief after all... Write on Ms. Kleypas. I am anxious for the story on Sir Ross."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too predictable for me....","review":"Although I like Ms. Kleypas' earlier works, I have to say this book just didn't rate... It was too predictable for me and I felt it was a bit petty for Grant to go through such lengths to get Vivian back for her earlier deeds. The chemistry just wasn't there and it felt a little unrealistic.For a taste of Ms. Kleypas' works, I highly suggest the \\"You\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book by Lisa and not my last....","review":"I was glad that I read the reviews and decided to try Lisa Kleypas. This book was wonderful! It was entertaining and kept me reading well into the night to finish. Highly recommend this book. I'm on my next Kleypas book, will let you know what I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"This romance did not disappoint!","review":"Grant Morgan is a sexy, larger-than-life (and larger-than-average) man. He is confident, collected, and a little bit dangerous.Vivien is sweetly innocent as an amnesiac who was nearly strangled to death and drowned in the Thames.The mistaken identity storyline is interesting and Lisa Kleypas never disappoints with her great characters and easy writing style.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"First from this author","review":"Started reading this a couple of days ago after reading all the reviews, I just do not like it and probably will not even finish reading it. I've read almost 200 pages so far. This is the first book from this author that I've tried to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuing the tradition of the romance stereotype","review":"Another stereotypical historical romance novel that continues to give romances a bad name. The heroine tells the hero NO on two different occasions, yet he continues with the sex anyway. It is also a very slow plot with no progress made on finding her identity until near the end of the book. Could barely finish it I was so bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read !!! Another Shelf-keeper!!!","review":"\\"Then Came You\\" and \\"Dreaming Of You\\" are exceptional to extraordinary historical romance books. Lisa Kleypas is still in form with \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\". Not quite 5 stars, but certainly 4-1/2 stars, it is an excellent read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but nothing special","review":"Well I was a bit disappointed by this story. I have liked Lisa Kelypas' books in the past but this one while it had a sweet heroine and and strong devoted hero bored me. It seemed like the mystery never really developed and the excitement was over very quickly. There wasn't much passion which is ok because I liked the tender love scenes. It just seemed a bit lacking so it took me several days to read. I wish it had been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone's not watching too well","review":"There were so many good reviews I was excitied to begin reading. After forcing myself to try and get involved for three days I finally gave up.From the start of the book Grant is seeking revenge on the courtesan Vivien for starting a bad rumour about him. When he finds her nearly frozen to death on the docks of the Thames river he grasps the opportunity he is looking for to seduce, dominate and then spurn her.(a turn off by itself)It was obvious to me that the woman he rescued was not Vivien as soon as she awakened. Why a brilliant runner like Grant is unable to put 2 and 2 together is frustrating. I kept skipping paragraphs to see how long it would take Grant to figure it out and begin solving the mystery of who this lovely woman truly was. He doesn't figure it out for over half the book. By now he is too much of a idiot to continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"JC Gordon","review":"This is a totally awsome movie and I have seen it many times on the Hallmark channel and now am ordering it so to add the movie to my collection. Thank you and keep up the good work. The plot is so great and the actors and actress is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Romantic Movie","review":"Great for those people who love romantic stories. It is a good movie about what a good guy really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The language in this movie was very inappropriate for family viewing and I would not recommend it to anyone. I did not watch the entire movie because it never seemed to get any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIke Father like Daughter","review":"A Father and an estranged daughter, both stubborn, fight to keep a Texas ranch afloat after the patriarch, his father and her grandfather, dies. The will gives both father and daughter equal part inheritance of the ranch in a modern day western. The problem which propeled the movie along was a previously severed relationship between the two due to a rift because of the mother's death and the main characters inability to agree on a plan to save the ranch from being taken over by the bank. Both Jennie Garth and Lance Hendriksen did an excellent job in realistically portraying their respective characters. As a little boy was in the movie and the lack of objectionable material would make this movie recommended for family or individual viewing. This review was based on a VCR recording from the Hallmark Channel March 12, 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Movie","review":"I really liked this movie. I was somewhat skeptical at first when I saw Jennie Garth's name. But this is a far cry from Beverly Hills 90210 or her present comedy series. She really kicks [...]in this movie. For a TV movie, it was very good. It gives a pretty good picture of the ups and the downs of modern day ranch life...and family conflict also...but like all good westerns should be, the \\"good guys(and gals)\\" win. Very entertaining for an old \\"wanna' be\\" cowboy like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad language","review":"This would have been a good movie it they would have left out the language. We didn't make it to the end of the movie to see how many foul words were used and the extremitity of the language. I wanted a movie with a good plot but without the language no matter how mild to some. It would have been a good movie it the language was left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I am so happy this movie was on dvd ....I just love it....it is a great movie. Anyone that loves Jennie Garth needs to either buy this movie or watch for it on the hallmark channel...awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I ordered this movie on the recommendation of a friend. I was not disappointed...it is a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke Warm","review":"The movie was only fair in my opinion. Thats because the writer could have done so much more with this concept. Only worth watching because of the job the actors do in it. Storyline borders on boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie","review":"It's been a long time since I bought a movie and read a magazine through the whole thing. Slow moving, story line could have been a lot better and acting too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italian Favorites ? Maybe not for an Italian","review":"Well I own this album and can safely say I played it once and then put them away with a couple of other never to be played again cd's.I did not realize at first that these were cheesy imitations of the real thing. If you want Italian compilations put a little more money in and buy the original artists and songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I would like to know what criteria is used to determine what songs are included on these \\"All the best from..\\" titles. As far as I'm concerned most of these songs don't even qualify for \\"good\\"! Most songs have folk or rock n roll rhythms with Italian words. Even the so called classics (O Sole Mio, Volare) leave a lot to be desired. Minimal use of accordions and mandolins but lots of guitar and piano.A much better choice is \\"La Musica from Italy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I have usually found the \\"all the best of...\\" cd's to be \\"","review":"a good start on world music, but I have to ask what the heck was on the Italy disc. I'm getting ready to major in Italian in college and was hoping to have some \\"theme\\" music for studying. Imagine my surprise when all but about 4 songs are horribly-made 80's imitations! I imagine this is an insult for people of Italian heritage, and it certainly is an earache for the rest of us! There is only about 4 (1 one of the new songs are semi-ok) songs I care for off the whole thing, and I just wasted 12 dollars of my weekly pay! They should have a warning on the label!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitations","review":"Disappointing! These are not original recordings but poor imitations by lounge lizards. Don't waste you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best collection of Italian songs","review":"I don't really know why such harsh reviews for this album. This is the quintessential album of Italian classics from the 70's and 80's that anyone who enjoys listening to good Italian music ought to buy. I remember purchasing these same 40 songs on two cassettes back in the mid 90s. I wore the tapes out. Now I'm glad to see that they are on two CDs. For those that say these aren't the \\"original\\" artists, they may be right on a few of them, however, the artists on these two CDs made these songs famous throughout Italy and North America. Give these songs a try, you'll be humming and singing along with them in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italian Music made in Canada?","review":"Italian music from St. Laurent, Quebec Canada? I guess that is what one would expect. Sounds like a bunch of French-Canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-Italian bar. It is pretty bad. I don't know how they get \\"Gloria\\" as an Italian favorite. If you want Italian cafe music, don't buy this one. A waste of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CDs","review":"When at first, I ordered the cds, I was in doubt if I did the right thing!But when you consider that you get 2 cds for that price, with a collection of 40 of the best italian songs, the you can say that you did the right choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just The Best Blues Guitar Around","review":"Folks, if you haven't had the opportunity to hear and/or see Tab Benoit, then you're missing one of the greatest blues guitarist's in today's world. This man has IT! His music is as infectious as his love for the bayous of Louisiana and the blues greats he has played with and learned from. Treat yourself to some great music when you sit back and crank it up listening to Tab sing and just wear out that Fender of his that's shown on the allbum cover. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call to Spirit","review":"I bought this CD for one song, track 3, Shelter Me.

Every song is great! Tab has quickly become one of my favorite Blues Artists. My hat is off for the awesome lyrics, fantastic melodies, and the sound on this cd is amazing! The banjo on Midnight and Lonesome is so cool and just blew my mind how it fits so well in a low down soulful blues tune. Thanks for such a great cd Tab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Blues Player","review":"I have been collecting blues for over 50 years, and this is one of the albums that is exceptional overall in the story telling type of blues I like. Even the songs he does by other artists are just different enough to make it great. Cant say enough about Tab Benoit.Gary"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"All I need to say about this album is every song is GREAT and Song #6 MIDNIGHT AND LONESOME alone is worth the price of the album!!!!!! Get it and you will see... it is a GREAT... GREAT.. GREAT.. Blues song!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the old style \\"rock and roll\\"and Cajun Blues rythems of his \\"Best of the Bayou Blues\\" album. Great listen throughout! For the most part, this album lacks the essential Blues Vibe that I've come to expect from Tab. Recommend you take advantage of the preview tracks and listen real hard before investing in this one! Keep the Blues alive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best workout book","review":"I have been using this book for 3 weeks and it has already transformed my fitness and changed the way I think about exercising.

Many of the strenght training exercises include multiple muscles rather than focusing on only one muscle at a time. This will save time in the gym.Also there are many good stretching exercises that hit areas not usually stretched. Also very important to me is how many of the exercises help develop and strenghthen your core muscles which should help anyone with lower back muscle pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inpenetrable","review":"It is near impossible to figure out the exercise routines listed in this book. There are great exercises here and some of them I will continue to use, but the only way to follow the routine is to take the book with you to the gym and even then you will have to spend more time with your nose in the book then doing the exercise. There has to be an easier, clearer way to present this material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my sliderule?","review":"Break out your old calculus books to help you with the workout spreadsheets in the back. COMPLICATED. Some good information, but simply overwhelming in its scope. I had hoped for a somewhat brief core strenthening program (30 minutes 2-3 times a week). As a triathlete with a pretty full workout plate, I simply do not have a hour a day six days a week to spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Athletes Only!","review":"This book is for athletes only, not for overweight middle-aged guys like me who just joined a gym because our doctors are yelling at us and we want to find out more about this \\"core\\" thing that our trainer and everyone else is talking about. This is evident from the initial stretching routines, which look more like Houdini contortion acts and advanced techniques than anything a normal person can do. The only thing this book is good for for me is good laughs! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Understand System, Too Few Exercises","review":"The system of training was hard to understand, and definitely hard to integrate into my workout program as I don't have much time, about 40 minutes a session. I bought the book for the exercises, and there weren't enough of them to make it worthwhile for the cost. A better option may be to work with a physical trainer who uses dumbbells and cable exercise to get some exercises that would benefit you instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a closer look","review":"I've read through Mark's book and agree with the fundamentals of training, but I think everyone reading this book should evaluate two things: (1) Mark has courted Nomar since his years at Georgia Tech... riding any kind of success as his own (shame on you), (2) Exactly how well has Verstegen's training proved beneficial to a consistently injured Nomar. There is a fine line between peak performance and injury... Verstegen is riding that line a little too closely don't you think. P.S. Are all of these principles \\"new\\" or \\"recycled\\" from leading experts in the field? Give credit where credit is due Verstegen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"Core Performance is a great book for all levels of athletes looking to get in shape. Some of the movements will be challenging for beginners, but overall if you stick with the program you will see great results.Side note: I bought this book many years ago when they only had a hardcover available - do yourself a favor and get the soft cover since you will be constantly referencing the book on how to perform certain exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great In Concept, Exceptionally Difficult To Actually Use","review":"This is a great book in concept, but next to impossible to actually use unless you bring the entire book in with you and/or memorize all the workouts, routines, and exercises (which there are a huge amount). The workouts and routines are great, but it basically requires you to buy the cd that creates workout sheets for you. Unless you have a photographic memory, this is very tough.Also, like all other good workout books, the routines are mostly based on a 5 day a week in the gym for 1+ hours a day. You'll also have to eat healthy. Not really sure this is so revolutionary. Overall, good book. Really tough to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenge Yourself","review":"If you think you're in great shape, this book may change your mind as it shows you how to work some parts of your body you may have been forgetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Although this book says it is for everyone, if you have had a good training routine for more than 8-12 months this may not be for you. I have run 2 marathons and work out 3x per week on a regular basis but wanted some more weight reduction and increased lean muscle mass. I started following the plan but it did not do enough for me compared to what I was already doing and I started to see a bit of a slide. The endurance training was not good for me at all, for others it could be great but the target zones were way too low.So if you are starting out or have started and stopped this would be a good book, but not if you are already working out regularly and have a good cardiac routine you may want to really review the details within the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Song Samples","review":"The samples shown here for this CD are, very unfortunatly, not the songs on the CD.

All veterans have the cemetery where they are buried. A list of cemeteries, bibliography, and Rev War index of names is included.

I have a feeling this distributor is from China which does not make me feel confident on the quality as most of their products are knock-offs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overvalued shampoo that doesn't beat a $5-10 shampoo brand","review":"Based upon the previous positive reviews of this product, I purchased the Kersastase Volumactive shampoo. Although it lathers up quite nicely while in the shower, it didn't perform better than a well-known popular brand of volumizing shampoo which can be purchased for $5-10 (depending on size). In fact, my hair seemed less volumized, in comparison to the $5-10 shampoo, after using this shampoo. Based upon its performance and high cost, I would not recommend this product to obtain fuller looking hair. Needless to say, after this shampoo runs out, I will not be purchasing this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Shampoo Ever!","review":"This was the worst shampoo I have ever used - do NOT recommend anyone using this awful shampoo - waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"I was so very pleased about my purchase from you.

About a quarter of the bottle had leaked out of the bottom and all over the packaging. I contacted the seller and requested a replacement bottle or a refund. I was unbelievably frustrated when they refused. The best they could do is offer me a 40% refund (which I have yet to receive and this was over a week ago). For a fairly expensive bottle of shampoo, which I've used for years and order online regularly, I was shocked by the poor customer service. I won't be ordering from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"So disappointing. I guess this was just wrong for my hair - I have fine long hair. It felt like my hair was covered in film, no matter how much I rinsed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have straight, fine hair that has no body whatsoever. I was hoping this shampoo would give my hair some volume. I can't see any difference except in the volume of my wallet. Seriously--this product is $45 for 8 ounces, about $5.50 per ounce. Pantene, my usual brand which performs just as well: $0.26 per ounce.The only \\"pro\\" about this product, and I am really reaching here, is that it lathers up really well so you don't have to use as much per wash. So okay, instead of being 20x the price it's maybe 15x the price. Still, no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used this product for years","review":"I have used this shampoo for years. I ordered the product and when I was finally finished with my previous bottle, upon opening, I was suspect that something was off. The color did not look right. After about 5 uses and buying a bottle from a reputable salon, I am sure this bottle is either counterfeit or the product sold at Target and this seller is trying to pass this off as the expensive version. I would use caution before ordering this and frankly buy direct from the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes hair feels so good","review":"This shampoo provides rich moisturizing. Your hair feels silky after use. I'd caution again using too much shampoo as a little goes a long way. Also, I find I have to alternate with other shampoos or it weighs down my hair after several consecutive uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I use lots of Kerastase products, but don't find this one very impressive","review":"I use the deep conditioners and other shampoos from Kerastase, and so decided to try this volumizing shampoo for fine hair (like mine).

Both my husband and I use it. I have fine thin hair and he has fine thick hair. Great when used in combination with the Resistance Bain Volumactive Volumizing Mousse. Gives your hair body and shine that lasts all day, even in humidity. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Took 20 years off my hair","review":"I was kind of hoping that this shampoo and conditioner wouldn't be that great, because it is a little expensive. Turns out it really does make a difference. I am 44, and my hair was turning into \\"old lady hair\\". Fine and wavy - it looked thin and frizzy and kind of dull. Now, it is full and vibrant and pretty again - yay! No more old lady hair for me, I'll continue to cough up the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE PRICE","review":"One more over-rated and over priced Kerastase product. Again,...one can get the same results w/a much, much less expensive product. When something is suppose to add volume,..I expect to see REAL volume!

I have thin blond hair and when I first started using this I had good results and told my sister she had to buy a bottle too. Half way through the bottle I started to have MAJOR breakage. My hair became so brittle I had flyaways all over the place from the breaking. The exact same thing happened to my sister's hair and she's not happy with me as you can imagine. If you want to risk your hair go for it but I wish someone had let me know about the damage this shampoo causes before I bought it. I started using Avalon Biotin thickening shampoo after I tossed this product out. Not only is it less expensive but my hair is finally starting to get healthy again and growing back. Save yourself from damaging your hair and go with the natural Biotin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"If you're a medical student, do yourself a favor and avoid this book.

Use Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lehninger Biochemistry Review","review":"The book itself was very interesting and a great introduction to biochemistry, however, the shippers are losers. They sent a hardcover, ~20 pound book in a simple envelope even though I spent the extra money for fast, safe delivery. Not only was the book not even sent until 5-6 days after the expected delivery date, the outside of the book was severely damaged when I finally got it. I am wholly dissatisfied with the way they treated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Textbook","review":"This book is the worst book that I have ever used, and has forced me to buy two other books in order to review basic concepts.

I recommend Medical Biochemistry and Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"College textbook","review":"The book itself was very nice and was like brand new even though I bought it as a used book.

Still, for the price charged, one can expect to get good service from these gas charged units. If one is looking for a more heavy duty or performance unit, look toward Bilstein, Koni, Rancho and some of the other more expensive units. I am quite satisfied with these shocks on their current usage, a stock 1988 Chevrolet K1500 (4 wheel drive) pick-up truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gas-Magnum Shocks-work as advertised.","review":"1995 Silverado K1500 5.7 Ext.Cab w/6' bed. Installed about 2,000 miles ago on all (4) corners. Work as advertised by damping uneven road surfaces by keeping all four tires firmly on the road. Currently running worn BFG long trail T/A's (6/32\\" left on front tires) and these Gas-Magnums majorly improve turning by actually steering this large truck where I point it. Before these shocks the truck drifted through turns. Haven't taken off road yet.While a minor hassle installing on front end, (rears were EZ), these beefy 2\\" wide shocks were definitely worth the effort because they honestly improve both my trucks handling & safety. Tough to find elsewhere at a better price too. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This SUX!!","review":"This is a bad CD. The song writing is very poor.

It sounds as if Whit has blown his voice out, which is believable after the great effort he put into Menace. They got away from what made them great in the first place: Whit's voice, great guitar, and humorous lyrics. Two songs are humorous (the sandwich song and Rage against..), and I'd say the best part of this album is trying to call the numbers on \\"Rage\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinky!","review":"Yikes, this is easily the most disastrous of the albums released by an otherwise fine band. Clearly coming to an end and running out of ideas musically the band have all but dried up and there's not enough left in them to make one good song. This one would have been better left unmade. The lyrics are especially trashy and the cheap hardcore metal is cringeworthy. Its all a bit embarresing really. The worst song would have to be \`Sandwich' and the best, which is still pretty dire, would be \`It's A Lie'. Oh, and I have to mention \`Rage Against the Answering Machine' which is plain horrible. No wonder not a single song from this album made it to the \`Greatest Hits' collection.Look to the earlier albums where the true colours of Ugly Kid Joe shine brightest. This doesn't do them justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"When I first heard this song, I broke down in to tears. It reminds me so much of my boyfriend, who is now in Kuwait.

I hope to hear more from her soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Voice, Fresh Face, amazing song","review":"The ability of Rachel Loy to capture her emotions and convey them thru lyric is simply amazing. By expressing a heart felt concern for a close friend fighting on the front lines of the war, she has put a face and name to the casuality, POW, and regular infantry man. When all we hear about are the Generals, Special Ops, and CIA agents, its easy to forget that its your son, your brother, your husband, sister, wife, or a close friend out taking a bullet for *our* country and our way of life.Thank you Rachel for bringing me \\"The Same Man\\" and reminding me of the sacrifice, not only of these young men currently fighting, but of my fore fathers who served before them.Can't wait for the whole album...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get Chills!","review":"This song really defined my feelings for the troops during this difficult time. Rachel has such a sweet voice and you can tell that this is a very personal song for her. I'm lucky enough to live in Austin, Texas and I was listening to KLBJ when she played it for the first time in public, and tears have welled-up every time I've heard it since. Please play this song for anyone who has ever served our country and their families - this song is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this video, but I bought it by mistake","review":"This is a video of interviews with celebrities who knew Michael Jackson well.

Then the 2nd time I popped it back in, it worked perfectly with no problem. The box cover has a little minor tear spot, but really no big deal.The interviews with Quincy Jones, Beyonce, Missy Elliot & others are wonderful & they all speak so highly of Michael.This is a definite must have for any Michael Jackson fan.All I can say is to any fan who does not have this, PLEASE GET IT!You'll love it & WON'T REGRET IT!!

My daughter thought it was released after he died until late in the video it is suggested that \\"Michael Jackson will live to be in his 90's.. he'll still be moonwalking, just a little slower perhaps. But we will all be watching.\\"Really, that's the only reference to Michael still being alive and well!

This DVD cut out a little bit of parts that were shown on CBS, but not on this. And there is no Wanna Be Starting Something video on this, I don't know what one of the previous reviewers is talking about. By the way, the special is completely amazing, the version on CBS anyways, I really needed to watch something like this during this hard time in michael's life. The only thing missing was more intense footage from the Dangerous, HIStory and Invincible eras, those eras were equally as good as the previous 3.

They rang this up and I almost had a heart attack when I saw the price (about $30 at the salon). They assured me it would be worth it...and they were right.First of all, you really only have to use the slightest amount, so a tube goes a long way. That makes the price much more reasonable. Second, it's the only stuff I can find that doesn't make your hair stiff, greasy, sticky or otherwise disgusting. I don't know how they do it, but this stuff is magical. I can't recommend it strongly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say... Bumble is a GREAT BRAND","review":"Great product, great brand. I love this stuff, but the price is HIGH.

Unfortunately, my 15.6\\" HP sticks almost 2 inches above the top of the padded insert, rendering the bag near useless for protection. A 15\\" Macbook Pro sticks out about 1.5 inches. Other than that, great bag. But most newer wide-screen 15\\" laptops stick well out of the top of the padded insert. Definitely a deal breaker for a laptop bag. If you have a 13\\" or smaller computer it would make a great bag. They shouldn't advertise it as a 15\\" laptop bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dissappointed","review":"I like the fact that Domke put a panel for organizing small items, such as pads and pens in the front pocket of this bag. Overall quality was good, which is typical of Domke. But the thing that I could not get past was the way that the top flap does not fully cover the top opening of the bag making it useless in even the slightest rain or in dusty conditions. to me this in simply inexcusable for a computer or camera bag especially or any messenger bag for that matter. What were they thinking. Did they look at the bag after it was designed before putting it into production? I replaced this with and F-802, which is much better, but lacks the spaces for pens and small items. I have owned many Domke bags before this and will continue to buy form them, this one is simply a dud, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this and get the fire burning!!","review":"Two great CD's well worth the money, a friend of mine introduced me to this collection awhile back.

For openers, if it's a capsule, it's not vegan. The capsules are made from gelatin, so cow or pig.In desperation, I finally called the manufacturer of Ferrous Gluconate, a product I had taken for many years with great success and minimal stomach upset (I could tolerate two per day, but not three). I spoke with a knowledgeable pharmacist. He did the necessary investigation while he was on the phone with me and then assured me that this product is both gluten free and vegan."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Generic as it gets.","review":"This is an Anime that I have heard people rave about. I honestly did not like it. The premise is that a fighting tournament is taking place to determine the best fighter in the world. Each fight is extremely boring and all of the fighters are generic and uninteresting. There is little or no character development, period. The animation is inconsistent (several characters look completely different during different episodes.) The show ends in a letdown fight between Baki and His Brother (who he doesn't know is his brother until near the time of the fight.) This is an anime that I would avoid personally, but some individuals may like it. If you are into tournament style anime, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. Dragonball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto, and others are all better at showing tournament fighting than this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen only next to Paranormal Activity! I can't believe I wasted an hour+ out of my life watching this. What happened to the writers of scary movies? All this man did was smoke cigarette after cigarette! The ending was terrible. I really can't say anything good about it. I just pray you will buy a pizza or something rather than waste it on this \\"movie\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Reliance on Visuals","review":"To rate a movie highly because of the appearance of a single actor does an injustice to the story and to everyone else involved. The acting by all was more than adequate to convey the story but for a few directorial impediments. Such as first, the director relied to much on a dark, barely visible setting making it difficult to relax and fully enveloped the nuances of the story. All was lost in the darkness - darkness as a cheap substitute for drama and suspense. Second, props such as spiders contributed little to understanding the character and were cheaply overused. Third, the story was edited to the point of fragmentation leaving the viewer to guess more than understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I thought that I would give this movie a shot because it had Rob Pattinson in it and I knew he was a good actor. However, even he couldn't make this movie work. It was dark, confusing and seemed like all they were promoting was smoking. I think he did the best with what he had to work with but I'm glad I Red Box Rented this movie instead of wasting $15 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 at best at 3 am great to watch w/ friends","review":"The movie was fantastic when I was sleepy at 3 am, but watching it in the daylight the shattiness of the movie comes into light. The fact that he wants to bang the woman that raised him is too funny to be serious!! Also the fact that copious amounts of Cedric Diggory jokes can be made when he is being bathed is priceless. Sorry to ruin the ending but with the whole aunt trauma/love thing, the dry humping after he slit her throat and is macking on her lips is soooo funny my roomie and myself fell off the bed laughing. If you want a movie that is as deep in plot as an ABC family original movie then this is the movie for you. This is also the movie for you if you want to show your boyfriend that Pattinson's abs are air brushed in New Moon, to make Pattinson seem like less of a threat to your relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Haunted Airman","review":"In my opinion this was an awful movie. It was just very boring and not much happened. I was so disappointed. Rob did do an amazing job at playing the character, he is an amazing actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Pattinson as the Haunted Airman","review":"I was amazed at the emotion Rob Pattinson portrayed while sitting in a wheelchair or lying down. Excellent to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive Actor, Boring Movie","review":"I'm sure most people that watch this movie will be watching it to get another glance at Robert Pattinson and I don't blame you. But if you are looking for an entertaining movie, this is not it. It was odd and boring and I had no clue what was happening through the entire thing. I hoped that something would happen in the end to make the time I had spent watching it worth while, but no. Pattinson's acting is very good but the movie is a snore. Do yourself a favor and just watch Twilight again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad ending","review":"While the acting was very good the director keeps building the suspense and then abruptly leads to a very bad ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you 5 star folks actually watch this??","review":"I confess - I purchased this movie along with other Rob Pattinson features after watching the Twilight series which I loved. What a dissapointment this is- not in Rob's performance ( however most of it is chain smoking and mumbling) but in the film. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, right up there with the Quick and the Dead from eons ago! Most of the film is in dark shadow, distorted, and slow paced. If you find your eyes wandering due to the uninspired script, you can actually see the mic and cables float into view. If you still want to see for yourself, rent instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"too real","review":"I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of this before I turned off the DVD player and did something more important, it was a soap opera that was too real and POINTLESS. If it was a psychological thriller, I failed to see where. The acting by everyone in it was wooden, and emotionless, I couldn't care less about any of the characters. Granted, the movie was set in WWII England, maybe it had some appeal to English people, but not to me. It could have been so much more dreamlike, surreal, involving engaged actors and a chaotic plot, but instead it came off as being almost an amateur attempt at explaining the psychology of the main character. Robert Pattinson cannot act."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars Because of Robert Pattinson's Outstanding Performance","review":"I gave this movie 5 stars because Robert Pattinson did such an AWESOME job as a paralyzed soldier. I could almost feel what he was going through. But I honestly did not really understand the film,especially the end. Why he did what he did. Not sure if he went insane or what. But I will have to watch it again and see if i understand it better and would like to read the book. Maybe it will give me more insight on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scoot, scoot to a different movie.","review":"Waay to long for what was happening. This movie would have been 40 minutes shorter if they would have cut the shots of Robert Pattinson scooting around an empty house in a wheelchair and if they would have cut the random shots of the empty house (oh, look! It's an empty stairwell. Now it's an empty hallway. Scoot. Scoot. Scoot. And now a shadowy banister. Scoot.) Pair that with an underdeveloped plot and you have the basics of this movie. Skip it and check out a better flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I Only Rented!","review":"This was an intriguing film--not a particularly good one, but truly intriguing. Julian Sands and Robert Pattinson are always worth watching, but even they couldn't elevate the weird plot.One thing that stood out was the ending. American films usually find a way to wrap up the loose ends, so it is refreshing to sometimes see a movie that doesn't. I didn't particularly like the ending, but I did think it was a suitable conclusion to the story.While it was interesting to see this film, I'm glad I just rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pattinson cannot save bad script","review":"Pattinson is great here, stretching beyond his vampire role, but even he cannot save this awful script, which was probably better as a story than as a film. The story is confusing, dull, and the ending is disappointing to say the least. Too bad. It could have been quite good had it been handled better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pattinson is handsome, but not worth sitting through","review":"Thank God it's short! Pattinson is definitely nice to look at, and I loved hearing his native accent. But he chain smokes throughout, which ruined his looks just a bit. It's a period piece - everybody chain smokes. This is one of those old-fashioned psychological thrillers, like Turn of the Screw. Try it if you like that stuff. But if you just want to see Pattinson, don't bother.Julian Sands reappears-wasn't he the love intrest in Room With a View? Disturbingly older - but aren't we all? And now perhaps the bad guy, but same beautiful voice. Made me wonder what he's been doing all these years...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a bit strange","review":"The movie was kinda hard to follow for me and a bit on the strange side.

I agree w/ \\"Mary\\". Pattinson was very handsome, and really reminded me of his role as Edward in the Twilight. That being said, the movie's ending was bizarre.

As for the story, I understand the war and his injuries but I was left baffled as to what caused him to experience the things, other than the war reflections, that caused him to do what he did. Was it the Doctor or just a poor man gone crazy from the actions he took during a war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie","review":"The movie was definitely not what I was expecting. However, I think that Robert Pattinson did an excellent job portraying someone who was either extremely delusional or in an incredibly disturbing situation. This movie made me think about what is reality and how we know the truth. This movie makes the audience question everything. I would not recommend this movie to everyone though; I can see how some people may find it off-putting."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"My boys & I absolutely loved this movie. We have been wanting to see this for a long time, but had to wait for it to become available in the US. We were totally suprised @ what a great performance Robert Pattinson gave as Toby Jugg.

A former airman dealing with the horrors of war sent to a home for veterans by the only family he has his aunt. However this movie has a lot that is unexplained.

Never read the book, but shudder to think a screen play could have been this bad from a good book(?) There is NO plot. There is NO storyline. Its pretty much about a neurotic, chain smoking, wounded war veteran in a sanatorium. The characters are shallow and do nothing to keep you interested. The strange camera angles, which add a lot to film noir, and although sometime eerie, do nothing but contribute to the short comings of this film.What I disliked about this film - The actors/acting, the plot/storyline, the music, the lighting, THE MOVIEWhat I liked about this film - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"I felt that the movie had no plat or story line. Although I love Robert Pattinson, I didn't know what was supposed to be going on.

As for learning calculus in order to understand relativity: I believe Einstein once said he could explain relativity (maybe he meant special relativity) to a barmaid. Knowing calculus and differential geometry (for general relativity) would indeed provide one with a much deeper understanding of the theory, but one can get a good feel for the subject without it. So if you are looking for a basic introduction to relativity don't discard this one for those reasons.

The world is faced with a terrible plague that in the early chapters kills 100% of those affected, within seconds. Yet later the heroine doctor notes that like the Spanish flu of 1918, it mostly target the young and healthy and not the old and infirm. So much for 100% fatality rate unless 100% were young and healthy! There are lots of other examples.

The game is complicated at first, so don't get frustrated if you cannot do it a first. The game play is alright, but it could use a few more moves. You can barely do 7 favorite moves. Favorite moves are moves that only this character(s) can do. You can also play as charecters you never thought you can play as. Some are Super 17, Baby, Pure evil buu,pam, all of the Ginuy force, super sayian super trunks and super saiyn super vegeta! The only way to do this though is you have to fuse Z items.

I say this because the graphics are like the Sagas game just a tad better.But we all Know Sagas was junk too. The controls are really slow, I would press block and it would hold it until the comp stop hitting me and i had no way of fighting back. This is the worst Game they have made for the DGZ series. The game features ways to fuse capsules together,though this sounds pretty cool it's Lame. There are really no good points to this game except the CG demo in the begining. That was the only thing I liked about the game. If they could have used the Last Bodukai as a reference and just added different stories they would have gotten a A+ but this is at best a F-.

The learning curve for previous budokai gamers will be high. The buttons can be switched but the default works the best for me. Very fast paced fighting, much closer to the show than previous games. Problems begin with no transformations in the gameplay. All powered up charachters are available but as seperate playable charachters. Also the dramatic cut scenes are gone. This may dissapoint some fans while others will be happy to see them go. Dragon Rush, so the paper, rocks, sicssors aspect is gone. A similar attack can be done via combination of attacks strung together. Free roaming through completely destructible stages are the games strong point. The story mode while not on par with Budokai 1 is still very respectable. With a few minor flaws and learning curve that is tough, the game will be a welcome addition to the DBZ collection of console games."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most original DB/Z/GT game ever!!!!","review":"Okay so I bought this game on Sunday and beat it yesterday (Thursday).

It works well for blocking visiability when trying to view the screen from left or right angles, but not for looking \\"straight\\" at the screen. As such, the screen is often fully visable to anyone walking down an isle at work (when working in cubes) walking down the isle on airplanes (if seated in an isle seat), seated in an isle seat behind you on a plane, or at various angles behind you in an airport. I understand that it is likely hard to block this type of viewing, and still make the screen viewable to the user. However, prior to spending so much to purchase this (or any) privacy screen, please keep in mind that the privacy provided is limited. As such, the screem can easily lead to a false sense of privacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good privacy screen","review":"This was far better than the all black one..

Be sure to measure your laptop screen yourself instead of depending on manufacturer information or the options presented on the order screen.

Appy guides around 3 edges of the screen casing using peel & stick application, slip the privacy shield in and away you go.The screen comes in a very nice rigid envelope similar to that used by UPS/FedEx/USPS for express letters.

If you're looking from the side, you can tell what is on the screen but you can't necessarily read the content. For example, you can tell if I have a Word document or iTunes open, but you can't read the text of the document or the song names. It works well for the most part.The only other thing is that it dims your screen quite a bit. Even at full brightness, its hard to see what you're working on sometimes. I figure that if 3M wants to make the screen block more, then they would have to make it even dimmer than it is. So with that in mind, it's a good balance for a privacy filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"proper installation is key","review":"I purchased this for my laptop and on my first trip I noticed that I should have mounted the side mounts (longer tack strips) lower than I did.

Technically, it does narrow the viewing angle effectively, making it hard for \\"neighbors\\" to view the lap top screen.

If you glossy side face you it's too glossy. Dark clothes are reflecting in daylight. If you turn the matt side the glossy side reflects the screen back to it which in turn reflects it again so you see double image for the elements that are bright.Furthermore I'm rating it low because it is very important to fit well and be easily removed and re-installed. In this case this is a total fail because the X1 has about 1/2 inch margin from teh frame to the viewable area and the filter is only the size of the viewable area which means you have to glue the attachment onto the glossy part of the screen.Furthermore this not working well since the this leaves no space for the privacy screen to slide in and out which would not be the case if it were glued to the plastic frame.I would guess the proper solution is to just get a bigger filter that fits over the entire glossy part of the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent privacy screen.","review":"The screen is a great fit and is a relatively hard to find size @ 12.5\\".

The shiny side should face AWAY from the monitor. You'll know it's on correctly because you will only see a black screen at an angle...from a distance. Depending on where the other person is standing, the screen will appear to be black, while it is perfectly legible for you (as you are directly behind the monitor). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Don't let those bad reviews fool you. I'm telling you this works perfectly, and I mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Privacy Filter Is Worth It!","review":"I chose the Gold Privacy Filter thinking it would be more \\"high tech\\" looking and because it said that it was sharper than just the \\"black out\\". The imgage quality is excellent, however I have a little more reflectivity with the gold side out. The nice part is that I can flip the gold side in and it works just as well and no reflections. While sitting on an airplane reading confidential documents, this item can't be beat. It fits my new Dell Latitude perfectly and took 30 seconds to install and is easily removed when the need to show a crowd my laptop arises. I would definitely recommend it. Only a 4 out of 5 because of the reflections - otherwise a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works GREAT","review":"I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because I saw it got a lot of bad reviews but I am so glad I did! I got the one for the netbook, 10.1Widescreen and it fits my screen PERFECTLY. No extra gaps and the tracks you use to stick it to the monitor work great, they keep it in place with no problems at all. The little logo in the top that everyone complains about doesn't obstruct anything, it's etched into the plastic but it's completely see through! And it prevents anyone not sitting right in front of the screen from seeing anything except an awesome gold screen. You don't have to be way off to the side to have the screen blurred, but it doesn't affect straight on viewing which is perfect!Overall this is a GREAT product!! Buy it if you're looking for something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too glossy","review":"It does what it should be doing (privacy), but you will pay the price: the screen become way to reflective (I can see myself in it even with regular daylight).

This filter is much easier on my eyes than the standard gray filter. It also helps that it fits flush with my screen now. The filter clips that arrived with the filter itself were damaged. One quick call to 3M and I spoke with a real human in the US! He was super friendly and shipped me a full set of clips which arrived two days later...no charge. As far as doing its job, this filter definitely works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of money!","review":"I bought this privacy filter so that no one would be able to view my laptop screen from any angle. To my disappointment, this product is more of an anti-glare screen because that is about all that is does. People can see your screen from basically any angle. I tested this product amongst my co-workers and they were each able to see my laptop screen as if it had nothing covering the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"They shipped this filter in a cardboard envelope, which arrived bent. When I opened it up to look at the filter itself, the corner of the filter had a big bend in it as well- not just a warping, but bent. As a result it didn't lie flat against my screen and I had to return it.An additional word of caution- the filter is indeed 13.3 inches diagonally, but when I put it up against my laptop's 13.3 inch screen, the filter was too tall, and not wide enough to cover the screen. My screen is more rectangular, while the filter is shaped like a square. Something to be aware of before you buy.Having said that, it did appear to cut out the glare, and added a privacy dimension as the part of the screen that it covered could only be seen straight on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really anti-glare.","review":"I purchased this because I was looking for an anti-glare screen for my laptop so that I could work outside in the daylight. I thought the privacy feature seemed useful as well. Unfortunately the anti-glare benefit is pretty much nonexistent. The glare when I am outdoors is just as bad using the filter as it was without the filter--and given that the filter also considerably darkens the screen and makes it slightly blurry, even with my laptop set to the brightest setting, I find it useless and actually less comfortable to look at than my regular screen. If you are looking for an anti-glare filter, look for something else. If you need the privacy benefit, maybe this would work for you, but be warned that it will also darken your screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, Read why","review":"First of all the product does not totally inhibit the ability of someone sitting next to you on an airplane seeing your screen, it just creates a more dark shadow of what's on your screen. Second, if your screen did not have a glare before it will now with this product. Third, there is a distracting notch at the top of the filter so you have this annoying thumb sized area and the filter does not cover. Do not waste you money on this 3M so-called privacy filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful filter. Maybe a little too powerful...","review":"WHAT I LIKE:- Does what it says it'll do: prevent people on the side from seeing what's on your screen. This product does a GREAT job of blacking out the view past a reasonable angle.- Easy, no frills installation.WHAT I DISLIKE:- While the screen is still visible when looking straight-on, the filter dims the screen quite a bit. I use this on my old 2008 Macbook, and when I put the filter on, even the having the brightness at max doesn't cut it. Everything looks so dim with it on, especially when working under bright lights/outside. I now take it off when I use my laptop at home, and only put it on when I take it with me elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I ordered the privacy filter because I sit on the outside cube in my office.

It offers no privacy at all, disappointed and now have to find another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Great, but...","review":"Though the product is listed mostly as a privacy screen, I purchased it to also cut down on the glare (a real problem in my office). The description says there is a non-glare side.The privacy feature meets my needs (there is a window where anyone could see my screen, but not with this product - the angle is perfect to block 100%).However, the glare from the window is unbearable. I first installed the screen using the tape tabs included, which cut out about 50% of the glare - not nearly enough. Additionally, the tabs kept slipping - it seems the heat from the laptop is too much for the tabs that are installed at the bottom of the screen. Out of desperation, I grabbed some blue painters tape and hung the screen at the top, where the heat is no problem. Interestingly, the hung position also improved the glare blockage - the glare is no longer an issue (about 95% blocked). So, I am keeping the product (blue tape and all). If anyone has another solution, please let me know..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with Samsung Series 9 11.6 inch screen","review":"I feel sorry for MBA owners who find this privacy filter to be unusable.

This is a fine example of useless expensive product.Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obtrusive, unstable, & Ineffective","review":"I should have heeded the 1-star reviews.The screen itself sits poorly against the monitor screen of my laptop, as the provided holding tabs only confine the screen to the chassis and in no way press it flush with the actual plane of the LCD. The tabs themselves are intrusive and garish at the edges of the screen. Something about the screen (I presume the filtering technology) makes an eye-straining Moiré pattern even when directly facing the screen, and when facing the screen the edges are slightly dim. The cutout tab at the top is also visually distracting.I should have heeded the other customer reviews and customer-supplied imagery - the official product information does not reflect the screen's form or mounting system properly at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad packaging","review":"This is a replacement order, because the first piece was damaged right in the middle. I strongly believe it has nothing to do with the packaging; the item was very likely to have been damaged before the packaging. This time, I have contacted Amazon and specifically asked for a less elaborative packaging. The first one was so huge and contained so much air packs inside. Because Amazon doesn't ship to my country directly, I had to go through 3rd party shipping. I was charged 2/3 the price of this item due to its volumetric weight, which I'm very unhappy and angry because Amazon totally ignored my calls for a less protective packaging. It's just a thin piece of film and a few cardboards would do, really no need for a mega sized box packed with so much air. Won't buy from here again.Overall, I'm happy with the quality of the product, but very pissed by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit my laptop","review":"I ordered this for my IBM laptop.

Initially everything was fine but next day when I opened my laptop it was lying flat on my keyboard. I used another set of tabs to attach it but again the same thing. In three tries it left many bad glue marks on my screen. That was not the worst though. A couple of days down the line I notice a weird white patch on the corner of screen. I tried to rub over it but it would not go. Then I realized it was the orange and black screens coming apart.

Most LCD monitors are difficult to read from that angle anyways.Returned mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter","review":"I have been using the filter for about 6 months now and it works really well. It did take a little getting used to with my eyes and still causes a bit of fatigue if I'm not sitting straight on to the monitor.

But for total blackout, that requires a very low screen brightness, which is not necessarily something I like, but can deal with.Plus, at the corners of the screen, where obviously my view is at an angle, I can see some reflection of my screen on the panel, which makes it slightly annoying. Coupled with the dark screen, it makes me feel like I'm losing my eyesight.The stickers that they provide aren't very helpful either. They stick so close to the screen that both sides of my filter have been split into the two plys because it was so close to the screen, when I tried to put it in, it split the layers. Required quite a bit of effort to get it to fit perfectly and yet still allow the filter to be easily removable.For this price, I'm sure there are better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great!","review":"I am an administrator in a middle school.

So it makes it look cheap2. the tabs block part of the view of the edges of the screenmost importantly:3. the tabs DO NOT HOLD THE FILTER FLUSH TO THE SCREEN. Because of this gap between the filter and the screen, the light scatters, the resolution of your screen looks terrible, and there are lots of distortions.I am disappointed that 3M, who has invented some of the world's most advanced adhesives, could not make a glare/privacy filter that adheres to the screen, rather than one that is held in by cheap plastic tabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky tabs hold the privacy filter","review":"While the privacy screen works, the stick on tabs that hold it in place are really tacky.

I find myself moving my head in order to get a better angle for looking at something on the edges of the screen. Also as far as privacy goes, if someone is sitting shoulder to shoulder with you he is still able to see what program is on the screen (MS Excel is easy to spot), but the data is obscured.

The filter came in a plastic & in perfect shape and it came with the little stickies to hold the filter in place. it fit all perfectly.The only thing I don't like is that the filter for some reason causes an eye strain. I feel like my vision got a bit blurry from staring at the monitor for few minutes. I had to increase the brightness of my laptop's monitor since it is dynamic, it automatically adjusts to my environment's lighting and increased the font size.It serves it purpose but I don't know if I need to get used to it first or what.

It does not block the view of your screen, unless you look at it from an inclination of about 80 degrees. It just obscures your screen making it more difficult to read text displayed at the screen but still making it possible to see what you are doing. There is no way someone will believe that you are working in front of a turned off computer as others stated. The notch the filter has in it's top side is also very disturbing. The filter will cut down brightness of the screen in say aprox. 10%, so the notch will be seen as a very bright spot on the screen. The upsetting thing about this notch is that there is no need for it to exist.In conclusion, if you want a filter to block the view of your screen as advertised by this product, don buy this one, since it does not the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toria","review":"This item was purchased and just sits in a cabinet now.

However, after straining to make it through one song after another without wincing at the completely tuneless, painful vocals, I surrendered all hope that I would ever become a KieTheVez fan.While a Dave Gahan imitator is not a bad thing to have in a derivative, synth-based band, at the very least the impostor should be able to hold a note without going flat. Such a shame, too, because the melodies and orchestrations are pretty topnotch for this genre. Were this a purely instrumental album, I would probably rate it 4 stars.

Nietzsche's overall project in this book is extremely significant, and especially toward the beginning of the book he seems to be at his best. But as Kaufmann notes in his intro., the book contains many embarassing passages such as the section on women (it's not embarassing b/c of its subject matter - I love to hear Nietzsche tell it how it is about women - it's just that the aphorisms aren't good except for perhaps, \\"A black dress and a silent part make a woman appear smart.\\")and the poem at the end. Besides this there are many weak sections, and Nietzsche really accomplishes his task after the first few sections. Nevertheless, this work is essential for understanding Nietzsche's thought, and while not the best stylistically, it remains one of the most important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Good & Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future","review":"If you are in high school or college, you must read this.

Ive had the book for many years but could never really fathom the book in its entirity. Recently I have been blessed with a further reaching insight into said book. Believe what i say when i tell you of the further reaching information that is available from Nietzsche. It is not enough to read it and disseminate it as you will. There is a specific purpose to his writings and I firmly have grasped them. Then just to see that I am not insane I browse through commentaries by laymen and learned alike---what I find in every case thus far is, at best, a banal intellectual review. There are very specific warnings and guides in his books--(especially good and evil and Zarathustra) they are hidden in meaning as is the style of his writings. Look upon his writing as you would a hologram; at once it appears one way but if you ruminate long enough you may find that the image --changes-----"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"Nietzsche, along with Derrida and Foucault must be amongst the most overrated of all philosophers. They represent the polemics of the literary mindset against the epistemic/logical concerns that ought to be the concern of philosophy.Forget Nietzsche. If you seek logic, read Frege, Wittgenstein and Russell. A chapter each of Hume, Kant and Hegel have more substance than the entire Nietzschean corpus. If it is practical philosophy that is your concern, you would do well to read the Stoics, Cicero, Seneca and Boethius. Sceptical considerations are well accounted for, by Sextus Empiricus and the Pyrrhonean school.OTOH, if mindless and intemperate polemics is all that you seek, by all means read Nietzsche. That is all that he is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book.","review":"If I could give this book less than one star, I would. It was a required text for my philosophy class and I absolutely hated it. If you type some of the sentences in to Microsoft Word, you will prompted that what you have typed contains \\"wordiness\\".

Although I consider this book to be hard and boring, I could see how philosophy lovers could love this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nietzshe is mean to Jesus.","review":"Nietzsche is very mean and not nice to Jesus and to Christians also. My pastor said it is important to love Jesus and to let poeple know when Jesus is being made fun of. Nietzsche says on p. 64 \\"Later, when the rabble gained the upper hand in Greece, fear became rampant in religion, too -- and the ground was prepared for Christianity.\\" But in allowing himself to believe that an original fear -- and not a weakness of the human condition -- leads to Christianity, he goes against what he had said in Human, All to Human. His contradiction with the earlier texts, even Zarathustra (which he laughingly claims as precursor to Beyond Good and Evil), make the later Nietzsche unbelievable. How can we know that the last books are not simply parody? At the beginning of The Gay Science, he actually wrote \\"Incipent Parodia\\" (that is, the Parody Begins!) Given that, how could we ever take him seriously?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing is Easy with Nietzsche!","review":"This book contains a series of aphorisms ranging from a couple of lines to a couple of pages. As such, it is easy to pick and choose things that interest you. The problem is that Nietzsche wrote the aphorisms in a deliberate order, so looking at one passage in isolation is an express route to misunderstanding. This is especially true with respect to the sections that discuss Women and Jews. I found that I had the best success in understanding the book when I ignored the footnotes (they usually refer to German translation issues that are lost on non-German speakers) and simply plowed through several sections at a time. I think this work really sheds some light on the issues facing the European Union today. Nietzsche had an interesting perspective on the differences among Europeans and his observations are quite relevant to the struggle to unify the continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"At times I wish I were with these four men","review":"I am amazed at how the human spirit can accomplish such as feat when most of us don't even allow such an event to be an original thought across our minds.

As a result Snoop is reduced to talking about his wife and kids, not very gangsta or interesting, Tray Deee obsessed with how saggy his kackeees are, and they all remmanis about when they lived in the hood in 1985, which is hardly relevant in 2001.

It convicts them of sin they have (and we all who fell short too). She uses the infallible inerrant word of God, which is light, which does manifest the obvious subtle lies & persuasion of the tricks, used to deceive humans. It doesn't matter who thinks what! To expose the kind devices of the liar satan and his followers (which at one point I was and no longer am) (thank Jesus Christ) is going to continue. Many have tasted both sides of this issue and those who do seek truth make effort to inform others to warn them of the ripoff lies of the filthy murderous agenda that is underneath all spiritualism (that is not in perfect alignment with the truth of God).

Very simplistic reading, which is fine. It was entertaining, but that's about it.There is not one single documented piece of evidence in this book. Michaelsen doesn't even give last names for most of those involved...even those she says are witnesses such as \\"Dr. Carlos\\". In addition, Michaelsen has been associated with known frauds such as Mike Warnke and Lauren Stratford and the sensationalists pre-trib dispensational writer Hal Lindsey. To add to that, Johanna claims her aunt Dixie had some sort of satanic super powers...even though it was admitted by Lulu Hurst later in a tell-all memoir, these were fairly simple parlour tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange But True","review":"I read the book \\"The Beautiful Side of Evil\\" after I had read \\"Like Lambs to the Slaughter\\" by Johanna Michaelsen. Johanna's experience in Mexico with the psychic surgeon, Pachita, was very interesting. I read the book in a couple of days. I am wondering if Pachita knew that Hermanito was an evil spirit. She probably was unaware of it since she thought she was doing good. The fact that surgery was performed on people and sometimes they felt no pain showed that something more than human was present.Johanna was fortunate to make the break with Pachita and start a different lifestyle. Otherwise, she, too, would have been Hermanito's instrument. That is too much power to give to an entity like Hermanito. It is true that Pachita worked nearly round the clock and that couldn't have been much of a life for her.I would say this: a warning is a good thing.

It wasn't until I received Christ that all of the super-natural things stopped happening to me. I read \\"The Beautiful Side of Evil\\" and was amazed by the similiarities that I shared with what Johanna Michaelson experienced.

The story is grusome in a negative way, the author if she actually experienced this was truly foolish while writing it but then after... as it is clear that she was into spirituality only for the flash and pomp and still continues on that route.The last 20 or so pages are tips on how to defeat the devil in your life.... interesting stuff.

It is very well made and well sewn. It feels very secure, and doesn't move or shift around; the rough finish seems to stabilize it. The belt clip is very strong and grips your belt and waistband very tightly. Draw is smooth, but the re-holstering is a little tricky.

All fine schools, but not reviewed.Also, there is no index, so if you are trying to find reviews of all in-state colleges for example, you will have to have memorized those schools to be able to find them in this book. If they are even included.In general, you won't need this book if you are not wealthy, as most of the schools listed are heavily weighted to the most expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are far better, less biased college guide books","review":"So, a book that receives praise from conservatives such as Thomas Sowell and Dr. Laura Schlesinger ought to sound alarm bells immediately in the head of the person seeking a BALANCED college guide. The reviews of the schools inside pretty much criminalize intellectualism, freedom, and the Young Democrats.I've been in the college guidance business for almost 10 years--spend your hard earned money on one book, The Fiske Guide to the Colleges.

This particular model is the last one I purchased, or will ever purchase. The unit works great for the first two seasons, but it will not last the third. In the northeast, you only need a water timer 3 to 4 months out of the year. So in actuality this unit will last you approximately 8 months before it dies.I purchased this unit the early part of 2006. It worked great that summer and in 2007. However, yesterday it started making a strange noise. I disconnected it, and was able to feel and hear the water that had accumulated inside. Apparently something inside had let the passing water into the electronics part of the unit. It was dead.Nelson no longer produces quality products.. If you want a water timer that will last, take my advice, leave \\"Nelson\\" alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tips","review":"I thought I knew Photoshop but I was wrong.

Though not really goth, Merrit's voice has that tone and his lyrics are usually very bleak. But they don't get much bleaker than this. Perhaps the saddest most depraved song on the record is the Tiny Goat, where a goat's live is so pathetic that he places himself on a stove - with lye nonetheless! It's useless to struggle is an apt begininng to the album, perhaps describing where you'll be while listening to it - wanting to turn away from Merrit's depressing rantings, but not able to because their too darn funny. Cave ridicules the goth genre and himself with lyrics too depressing for the likes of even Ian Curtis on Andrew Eldrich. Sad, sick, twisted, depraved, depressing - but very very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously bleak...","review":"This number is a great little EP from Merritt... hilariously depressing and lyrically destroying all that is good and nice with its hopelessness, you should play this one for your black-eyeshadow-wearing-face-painting-ever-complaining goth friends and really honk them off. Perfect for its length, a variation of this was originally released for the Hello CD of the Month club, which is a rare find now. Either way, it's a great, tiny album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Weird","review":"I bought this album after buying one of those \\"Series Of Unfortunate Events' and audio book. The theme music is composed, and sung by the Gothic Archies, which in reality are just a one-man-band by the goth weirdo Steven Merritt.

While there may be an objection of sides within the definiteness of this book, I'm sure all will have to admit that most of the verbiage contained in this book does in fact hold some truth. I've found that the problem is most people just read a book and expect for a miracle to happen. I'll give you a hint into this book...Read it like you were in school. Take notes and review each chapter before moving to the next one. Then before you start the next chapter, try to apply what you've learned in your world - \\"the real world\\" and see how this works.

Those who are successful certainly have had some advantages others don't, but with enough persistence anyone can get whatever they want.

Henry Ford almost ruined his business by sticking to the Model T way too long - He was a jerk to his son Edsel. Edison ruined Tesla by insisting on DC current instead of AC - he was wrong.

So this was like my fourth or fifth book on the topic of thinking and changing your life. I highly recommend it, and I am already implementing his stragies and suggestions into my life.The most important for me was finding a desire. Then using autosuggestion.

The reader has a fine voice, but lacks some of the inflection of the original author I think.I find it difficult to utilize all of Napoleon Hill's instructions to the letter, but I have found that by adapting some of the principles that I can do in my life, I have accomplished more than I would have otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book started it all.","review":"I have been an avid reader of self-help book for years.

It is a bit dated in places, but that does nothing to diminish the incredibly inspiring messages that Mr. Hill has to offer.However, this particular edition is a complete mockery. It is obvious that the printer simply took an old copy of the book, scanned it, and ran it through an optical recognition program without checking the results. Blatant typos appear nearly once per page, punctuation appears randomly throughout sentences or is omitted entirely.What boggles my mind is the amount of effort it must have taken to put this edition together compared to the little extra effort required to read through and find the errors. We deserve better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful book for people dealing with a bad economy","review":"A friend of mine got me this book as a gift to help me deal with my financial struggles and feel better about the crazy economic and job markets right now.

While the information is priceless this format is not a fun listen unlike zig ziglar or tony robbins which have a really fun, exciting interesting voice. Every great self help professional always talks about this book so i got it. Since the info. in the book is really old the wording is sort of oldschool and the examples they use for successful people is hard to relate to since we do not know them as well as the author did back then.. Many of the current self help pro's use the same or similar ideas in this book with sort of a refacing that is fun and current. the action pack book is good because it gives you all the info and then makes you go through a straight forward process of how to achieve your goals. the cd series does not have the action pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy a ticket on the success train.","review":"I first read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" in 1978.

This book is a wonderful collection of tips - many based on the ideas of Hill's mentor Andrew Carnegie - that range from the practical (how to prepare a resume) to surprisingly New Age-like mystical talk about the infinite powers of the universe. Of course, like an old uncle, Hill can get long-winded and repetitive at times, but since he packs so much wisdom into his slender book, you will want to reread it over and over again, repetitions and all.

This is why a multi-millionaire can lose his entire net worth and have it all back in five years or less while unsuccessful people plod along and never amass any real level of wealth or success.Hill states that when the secret appears to you, whether it be in the first ten pages or on the 200th page, that is when your life will change.This is when you are ready for it.I have known people who read the book and never got it. Not surprisingly, these people have never achieved very much in life either.

It contains the same errors and typos as that edition (which Hill himself cleaned up in the late '50s or 1960s), and it still reads as outdated in terms of language and terminology as the old edition did.

Well, at least a portion of my wasted money will be taxed, which might help build a bridge or something else useful.Anything that tells you that you must be completely OBSESSED with money to succeed in life is a bit disturbing. What's more disturbing, however, is that this book is so highly rated on Amazon.There's nothing wrong with focusing on making more money in life. However, this book takes it way overboard.

And learning the moves with the proper form (as explained on this DVD) is important -- if you're not doing the correct tuck for the ab ones, you're not getting the full workout.Don't assume that because it's the introduction it will be any less of a workout -- I considered myself to be in fairly good shape (not fat, walk several miles a day) and this still had me worn out at the end -- muscles I didn't even know I had were sore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"This book is good I guess, I just expect so much more from Lisa Kleypas. She is an extremely talented writer that can really sink her teeth into a character and create a real emotional experience for her reader that resonates truth. The story begins with the main character dealing with the death of her husband. She is living with her inlaws, and raising her daughter. Not the best of sitiuations. I really liked the concept of going on when life deals you a terrible hand of cards I just felt the story could have been so much more given Klepas's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, a FABULOUS hero...","review":"\\"Where Dreams Begin\\" is certainly not my favorite Kleypas, but the hero, Zachary Bronson, is truly one of her best. I was so taken with him from page one that even though the story didnt grip me as much as I wished, I wasnt disappointed. I will admit that Lady Holly's reluctance to love him was maddening and I felt that the ending was dragged out a bit. All in all, this wasnt my favorite, but Zachary's heady mix of pride, strength, gentleness, and pure sex appeal elevated this book to much more than mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO READ....","review":"I really enjoyed Kleypas' last book--Someone to Watch Over Me. Lots of character development and a plot. I felt that this book was lacking both. It was not a complete waste of my time, but I really felt nothing for either character. I was kind of distracted with the presence of the heroine's daughter. Needless to say, I will not be rereading this book or keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HER BEST...","review":"I was waiting anxiously for this book since reading Someone To Watch Over Me. That incidentally is still her best book. This book wasn't terrible, but it didn't engage my interest as it did with her previous books. I agree with a previous reviewer that something is missing. The characters were not interesting and the plot non existent. I like a story that concentrates on the two main characters. Here you got a heroine with lingering memories of a dead husband and she is saddled with a daughter.I would recommend a pass on this book if you have other books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to kleypas standard","review":"no real passion in this one...and i hate when historical romance writers make their heroines too old to be innocent and refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I have liked some of this author's books but this was not one of them. I think the decision to take the position in Bronson's home and let the entire ton think she is his mistress is unreasonable to begin with especially since she has a young daughter. She isn't destitute and desperate which would have made it more reasonable. It would make Rose only eligible to marry a fortune hunter who didn't care that her mother was a rich man's mistress at one time. I also question the hero's morality since he conducts his irresponsible sexual life in front of his mother and his sister in his home. Then when Holly puts her foot down about that while she and her daughter are living in the house he goes off whoring to London every night. Ick. I just didn't like either the h or the H very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Another winner by Lisa. I thought I had read all of her books but I missed this one.

This book was so romantic, I want to read it over and over and over again. It reminded me for some reason, of The King and I. He was rough around the edges,no manners, filthy rich, and the heroine was a true Lady, hired to make him a gentleman. I think it stands out all on its own, and seemed very original. I loved, loved, loved this book.

We are rooting for Zack and Holly right from the start but still wonder if they will overcome all the obsticles.

But the story sizzled with suspence and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I am a huge Lisa Kleypas fan, but for me this book fell short. I found the book to be boring. Nothing really happened. I also felt that the story just took way too long to progress. I really like the character of Zachary, I think that he would have made a great hero in a better story. As for Holly I thought it was a pleasant change to have her be in love with her desceased husband, but she was just to prim and perfect to be related to.

Both of them are excellent for repelling deer (two years of experience with high deer pressure) but the Contech ScareCrow is more dependable. Although the Scarecrow sprinkler is more expensive, it is worth the price. The Havahart does not come with a guarantee other than a 30 day return policy whereas the Contech ScareCrow sprinkler has a two year warranty and they stand behind it. I had one fail after 22 months of use and they replaced it promptly. Also the motion detecting range, sensitivity, and adjustment is more stable and dependable in the Contech ScareCrow. The only time I've not had the ScareCrow work was during a period of very high humidity during some rainy weather when it failed to go off during a period of less than a day. On the other hand the Havahart motion sprinker is much more erratic in its performance and sometimes fails to work for brief periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great...Once you get it set up.","review":"I bought this item as a way to keep rabbits out of rose bushes.

I contacted the company, but they could care less and they not only won't tell you how to repair them, but they don't sell repair parts. I guess it's just as well because they ignored me when I asked them what the problem could be. They just wanted to sell me more.

Our neighbor, across the street, feeds them which encourages them to come around often. They had eaten many of my flowers, including the \\"deer resistant\\" types. These work great for chasing them off without hurting them. They do tend to learn not to come, but they will try every now and then. We have placed three of these units on different sides of the house. They operate when the deer come within range. Our only problem was remembering to turn the water on at night. We have since added hose end timers at the faucets and have them programmed to come on at dusk and off at dawn. Now we don't have to worry about getting up in the morning and finding that the deer have eaten the flowers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is GREAT!!","review":"I installed the repellant to protect my fish pond.

Simple to set up and simple to use, love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more birds, squirrels or stray animals!","review":"Even though some my garden burned up from the heat, nothing got ate, trampled on or ruined and I actually think it saved some of the plants by misting them during the extreme heat. I used some pipe tape to put the water hose and the attachments together to save on the water bill, to avoid leaking and water deposits from hard water. Took a complete soaking (on myself) to get the adjustments down correctly, and my puppy even like teasing it to make the water come on like a kids sprinkler!

Before we installed the Scarecrow, we simply couldn't plant herbs or various types of flowering plants around our patio due to the critters. The plants wouldn't last a week. Sprays, etc. weren't effective and required constant reapplication and we don't use poisons.Easy to setup if you have a hose connection close (I recommend the double valve as well). It is a great training device for these critters as once they learn to be wary of this area they stay away even when you forget to turn on the Scarecrow. I'm planning to use it to discourage deer from walking through our yard before winter. Not cheap for a plastic sprayer, but it turned out to be worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very high quality gauge","review":"This is a very high quality vacuum gauge; you can flair that from the moment you begin assembling its parts to the moment you watch it work.

Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn are delightful together as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Great Early Westerns","review":"Dodge City is one of the Westerns that set the standard for the thousands that would come after it. Fun,funny, even playful, with a stalwart hero (Flynn, dastardly villains (Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory), noble and comical sidekicks (Alan Hale and Guinn \\"Big Boy\\" Williams), and a woman worth fighting and dying for (Olivia de Havilland).Flynn didn't consider himself a good Western hero, but he was perfect, and Dodge City, for the time it was made, and even in today's harsh light, is near perfect. Another one of the many great films made in 1939."},{"rating":"2","title":"The western thar inspire all the great westerns","review":"Yes some may say corny and over the top and dated ...Shoot outs cattle stampedes, salloon gals,but this was the very 1st high budget western that every one tried to copy ever after. Plus it'ds an Errol and Olivia flick... and it has enormous charm. what more can one ask for AAAA+ go buy it. You know I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong genre for Flynn","review":"One or two good scenes, but this, frankly, isn't much of a movie. Most of the reviewers seem to know this, but they give it high stars because of Flynn and De Havilland. It's all a bit tedious and predictable. Flynn never had an Australian accent (well, maybe, right at the beginning of his career). In fact his accent was about as British as they come, and he wasn't a good mimic when it came to accents. My disc came in the six disc Signature Collection, and although Captain Blood played well, this Dodge City disc had something seriously wrong with both the colour and the sound. A dull script, plot full of silly holes, corny dialogue, heavy-handed comedy can't be saved by the stars and a good barroom brawl. According to the bio-documentary of Errol Flynn, which comes with the collection, the villain in this picture, Cabot, actually managed to ruin Flynn towards the end of his life by suing him, when Flynn had tried to give him a helping hand. My advice is to dodge Dodge City."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errol Flynn - In His First Western","review":"Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland together -- this time in a western. Westerns were not Errol's favorite genre. The chemistry between the two stars is great, though the story is not as strong as some of his other movies. It is the smaller characters like Alan Hale that make this movie. An interesting tidbit is that the group \\"Pure Prairie League\\" got its name from a scene in this movie; see if you can figure out from where. Again, a fun movie for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Church and Society in Byzantium Under the Comneni, 1081-","review":"This is a brilliant book contaning reliable and acurate historic information. When I read it I thought it to be a very informational book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"A Protestant look at Matthew 16 shows that they, and Catholics alike miss the point.As a Protestant, he seeks to quote from Church Fathers to prove a point when his very church rejects 'tradition' - which is what the Church Fathers make part ofCatholics too, in rejecting this book miss the point, for no matter whether Peter was 'the rock', or not, it's not the same thing as saying he was the ONLY rock, as the Church Fathers attest that the Apostles, all were the foundation of the church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"My kids are always stealing my expensive Canon digital camera, so I bought 2 of these Disney cameras for them. They like to photograph silly things like their feet, their toys, and their lunch. This Disney camera is not even applicable to such silly-fun photography. I was fair warned that the pictures would be grainy when downloaded (only 1 megapixel), but I hoped that the act of photographing stuff would be a fun activity for the kids. No so. The LCD screen on the back of the camera is completely useless, as you can barely even make out objects within 1-2 feet away. When preparing to take a picture, you must hold the camera very still and about 12 inches from the subject. When using such a technique, you will be able to make out the outline of the object, at best. After the kids gave the cameras a try and discovered that the LCD images were impossible to decipher, the cameras were left in the bottom of the toy box. Do not waste money on this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I say ZERO stars????","review":"My daughter received this camera as a gift at Christmas. What a horrible toy.

I would never buy this product again-- Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure about the program, but the picture editor is worth it!","review":"I actually have not tested the camera yet. I have installed the picture program and started playing with the features. If you don't think the camera is worth the money, the program is. You can add Disney characters to photos, add text, and there are other options, such as drawing and erasing. I just opened up photos that I took with a real digital camera and edited those.I really don't think you're paying for the camera, I think you're paying for the program.I would recommend this product if you want Disney characters in your photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for about 3 months","review":"This camera deletes all the photos all the time. Very disappointing, after your kid has spent the day taking pics, only to have them all deleted at the end of the day. At first, it was our kids' own mistake as it's VERY EASY to delete your pics on this camera. Then, we realized it wasn't our child, it was the camera doing it on its own! Also, does NOT sync with the MAC and also does not sync on a pc without the disney software which is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly I am being punished for buying Chinese products","review":"Purchased as a toy for a toy price level of $10.59 including tax. Therefore, the fact that the pictures were extremely blurry was not an issue. However, this camera only worked the first couple of times my daughter used it. Now the download message consistently reports that there are no pictures in camera. A digital camera that either won't store a picture or won't send the picture to the computer is good for nothing but the landfill.Typical China junk (poor quality, poorly designed, produced solely to turn a quick buck). This one will head to the dump to join the \\"bargain\\" $40 dollar (at 60% off) Chinese junk camcorder that I picked up for her brother.Don't buy for the software either. The editing software will not recognize anything but this camera so don't buy this thinking you can edit and decorate pictures from another camera when you discover that your new piece of Chinese junk doesn't work. That won't be an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"no luck with this one","review":"We purchased this camera after having to return 2 others(of different brand) to the store because they would just freeze up, and you would then loose the pictures. We thought this one would be great as my older daughter has a hannah montana one and loves creating new pictures with the software(even though the quality of the pictures is not the greatest). With our other one we got the error, no pictures to upload, and switched batteries,just for cameras, and that fixed that problem.However, this one is no good, because when we hook up the usb to the camera and computer, it says the camera is not connected, please check connection and try again. Very frustrating, and now we search to see if there are any worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It works ok for the purposes of my 4 year old, however, the picture quality is not great and the camera is SUPER small.

Moonphase is a well balanced mixture of comedy and serious storyline.Moonphase is about the adorable but bratty vampire Hazuki wanting freedom from the evil Count Kinkell so she can find her mother. This is just a basic description of the plot but there are more storylines involved.The cast of characters is great , but the real standout gem is Grandfather whose blend of seriousness and off the wall humor make the series a worthwhile purchase just for him alone.I don't want to give too much away and spoil the story, but if you're a fan of vampires , great characters and humor , then you should get Moonphase you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun series with a bit of edge","review":"We really liked this series. Fun characters with a very unique story. The animation is very good and it has a wonderful mixture of cuteness and wit and edge as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a Second Season","review":"Great combination of a story evolving around a cute nekomimi vampire and her choosen slave. Like super-natural? This show has plenty of vampire and fight references in-between comedy and a developing plot that will keep you upon the edge of your seat.Graphics 4/5Music 4/5Plot 4/5Overall 4/5It's a wonderful series to add to a collection. Reviews couldn't have said it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonphase","review":"The shipping was fast and the product arrived in perfect condition.

Gosh. I KNOW BRITNEY AND LINDSAY ARE BETTER THAN HILARY..but but but......wait.... It's not that bad of an album...You know Avril Lavigne? She can't sing live either. But ther album rocked. It did. And as for Hilary..Okay..DON'T BUY HER CD THEN, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! she's aiming for 3 year olds, okay? Come clean wasn't that bad....but once you listen to it for hours..you wanna strangle Hilary..I know..okay..Chillllllllllllll."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent first effort.","review":"Everyone is a critic about something and Hilary Duff has hers concerning her music.Personally I thought this CD was a good effort. I would like to hear Hilary without all the 'fluff' the studio adds just to see what she really sounds like.As to all the Hilary Haters posting here, I find it rather amusing how many 'I Hate Hilary' reviews are by the same person/persons. I guess some people have no more of a life than to berate another person trying to explore their talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping this CD was a metamorphosis of her voice","review":"She may have star quality but as an actress and a singer, she is not even as convincing as the Olsen twins (which is pretty bad). I know that the Olsen twins don't sing and since Hilary's basically a Olsen clone, (in her career, not physically) she would do well not to either so that her 10 year old fans would not be disappointed by hearing their little Lizzie McGuire \\"hero\\" sound like nails on a chalkboard. Why do we not turn our attention to the more noteworthy young talents of today such as Lindsay Lohan or Alexis Bendel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I thougth this CD would be very good, and different.....but it's just like any other pop CD.....it's boring, and it seems Hilary voice is computer generated....There is only on good track on this CD and that is track #2....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm TIRED of Hilary!!!","review":"Hilary Duff (or should I say Hilary Duffelbag, as one kid said on here, hahahahahah) we are TIRED of you!

I could stand it.After ahile it seemed like her songs began to get over played on the radio stations. That really gets to me, therefore I got annoyed and think she has a bad voice. Its just annoying and obnoxious. Like high pitched. So I think this CD isn't the best out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is So Yesterday, So Not Tomorrow, and So Not EVER!","review":"I'm only giving this CD two stars because I used to like Hilary Duff, as innocent Lizzie McGuire. Then Disney had to go make the movie, which was pretty good itself, but as a result Hilary Duff rises suddenly as this diva star or something! What's up with that? She's only famous because of the movie. Hilary, I love you as Lizzie McGuire but you are a HORRIBLE singer! It's not even her real voice. They've done same major editing so she sounds better than she really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"People like this shouldn't be encouraged","review":"For those of you who are fans of hillary duff i ask you: what are the odds that a disney TV star had an unspoken talent for writing number one hits? Zero. Somebody wrote those songs for her and slaped her on the cover of the CD because she is easily packagable. The last thing the world needs is another brittney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"where DID she go right? I don't know...","review":"FYI, people...10 year olds HATE this album. Or they should. Hilary Duff (like the beer in the simpsons) only got a recording contract not because she can sing well, but because she's famous. Sad, right?Does she have a voice? No, it's computerized so it sounds good. So if you saw Hilary outside and you asked her to sing, she would probably sound screechy. Not to mention her lyrics are stupid. \\"If the light is off then it isn't on\\" Wow! Lyk I didn't know that...Do the math...Your money minus $13 for this garbage=$13 you don't have anymore...you could have used that to buy food for your family!So, if you want REAL music with NO computerization, search right now for \\"Michelle Branch\\". Now SHE knows music."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't have a 0....","review":"Metamorphosis is a perfect example of the c**p that the music industry feeds us.

Why make music only to make money?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary Duff please stick to acting. Please","review":"Her record contract should have gone to someone who earned it.She can't sing well, and she has no stage presence. I mean Britney Spears voice is terribe, but she more than make up for it with her dances, and stage pressence.Hilary doesn't even sing live, and she doesn't even write her own lyrics.Why don't all the actor come out with albums, because they will make million even if they don't have talent. Hilary duff is living proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary, Hilary...","review":"Just when you think you've seen the worse of it all, along comes Hilary Duff. Now I normally wouldn't care for talentless people but Hilary really pushed the limits of talentlessness this time. Making this album was wayyyyy over the edge. She's just begging to be slapped. This is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE MAKE HER STOP!!!!","review":"Hilary's irritating voice and her meaningless lyrics basically ruined the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor CD","review":"Very bad CD. OK actor, but she is just trying to get more popular. Pop fan or not, get one of Avril Lavinge or Michelle Branch's CDs instead. They are much better. I give all the songs a 1 except \\"So Yesterday\\", which gets a three. Her lyrics are impossible to understand, and I can name over 20 people who can sing better. She should leave it to the pros instead of barging in and trying to get more money. Trust me, you will want to smash this CD with a sledgehammer instead of listening to this wannabe pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the option of zero stars please","review":"Ok lets face it, Hillary Duff is a fake, she sings about love and she's 15, what the heck would she know about it??? Lyrics, she didn't write them. The only songs on here that might get any recognition were done by the Matrix and even those aren't the best work. Since she didn't do anything for this album the only thing one can focus on is vocal talents...Hillary Duff doesn't have the vocal talents needed for this kind of music or any kind for that matter (she may get them later but she certainly doesn't have them now). I know at least 20 people who could sing this CD better than her. For all of those who are skeptical of my review, yes I have listened to the actual CD and yes I am open to any kind of music with the exception of country. All in all this is as fake as they come, 0 of 5 stars this is another corporate produced piece of garbage that should be available in the dollar bins everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked","review":"How the bloody hell did Hilary Duff ever score a record deal??? The girl sucks: she CANNOT sing AT ALL. (she can't act worth anything either)She is the best example of the result of what is called 'studio magic'. I didn't even buy her album and I know it sucks. Because an album with a crappy singer is, obviously, going to suck. She makes Britney Spears look and sound like the greatist artist ever. I get pissed off every time I see her on tv or hear her on the radio because she is so pop and fake and made-up. You watch, she won't last much longer; she doesn't have the talent to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't you morons tell?","review":"Can't you idiots tell that she has computers help make her voice sound better? And it doesn't even work. And she doesn't write her own lyrics, obviously she's too shallow for that. Please, I beg you, try Matchbox Twenty or Fefe Dobson or at least someone who can sing AND play AND write their own music. The world is a sick, sick place. Hilary is an OK actress, and I think she should stick to that.

It's is just cruel injustice that Hillary should be the special one that got herself noticed when she started out. And I know this girl Grace who goes to my school who is bold, funny, unique, could captivate the world with her singing voice and leaves the audience with pains in their sides from laughing or with tears streaming down their cheeks at every school drama performance. Now why, I ask you, is Hillary living out the dream of many people just like Grace? Who knows. All I know is that Hillary ruined this album!

Her voice is edited an unbelievable amount and if you've ever heard her live she really sucks if she even sings. most of the time she lip syncs anyway. she shouldnt be on MTV and i cant understand why she is on the radio. and worst of all, her music(if you can even call it music) is pop.

She has no talent, so how did she get here? Not by her looks; she's got a chunky face that is not pretty and no figure. She is one LUCKY girl to have all this without any hard work or talent.

Hilary is a fairly decent actress, who has not yet lived up to her full potential, but I would like to know who told her that she could sing. Throughout the whole album, Hilary struggles through the songs, granted they were not written for someone with great range or power...I don't think it is possible to say that Hilary is a singer...she talks on a note, nothing more. Rather than spare the gory details of the cd I would just say, if you want great singing from a female, don't buy this album, buy something by lea solonga or dido or something...Either way this IS the #1 album in the country and Hilary is laughing all the way to the bank...vocal talent or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible voice!","review":"She's can't sing at all!

We should have more stars like her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good or Bad that is the Question!","review":"Well I absolutly loved this CD! She has a beautiful voice and she is definatly going places. But I still think she is such a better actress. But she needs to do what makes her happy. But if you liked her songs \\"I Can't Wait\\" \\"Why Not\\" and \\"So Yesterday\\" You will love this!

Some places she does struggle a bit, but overall she is great. This is a good cd for people who like Hilary Duff and like pop. The pictures are pretty good. Plus, this cd gives you all the words to the lyrics. Hilary really has done a vast metamorphosis to accomplish this album. Although, people saw that she's the next Britney, I disagree. Britney Spears has more of a talent for music, but Hil is trying. This is a AMAZING album! WAY TO GO HILARY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"METAMORPHOSIS","review":"Hilary Duff's new CD is awesome. There is not a single track that I dislike! There are also different styles in the songs. She has an awesome voice, and all of the songs are great.

Hilary Duff uses no foul language, and doesn't talk about inapropriate subjects. EVERYONE should get the album! It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great CD, I love almost every song and havn't stopped listening to it! She is very talented.

I mean, she's a decent actress, she's pretty and everything. Her only problem is her \\"singing\\" career. She has an ok, voice- don't get me wrong- but that's just it. It's OK. Her CD is really repetitive in theme, lyrics and beat; and the stuff she does is very cookie-cutter. She reminds me of Britney back in the day. Innocent at first, fresh from a Disney show, but as her success grew, her clothes tightened and lessened in length, and her make-up grew. I don't like her CD at all, and I think for as much money as Disney spent on her, she should have been able to buy a better vocal coach. Lol.

Her voice is horrid, her sister wrote most of her songs, her \\"silver screen\\" acting is cheap and over-rated...it seems like she and Lindsay Lohan are at war with whose the better singer and actor...Lindsay Lohan is a fake singer, too but a much better actress. I espicially dislike how Hilary always seems to have the same role in EVERY single movie. She's always the goodie goodie girl and hasn't played much of anything else.

None of the songs held my attention and I thought Hilary's voice was as annoying as ever. Being a fair-minded person, I didn't want to throw the CD away and rush to judgment like a lot of people did. So today, I sat down and gave it another wholesome listening, hoping it'll grow on me or that I'll find something nice to say about the album. Oh Lord, was I ever so WRONG! Every song seemed to repeat itself, and at the same time, sounding worse than before. I felt like I was being punished the whole time I sat there. It became clear to me that Hilary's \\"musical talent\\" doesn't exist. That poor child shouldn't even be allowed to sing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugg people these days","review":"I bought my child this CD and it is the worse piece of music I've ever heard. I've had enough of these rich movie stars converting to the music world. The greedy little untalented child. I would rather have her listen to Christina Aguilera, who isn't a good role model but is at least TALENTED. Hilary Duff is a terrible role model. If you ask me people only buy the CD because she's a cute blonde, that is her only positive attribute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the rest of these reviews","review":"If you take the time to read the reviews on here, it quickly becomes obvious that the only people who like this CD are girls in their early teens.

Its also great for target practice with my 12 guage. Hang that baby up and blast it.Oh yea, I made a project out of the cover by melting the plastic with a blowtorch. My friends liked it and we had a good time burning it and running it over with our cars so ill give it 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad lyrics + actress with okay voice = CD worth about $1.50","review":"How this CD got to be #1 is a total mystery to me. Compared to someone like Michelle Branch, Hillary Duff sounds like crap. I'm not saying she's really horrible or anything, but she definitely isn't great. In fact, if you take away all the effects that have been added to make her sound better, she's not much better than the average person. Combine that with a bunch of lyrics that would make Britney's latest hit sound meaningful, and you've got a CD that is worth about $1.50."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love you Hilary","review":"This Album is fantastic, one of my faves, Hilary is amazing, GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HILARYYY"},{"rating":"1","title":"love her, not her singing","review":"i really really love hilary duff, i really do, i am a really big fan, but i have got to admit that she shouldn't sing, because she cant really, she should stick to acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE SONG is GREAT, others are SO-SO","review":"I hate to be harsh...but, So Yesterday is wonderful, buy the rest of the songs are just so so.

She acts like such a bubblehead - airhead. Her music is really bad and she simply cannot sing a note. I mean, if she were to call herself a \\"singer\\", then i guess we all are. Her voice is so abviously synthesized and she cant even sing in tune. Her roles in her movies are all the same princess type peppy people.

I mean come on people open your eyes \\"Why not do a crazy dance\\" how STUPID is that. \\"Metamorphosis\\" that's the title of this crap right? My friend & I both agree on the basic meaning of that tilte, she metamorphosed from dork into a much bigger dork, with a big head. She has totally let this whole fame thing go to her dumba**ed blonde head. She sucked in Lizzie McGuire & her crappy CD sucks also. Everybody is entitled to her/his own opinion right? Well this is my opinion along with several of my friends, so this is for everyone who gets mad just b/c someone puts down their percious Hilary Duff.

Show your love for Hilary Duff in another way, though I can't possibly see why anyone would like her voice. The only saving point in her songs are the producers that fix up her songs. Other than that, her voice could possibly shatter glass. I am not going to give a second thought to this, ever. Get a life, don't obsess over others. That goes for the naysayers also.

She means well, but this CD is just very childish. She can't sing nearly as well as she can act. She may be cute, but her vocals and her lyrics (\\"if you can't do the math, get out of the equation, I'm calling you back, this is *69) just don't cut it.

If i could give it zero stars, I would. You can totally tell that it's not her voice on the CD and it sucks that she gets so much financial backing into selling her album when there are way better Disney channel stars (Raven or Christy Carlson Romano). By better I mean better at singing AND acting. If any of you guys have seen Lizzie Mcguire, she sucks at acting too. The only type of person she can act out is a superficial airhead, because that is what she really is. This album sucks and you are an idiot if you spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can't sing. At all. Period. End of sentence.","review":"She can't sing. Her songs aren't bad. But she cannot sing at all. She's yet another J.Lo, i.e. a not half bad actress that has the misguided notion that she also has a singing voice. It's weak, puny and boring. I can't believe anyone would actually buy this album. My kid sister has it (that's how I came to hear some of it and be able to feel fit to write a review) and wow, I love her, but I think she's crazy to support such an untalented hack. Normally I have lot of respect for other people's musical taste, but just, wow. This is an incredibly cheap work of fluff.

Don't get me wrong here, she's totally awesome, but maybe she should have stuck to movies instead of getting into the music side of stuff. I think she is really talented, and am a huge fan of her's, but maybe singing isn't her thing. I did, though, like this CD. Some songs are very good. It is most definately pop! Oh well, she can sing if she wants too. Not a bad CD, better than her second one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Suprising!","review":"Despite what some may think, this really is a pretty good album. Don't be fooled that this is bubblegum pop, cause it's not, Hilary has come a long way from her Lizzie McGuire days.

Way to go Hilary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying Hilary","review":"Hilary Duff's Sophmore debut is completly horrible, not to mention that she barely put any effort into it. she did not write any of the lyrics (songs) and she did not help produce it. She bacically only lent her voice. And whoever lent their lyrics for the album should be fired and be put in jail, the lyrics don't make sence (from \\"So Yesterday\\" \\"Im keeping your old black hat, they look good on me, you're never gonna get them back\\") She debuted on the highly poupular Disney Channel Sitcom \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" and was titled as an actress. Then she decides she wants to lend her horrible voice on an album, and now shes targeting to have an Olsen twin empire, with her own clothing line. Besides that, the CD has no melody, and the lyrics are awful. This is one Metomorphosis into a history of shockingly awful albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"...WTF is this...","review":"omg this has got to be the worst CD ever... half of the time her voice is digitized because she can't sing at all.

What right does Hilary have making an album? Esspecially when, undoubtably, there are actual real talented musicians out there not being heard. Well, she has just as much right as J-Lo, Brittny (neither of whom can sing real well either) and Avril (Hilary had just as much input into \\"her\\" music as Avril did in hers--except Hilary didn't lie about it, the way Avril does/did...) See, all pop music pretty much ..., and who'se to say Hilary's pop music ... more then those of whom, for some reason, been deemed credible? Actually, I think it's better then the usual (stuff).

This girl's audience and source of income will never come from anyone over the age of 12 because no one older than that is stupid enough to buy this sh*t. She manages to consistently suck throughout the entire album, where as most artists come out with at least ONE good song. If you're willing to listen to pre-pubescent crap, then buy this album and waste your money, but if you want real music, then do yourself a favor and keep a 5-foot distance from this album.

There nothing special about her voice. Half the people I know could sing better than her. Sure, she's a great role model, unlike some other singers out there, but what else is so great about her.I admit that some of the songs are cute. I mean that the songs personally are cute. Most of these songs would benefit greatly if it had sung by a singer with a decent voice. But some other songs are just bizarre. I mean the lyrics are all over the place and don't even make sense.The reason that I give the album 2 stars is because the songs and because I suppose Hilary does have potential. But she needs to take a good 2 years off and go and study with a good vocal coach and voice teacher.

That didn't last long. Soon after, I heard her sing. It was terrible!! It sounded awful, and she obviously used synthesyzers (sp?). I am really disapointed in hearing how many people bought her album. She got so overrated and has dumb, meaningless songs with no depth. It's pitiful that people can't tell real musicians from cheesy, pop money-making stars. In my opinion, she's the next Britney.Did you know some of her songs were written by the guy who wrote songs like \\"Like a Virgin\\" for Madonna? Wow, he's sure lost some of his luster (no offense to him.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This album is great. This album is for teenagers. And this album is not for adults.

These also happen to be the girls who fantasize about boys and love. That pretty much sums up lil Miss Hilary. She sings songs, that are written by 40+ year old men, about what love/heartbreak would be like. Don't expect any depth or actual singing ability on this CD. Heck, don't expect any actual substace from Duff until she gets some singing lessons and can writes her own lyrics.I'm giving her 2 stars, because I find her voice \\"nice\\" on \\"So Yesterday.\\" It's no Christina Aguilera, but it sure beats Britney."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is true!

But yes, I was a fan of her before purchasing this CD. I couldn't wait for this CD to come out, and I was heavily disappointed. And she doesn't even write her own music! Look at all these struggling artists out there who can actually sing and write their own stuff! There aren't any words in the English language to express my hatred for this CD.

It kind of a lacks a certain flare, it's just not very good. As far as Hilary's voice goes, I think she needs voice lessons. She just doesn't have enough talent. As for her looks, she is very pretty, but that has nothing to do with the CD as far as I'm concerned.

Personally I think that Hilary Duff is just another example of artists today with hardly any talent. Hilary Duff will never perform one of her songs live, and if she does she will lipsync her songs because she can't sing without a multi-million dollar recording studio behind her. Everyone is just validating her status as \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" nothing more. All the songs on this album sound exactly the same with no mixture of stlyes. The record is pretty bland. So buy this album if you like her as an actress, that's why everyone else is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Not STOP!","review":"I knew Hilary's CD was going to be horrible just after hearing her plain, flat voice on \\"Why Not\\", \\"I Can't Wait\\" and the Lizzie McGuire Movie.

Why do they all feel the need to sing when 98% of them CAN'T?!Of course, my younger sisters just *had* to have this so I have listened to it. I couldn't stand it, either.While she's not pure bubblegum, most of her CD is. The songs that aren't, I was like WTF?! Why's she trying to be some 'hard-core' when she can't even sing?Her voice displays NO emotion. It's flat, annoying and it's obvious Disney Records wants to squeeze all it's worth out of Ms. Duff.Hilary, stick to acting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen & Learn","review":"Wow! Listen and learn. This CD is true genius! I can't believe how she did it! She began as a beatiful dorky unpopular kid in \\"Lizzie Mcguire\\". Then she transfored into a solo popstar. This is what teen music idols should make. Hilary has made it easy for us to fufill her dreams of emotion in her music that makes think \\"That's the new CD I'm getting with my cash this week! Her painful performince in \\"So Yesterday\\" made you want to cry, then comes \\"Come Clean\\" thats so dangerous, it could kill! (Just Kidding!). Then you come to Number 4's \\"Little Voice\\" which may startle you in suprise thinking that it's a rockin' happy party song into a sad, deep & depressing song. This CD is so filled with suprises that you think you hate it and will refuse to get it, but incheck that it's your birthday get it for a gift, say you like it (which you THINK you don't) and then listen.You relize that you LOVE IT!!!!!!

Why does she waste her time singing when she must (not) know that she has fans? Who would waste good money on a CD that is pointless, and a must-not-listen-to? Spend your money on something else. This music sux! I don't know why Hilary can't see that. I mean, her album is \\"number one\\" in the country. Yeah, right! I soo believe that. NOT! Hilary's album shouldn't even be in the top 100 list. I have to be honest. This CD should recieve negative 2,395,957,489 stars. Well, this album is soooooo bad, it shouldn't even deserve ANY stars.

'metamorphosis' may have been a hit, but it sure did not deserve to be. please stick to the acting, hilary; your'e not bad at that, and you have a great future there.peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Next Britney?

I mean the biggest mistake she made was quitting Lizzie McGuire~sp~ because at least then she didnt have to got through the disappointment of knowing that no one was buying the CD cause she has an alternitive.

She is constantly dealing with other teen idols and probably has enough stress than it already is. Hilary is not one of the world's greatest singers, but fortunely her album did go platinum(I think). However her album is not one of my favorites, but I still love you Hilary Duff!!! I give her album 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Hilary!","review":"This c.d is soooooooo not yesterday! She really knew what she was doing! I really liked the c.d.Alot of people gave it bad reviews but I think they're just hating on Hilary. The only thing is that her voice is digitized in real time so it is a computer and I'm kinda mad about that,but she's alright! On a scale of one to ten I give this c.d a 10+. For a first album this is good. If you like rock/pop (what I like to call Rop!) you should get this album. I suggest you listen to it on the computer before though just in case.P.S The best songs (for me) were So Yesterday,Party Up, Little Voice and Metamorphosis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Now I must admit, I didn't buy this cd.

Her voice is so weak, I can't believe someone actually thought otherwise. I suggest to Hilary to get more extensive voice lessons to strengthen her already weak vocals. I'm not a singer, but I can distinguish a really great singer (like Whitney Houston) from a mediocre one like Hilary."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL what a weird album...","review":"I feel so stoupid I bought this album!All the songs are horrible and dont make any sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im being honest","review":"Okay to be perfectly honesti dont hate hilary duff because i dont know herfor all i know she could the kindest person alivebut i must say this album defintley sucksthe songs have no depth or soulit is obviously not her real voicei dont like music where the singer didnt write the lyricsand i can tell there was no real work put into thisif you want music with meaning and souli suggest you try, Matchbox 20, 2pac, Savage Garden, Goo Goo Dolls, and Stained"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary Duff was good for a while","review":"I think Hilary is kind of out now but at the time the kids liked this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad.

I like almost every song (except for one--Party Up), and a few of them continue to grow on me the more I hear them. Little miss Duff has a pleasant singing voice; she doesn't have the power and/or range of certain other vocalists out there, but her voice seems perfectly suited to the songs recorded here. These are fun, lighthearted, catchy tunes--who better to sing them than someone with a fun, lighthearted, carefree voice like Hilary Duff. I am very happy I bought Metamorphosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR","review":"When i bought this cd i thought it would be another excellent cd in pop history. Instead I got something that was so bad i traded it in. METARMORPHOSIS is one of the worst albums ive ever heard. COME CLEAN is such a bad song it should come with a government warning. SO YESTERDAY and PARTY UP are probablly the only excellent songs. Teriblle. Go spend your money on Jewels 0304"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be any worse?","review":"Wow. I am NOT saying that in a good way. She is one of the WORST singers ever. Actually, she's not even singing. Her voice is so obviously computer generated.

PL, don't sing it if u don't mean it.Yeah, she's cute so she gets 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice try but....","review":"I can't stand Hilary Duff. But, my personal hatred for her aside, this CD is still not very good. Hilary's voice needs A LOT of work. She has one of those voices where if she was singing with friends or in public, nobody would cover their ears, and she wouldn't be embarassed to sing. However, for her to make an album is ridiculous. If she wasn't already \\"Lizzie McGuire\\", nobody in their right mind would give her a record deal. Maybe with alot of voice training and when she gets a bit older, she might make a half decent singer, but by then probably nobody will even care about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disapointed","review":"I was excited about this CD coming out until I previewed it on AOL First Listen. She only has 2 good songs on the whole CD. I liked Why Not and So Yesterday, but the rest of the songs were horrible. It can't be described as bubble gum pop, I don't know what to call it! I am glad I previewed it before I bought it so I didn't waste my money. Hilary has a great voice but her songs are lacking. She needs to find someone new to write her lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete \\"Kronos\\" is an idiot","review":"This idiot Pete \\"Kronos\\" is possibly the stupidest person I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. he never listened to this album, therefore i will give it a 5 just to negate his review.obviously if you are into trash metal and heavy rock you aren't going to like a pop album like this one.If you write a review to insult a CD just because you can and it will make you look like a top reviewer you are a pitiful personAlthough this album isn't good, it sounds better than Pete \\"Kronos\\" whiny voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This cd is really good!

I love it.Workin' it Out- 7.5/10: This is not the best song, but I still listen to it sometimes.Little Voice- 100/10 FAVORITE ONE ON THE CD!!!!! This song rocks!!! It is sort of bratty though.Where Did I Go Right- 9/10: This song is so sweet and lovely.Anywhere but Here- 10/10: I love it! But I already had it because I had \\"A Cinderella Story\\" soundtrack.The Math- 9/10: Pretty good. It has a good beat.Love Just Is- 9/10: I like this song a lot.Sweet Sixteen- 6/10: This one isn't that good. The chorus is pretty boring.Party Up- 10/10: I love this song!!!!! It's very rockin' and cool!Metamorphosis- 10/10: Love it!!!!!! Very good!Inner Strength- 4/10: Pretty short.

The only thing I hear when I listen to this album is the sound of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the kids have it","review":"Hillary Duff can't sing and she's a midiocre actor who lucked her way into a Disney Lead because she's cute. And now she matured into a beautiful teenage girl, so they sell her another way.But one day she will fade into the realm of 'whatever happened to' so I don't worry about the kids listening to this CD, they'll outgrow it in less than two years and in the meantime it's harmless.

So let the kids have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, At Least She's Got A Beautiful Mind.","review":"Miss Duff is the most phenomenal musical deity since Mozart...wait a minute, she's even greater than that lame little eighteenth-century Viennese pissant!

She just tries to be Avril Lavigne in half her tracks, like \\"The Math\\", \\"Party Up\\" and \\"Metamorphosis\\" sound JUST like songs that were on Avril's album. She has NEVER done a live concert *with her REAL voice* so i would think her voice is totally fake...take my advise DONT buy this CD just download it for FREE. Her voice gets so tiring, you'll get sick of this CD after listening to it for 3 days, so do yourself a favor and SAVE ur money.

If you actually want to be able to remember a song after hearing it a dozen times, try early Joni Mitchell. If you want easy accessible pop, try the Beatles. If the thought of listening to something older than five years scares you, at least try a band or singer that writes his or her own music; Franz Ferdinand or early Jewel. Their songs areall a thousand times better than Hilary Duff could ever hope to be. Not that Duff would know, seeing as how she doesn't actually write music or play an instrument. What an age when being pretty and being able to squeak out a few notes gets one at the top of the Billboard Charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This CD Is Great but if you wanna buy this album just go to Target!

Is this some new type weapon?\\" I surmised. No, its what shifty record producers think they can get away with.

This album is full of unfathomable lyrics backed by a 15 year old girl who has no vocal abilities. Why this girl even thought she could pull off singing is sad, but what is more depressing is that there are thousands of talented, unsigned bands out there that are actually worthy of putting out a record, but instead, we are \\"blessed\\" with \\"musicians\\" like Hilary Duff. Don't buy this album, don't even download it. It is especially not worth it since the recent lawsuits. If you are around 7 years old, you may enjoy this album.

Her voice is ssssssssssooooooooooooooo weak and she has no pwer to it. SHe has the wors voice in this music industry along with Jennifer Lopez and Ashlee Simpson. There are better artists out there today that have amazing voice but dont get much credit for it like Jojo for example who's younger than Hilary and has a powerhouse voice. Anyways skip this talentless babe. I do have to admitt, she is pretty hot. BUT HILARY SHOULDNT EVEN MAKE ANOTHER CD AGAIN. She should stick to acting.

But for anyone who has the sick, sick vice of overlooking titles i'll go into further detail. This album stinks. Hilary couldn't act, and she certainly cannot sing. The album is repetitive and dull, with little depth and has a very cheap quality to it. Her voice is plain, it doesn't sound bad, but it has a restricted range, never going high or low. One thing is for sure, it doesn't make you think but it does make your ears bleed after a while. it markets to immature nine and ten year olds, but it seems i can't escape it even at my middle school where they insist on playing the whole album over the PA system during lunch.

She sounds horrible-her voice is always breaking & she cant hit any note that actually songs well! She didn't write any songs & the lyrics are not for children. This album deserves A BIG FAT \\"F\\"- for a big ugly, no talent, s**pot,W.A.S.P.!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Terrible","review":"This CD has been giving me a hard time since my little sister bought it a year ago. I have been tortured while trying to listen to Agaetis Byrjun (a CD by a GOOD artist called Sigur Ros) by being interrupted by this poor excuse for music. It lacks originality and is very uninspired (sorry for being redundant)(...)That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Unfortunately, the only songs I can stand to listen to on this cd are the ones that were already released (so yesterday and why not). The rest are pure drivel and completely maddening. They make me want to smash my poor, innocent cd player. Save your money - buy a good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"First of all: I hate pop! I perfer bands like No Doubt and Gavin Degraw, and will never buy a britney spears album. Even so, I love Hilary. She has a great mix of ballads and dance tracks. My favorites include party up and little voice. I know you'll like the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"Many people have reviewed this cd badly for the wrong reasons. First off, I have no interest in this genre of music. I generally listen to more traditional stuff like the Eagles (Hell Freezes Over is the best CD ever made) and James Taylor and rock like Lacuna Coil. My little cousins however do listen to this. Hilary Duff's music is perfect for them. With all of our kids listening to eminem and christina aguilera's adult lyrics nowadays, it's nice to see music that isn't suggestive or offensive playing on the radio. I'd rather our kids listen to this than most of pop culture music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphosis!!!!","review":"This album is the perfect one for everybody!!!! I give it 5 stars. I own this CD and I think that this is perfect. I listen to it everyday! It's very fun to listen to this CD! It's worthing for this CD! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I am a fan of Hilary Duff's work so i liked it. if you like music that's easy, not TOO headbanging but not slow either(at least SOME songs aren't slow) then you'll like this.it's a very nice mix of songs.I definatly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I'm listening to the fifth track right now. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised. She's obviously no Kelly Clarkson, but the songs are catchy and her vocals are nothing to be ashamed of. Great job, Hilary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the new equation","review":"This has happened before when untalented 13-18 year old girls get record deals and this equation can help predict the outcome15 yearold star+ tv show + debut album + movie = drug use and implants"},{"rating":"2","title":"You know Hilary's sexy and your jelous of her bust size","review":"You know Hilary's sexy and your jelous of her bust size"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about buying","review":"Some people have definitley hit me in the head for saying this, but Hilary Duff is a horrible singer, who only got a record contract because she was pretty and already a well known actress. Her songs are pointless and catchy (come clean is still stuck in my head from this morning) and she honestly can sing about as well as me. The only song i think that's really okay to listen to is So yesterday. IF you personally like Hilary Duff, just buy the C.D, but if you want good music, try Evanescence or Rent.Don't kill me, i'm just the messenger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....","review":"This CD is dreadful. I gave her 2 stars only because she can't sing for beans, and somehow she has made her album sell a couple copies to a few tweens. People, we have a magician here. Mabye if she made a magic video she would make more money. Heck, she'd be a billionaire if people paid her NOT to sell her CD. What is the music world coming to? If Hillary Duff can make a CD, what's next?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary Shines!","review":"Hilays Debut Album Metamorphosis is a good C.D. All the songs are good except The song Little Voice Is weird but all of the other songs are good & Hilary wrote a few songs & I think their good for some one At The age of 16! Hilary Has Some Talent & is very gifted for such a yong girl! Features the big hit So Yesterday & a bonus track Why Not! This album has lots of great pop tunes with a little twist of rock!If you like this C.D. then I recommend to youHilary Duff Santa Claus LaneBritney Spears In The ZoneKelly Clarkson Thankful"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst singer in history...","review":"Or maybe tying with Britney Spears. My number one peeve? She doesn't write ANY songs...as juvenile and undeveloped as those songs are, a three year old could write them and they're too \\"deep\\" for the mind of Hilary Duff.However, I can overlook lack of creativity when there is a great vocal talent at work (like Christina Aguilera's first album, or Whitney Houston) but this girl has the most horrible, computerized singing voice in history! No range, she sounds ridiculously young, and her voice has no emotion in at all. Disney/Buena Vista is just capitalizing on the whole Lizzie McGuire and teen pop phenomenon, and it makes me want to throw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless CD for sale!!","review":"This is not good music.

Sorry Hilary."},{"rating":"2","title":"She rocks!","review":"I think hilary duff is the koolest singer in the world.She is bueatiful, hip, a movie and tv star, and has the best singing voice i have ever heard. She is also my role model.I wish i could be just like her.We are the same in alot of ways. We both have two dogs, a sister, and a love for pop music.And best of all, the same birthday.Before this summer i hated music. All music, until i heard metamorphisis.My favorete song are the math and sweet sixteen.I even convinced my mom to take me to hilarys concert in december.I was in the FIRST row. The music was blasting in my ears, but i did not care.I actually got to see hilary in person! I will never forget it as long as i live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This is bad!","review":"Ok... I love pop. Good voices like Janet Jackson, Christina, and Kelly Clarkson all define the genre. This CD is so bad I felt like I was listening to a 5 year old singing nursury rhymes. That is how bad her lyrics sounded. Hilary Duff has her own TV show (just as bad as her CD by the way) and then all of a sudden she has talent and gets a record deal. What is going on? She is not pretty at all. Her voice sounds like it was fed through a machine. Wake up America!! If you want to hear real talent go buy \\"Stripped\\" (Christina) or \\"Thankful\\" by Kelly Clarkson"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did she get a CD?","review":"My question: How did Hilary Duff get her own CD? She's only a mediocre singer! A bunch of people at my school (myself not included) can sing better than her, and do you see companies handing them record deals? All she is doing is using her influence to get her more money. Either that, or, ever since Lizzie McGuire has been canceled, trying to stay in the limelight. Stick to acting, for the sanity of all of us, Duff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I personally would not waste my money on this CD. Hilary Duff does not have any musical talent; she has little range and has an immature voice. I really cannot stand to listen to her for very long. However, the songs on this CD are very catchy. She was lucky for that. But she only got this record deal because she was already famous from Lizzie McGuire. If you really like Hilary Duff, go ahead and buy this CD (the songs are pretty good), but I wouldn't recommend it as she has absolutely no singing talent. The songs could have been sung better by someone else who truly deserves a record deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does a tv star become a singer? come on...get real","review":"What the hell has music come to these days? why would a record label just sign up a actress that doesn't have any talent singing? wtf is this... how the hell does a tv star just become a singer out of no where? does she even write her own lyrics? thats the problem with pop music these days... they are all crappy lyrically and have no effort put in it... the only good music that actually has some work put forth into is alternative rock/rock/metal etc.... rap is just about being a gangster, murder and b*tches and hoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH GOD KILL ME NOW","review":"this CD is a form of torture! WHO THE HELL CAN STAND THIS CRAP???? Hillary Duff is a dumbsh*t blonde who can't sing her way out of a paper bag. It isnt even her voice singing and it sux. Soooooo if they tamper with her voice, she must suck even more than she does now, just when you think shes hit rock bottom. Shes also a Class A B*tch, didnt u all hear that she demanded more money from Disney, so they fired her a*s??? who the hell wants to listen to a money hungry, prep, who cant sing worth a sh*t?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphosis is an awesome CD!!","review":"When I first bought this CD, I really wasn't expecting that much from Hilary Duff, because she was originally an actor from Lizzie McGuire Show. Also since I always listened more towards metals and rocks like Linkin Park and Nickelback, so I was not much into this pop/rock thing that Hilary had. Then when I listened to this CD, her music sounded real nice.. The tune was catchy and her voice sounded really cute. I especially liked, So yesterday, Come Clean, The Math, Anywhere But Here, Sweet Sixteen, Why Not and Metamorphosis. Thats about 8 out 11 good songs in one album. I don't know why you guys say horrible things to Hilary. She looks nice and HOT and I think her voice sounds a lot better than Britney Spears or Avril Lavigne. Also she sets a good example and acts like a good role model towards younger kids. People with their pop taste should purchased this CD because this CD is worth a money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"I love Hilary Duff. Also, I am not 14 nor am I 50. I am 19, and I see Hilary Duff as the clean Britney Spears-you know, the Britney that sang Baby One More TIme. I think my friends and I see Hilary as 19 and 20 year olds saw Britney when she first cme out-young, cute and a nice voice and body. I do like the song \\"come clean\\" and \\"so yesterday\\". I listen to this disc when I feel somewhat melancholy. It is overall a pretty decent CD, but you have to be in a certain mood for it; but a lot of music is like that! I would suggest buying it, but I also suggest that before adding it to your cart, listen to the clips above first to decide if you really want the disc! I think she has a lovely voice. Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hilary or hellary","review":"oh my god, i love this album. i am twelve years old, and hilary duff's music gives me the power and strength to not kill myself.

I bought her CD at Fred Meyer's for $10 then popped it in my CD player.FIVE MINUTES AFTER LISTENING TO IT I THREW IT AWAY...Her voice is pathetic in all of the songs..especially in Little Voice, Why Not, So Yesterday, Come Clean, Sweet Sixteen, PRACTICALLY every song!Plus, must I add, a song called 'INNER STRENGTH' IS ONLY 1.5 MINUTES LONG!!! showed how desperate they were to fill the CD up and sell sell sell and make $$$$$...~*~*~*So please, do not waste your valuable money and spend it on Britney Spears' new CD or Dido's this holiday season~*~*~*~"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay in acting gurl u just cant sing","review":"hailary duff is just another teenage gurl trying to make money of young kids come on she cant really sing she only has to good songs on that cd ( so yestoday her first singel in come clean )overall the cd is really stupid her sister wrote songs for her in those songs are also stupid shes better in acting than singing hilary stick to acting if i was you read this well DONT buy the cd its not worth the money she cant sing for nothing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talentless little girl","review":"Wow, and I thought J.Lo was bad..

Some of the songs are pretty and some are the kind of music that the 2 year olds I babysit dance to. I thought it would be different since she wasn't really so Disney anymore. It doesn't really have the little bit of rock I heard it would. Buy it if you like it. I didn't really like it much but everyone has their own opinions so don't resist buying the cd if you really want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HILARY'S COMPUTERIZED VOICE","review":"excuse me people, do you not realize that hilary duff's voice is computerized??

Hillary has an \\"Ok Voice\\" ( but she should stick with acting ). My only problem with this CD are the lyrics and its lack of origionality. For example is So Yesterday she says \\"If the light is off it isnt on\\"....What? And on Come Clean she says \\"trying to fit a sqaure into a square was my life\\", right there she's trying to sound deep but not doing a good job. But what bugs me the most is this is another CD with just a bunch of love songs. Theres nothing except love songs. And what is she like 15? What could she possibly know about love?I gave her a 2 cause i felt sorry for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"ohh my god","review":"i just can't control myself when i heard the whole album,this album is for people who under the 15!!!!i gave it 2stars for: so yesterday,come clean,where did i go right? & why notthose songs are really cute,pretty!!!she can't sing,her voice is too low,she need to practise more!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you be a BIG fan of her?","review":"She's so COMMON!

Just sell this crap to those pop hungry retards.DUFF IS A COW AND EATS CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary Duff Should Metamorphasize of her fat ass!","review":"This CD is one of the worst albums ever. I wish Hilary would actually sing her songs, instead of having a computer sing them for her while she has mickey D's in her mouth. A lyric from this album is \\"if you can't do the math get out of the equation.\\" I guess the got out of the equation after she did the math with calorie consumption per day, that was a losing battle, the number on the calculator was to big to fit on the tiny screen.

Please don't listen to the other reviews (I think the ppl were brian washed). Okay, so me and my friend both got Metamorphosis as a gift. WORST ALBUM EVER!There was only one song we like (and only if Hilary Duff didn't sing it) it was \\"Where did I go Right?\\" Hilary Duff is making albums when she can't sing.

HIL IS NOT PUNK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PopFan","review":"People say the love her or hate her to death. Either way,those aren't helpful reviews. I think Hilary Duff has a nice voice. Duff's songs are catchy and fun to sing along to,while some songs are soft and nice to relax too. Party up,Sweet sixteen,The Math,and Come clean are good songs to listen too. So Yesterday is also a nice song. Listen to Hilary's songs yourselve to decide if you like her. If You enjoyed Metamorphosis,I recommend Her 2nd album entitled Hilary Duff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I really liked this cd, and yes, I actually own it. All of the tracks are really good, I can't tell which one I like best!

I first heard the whole CD at my friend's house. I noticed that Hilary shares some qualities with Britney Spears. Hilary really doesn't have great range or a major talent, but when she sings she's on pitch and her music is more about the tone of her voice than the actual talent she possesses. The album is highlighted by the catchy and upbeat songs \\"So Yesterday\\" and \\"Anywhere But Here\\". I really do recommend Metamorphosis! Maybe even 4 1/2 stars. Perhaps the album lacks a bit in the originality department but Hilary is clearly the next IT Girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever","review":"Its the best.

What a shame huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UmMmM..YeAh","review":"I'll give Hilary Duff-Man (lil inside joke) one thing. She doesn't sound very bad. I mean yeah when I heard that she made a CD I did roll my eyes but she isn't a bad singer, she just sings the wrong stuff. 'So Yesterday' isn't a bad song either. But the rest of her songs are as good as gone. Or maybe corny in other words. I dislike (not hate) Hilary's lyrics. Even in 'So Yesterday' I didn't like her lyrics but it's still a good song. The lyrics and some songs are kind of childish, which she's a child herself or teen which that explains it.I recommend just buying the single for 'So Yesterday' because the rest of her CD isn't the best thing in the world. But that's my opinion on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary Sucks!!!","review":"This is one of the worst albums that I've ever heard. Every song sounds the same. Hilary's voice is awful. She can't sing. She should go back to doing t.v. shows and movies. She's just using her fame to do music not because she has musical talent. People like her because they like her in Lizzie Mcguire not because she has musical talent which she doesn't. If you want to hear artists with musical talent check out Britney Spears \\"In the zone\\" or Christina Aguilera \\"Stripped\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true review","review":"O.k. people, here is a real review. It's true Hilary duff's songs are very catchy. The tune,and the words are cool. Her voice isn't as great though. If ur into awsome singers with a REAL voice then don't get this. This C.D. is great to just listen in the car or while hanging out with friends ( the ones that don't hate her). If you like her songs \\"Why Not\\" and \\"so Yestreday\\" what are you waiting for? get the c.d. already! For people who think otherwise, i suggest looking for more hard core singers. This is more bubble gum pop, if you know what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"It beats the heck out of Britney Spears!","review":"1st off all pop singers today can't sing, and the music is horribly commercial(we need one of these young teen stars to discover Rosemary Clooney or Ella Fitzgerald). Until hilary duff discovers Kay Starr, at least she can sing, and much better than Britney Spears or nay of the teen stars of today. Her So yesturday is more listenable than anything else out there today(I only listen to trad jazz anyway, for that reason). However Hilary Duff is adorable and has classic beauty not seen since Ann Rutherford. Get this cd if you like kiddie/teen pop, and just to stair at the photo on the cover. I'd personally like to hear Hilary Duff sing the Cole Porter songbook without the computer generated vocals and with the Oscar peterson Trio, i think she could pull it off. Let's turn Hilary Duff into a jazz diva!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actress, but...","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt tried it. So did J. Lo. And now, Hilary Duff. Actresses trying to break into the music business. Very few are successful. I don't believe that Hilary Duff is one of those people.Now, don't get me wrong. I loved Hilary Duff on Lizzie McGuire. She's a great actress and it was a good show. The fact remains, though, that while she does possess acting talent, she is sadly lacking in the area of natural singing talent. Unfortunately, Hilary's voice is not groundbreaking, and what she does sing is often covered up by the multitudes of background singers on all of the songs. Most of the tracks on this album come across as sugary, overproduced, typical pop songs. Overall, Hilary is a great actress, and acting is where she should stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I just want 2 say that I think that this album is GREAT! It's not 4 every1, only people that r under 16, that like pop music or that like Hilary.

Girl Can Rock"},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist in the making...","review":"Hilary Duff shows that, although she did not write any of the songs, she put a large amount of effort into collaborating with other musicians to process ideas and create a work of art. Metamorphosis was, overall, a \\"pretty good\\" CD. While the sound was highly original and tasteful, some songs didn't reach expectations. I was, however, pleased with the quality, meaning the song style.favorite songs:1. So Yesterday is a traditional break-up song about getting over a boy. It certainly worth condiseration listening to.2. Come Clean3. Little Voice4. Anywhere But Here5. Party Up6. Why Not**cheetah**"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read this review before you but the cd!","review":"A couple months ago, I hated Hilary Duff. She's a pretty good actress, for the shallow roles she played( I do love her show though...) but she has very little singing talent. \\"Why not\\" made my quickly change my radio station, it's lyrics barly make sense, they do ryme however, which is the reason most of them are there. And if she wasn't pretty, she probably wouldn't be this big at all. So needless to say, I just about despised her. Well, on aol you can listen to cds before they come out, and hear was Hillary Duff's on my screen. So I clicked, expecting to hear some really bad stuff. The first song is overplayed, so I skipped it. But the rest of the cd wasn't that bad. Sure, it doesn't have deep, meaningful lyrics and her voice is done over, but it wasn't really that bad. It's just a light, fun cd to pop in and dance to. So, from a honest view, all personal feelings aside, it's a pretty good debute album.

Miss Duff is a star, and though many hateful people rate this cd poorly, it's not going to effect her zillions of cd sales across the world, heck aliens in outer space probably play this cd on top ten, on universal outer space radio... woo hoo Hooray for Hilary her success and her legs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brittney Spears is so yesterday!

How someone with so little natural singing ability could land a million dollar recording contract is beyond me. Of all the female Disney stars, her voice is by far the worst. But Hilary is pretty and that's all that matters.Believe it or not, I have listened to this whole CD. While her voice does not come across as tragic, this is due mostly to the overabundence of backup singers who drown out Duff and the blatant overmanipulation of her voice by computers. This Cd is digitally enhanced within an inch of its life. Plus, is it me or do the songs all sound the same?? Originality anyone??Save your money and go buy something else. house. If people must get a cd from a Lizzie McGuire star, go get Lalaine's cd (Miranda) which you can get off her website.

Well I am gonna listen to this cd because I want to see if I am proven wrong by the songs. Maybe the songs will be good enough to see pass her 'ok' voice.

Hilary is trying to be a punk and guess what it's not working! Her songs really are catchy and cool but her voice is overated by machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary Duff and this cd","review":"Well, let me just start off to say that this cd has good, catchy songs, but are sung with a girl who's voice is 1/6 computerized and who can't sing. The only reason Hillary Duff is popular is because she is an actress turned singer. Any actress can be a singer. What makes a talented singer is one who isn't famous just because she acts, it is one who has risen from pressures to be a great singer. Hillary Duff's songs are catchy, but she is a really bad singer and an average actor. I recommend this cd to people who just like the songs but not the singing. I also want everyone who reads this to NOT RESPECT HILLARY DUFF AS A SINGER, BUT RESPECT HER AS AN ACTRESS. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the matter with all of you reviewers!?","review":"Hilary Duff's cd \\"Metamorphosis\\" has some great songs if this is the type of music you like. Very...Britney Spears (pre-nasty), Christina Aguilera (sweet girl phase), Mandy Moore etc. If that isn't the type of music that you like, then you shouldn't be reviewing this CD and offering advice on it because your opinion is useless to those people interested enough to consider buying it. If you are looking for the sweet, school girl pop music stuff, this cd is great! I have several younger sisters who absolutely love it! And unlike some of the Britney Spears and Christina cds, it doesn't have anything in it that parents might find offensive. Hilary Duff is beautiful, young, and fun. Young girls will love her! There are a couple of really good songs on this CD like \\"Why Not\\", \\"So Yesterday\\", and \\"Come Clean\\". If you like this style, this CD is fun! :)Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM A POP FAN..","review":"I might make a few teenies cry so I advise her soft hearted fans to skip this post altogether. I adore pop but Hilary is trying to ease herself into the rock world that she mentioned in interviews....which by the way isn't working..she's speaking throughout her album which should consist of actual singing. I don't understand how she got a record deal in the first place. its another marketing scheme.If you're gullible/easily disillusioned then this cd will appeal to you..in its repetitiousness, and incesssant breathy vocalization. Her voice isn't even consistent throughout the album. I do hope she tries out for some vocal training..for the love of god..she can afford it.Parents, I recommend you buy this cd for children that you wanna keep occupied so you can relaxOther teens, I suggest you try Michelle Branch..she can sing, write and play the guitar..all of which Hilary Duff fails to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have came to the conclusion that","review":"Nowdays talent doesn't matter...this is a prime example.

Her show Lizzie McGuire brought her stardom a young girl of her acting abilities should never have recieved. This little pretty girl has had everything handed to her, acting roles, record deals, etc. without the work or talent to back her up. In a way, I say good job Hilary for proving that a person of very average talents (although she is quite the looker) can do very well for herself financially. On the other hand, i think of all the talented people out there who so much more deserve the opportunities this little brat has come to expect and it makes me sick. Do not buy this cd unless you think she is a good actress because if so you don't know enough about talent to know the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick, get this girl some singing lessons!","review":"This is about the worst album I've ever listened to. DO NOT BUY THIS CD (I didn't, I just listened to my friend's copy). It will be a huge waste of money because Hilary Duff can't sing to save her life.First of all, all her songs are enhanced by computers or dubbed with many, many background voices. And she STILL sounds terrible! So her voice must have been really, really, really bad before they enhanced it.And most of her songs are completely boring and unintelligible; she sings about love and tween-stuff but it's SO obvious she doesn't know diddly. Half the time, I can barely understand what the hell she's talking about. This CD is sure to drive you insane. If you like Hilary Duff now (WHY?!?!?!), then you'll hate her after listening to this CD.She should stop pretending she knows how to sing, get some voice lessons, and then try again. This CD is truly painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't a good album","review":"I personally never liked Hilary Duff...but this album sucks! I don't think she has much talent, either with acting or singing. In this CD, she doesn't sound her age, she sounds younger! She doesn't have a mature voice yet, so it doesn't really work right. She doesn't seem to know music at all and I just did't like any of these songs. I guess, \\"So Yesterday\\" had a nice BEAT, but she ruined it for me. I don't know how she even got a record contract. Don't buy this album! Don't waste your money!

Intense from the outset. I did not find any of the characters to be particularly likeable. The title aptly describes the squalid lives of most of the main characters. A visually rich film with some nice twists in the story. Henry Thomas (\\"Elliot\\" from E.T.) turns in a particularly outstanding performance of explosive menace. Dominique Swain (as Inez Macbeth) fills the screen with her sensuality - a battered lady Macbeth who instead of manipulating her husband, manipulates others to carry out her dark wishes. Arie Verveen is just plain creepy (and dirty).

Little Elliot from E.T. is all grown up and give us what is perhaps the best, most complex, even sympathetic portrait of an angry, wife-beating loser. You Swain-hunds wont even get real nudity so go check yourselves (her cut off jeans aren't half as short as Daisy Duke's), this be art and love lovers swamp territory all the way.

However, it is humorous and contains a number of worthwhile observations about everyday life.One review describes it as \\"nihilistic,\\" but I cannot agree. I found this book to be the exact opposite.If you have already made up your mind that God/religion/spirituality have no part to play in modern life, then you will probably not care for this book. For everybody else, it is definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indecisive and Insightful","review":"The book begins with indecision and continues gloriously from there. It insists on asking all of the difficult questions about self-hood that everyone is familiar with and desperately wants to be able to answer with some sort of certainty. It is light-hearted, but serious; shallow, but stirring. And while you are reading it, you will have to define and redefine your relationships with yourself and with others and with the Cosmos over and over again. This book is not one that can be swallowed in one sitting, but take your time and let it sink in. You'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"all the prodding questions you never wanted to face","review":"Walker Percy has written a book that never really answers any of your questions but somehow leaves you feeling as if you have a broader understanding of what it means to be human. He is witty, sarcastic, entertaining and painfully honest. This is a wonderful book that should be read by anyone wishing to understand the human condition. I'm not even sure how to describe it. Just get it and you'll know what I mean. I had to read it for a culture and values class about 10 years ago and have gone thru 5 coppies from lending them out and never getting them back. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Walker Percy was an author who came highly recommended to me, so I chose \\"Lost in the Cosmos\\" as my first Percy book. Maybe it was the wrong choice, but I found nothing herein to recommend any further reading. Well, nothing is maybe a stretch. There was some interesting dialogue analyzing the rewards of creation between scientists and artists. At one point in the book, Percy states the following forty pages can be skipped. I can picture him laughing at readers who didn't follow his advice, because these pages are nothing more than gobble-de-gook: Unreadable and not at all understandable. The subtitle of this book is \\"The Last Self-Help Book.\\" I guess this comes from the two places in the book where he highly recommends suicide. Not a book to be read by someone suffering from depression. Or by anyone else as far as I can see. I'm crossing Mr. Percy off my must-read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardbound spam","review":"This is the first Walker Percy book I read. I thought his stuff was supposed to be funny. I'll try another. I suggest you give this one a miss, unless you've never read a self-help book, then perhaps this would be more entertaining than doing so.Some of his questions recall late nights as a college student, gabbing on the sofa rather than studying.Really, the calibre of the humour -- inane -- reminded me of the kind of spam I used to get and that now gets deleted unread.Skip it. Any reputation he has as a humourist can't be founded on this effort.Instead, read Henry Miller's The Cosmological Eye. Then, sit on a sofa with a college student 'til 3 a.m."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living the Question","review":"It was a very interesting read. It doesn't presume to offer any answers, but makes you think about the idea of \\"self\\" in a different way. And Walker Percy is a smart and good writer who will no doubt make you think about things and learn more about yourself and your surroundings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zany and eccentric","review":"This is another one of Fr Schall's recommendations which I picked up recently. The book is an eccentric guide to being a \\"self\\" in the modern world and the problems of being a \\"self\\". It is witty and thought provoking albeit that I would have preferred it if he had ditched the salaciousness and coarseness. However, such \\"touches\\" reflect modernity. Its a serious criticism of the one dimensional so called objective world of the scientific realist, who \\"objectively\\" views and analyses the whole world but simply cannot get the wonder of the human person. The book is a little dated now; we are no longer obsessed with annihilation through nuclear war and have moved on the a frenzied fear of global warning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I think I just don't have the right personality for this style of writing.

To each his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Chicken Soup Here","review":"Walker Percy is at his best in this fiendishly clever parody of a self-help book. Through a series of provocative questions, he forces the reader to recognize how complicated as well as downright peculiar the human being is, a creature whose nature and deepest desires can not be satisfied by the cheaply proffered \\"self-esteem\\" or other banalities of the self-help movement. Not only are we odd, according to Percy, but equally so is the very planet on which we find ourselves. Percy's ultimate aim, then, is a metaphysical one, to reawaken the reader to a concrete sense of mystery within and without. He seeks to upset the apple cart of complacency induced by many self-help gurus fully at home in the world. He challenges their readers to engage instead in a deeper search for meaning and truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions","review":"It said \\"self help\\". What help is a book full of questions - with no answers? I couldn't understand it. The questions are ambiguous and stupid. It must be a joke that I didn't get. I tried to read it and understand what the point of it is, but it was beyond me. Then he makes up conversations between fictitious people that didn't seem to go anywhere, & then he asks another question. I didn't get it. I don't normally read 1 star criticues, but for this book I needed to do that because I agree with all of them. This was not a book for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was indeed lost...","review":"Despite giving this book all of my attention, I found it terribly frustrating. I initially couldn't decide if it was supposed to be some type of dark humor or \\"dark matter\\", but then I was completely lost by the chapters in which the author attempted to shed some light on the foundation of his field of study. I'm still lost in the dark. It was recommended by an astrophysicist on PBS, but I guess you have to be one of that rare breed to appreciate it. I bailed out at about 40% with little hope that it would improve.

The first one I had for him, a different brand in an XL, didn't cover all his back and none of his tail, and the neck was so tight I had to cut it. The neck on this one fits perfectly, and the coat protects him nicely, especially since he doesn't object to the hood. He's a hard fit: 74 lbs Lab mix, way long, but relatively small girth. Even with velcro, the straps around his tummy hang loose. I ordered an XXL because of his unusual length, but he really should have an XL. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again. It is well-made, and is absolutely essential in this climate. People think it's cute or funny--I've had people stop to take a picture with their phones--but I bought it because I don't want a wet dog.

Although there isn't much in terms of bonus material, (the interview with Kenneth Johnson is the same as the intitial release of the pilot episode) the quality of remastering is good. Picture is very clean and clear and the sound is good mono. It would have been nice to have some commentary from the celebrity guest stars. Though they were not well known at the time (Loni Anderson, Gerald McRaney) it still would have been nice to have them reminisce about their appearances on the show.

That happened in the cases of Lost, Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives.Another thing that is odd.

The packaging is nice but the extras are a waste of space. The commentary is from the previous release and WHY release an episode of season 2 when they should just put it on the season 2 release? The video quality is grainy as if Universal decided to record this directly from VHS. Even Leave It To Beaver which dates The Hulk by about 30 years has better video quality.The photo on the back of Bixby is NOT from the series, but \\"Death Of The Hulk\\" movie.

He is a local (Wash DC area)session guy without a big name or following, so I assumed this collection would come up short as much of the locally produced stuff does.It is, in fact an excellent collection, primarily jazz based with a few allegedly Zappaesque novelty numbers. I am not a novelty person and they didn't do much for me. But the remaining, instrumental numbers comprised a nice collection of various styles from traditional lounge jazz to fusion to New Orleans funk. It is generally upbeat, and well produced.

It was hard to follow, but it was written very well. I like the way the nouns were described, and the action words really sounded like an action. The only sugestion I would give to the author is to elobrate on the other characters more. I also liked it because, the other characters had a close bond with the central character. -Sammy H."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adam of the Road","review":"Adam of the Road is a fairly hard to follow book. It's about a boy named Adam who lives in medieval times. Later in the book he loses his dog Nick and has to search for him.

Some parts are just too descriptive and some parts you could just take out of the story and you woudn't even notice that it was gone.

I personaly think that if one would like to read a book and learn somthing in the process this is the right book for them. This book is like a fibanache number for the imagenation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Nowhere","review":"This book made it easy to understand why someone would feel badly about losing their dog and spend a lot of time looking for it. Also, if you don't know a lot about the middle ages, you will learn something about poverty and entertainment at that time. However, the plot of this book is WAY too predictable. You know what is going to happen in the end. It is also too unrealistic. For some reason, everyone the main character meets in the book acts as if he is some kind of lost relative or god. So they are more generous than we think real people would have been in the middle ages.Newton Boys Book Circle"},{"rating":"2","title":"It helps","review":"I've been treating myself for depression and fatigue issues for half a year.

This is the worst, by far, of any of the recent crop. The dialogue is crass and obvious, using the comedians' (Leary, Romano, Latifa & a mush-mouthed Leguizamo) schtick \\"attitude\\" to drive a vehicle with essentially no plot whatsoever (escaping a flood?). None of the characters draw much sympathy, as the harshness of each of these comedians' delivery virtually negates any bond with the audience, young or old. The film consists primarily of plenty of animated and often violent sight-gag filler, and crass pandering to certain adult \\"sensibilities\\".

The story brings back your favorite characters Sid, Manny and Diego and adds a few new fun ones. The story begins with the discovery of the melting ice that will soon flood the mammals valley and the subsequent flight to safety. It also deals with the possibility of the extinction of the mammoths. The story is nicely done, and the squirrel and acorn are back quite often throughout the film. The action is mostly cartoon violence, with a few little jumps. The humor is gentle with the only cursing involves the word ass(which is used for the actually animal) and a beaver saying dam(after his dam is destroyed). Overall it is a nice story you can enjoy with the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Review","review":"Best animation film made. It even has a story that is great. My grandchildren loved it.

The weak premise of the first movie (Jungle Book on Ice without the good jokes, songs or dialogue) is stretched even thinner in the sequel. Sequels in this genre are always going to be compared toToy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition)\\". The producers should have realized that the script they had was not good enough. They obviously did not want to invest any more money as no new characters are introduced (i don't count a scaled model of one of the original characters with longer hair and slightly different color as new). So it clearly shows their intention to cash-in quickly on any good will.The one saving grace for this movie is the squirrel short done to different thematic sound effects (my kids seemed to enjoy this). that's why it gets 1 extra star.my advice is if you really want to own it (and trust me you don't), buy a used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most bloody Cartoon ever","review":"Manny, Sid, and Diego discover that the Ice Age is coming to an end, and join everybody for a journey to higher ground.

As Manny tries to protect his family and reach higher ground he is forced to make decisions that will impact his \\"heard\\".

The next half of the movie is letting the recruits out to play with said dousing rods. The camera angles aren't very good and there's a gratuitous use of night vision when the room is lit. One could argue that it was used to make the dousing rods more apparent, but I would argue that adjusting the camera position would have the same effect.Even those who aren't skeptical and are looking for an excuse to believe will have a hard time swallowing this.If you're looking for a decent paranormal investigation movie, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reusable dry disc filter","review":"These are very good filters, especially for reusable.

Its major premise--that the majority of Cesarean births are unnecessary--is well made and substantiated. Though the size of the book might be intimidating, it is worth digging through. The personal stories of births, both awful and wonderful, are well worth the trouble and drive home the major points of the book. \\"Silent Knife\\" is a good recommendation for any birthing woman--though she may never trust a doctor again.(This review was previously published in \\"Daughters of Sarah\\" May/Jun 1985. Sadly, the number of Cesarean births has not significantly declined since 1983 in spite of alternative birth options.

It installed easy and has never leaked after a few months. I like the clear top so you can see what is being caught by the filter. Im glad this product was available and i will never trust a pur product again. It goes by the original name Teledyne Water Pik or Instapure."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor connection to faucet","review":"The installation was pretty problem free. The water flow is good when fullyconnected and the design is sleek.There is one major problem and that it that the filter will not stay connected. Thescrew well is too shallow to hold the filter securely. The water pressure from the sinkis enough the blow this filter completely off. I find myself re-attaching the filter at leastfour to five times daily. Lately I've just decided to leave it off since I seem to waste somuch time re-attaching it to the faucet. That being said, I find it's more difficult to usethat it's worth. I would buy this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would love to review this book...","review":"... if it were delivered.

Very readable, and extremely insightful.~jjg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, In-Depth Overview of Theory","review":"Kirkham presents readers with an excellent introduction to theories of truth in this book. It's well thought out, highly organized, with excellent indices, and covers its topics in great depth. This is a highly academic and intellectual book, so unless you're a philosophy major or have experience reading theory, this may prove somewhat difficult for you to comprehend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tedious and Technical, but a Worthwhile Purchase","review":"I've only read about the first 2 chapters of the of the 10-chapter book, \\"Theories of Truth\\"; however, I've found Kirkham's treatment of the subject of truth to be quite technical, a bit tedious, and more detailed than my preferences would require. Yet, Kirkham does a fine job of juxtaposing different theories and different approaches to the study of truth as a highly worthwhile subject.I expect the remainder of the book to involve some highly analytical and technical expositions, but I tend to agree with what I've thus far garnered of the author's views on important philosophical issues surrounding truth as a study. Thus, I will give the book 4 stars, and I refrain from the maximum of 5 stars simply because it's a more tedious analysis of truth than the generalist approach that I would most strongly favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning...","review":"I would like to point out I ordered the fifth printing of \\"Theories of Truth\\" and pages 307-338 are missing. To be more correct, they are replaced by pages 51-82. The most amazing thing is that the missing pages contain the material on the disquotational theory of truth--the ONE section I needed.Perhaps my case is unique, but one would think the MIT Press could get this right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"Geez! When I saw that the end of \\"The Witches of Eileanan\\" said: Coming In June 1999 I could't believe it. Then It came out in March1999 I could't believe it. I bought the book and read in 4 days. This book was almost as good as the first! The characters were fun and interesting. Iseult, Lachlan, and Isabeau had to do almost everything with out the help of Megan. All three of them got over some problems and into trouble. This is a GREAT book and I don't think I can wait until JUNE 2000 for the next one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-up","review":"I was impressed that the Witches wasn't a one hit wonder. This second book was well planned if not a little on the slower reading side. The first book truly focuses on the relationship between Meghan and Isabeau, whereas this second book deals with the relationship of Meghan and Iseult, and Iseult and Lachlan. Again praise for the research of pagan traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"why haven't I heard this name afore?","review":"I totally agree with the reader from london who says to read Katherine Eliska Kimbriel and silver Raven wolf.

NO!!!!!!!!! I want it now. The character development of Iseult was added on in leaps and bounds while developing Lachlan (Baccaiche)to a very satisfying character. I love the theme of fantasy books like this one, its fascinating to read books that can captivate thought so wonderfully and still have factual information. Because of this book i have started looking at modern day wicca and amazingly there are some stark simmilarities. Kate Forsyth combined factual information in with the book so well that it could still keep one on the edge of their seat.BOTTOM LINE: READ THIS BOOK (and like me you shall anxiously await the next, can we really wait till SUMMER 2000 though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO KINDLE EDITION","review":"WHY is there no kindle edition of this book?

The working angle of the tool is great and it easily breaks up hard soil. The tine end is nice and small and works well around obstacles. The only minor issue I've had is the plastic cover at the top of the handle comes off when I'm working. It slips right back on but it's irritating. The weight and balance is great. I'd definitely recommend it.

Now that it's finally mounted, it moves well, but I don't even like to move it since I'm not sure how securely it's mounted - unsure about the hardware remember? Well there were only 2 types of screws that fit - one was way too long, and the only other ones were long enough to go in - but only just. They're in maybe a few millimeters - that's it.

I have not significantly scratched up a watch in the past thirty years - but I scuffed this one TWICE in the first week of use. I recommend spending the extra money to get a G-Shock model.

I prefer it over my other much more expensive watches since I don't have to worry about getting it wet or damaged.

Since it is cheap, I just buy a completely new watch when the band breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke then got a replacement and that one broke","review":"The replacement watch also broke just at the end of the band. One of the pieces that comes out of the case to hold the band is what broke. Unfortunately, it broke 7 days after my return allowed day. I wore it to work about 5 times and played tennis with it about 5 times and that's it.It is a very light watch and not as thick as most.However, If yours also breaks, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK","review":"Product arrived on time and in good order. The functions are in different order than they were on the older Casio it is replacing. While it has a count down timer, it would be nice if that could be made to be continuous as opposed to restarting it each time. If it was continuous it would be helpful for making rounds by reminding you each time the rounds were to be started. It does lose 3 or 4 seconds every month or so. Also found it interesting that you should not push the buttons when it is in the water, probably has something to do with sealing out the water. The display appears slightly larger than the older Casio even though they are the same physical size, so easier to read and helps when I am running."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sturdy watch","review":"Bought this for jogging.

Overall I would say it is a good value.Here is an update, I lost the original watch and immediately ordered a new one. As a workout, hiking watch, this one works great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I would not recommend buying this watch. The plastic casing is very brittle. Within one month all four arms that the pins for the band go into broke off. I was able to glue the first two back on, but the second two broke I was riding a bike and there no way I could have found those little pieces of plastic. I have bought inexpensive Casio watches in the past and have been very pleased with them, but it appears that the quality of this watch has been reduced to an unacceptable level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I purchased two, both failed within three weeks.

Maybe I'm biased because I'm a gigantic Slipknot freak - but this 2 DVD set is unbelievable. The performance of Spit it Out is cool as hell, and if you've ever seen Slipknot in concert before (which I had) you'll realize how real this DVD is - it's exactly like being at the show!

It's my first Slipknot purchase and didn't really sell me on the band musically. Great guitar talent spends vast majority of the time banging out one-finger detuned chords. Vocals are cliched cookie monster growl almost always. Drums, on the other hand, are mind-meltingly slammin'.

It reminded me much of the company where I worked which was also run by a brilliant engineer. I had recommended the movie to many others and finally decided to buy a copy of my own.However when I watched the movie this time, I was startled by the amount of needless profanity.

I was excited when I read the reviews for this one. So excited that I bought all three books (and paid almost $60). What a total waste of money. All three books were poorly written. The character development is non-existent. The sex is not sexy or enticing. There is no build-up in the relationships, everybody simply loves each other for no apparent reason. The only thing going for this series is the author's imagination. Don't waste your money of these books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No development of the characters supposed \\"romance\\"","review":"The first book called One With the Hunter is very strange. It begins good but the characters, Shai and Val just jump in the sack together, then after about 2 or 3 times in her bed she wonders who the heck he is. At the end you have no idea whats going on but somehow she just trust and loves him. Then she just dies, which is confusing because the author doesn't tell us how it came about so fast, then she becomes a vampire and thats it. No real good development of the characters and no real plot for romance, the sex scenes were average, I've read better. Wasn't really worth my time, I won't even read the second in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book promises to instruct anyone on how to hike and bike the desert safely. As a generalized overview to some (not all) desert travel it is sufficient for that purpose, but I found it lacking in many subjects crucial to remote desert hikers. Trip/water planning, gear prep, finding water from natural sources, trip navigation (map and GPS), first aid for desert and heat sicknesses, etc. could have all used a lot more material. Coverage of some deserts and specialized advice was lacking. The book emphasizes coverage of 'high' deserts like the Great Basin, unfortunately, at the expense of others. And forget anything outside the U.S., as it's not covered here. I probably would have liked this book better had I not read the Ultimate Desert Handbook, which covers the same subjects a lot more thoroughly, not to mention the diversity of many more deserts in North America and around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I got h03s in different area codes\\"","review":"NO, Luda.

Casio products are a great value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good Casio watch","review":"This watch only lasted about 3 months. The problem is the case that holds the metal pin for the band is made of plastic. For me this means when I was doing yard work, and the pin was ripped from the plastic casing and permanently destroying the watch.As for the functionality, it was easy to use. Big buttons that were accidentally hit frequently changing the time from 24hr to AM/PM. Also missed leap year, and does not have a month displayed, but these are minor issues.Still a huge Casio fan, but just not a fan of this particular watch. Check out other Casio's like the Waveceptor, they're amazing for just a little more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"Nice product, easy to use and set. I like the little dial in the upper left corner of the screen which tells you if you an in the AM or PM or using the stopwatch. It's a convenient feature. The backlight is a major plus! I found that the women's version of this kind of watch does not compare to the men's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Everyday Watch","review":"I didn't buy mine from Amazon but I thought I'd submit a review here nonetheless. This has been a great everyday watch for me. I'm a warehouse manager and I've worn this watch to work everyday for the past 2 years. To steal another companies catch phrase \\"it takes a licking and keeps on ticking\\". I've never had a problem with it and I've only just replaced the original band 2 weeks ago. I couldn't find a Casio replacement strap so I had to go with a Timex (plastic) that was very close but with not quite as nice a feel. At this excellent price it's almost better to buy a new one versus replacing the strap but it's been so good to me I just couldn't bear to throw it away before it's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Case","review":"The watch runs fine, with all the features I want. Only one problem. Approximately 10 days after receiving and wearing the watch, a portion of the watch case broke. A rather crucial portion -- the small area where the pin that holds the band is attached. In trying to follow Amazon's rules for returning (or repairing) the watch, I recieved time-consuming run-arounds, including countless attempts to reach a live person (\\"All operators are busy assisting other customers, so please call back.\\") ... first from Ace (the Distributor), who referred me to Casio, who referred me to their repair center, who referred me to their local repair center. I'm still waiting, approx. 2 weeks later, for a call back from the local guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Watch","review":"I was looking for a watch that had large numbers, a lit face, and was rugged and inexpensive. This Casio met all my needs. There is a large easy to find button to illuminate the face. It is easy to read, night or day. The finish on the watch isn't affected by daily use. I ride a motorcycle, and exposure to the elements composes part of the regular use. Bugs wash right off. I have had other Casio watches and they last for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I bought the same watch 11 years ago and it is still running today on the same battery.

In fact, one menu item didn't even play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incest as a Sweet Candlelit Experience!","review":"Excuse me, but didn't anyone except one reviewer here notice that this novel revolves about repeated and \\"soul-robbing\\" incest between Sarah Polley's character and her father, which is why she lies during the deposition. The Pied Piper of Hamblin that she reads throughout the film is a metaphor for incest her central horror and concern. The candlelit scene between her and her father implies mutual consent which derails the book's ending where she lies to get back at her father. Read the book where incest is shown to be the horror that it is. To show it as romantic is irresponsible both to the book's intention and to the actual experience of incest. Oh well, just underline the Ego in Egoyan and you get the picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This movie was rated highly, but... I found it completely boring, I didn't like or even care about one character. I watched to the end just to see what happened and ended up just shaking my head.

Perhaps, but i still think this movie sucked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREME WASTE OF TIME AND CELLULOID.","review":"This movie is voyeristic, empty, and completely lacking in emotion. For a movie that should be full of sadness (children die in tragic bus accident, people cheat on their partners, a man molests his daughter, etc.), there is no true emotion. We aren't connected to the characters. As much as the viewer should care about these horrible things, this movie is so disgustingly voyeristic and uncaring, that we feel absolutely nothing (except anger at the filmmaker). The best thing about it is the numerous shots of snowscapes, symbolizing the vast emptiness of it all. The way that the molestation is dealt with is sickening, with the daughter being portrayed as a precocious, sweet, young thing who wants it. Then, the big finale is equally awful: she (quote) gets him back, as if the manner in which she does this is at all a real revenge. I don't recommend that anyone put themselves through this two hour torture. There are so many other more worthwhile movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please wake me when the film is over","review":"At the end of The Sweet Hereafter, I had tears in my eyes- tears of boredom. I would like to use this forum to point out the parts of the film that annoyed me. First of all, the incest scene is ridiculous. The young girl is not raped by her father, rather, they make love together. Candles? Why? It was like a scene out of a cheap romance novel. That scene actually made incest look sweet. The father looked like he was his daughter's age! Second, did anyone else notice that the bus driver had a Minnesotan accent while she drove the bus, but not any other time in the movie? Did the director forget about that? The book is a lot better than the movie, and the book isn't that great. The lawyer in the book is much more energetic, the incest is what it should be, dirty and immoral, and the scenes were drawn out way too much in the movie. Of course, what do I know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE 'HEREAFTER' HAD BETTER BE SWEET, TO MAKE UP FOR THIS...","review":"This is an astonishingly disappointing film. The 'hereafter' had better be particularly sweet if you've had to sit through this inordinately pretentious and endless film. Good casting, but impossibly, Ian Holm delivers a genuinely lousy performance - mucking his way through this endless contrivance with accents ranging from Bronx taxi driver, to Jewish deli owner, to South African gem dealer - he's totally lost here and, clearly, making alimony payments by appearing in this ridiculous movie. I suspect the original book is far better. A terrible and arrogant script. Avoid this at all cost....."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best DVDs You Can Buy","review":"What a great DVD. The movie, of course, is superb: one of the most beautiful, haunting films ever made. But what makes this title such a stand-out is all the care that went into producing the DVD. The soundtrack is recorded in 5 channels, and is remarkably more effective than that of many action films. In addition, the title is loaded with such goodies as an audio commentary by the director and author, interviews with the cast, and a panel discussion of the film. Normally one would have to buy from Criterion in order to get such a lovingly-made title. Thankfully, we can save our money this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word...masterpiece","review":"In brief: The best film of 1997, and an excellent primer for first time exposure to Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan. A fantastic film in its own right, the DVD, part of New Line's Platinum Series, features a commentary track with Egoyan and novelist Russell Banks, Q & A with members of the cast, Canadian and American trailers, a Charlie Rose interview and more. For those who enjoyed the film in theaters and VHS, if you have not explored the New Line DVD, you are doing yourself a grave disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Atom Egoyan is making the best films of a generation.

After seeing it I couldn't figure out for the life of me WHY anyone had made it, and who would like it. Lots of very drawn out scenes with long periods of silence between dialog, and nothing made sense--the daughter making out with her dad? The lawyer trying to get rich off of the townspeople? No redeeming qualities WHATSOEVER! The worst movie I've ever seen, second only to _What Dreams May Come_ (and no, I am not an insensitive lout who doesn't like thoughtful movies. This one just had no point, made no sense, and bored me to tears!)I'd give this one zero stars if such a thing were within my power. I didn't just feel apathetic about it--I hated it. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deafeningly Dull","review":"While this film may suit the taste of many a cinematophile, to me it was terribly dull. The story itself was interesting enough, but the pacing was painfully slow and the cinematography was oddly \\"flat.\\" The director and the screenplay failed to catch my interest at all; it was all I could do not to fast-forward through it. The film is just not suited to everyone's taste. Some like it a great deal; other people like me hated it.

This film is one of my favorites of all time and after fourteen years it drives me loonie tunes how many viewers/reviewers did not GET this film so here goes: Billy Ansel's late wife was actually his daughter. Nicole realized this the night before the accident when Billy gave Nicole his late wife's clothes which she outgrew. This was brought up later in the motel room when Billy's lover brings up the sweater which Nicole was wearing during the accident.The reason Nicole lied: To get even with her father and as an act of forgiveness to Billy.Nicole understood why the accident happened (it was Billy's punishment) and that Billy had suffered enough. This was also a round about way of forgiving her father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual & unique","review":"THE SWEET HEREAFTER is a very difficult film to evaluate. It is more of a character study (as are all of Egoyan's films) than a traditional plot driven narrative, though there obviously is a narrative.Most of the story of the bus accident (the \\"narrative\\"), interestingly enough (and quite characteristically of Egoyan), is withheld from the audience. The aftermath of such a crisis, however, is given screen time in its place. In this way Egoyan sets this, and all of his films, apart from others: by exposing the \\"gaps\\" within any given story, by exploring the unstated and uncharted emotions in subtle --and some say anti-climactic-- ways.This film displays Egoyan's brilliance and originality as a director, even though I believe it is his worst film to date. (You can imagine what I think of his other films.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful!!","review":"I saw this movie after I had read about it in a list of 100 daring movies.

On top of it all, I am an exceptionally hard bitten movie viewer.When I started this film in the video machine I had spilled an ice cube on the kitchen floor. When I had gotten through the spell that this movie wove, the cube had long been melted. Atom Egoyan had me riveted to the spot with excellent story telling, casting, acting, plot presentation and timing like no one else.Of all the movies I have ever seen, this one is at the top of my list. I am scared to see it again because it could not be more special than the first time through.Excellent excellent from every point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most pretentious movies I have ever seen","review":"I saw this movie for a film studies class at the university I attend. It was absolutely horrible. The characters are stereotypical and cliched. The writing is shallow and at times overbearing. The story itself arrogantly forces the audience to believe that they are viewing a \\"profound work.\\" Instead, the movie does not go into the utter devastation that the town faced by losing its children, but shows the \\"seedy\\" underbelly of white suburbia. Seems more suitable for an after school special than an award winning movie. The only reason it got one star was because of the use of complex crosscutting and the subjunctive narrative style. That's it. Not worth seeing, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Find","review":"This book is an excellent read. There are places that are difficult to read - not because of poor writing, but because of the nature of the subject matter. The author manages to keep the tension rising throughout the trial of a man accused of murdering a white man who allegedly commmitted a racially-motivated crime in the 60s. But did he, indeed, do it?This book is well written, well plotted, with vivid imagery. The subject matter is unique in a fiction setting, the trial has the feel of the real thing, and the outcome, while not unexpected, leaves the reader pondering if the accused was really the murderer and intelligent enough to get away with it or merely the instrument of the murder.This is the author's first work of fiction, and it will be interesting to see where he goes with his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption ,By Any Means Necessary","review":"Jeff Stetson has completed the path started by Ralph Ellison's \\" The Invisible Man', Guy Johnson's \\"Standing At The Scratch Line\\",Mr. Steton has completed the story with \\" Blood onthe Leaves \\".

The writing is superb, the characters are realistic, and the plot moves with a cadence that lets the reader experience the action and contemplate the tension that rises during the story. Stetson blends real events from past with fiction to produce a very engaging and suspenseful story. Professor Martin Matheson, the main character in this novel, is a complex literary creation whose desires and motivations make the reader consider many things like right and wrong, justice, revenge, and moral responsibility.

This is a great product, it really has no fishy taste--and it produces no fishy-tasting burps, which is another problem common to fish oil softgels.

The stories are cliched, and pretty much no good. The worst story of all was the Christmas Cache. It had nothing to do with Christmas, and barely had a mystery to it.

Complex scientific observations, from concrete to esoteric, are made accessible to the untrained. This renders the ideas he presents all the more intriguing. The book is a page-turner. It is also thought provoking. My personal copy is marked with notes of things that came to mind during the read, which is atypical for me when reading for pleasure. I would (and have) recommend(ed) this book to numerous people and have purchased copies for some as well. Virtually anyone can enjoy it as it has elements of so many things, from a story of rags-to-riches, to the impact of Mahatma Gandhi on India and the world, to spirituality, to the scope and limits of modern science. It also sparks the imagination. In all, a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"code name God","review":"i really liked this book a lot.be honest i didnt think that it is gonna be that GOOD.i highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Code Name God","review":"This book is thoroughly engrossing, an intensely powerful life story and a true joy to read. Its evocative power was gravitational - it floored me. This is one of the most important and meaningful works of non-fiction that I've read. I believe with the right exposure it will become a best seller.The pace was perfect. No matter how fast I was moving at the time, the pace was like a delicious molasses for my mind, catching me, forcing me to slow down and enjoy the journey. I had to take breaks just to savor and digest. I didn't want the book to end. There were so many juicy nuggets throughout.Dr. Bhaumik has taken some very complex concepts from both the scientific and spiritual worlds, thrown them into a cosmic pot, stirred them up, seasoned it with delicious nuggets of his own and served it up on a simple, yet profound, elegant and lyrical plate with great insight and inspiration as garnish. This book could conceivably change the way people view the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you pay more than $7 per section please request dinner","review":"Folks, please be aware that this press steel track usually sells for Far Less than $100/section.

I practice mindfulness and loving compassion to my current capacity and really appreciate her opening herself up to the raw, nasty parts of existence & her experiences that MUST be experienced if we're going to get off the cushion and live the ideas.

One line which hit right to the core of my \\"worrier self\\" was: \\"Start worrying...details to follow.\\" She then proceeded to explain that we are conditioned to worry even before we know what we should be worrying about.

It is a tough concept for me as I find self-love challenging and think it's a problem which many people have, and she really hit this nerve right at the start.

Freud infantalizes the human being, scorning the breathtaking gifts of the human for instead seeing the human, like himself, as a bundle of Victorian/ Viennese repressions and fuedalisms. If the author had stated his opinions, and they are opinions, not facts... his supposings about ancient humans are rank speculation at best for instance... and not built them on Freud's passe notions which are ungrounded and unproven, the book would have been credible at least as the author's imaginings about what might have been/occured/ been structured in human psyches long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph!","review":"Wow, bad movies don't get much more entertaining as Frankenfish, the tale of genetically-engineered superfish reigning terror on the inhabitants of a swamp.

Other reviews here give a more-than-adequate summation of the silly plot, but my \\"bad movie\\" pal and I spent most of our time counting the decapitations and remarking on how remarkably bad the monster effects are. The director wisely showcased the title creature only in very dark, quick, jerky shots to minmize how stupid and unconvincing it looks. I was halfway expecting a foam rubber puppet or latex mockup to take over the monstering duties in closeups or other shots, but apparently that would have run into money.

But, just because it's not as bad as the title, doesn't mean it's good.This movie belongs in a Bad Bayou Movie Double Feature with Tobe Hooper's \\"Crocodile\\". The DVD cover boasted \\"From the director of Spawn!\\" Now, is that supposed to be a good thing?

The roles are your typical characters, the hippie/stoners, the crazy vet, the undervalued employee and the mean boss. The script even went as far to make the \\"mean boss\\" have some of the meanest lines you would ever hear, so that you would cheer for him to be killed by the monster.

I have very thick wavy hair and the John Frieda product was perfect for volume and actually curled my hair. The Bumble and Bumble added texture, but weighed my hair down. It actually pulled the wave out of it. It left my hair very knotted and tacky feeling. My biggest issue with this product and the reason for this review was washing it out. I had to wash several times and use a massive amount of conditioner to do so. I lost so much hair from combing the tangles out WITH the conditioner still in my hair. As I am writing this 20 minutes later my scalp is still tender. Buyer beware! Especially those with wavy, curly or thick hair!

Also falls off the little tabs on wide screen laptops. Small stick-on tabs do not hold it in place very well because the plastic sheet is thick and heavy, thus folding away from the screen in the middle and falling through. I had to add additional tabs at the top as well to prevent this and made removing it annoying. So either you install more than enough tabs and live with it or install as suggested and it may fall off when you close the lid. I also suggest getting the more expensive GOLD reflective model, it seems to work better for \\"lookie-loos\\".

Most conspicuously, the final scene, a poignant one featuring Nancy Price and Michael Redgrave, is gone, replaced by a shot of storm clouds with some highfalutin narration from Lionel Barrymore. Also, his portentous narration has been tacked onto the montage of miners gathering for a possible strike, all of this totally foreign to Reed's style.I love this film and was anxious to see it again, but watching this DVD left me feeling disappointed and angry. My hope is that Criterion might release this along with other early Reed in an Eclipse edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful transfer - is this a bootleg?","review":"The actual film is very good, but the transfer on this DVD is rather horrible.

Visual artifacts are everywhere and there is poor resolution and muffled sound. The actual DVD is a DVD-R and there are no menus or chapter stops of any kind. No copyright notice either, although I do not think this film is in the public domain. The product description is what is printed on the back cover, with the incomplete sentence the same. It simply stops abruptly. Synergy Entertainment seems to be located in someone's bedroom, with this DVD-R produced in small numbers.

Gerald Schlabach's paper on \\"just policing\\" is the focus of the discussion. Schlabach is looking for ways to hold Catholics more accountable to the rigors of just war thinking, and hold Mennonites more accountable for actively promoting peace, not simply refraining from violence. In responses by Joe Capizzi and Denny Weaver, Schlabach's proposal is vigorously criticized from both Catholic and Mennonite perspectives. Schlabach responds with clarity and vigor. This book should not be regarded as the final word on the subject, but the opening of a debate that needs to happen. Catholics need to stop regarding the just war tradition as a rubber stamp for whatever violence the state perpetrates. Mennonites need to do more to promote peace than simply refuse to participate in war.

Conservatives, especially religous conservatives with a Reformed understanding will love it. Liberals will hate it because it does not confirm their world view assumptions. The chapter on Abraham Lincoln is also a must read for civil war buffs. It gives truth where others perpetuate myth. The chapters on Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, and Teddy Roosevelt are useful contrasts to today's Democrat and Republican surrenders to big government vs. limited government and emotional and sentimental appeal vs truth, logic and real fairness. The chapter on Kennedy is fair, but alarming. Only the chapter on Bill Clinton is a bit of a let down. It is must reading for Conservatives of all types.

A number of the subjects reviewed clearly illustrate the dilemma of American culture - pragmaticism at the sacrifice of ideals higher and more substantive than the needs of the moment. Judeo-Christian ethic, the core of our history, is brought to light in a very real manner. Political history students of all ages will benefit by his illustrations and analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in propaganda","review":"Written in the transition from Clinton to Bush, Olasky does here what Olasky does best: puff political conservatism in the name of religious conservatism. Andrew Jackson is a Christian hero. Abraham Lincoln is a deistic big government guru who happened to win a war. Bill Clinton is an unChristian fake. If you are a World magazine subscriber, you'll love this book as it is editorializing with a thin veneer of history. There are, though, even among conservative thinkers, much better books to study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olasky needs to rethink what is Moral and Christian","review":"Olasky may be the editor of the World, but he is either ignorant of history or what it means to be a Christian. Jackson was one of the most imoral presidents in American history. His actions towards Native Americans is deplorable. No man responsible for such atrosities is either a Christian or moral in my book. God save our nation from such leaders. While men such as Clinton are morally reprehensible, they are not responsible for the supression of an entire race of people. Perhaps Christianity and our nation would be beter served by a morality that reflected the teachings of Christ. A morality that values all humanity. Christ died for all mankind, not just white Europeans. Needless to say what Olasky views as Christian and moral is far from the biblical standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"would give it negative stars if possible!","review":"The writer is extremely one sided and inaccurate in his portrayal of various presidents' moral substance. One of the worst portrayals is Jackson. He believes that he was moral because he read the Bible daily and was against big government. He doesn't believe Jackson's Indian policy (Trail of Tears among other incidences)should be held against him. In fact, he even puts some of the blame for the Trail of Tears on the Cherokee. The entire book contained similar rewriting of history.

Otherwise, you most likely have a preconception of the artist (even if unconsciously done) and a comparison will be made.When listening to One Quiet Night, forget that it is Metheny and ask yourself if you like the music. If you do, your ears are the judge. It won't be Metheny's history, past records, past record labels or the \\"direction\\" you think Metheny should be going that you will hear, it will be the music on the CD.

This album finds him playing completely solo (a style I enjoy myself) and nothing is missing. Especially nice to hear Keith Jarrett's My Song played on guitar. His improvised pieces are wonderfully constructed and shows just how compositional he thinks even while improvising. As the the title implies it is a very mellow and beautiful album, reminiscient of The Missouri Sky album w/ Charlie Haden.Also the use of the baritone guitar with a 'Nashville' tuning gives it a deeper and more resonant sound enabling low bass notes and high trebles to be combined in ways not possible on a regular guitar.In other words, I Dig It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, pleasant album - vintage Metheny","review":"What else would one expect from Pat? My only complaint, if one could call it that, was that the same guitar (and perhaps the same tuning) was used in every recording. Anyone who has heard Pat play on a Nylon string guitar knows a certain beauty that shines thru when he performs on that particular instrument. I do believe that he will go down as one of the best guitarist in the history of the instrument and with recordings like this one, it's easy to see why. Not only are his compositions stellar, the performances themselves are truly stunning.

Twenty minutes later, I killed the DVD and replayed PM's beguiling treatment of Nora Jones' 'Don't Know Why'; then I needed to check the harmonies on 'Ferry Cross the Mersey'; then compare 'last Train Home' witht he original ensemble version.

It's the \\"In Death\\" series by J.D. Robb. It will take you into the futuristic/murder mystery/romance genre, but don't be put off by the futuristic aspect of the books. Romance dominates. The chemistry between the hero and heroine -- very much like that of Jack and Amanda in the five-star Suddenly You-- is strong enough to have accounted for something like eight or nine books so far with the couple (Eve and Roarke) as the focus. One piece advice: Start at the beginning of the series with \\"Naked in Death,\\" and read the books in order. I promise you, you won't be able to put them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I bought this book because it was on a suggested read list from Amazon.com. It was terrible. The writing is bland except when it comes to the sex scenes, which happen every couple of pages. The sex is almost revoltingly graffic and borderline smut. The characters seem to have few facial expressions: Frowning or smiling. Amanda is always speaking \\"tartly\\" as if it's the only word that the author could come up with.

However, the rest of the book was disappointingly light-weight, and it began to resemble Dreaming of You (one of my favorite books) too much. (independent woman writer, ambitious man from low background). If she had rounded out the supporting characters and taken a bit more time in the later scenes, I'd have forgiven her and stacked it next to Dreaming.

I enjoy books that have good dialogue, interesting scenarios/premises, and just generally everything that this book had going for it. The interactions between Jack and Amanda were nice. I liked the part where he called her a \\"little coward\\" and gathered her close. Since reading this book, I have purchased all of the others by Lisa Kleypas that are available and am seriously contemplating purchasing some of the out-of-print books.

I have to say that I find Kleypas's work to be improving--not getting flat at all if this book is any indication! The characters are intelligent, the plot is innovative, and the romance is engaging without ever becoming sappy. I will say, though, that the sex scenes are NOT for the faint of heart.

I didnt laugh or cry i didnt feel any type of suspense which is unusual of Lisa Klepyas to not put in. I also didnt feel as though Jacks Love was sincere to me it all seemed like lust all the way to the end. And Amanda.. welll... she had her good moments.Overall i guess its a story you can read if you wanna waste a few hours.. days.. but i wouldnt buy it and keep it on my shelf.Sorry Lisa.. but i will continue reading your stories you have written much much better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy but still a very nice read","review":"- All the chichees used here fit very well together or are beautifully merged into context.- This book had a good beginning.

I have no idea why so many words are required for a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing......","review":"The most fascinating thing about this novel is that the guy is younger than the girl. I mean it's one of the fantasies for an older women to marry a younger man. I kind of thought the problems between the two lovers were not strong enough for to keep them apart for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the average historical romance","review":"The thing I liked the most about this book was that the heroine was already established, self sufficient, and appreciated her independence. Even better: she's still a kind of shy person but sucks it up and speaks her mind.The character descriptions gave really nice insight and actually made them seem more like real people and less of the typical romance genre stock characters. Though there were some predictable moments, I found it charmingly realistic and I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suddenly You","review":"I liked both heroine and hero in this story but never really cared about them. The story did kind of amble along with no real purpose but it was still somewhat entertaining. Amanda constantly moaning about not being attractive was a bit repetitive and annoying. I felt that she was constantly fishing for compliments. The ending was very weak. They seemed to have lost their chemistry by the end despite all the sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A KEEPER....","review":"I generally enjoy Kleypas' work, but I thought that her last two books were very flat. In \\"Suddenly You\\" the sex scenes were steamy, but the characters were so flat and the storyline was so bland that I didn't have a whole lot of interest in finishing the book. The chubby heroine and her fairly younger man theme got quite tiresome. The last books that I did enjoy from Kleypas was \\"Dreaming of You\\" and \\"Someone To Watch Over Me.\\" You can save your money and take a pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was very nearly 5 stars...I really liked it!","review":"It was sexy, romantic, and original. I could have done without the anal play and raspberry scene towards the end of the book, but maybe that's just me.:)I would highly recommend this book to any romance reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story line?","review":"This was my first Lisa Kleypas book, and I'm not sure that I'll be seeking out another one. The plot of this story was missing, and in its stead was too much panting and kissing. The character development was non-existant as well-- I could have cared less what happened to either of them. In fact, the only character I liked was Uncle Hartley, but he had almost no role in the story. I would have appreciated fewer intimate scenes in place of a story line that held my attention. I repeatedly put the book down and had to force myself through the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh, not a winner for me","review":"Sorry. As much as I love MOST of Lisa Kleypas' books, this one is awful. I personally found it impossible to like Jack at all. And the sex scenes were positively cringeworthy; what is sexy about a man inserting fruit into your vajayjay? Nothing at all. Horrible story; none of it made sense and none of it was sexy or romantic. Wow, I can't even believe this mess came from the mind of my favorite romance novelist. Truly disappointing. There was not a single likeable person anywhere in the book. Yuck. Save your dough and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I loved the initial premise of this book, but toward the end, it dissolved into cliche. I really thought I'd found something new in the romance genre, but alas, it's not this. My first Kleypas, my last Kleypas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Left Out","review":"Suddenly You is about a very independent women named Amanda and an eager, ambitious, go getter named Jack, they both knew what they wanted and went after it. The relationship between Amanda and Jack was exciting, they both learned from each other and got what they wanted from each other. The story told the history of Amanda and Jack and how they ended up at the points in their lives and that is why I liked the Book, it left no questions unanswered. I think that the fact the book was well written and I didn't feel that I was left wondering, who, what, when, why, and how made it enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"IRRESISTIBLE","review":"I have not yet finished reading the book, and I don't know how it will end,but I can't put it down. I can't wait to see how this will end and that is the only reason I would not give it a5 star rating. I just wanted that make sure I told everyone about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, hot, hot!","review":"Wow! Still sitting in front of the fan to cool off after reading SUDDENLY YOU, the first book I've read by Lisa Kleypas. On a sensuality rating betweet 1 and 10 I'd have to give this one a 22! The storyline has been described so much on this book there's not much I can add. True, the romance segements are steamy, but the storyline supports the love scenes and the characters of Amanda and Jack are described so thoroughly it's almost possible to \\"see\\" them. Ms. Kleypas has become a new favorite author of mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, NO. If you must, read it to finish the trilogy.","review":"I picked up Reap the Wind eagerly, having thoroughly enjoyed the first two books, to complete the trilogy of The Wind Dancer series. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I give it two stars for several reasons. I didn't find a connection to the characters (even though they were more modern than in the other two books). There are pieces of this book that are bawdy and frankly, a turn-off. Not something you look for in a romance novel, historical or not. Not quite sure what happened here. The first two, especially Storm Winds, were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is horrible! I'm not sure why it is rated so high. I have not finished the book yet. I am having to force myself to finish it. Thank goodness I am checking this book out from the library and did not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE Iris Johansen","review":"but not crazy about her 'period' pieces. I know this was the 'recursor' to The Wind Dancer, which I loved, but - just not my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reap the Wind","review":"This book was sent to me in very good condition and quickly. It is an interesting, suspenseful book. I recommend to read the first two books of the wind dancer before reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end.","review":"If this had been the first book by Iris Johnason I had read it would have been the last. I have read many of her books. This one is at the bottom of the pile! It was to long and drawn out. I thought it would never end. Several times I almost didn't finish it but thought it would pick up at some point. I was just boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"FULL OF WIND!","review":"I just couldn't get into this book that characters are flat and annoying. The girl Catlin comes off as a spoiled brat and Alex as conceded and self important. Also as another reviewer wrote the cover art of the White House HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY!!! This in itself is highly annoying; add that to the story which moves along slowly full of needless pomp and stuffing. I've read several of her books and this one will be the last I ever attempt by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reap the Wind","review":"I ordered this book on 11/5. As of today, 12/6, I have not received it. Very disappointed.

Travis and Nora are three-dimensional and believable, they don't fit any stereotypes, which is a common problem in most horror fiction. the book is fast-paced, suspenseful, and never boring. And as for Einstein, well what more can I say? I LOVE EINSTEIN!!! The perfect choice for those who are new to Dean Koontz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller! A Classic! You'll Never Put It Down!","review":"Watchers is a great book. The characters are so real! Nora Roberts and Travis Cornell are so realistic. Dean Koontz is a master story teller and I can't wait for all the rest of his books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie!!","review":"This book was amazing. The first Dean Koontz I ever read, which got me hooked in the first place. One gripe though: Who ever adapted the book for the movie ought be shot! I settled in with the video for the screen adaptation of one of my favorite all-time books, and was horrified with the results... My thoughts folks? Read the book, and stay *well clear* of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz's best","review":"He may re-work the same idea many times in his different novels (Mr. Murder seemed WAY too much like Hideaway) and use some seriously 2 dimensional characters in many of them, but with Watchers, Dean Koontz tells such an original story with such rich detail that it stands out. It still isn't as deeply layered as some of Stephen King's (not all of King is untouchable, as Cujo sucked) but Koontz really tells a compelling story with Watchers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT his best!!!!!","review":"I was prompted to read this book only after reading all the rave reviews here. In my opinion this is not one of Dean Koontz's finest efforts. Not nearly as suspenseful as some of his others. However, I have really enjoyed some of his other titles (i.e. Intensity) and will continue to read his work"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLW 2010 Summer Book Club Review","review":"Dang. Maybe my expectations were too high, because I'm already a DK fan (his Frankenstein was awesome) and I know that Watchers is one of his most acclaimed works. Regardless, I just couldn't get into this one. I kept expecting edge-of-your-seat suspense, but I found my mind wandering as I read descriptions of wooded areas and such. I finally couldn't bring myself to pick the book back up after 50 pages, so I decided to give up. I'm pretty sure the fault here is mine - I am so easily bored, and perhaps I didn't have the patience to wade through the details to get to the meat of the story. But I did give up nonetheless, so the best I can rate this book is two stars. Sorry Mr. Koontz - please don't send any monsters after me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Book I Regret Finishing","review":"I wanted to know the ending, but reached that 3 days ago, yet I'm feeling lost now that I've finished it. A great read that put's you in such harmony with the protagonists that you feel a part of their story. I loved it and wish the author had seen fit to produce a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd all-time favorite Koontz book","review":"This was the second book of his that I read (too many years ago to mention) and it is still my 2nd favorite of his books. Too bad the movie(s) were stinkers and didn't do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner for sure.","review":"The cutest most intelligent dog you could imagine. The most relentlessly vicious mutant monster. And the monster that created them both. Add some average people and it makes for quite a story.Some 20 years ago this book helped to turn me twards Libertarianism. Thanks Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-Movie Book","review":"First of all, I am astounded at the five-star ratings for this novel. It was like reading a screenplay for a made-for-TV movie for the USA Network. I could expand on my criticism for the book, but its taken up enough of my time already. No point in letting it waste more. Readers, be warned: Not everybody found \\"Watchers\\" to be a five-star read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a book for dog lovers","review":"I love dean koontz, but this was a real dissapointment. The whole book is about the compainionship of a dog and the climax it works toward is a 1 page ending without delivering. Unless you are a dog lover, STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great I am sure if you are allowed to read it","review":"I love Dean Koontz books. I have several hard cover and paperbacks of his books. And during my recent visit to the US I bought a Kindle in order to buy the Kindle version of his books and others. How disappointed I was when, after getting a sample of this book to my Kindle, I was not allowed to purchase the book!! Why - because I live in Asia!! I am just so surprised and disappointed. Do the authors know about this? And why did I bother to buy a Kindle if I cannot get the books I want!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Dean Koontz Fan","review":"This book & author was highly recommended to me by an Aunt who is also a D.K. fan. I was instantly taken in from the first page & when Einstien{pardon any mis-spellings}entered the picture, I fell in love with him, Travis & Nora. The carefully well thought out well written words makes you forget that you're reading a book because Dean Koontz was able to make me feel like I'm the characters. I smiled, laughed, & even cried @ certain parts. Dean Koontz has a wonderful & gifted talent & a unique way with words. \\"Watchers\\" is my #1 favorite D.K. book so far. I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who enjoy dogs,action,thrillers,heart racing,suspense,heart warming, with a dash of romance all in one book, then this book is for you. Happy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"koontz best","review":"This was my first Koontz book to read it was suggested to me by my mother, and I fell in love with this book, I have read it so many times, that I will have to by another book because mine is falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Great read and wonderful story. I highly reccomend. I bought the book just because I like Koontz and love Golden Retrievers (which was on the cover). I was super happy when it turned out to be my favorite book by Koontz so far. I like how he draws you in with different characters and there lives by chapter. It's even better when those lives connect to each other. I always find that I want to focus on one or two people and there lives. Then when they connect I get super excited. This book was no different and I loved it. Plus what can be better then a thrilling story revolving around a dog : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to read it again!","review":"Read this years ago and loved it so gave it another go. This is still one of Dean Koontz best books. What a journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz's best work","review":"A touching and perfectly-paced story with a very memorable protagonist in Einstein, the golden retriever. I never get tired of re-reading this book and I always get a little choked up at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"It is a sci-fi type book, but if you are a dog owner/lover this is a great story to read. Open your mind and let the true possibilities of your dog's intelligence shine through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"Best one so far! Made me cherish my dog even more. She won't be like Einstein, but she's a smart one too. Very protective. Will read again and again. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"I never read books twice, but I think I may have read Watchers at least five times. I love this book. It is fiction, however, if you have ever loved golden retrievers, you will appreciate the dog, Einstein, that stars in this one. The story is easy to follow and keeps your suspense so that you do not want to put it down. I suggest this as a must read-it is one of Dean Koontz's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This Koontz book was my absolute favorite. I've read almost all the Michael Crichton books, and Watchers scared me more than any of them! Defenitley should read it. I study bioengineering, and this is the kind of thing that freaks you out with the possibilities of DNA manipulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Reading!","review":"I received Watchers as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend's mother. She had read the book and knew I was an animal lover who would enjoy the book. Well, I did alot more than enjoy the book! It was excellent. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it scared the pants off me, and it still has me in awe. I have read Koontz books before, but this was by far the best. Anyone who loves animals and is a sensitive soul will appreciate the underlying ideas in this book. Hard to put down, so make sure you have plenty of time to devote to the intricate characters in this book. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite book after 20 years","review":"I have read all of Koontz's books and Watchers was my first, 20 years ago. This book has it all!1 have yet to find a book that I can still remember so well, which is because of all the emotions the book puts you through. Of course, I have read it more than once, and that is something I can only say about 2 or 3 others in my life, and I have read constantly (meaning I always have a book, or 2, in the process of reading) since I started going to the library at 11 years old and started with \\"Little Women\\". There are really few books that make enough impression, that you remember them years later. I am now 58, so saying Watchers is my favorite book after all these years is saying a lot! I recommend it to everyone and everybody has loved it. I love seeing how many people have passed it on to their children, who in turn say it is their favorite, as does my daughter. This is Koontz's best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good....4.5","review":"I liked this book, the only problem was that I kinda knew what was going to happen around halfway through the book, although I kept on reading. Honestly its a preatty easy read, I read it in a few days. Don't expect anything out of this world, but you'll still find it enjoyable. The dog is so cute, I want one. This is in my top 5 list of \\"fun\\" books to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Koontz","review":"I've ever read. Fast paced and fun, could hardly put it down.

Planning on reading more of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you spend your money on nothing else get this book","review":"dean koontz presents a wonderful tale of suspense, horror drama, and even some science fiction in a wonderful book definitly should go down as a classic it all starts off a guy who is your ordinary joe taking a trip to the mountians on his birthday if i remember correctly. on this trip travis (the ordinary joe) meets a dog who at first appears kinda screwed up but it turns out that the dog is really smart it even understands english and can communticate with travis... but the dog isn't alone... the dog escaped from a labratory along with the dog there is this thing that hates the dog a \\"perfect soilder\\" created to kill and it's target is the dog. that's all i can say without spoiling the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchers","review":"My favorite of all the Koontz novels. Like many of his readers, I wish for a sequel, but like Mr Koontz I fear it might leave me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating throughout","review":"4th time I've read it ans sure I will do so again.

I could visualize every detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollercoaster ride","review":"This book is such a rollercoaster ride. It takes you from intense fear to compassion to frustration...awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Dean Koontz book ever!!","review":"This book is a must read for any Dean Koontz fan. If you like animals (dogs in paticular) you will love this! It captured my imagination like no other book I've read. It will make you scared but also make you laugh and most of all cry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is by far the best book I have ever read!!","review":"This was my first 'Koontz' and I absolutely loved it! Einstein was of course the star of the book. My family still uses his original line \\"home is where the weenies are\\" as a joke.I had my teenagers read it too and they loved it. I grew up in Orange County, CA., so it was even more special for me to read about places I had been."},{"rating":"2","title":"I first read WAn instant classic","review":"When iI first read this book in 1989, I was totally blown away by the story and the characters. It was also my first experience with Dean Koontz but not my last. I've read and re-read this book many times since and I'm happy to say that I've used this book as a gift to introduce many friends to the exciting world of Travis, Nora and escepially, Einstein. What a truly remarkable character Einstein is!This book took me through a wide range of expressions....from laughter when Einstein tears up the flower-bed...to tears when Travis discovers the \\"Fiddle broke\\" message....to compassion for The Outsider\\"s demise.I still get chills whenever I read certain portions of this book. It is definitely Dean Koontz at his best.If I could rate it higher than \\"10\\" I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best Dean Koontz novel","review":"This is the be-all-and-end-all, absolute best Dean Koontz novel! (Lightning is runner-up.) It has everything--pseudoscience, monsters, assassins, great chase scenes, gunplay, love story, a man and his dog, doggy intellect. You'll laugh, you'll cry--and even better--you'll even cry for the monster! Pretty darn cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Einstein is totally loveble, leaves room for a sequel.","review":"The first time I ever saw Watchers was in my parents bookshelf. I could NOT put it down. The retriver is so loveble and gives a certain lightness to the story. The Outsider is a horrendous monster, but you end up feeling sorry for him again. The paid assassin is a nice side story, especially with his \\"gift\\". And with the end I think it leaves a good amount of room for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and heart-pounding thriller!!","review":"\\"Watchers\\" is by far the best book I have ever read. Koontz is outstanding. This book pulls you right in and does't let you out to the very end. I found myself feeling sorry for the dog and the \\"Outsider.\\" I was so in to the book that I feel like I was actully there. I have my own vision of all the characters. It was like watching a movie --but better--."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfuly entertaining, suspensful, sad, funny - everything","review":"\\"Watchers\\" is my all time favorite from Koontz. I laughed out loud numorous times when Einstien did something funny, witty, and intelligent. He was the sweetest dog, and very beleivable. I felt immense pity for The Outsider; he was not asked to be that way, he did not want to kill people, but he had been \\"programed\\" to kill. Nora was wonderful; I was so happy for her when she was no longer a reclues; I was sad when she was. Same goes with Travis. Everything was so wonderful and beleivable. Einstein is defintally the best dog every written in any story! I love him! READ IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best horror novels","review":"This is one of the three or four best modern horror novels. The genre, \\"genetic engineering gone bad\\" is always lots of fun, and Koontz treats it as only a master can. The evil creature even has some wonderful, redeeming features, that are completely unexpected. The intelligent dog reminds one of his early novel \\"Haunted Earth.\\" I envy those of you who have not yet read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise is wasted in Watchers","review":"This isn't Dean Koontz's worst novel, but it is a runner up. The only major confrontation with the outsider was at the end and it ended quite abruptly. For a much better book of of this type of premise, read Fear Nothing and Seize the Night, second and third best of Koontz's novels behind only Phantoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"Upon coming on this book I was searching goodreads for the best ranked horror novel. Unfortunately for me once I start reading a book I can't stop reading it. I would really like to know what was so appealing about this book. That being said I am not particular to genre novels. There is really nothing special about this book except for cliche type scenes and settings, characters, and dramatic effects that are supposed to elicit response. If you actually enjoy literature stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining only in its absurdity","review":"If you're a fan of thoughtful books, stay away from this one. It's ludicrous. Everyone in it is independently wealthy and has nothing better to do than to run around and get into adventures. The dog is overdone, the love story is [bad], the story is overlong, the baboon is just stupid. The only reason I finished it? I HAD to for an English course I took in Horror. Read Richard Matheson if you like Koontz's style. He's a ton better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book was awful! Too unbelieveable and corny at the same time. I'm reading about this \\"magical golden retriever\\", and then happen to look on the back cover only to see the author, mr koonz with a golden retriever! I tell you, I was beside myself! This book also likes to use terms that not only offend me as a human being but also just make me horribly mad. The worst of which was \\"pregger,\\" referring to a pregnant woman. So between this and all of the references to the dog as \\"fur face\\" I just did not enjoy this book. I don't know why I finished this book, but I'm sorry to say I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"As good as a Dan Brown-novel!","review":"I first read this book back when I was 14 or 15 and I remember I loved it.In a fit of nostalgia I bought it for my Kindle, am \\"30%\\" through it, and I actively dislike it! The characters are vacuous, the prose is mediocre, and the plot is like a Dan Brown-novel; zipping from place to place at a hectic pace. Indeed, the last book I actively disliked was also a Dan Brown-novel.Do not buy this book. Unless you like Dan Brown, in which case you probably don't understand any of the words I've just written.It gets two stars, because it's not a Dan Brown-novel, and the lowest rating I can give isn't 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I have been a Koontz fan for years and have read almost all of his books and this still stands at the top of the list. I can't see anyway this book could have been improved. I remember reading it for the first time and thinking \\"I don't want it to end\\" and I didn't. I wish I could unread it so I could read it for the first time again. I envy friends when they read it for the first time because I can't experience it new again. I can't explain why I love this book so much but I do. The story isn't the most ground breaking story ever but the way Koontz delivers it is what makes the story great. The characters are his best ever and The Outsider is one of a very few villans who I have ever felt bad for.This is an awesome read from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I remember seeing this movie a long time ago and how much I loved it then. I decided to read the book this time around and loved it even more than I remember loving the movie! I recommend this book to everyone, especially if you are a Dean Koontz fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mighty fine book","review":"Ok, first off I noticed some people actually rated this book poorly. Now this is completely nuts because anyone who read the book and has any bit of an imagination was grabbed on the first few pages and not released until the very end. I hated reading with a purple passion, first time I read this book I was skipping a class in school sitting in the library about to take a nap. I heard a girl I knew talking about how she liked this author so I went and looked up Watchers since I was bored out of my mind. Since that day I think I can say I own just about every book Dean Koontz has written except for some he did under pet names. Watchers changed my views and made me realize just how entertaining a good book could be. Awesome book, great characters!here's a final note.............- (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Koontz...yet again","review":"Sometimes saying \\"classic\\" is supposed to mean good things. Not in this case. This is the typical Dean Koontz theme. Bad government labs create mutant good and bad creatures. Overly intelligent dog that somehow is as insightful as humans. It was nice the first two times I read Koontz but frankly he is just too much of a formula writer to be read often. On the rare occassion that he goes beyond this formula it seems ok. Unfortunatly he is pretty much stuck on this theme. God forbid that there were never government labs, Dean would be out of a job."},{"rating":"2","title":"His all-time best","review":"I have read this book of Dean Koontz' so many times that I will soon have to buy another copy. Whenever anyone asks me if I know of any REALLY GOOD books to read, I always tell them of WATCHERS. My daughter, her fiance, their friends all adore Koonts/WATCHERS. I'ts a love story, a thriller and best of all an animal lovers dream come true. Oh how I wish my puppy could talk with me like that and who knows---- maybe someday she will. I really look forward to a new year. Even though it means I'm getting older, it also means a new book by Dean R. Koontz is on its way. I only wish a year was'nt so long. Thanks for so much enjoyment, Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I absolutely loved this book, although at times I found myself skimming past the parts that didn't include Einstein...I think that was because I was so in love with him! This is really a great read, I literally had tears in my eyes at the end of the book because I was so happy in the way that it ended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"This one is a classic. Reminds me of the good old days reading early Stephen King novels. It's a story of friendship and love and monsters and bad guys all wrapped up with a Frankensteinesque bow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"I have read about all of Dean Koontz's books, so he is has not wrote a bad book yet. Some are slow starters and some are alittle long in detail. This book is one of his best. I say everyone should read it because I could not put it down. This is a good book nomatter who you are because when the book is over you are still wanting to know what else happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"I had never read Koontz before picking up The Watchers. Once started, I couldn't put it down. I wasn't surprised at the end to read that it is his favorite book. I had read the reviews on this page which convinced me to buy the book. I'm so glad I did. I think you'll enjoy it too -- even if it's your first book of this genre. It's so much more than mere fantasy/horror. Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an all time favorite.","review":"I loved this book. One of the few I went back to re-read after about 15 years. If you have ever loved a dog, you can\\"t help but wish he could communicate the way this brilliant golden retriever can who is smarter than the people in the book. In addition, the scary parts of the story keep you in suspense beginning to end. Along with many readers (according to Koontz) I have wished for a sequal to this story. Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This book is well written, and gives you enough information to believe the slightly incredible tale. One of the best books I've ever read. I would / do suggest this book to everyone I know.This book is about a woman and man who are brought together by a genetically altered intelligent dog. There is a wide range of characters who people can relate to, their stories are colorful and entertaining till the end.On a side note, the book exlains that there were people looking for the dog everywhere. Including all modes of transportation. And that they wanted to stay close to resolve the situation, rather than flee across the country. It keeps together the core characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good long listen","review":"I listened to this book on a cross country drive and although it had its faults i really enjoyed the book and will listen to it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Dog Lovers","review":"As a dog lover and Dean Koontz fanatic, I absolutely devoured this book. Einstein, Travis and Nora feel like family now. Anyone who has a dog will absolutely adore this fast-paced read. I will never look at my 3 year old pit/lab mix, Anubis, the same way again! I'll always pretend in the back of my mind, that maybe he's the great, great, great, great grandson of Einstein!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Dean K reader","review":"I have never read a DK book.

A few weeks passed before I actually picked it up and read it....and once it was in my hands, I couldn't put it down!!!!!The two main human characters are endearing and you cheer from them from the get-go....the two non-human characters are nothing but sheer genius!!!!!! This book made me laugh, cry, and kept on the edge of my seat so much I practically fell on the floor.This is truly the BEST book I think I've ever read....as Dean Koontz himself puts it....other books I have written are as good, but nothing has been better than Watchers!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Einstein never had it so good ....Koontz is the way","review":"A suspense-filled extravaganza so alive that can only come from the masterful pen of Knootz. Detail so tightly woven together it makes a spectacular read that will leave you satisfied. I spent every waken night reading this fine noval finishing it in 6 days with blood shot eyes. Travis is the protagonist who adopted a golden retriever that will change his life forever awwwwww. The epitomy of man's best friend, it will make you want to get a dog as a pet if you never had one before and i want one NOW. In rescuing a sexy neurotic recluse, they come to find out that there is more then beneath the covers. I will not give away the enjoyable plot like some people in here. Koontz's literary prowess is unmatched in the world of suspenseful horror/thriller. Anyone who never did Knootz would never appreciate man's best friend like he has. Watchers...they are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak premise couldn't hook me from the start.","review":"The biggest thing with getting someone to believe a fantastical plot premise is \\"the hook.\\" Michael Crichton does this best, he gets to to believe that DNA can be be taken from blood in mosquito's encased in amber, genetically re-engineered into living organisms. Once he's got you hooked on the small details, you're mentally ready to accept humans capering about with dinosaurs in the modern day. Koontz just never established his hook in me and I spent the whole book disbelieving what was on the page.Koontz does a pretty decent job of establishing his characters and this is what kept me reading. His pacing is good, he knows what he's doing as a thriller writer, it was just a case of \\"too little too late.\\"I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, but just couldn't get behind this one. My advice, stick to some of his better works like Intensity or Velocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Koontz has done a lot better. I'd recommend \\"The Bad Place\\" or \\"Hideaway\\" as examples of his best horror writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An oddly popular Koontz book I didn't like","review":"Many Koontz fans I know list this book as one of their favorite Koontz novels, but I list it amoung my least favorites.The premise of this book didn't appeal to me, and it just struck me as cartoonish. The book had good build-up, but was anti-climatic.One of the villian characters is quite interesting, however. But, I don't feel he justifies reading the book for. Consider one of Koontz other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly not my genre","review":"I got this book used on audiotape - my first Koontz -- and can listen to almost anything while I am pushing paperwork around the office. My standards are pretty low. I made it through the syrupy opening with the super-clever dog. I didn't mind the pitiable female character who was afraid of her own shadow. But when the serial killer shot a sleeping boy in the head and shuttered with an orgasmic joy, I clicked the tape off and tossed the whole boxed set into the trash. In a world like this, the last thing we need are more inexplicably evil fictional child killers. When I noticed that 500 Koontz fans had rated this novel as top-notch, I got a stomach ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish my puppy was as smart as Einstein!","review":"I have read almost every Dean Koontz book, and this is my all-time favorite. I have read & re-read it over the past few years. Highly recommended! A great read. I didn't want to put it down!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is still the best book I have ever read!","review":"Out of the twenty-three or more Koontz books I have read so far, I have to say this is still the best book of his. I read it when I was down in Orange County for the first time in my life and to know that he was writing of the same county I was in, made it even more horrific. The way he details his characters and setting makes the book that more easy to forget about the real world around you and put yourself into Koontzworld!!!! I recommend this book to anyone that loves Horror and Science-fiction books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is too heartwarming to be a thriller - it made me cry","review":"This is one of the few Koontz books I've read twice (Hideaway being the other I think). Being an animal lover, I adored Einstien and was rather impressed by Dr Keene. All the characters are well developed and the storyline is just awesome. I can't really find the right words for this book, just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a grabber...you hang on till the end.","review":"This book was interesting from the first word thru the last word. Dean Koontz is one of the best authors that have come around. I have every book of his except the last two (intensity,...)I will have those too. This was a great heart warmer and thumper. Einstein was a love and you grew to hate and like the outsider also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me want to sleep with the lights on!","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan and this was one of the best works I've ever read by him, or anyone else for that matter! This book scared me so bad that I would actually look over my shoulder as I turned out the lights and headed to bed....seriously. There have been very few books I've read that have actually scared me but this one did the job! If you're looking for a great book that will keep you turning page after page and hour after hour then this is the book! I stayed up WAY too late reading this:) I don't want to give anything away but what I think I enjoyed the most was Koontz's ability to make me feel sympathy for characters I didn't think I would feel sympathy for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is the best Koontz book I have ever read. It is an oxymoronic heart warming horror novel. I cared deeply for the characters. The dog absolutely broke my heart and I even felt sympathy for the monster which reminds me of when I read Frankenstein. I highly recommend this book even if you are not a fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not plausible? HOW can you be sure?","review":"This is one of the first books I read by Koontz. He's a genius!Watchers has all the elements of a good story. It's fast moving, very suspenseful, truly romantic, and filled with adventure. One almost literally cannot put it down.Many say this story is not plausible. People once believed the world was flat, too. How can we be sure?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever Written","review":"I read it again for about the 6th time a few months ago. It still have me enthralled. What other book can say that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story","review":"Another great story by Dean. Full of action and suspense this book is a must read for all of his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCHERS by Dean Koontz","review":"WATCHERS is one of the best novels I've ever read. A thrilling combination of adventure, action, great suspense, awe, respect for the author and his characters, a Cinderella-type romance, adrenalin lifts, empathy, sympathy... Couldn't put it down. And, surprisingly, I even cried for the villain who was so consumed with jealousy and envy. And who could blame him?: he was a victim, as well! Ah, if I could only find more compelling books like this one. If you're a dog lover, you'll love this one. It's one of those rare books that I wish I'd written. My next dog will be a Golden Retriever, in honor of Einstein. Hats off to Dean Koontz, a superb wordsmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornball tripe","review":"Koontz can write a compelling novel, but in this one he \\"writes down\\" to the reader. The major female character is not believable; the romance is corny as the dickens, and the protagonist, Travis Cornell, is not well-developed. The plot is okay, and the monster is pretty monstrous, so I'll give it a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book - very poorly presented... =(","review":"I bought this version (as a gift) thinking it would complete my sister's Dean Koontz hardcover collection nicely - when it arrived I nearly died.Its about the size of a mass market paperback, has cheap printing (text isn't even aligned right on the first 50 pages), and a cover that looks like it was scanned off the real thing and printed on a piece of wet cardboard. It felt so bad that I thought I might damage it just by holding it...Sure, go buy the book yeah but not THIS VERSION!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Travis an elite Delta Force fighting machine? Nora a reclusive beauty? Einstein a Retriever with near-human intelligence? Repeated feedings of chocolate to a dog? Come on. This is a goofy effort from a writer who should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchers by Dean Koontz","review":"If you are fairly intelligent, you won't be very impressed by this book. As others have said, the characters are one-dimensional. The hero is too competent. Koontz is way too klutzy in writing about the hero's relationship with the woman--it will actually make you barf if you've ever known a few real women. The dog and the human stalker are by far the most interesting characters, and they are the reason why you may not be able to put the book down. Koontz does have the ability to make you want to keep reading, and that's why I rate this 2 stars instead of just 1. The story has good flow, but the ending is truly awful: It's way too brief and unsatisfying, and it's far too predictable. What a shame. And I thought, \\"this is it? talk about a banal plot!\\" So an enraged baboon is on the loose--who cares? Even the title is stupid and undecipherable. The whole book is so underwhelming, except for the dog. The dog deserves a miniseries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing experience!","review":"There's nothing like a succesful attempt to free oneself from a pair of police handcuffs, yet this is EXACTLY what one special dog accomplishes in Dean Koontz's WATCHERS. The metaphysical aspects of the expanoria are what makes this novel emit fascination. The mob hitman reminds one of sanctuary hives in the small of France. If the reader does not equate this phenomenom with spacious lanterns, then he is left with oats to fall upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"It takes guts to make a dog the main character of your book. It takes talent to make your reader care. It takes genius to make that dog as witty and engaging a character as Einstein is in Watchers. Dean Koontz is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIPPING!","review":"I say \\"gripping\\" because I can't put the book down. Ordered it through Amazon a little while ago and it's AWESOME! Better than \\"Icebound.\\" If you like Cussler and Clancy you'll love Koontz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Koontz Fan","review":"Koontz fans tell me this is perhaps his best. If that is the case, I am glad I read it first. It will save me the trouble of wasting any more time on the rest of the Koontz offerings. A few great ideas ruined by poor character development and predictable, anti-climatic resolutions. Color me \\"not a fan.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchers - one of Koontz's best!","review":"Watchers is the story about a man and his dog! Sounds simple, right? However, this is an extraordinary dog that we all want to own. This is about a man who bonds with this dog and keeps the bond thru out !The story is a well woven Koontz presentation and my personal favorite! It takes the reader by the hand and that person becomes a part of the drama and the challenges. This is not a book to read on a busy weekend. This is one where the reader has no plans and wants to be entertained.This is a great story with a beautiful animal, a little romance and a great book about how love conquers all!Enjoy-"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, original, compelling book. A definate must-read","review":"Surely on of Dean Koontz's best. A book I never wanted to end! The idea was original and unique, and would appeal to all tastes. Surely there must be a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS ABSOLOUTE BEST - ONE BELONGS IN EVERY LIBRARY!!!","review":"This one was my first Koontz book, too. I fell in love with it, and drove everyone in my house crazy, telling them they had to read it. (My mom finally caved in, and she even loved it!) That was probably 10 years ago, and Koontz is still my favorite author of all time. I even wrote to him before I entered the military - and got a PERSONAL response!! He's a warm-hearted person, and a wonderful author - I always rush to the store to get his latest books."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best ever","review":"\\"Watchers\\" was the book that got me hooked on Koontz. Although I have been disappointed by some of his work since this one, \\"Watchers\\" was by far the most entertaining and heartwarming novel he has written. As a dog lover, I still get choked up thinking about Einstein the Golden Retriever and believe my dog my be almost as smart.I borrowed this book many years ago when it first came out and have decided (after reading the reviews in Amazon) that I need to get one for my own library. DON'T judge this book by what you may have seen in movie form, they all sucked.

I decided to read a few of his older works and I started with Watchers. It's a little dated in my opinion but the writing and characters are great. In this day and age it's hard to imagine a top secret lab animal not having a gps chip inbedded in it, so there would be no chase or hunting just hopping on a computer to locate said lab animals. No matter if technology has changed since then I don't regret reading Watchers cause I loved this book and its become one of my favorite Dean Koontz novels and I've read over 25 of his books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love..Love..Love It!!","review":"My absolute favorite Koontz novel!

Dean Koontz once more weaves another fast paced, edge of you seat story. Two creatures are created in the confines of a labaratory intended to serve as a sort of secret weapon in times of war. One is hideous, hateful, extremely intelligent, and extremely dangerous and uncontrolable. The other is extremely smart. One is a dog. One is a combination of different species, which becomes known as \\"The Outsider\\". When the dog escapes the lab so does the outsider who's one purpose is to destroy the dog, for many reasons. One is it is extremely jealous and hates it with a passion. In the process of trying to find the dog, The Outsider savagely kills along the way.

Koontz....This book in my opinion is the greatest book Koontz had written yet. It has everything a book would want to be. Each character has his or her own plot and when that person meets another important character in the story, their plots combine into like it was one single story. He always goes into detail with each character explaining their background and where they fit in the story. If you're a horror story fanatic, this is just the right book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling, exciting, emotional. The best book ever.","review":"This book was the best Dean Koontz book I have ever read. And Koontz is definatly my favorite author. I could read this over and over again and still have the chills and thrills that come with the story. I first read this book 3 years ago and to this day I still feel like it is something I lived, something in my memory, something very real to me. The detail that Koontz gives allows anyone with the least bit of an imagination live the story in this book and more.

I was gripped from the first chapter many years ago, and the characters have become a part of me.

I did not think it was at all as described. It is a book that lists many sports and the problems associated with them. The problem is that she covers so many areas that there is not much detail in any of them. If you have spent any time at all in your sport, you will already know all of the information. For example, she covers scuba diving. If you have your scuba certification, you had to know all of the information to pass the test anyway!

It is an extremely easy and quick read, written using simple language. I cried tears of joy after realizing that hope was not at all lost. The exercises provoked thoughtful discussions with my spouse and we are both now committed to trying many of Dr. Love's suggestions.

The import was only released in Sony/Japan because the Ep had already been out for a while in the U.S. It sold very well for an Indie record And since the Ep had already charted earlier, there was really no sense to re-release it I guess. Cyndi basically ditched the whole project, and wanted to put out a completely new cd, by the time her and Sony got back together. The import cd (the full version)was released during the time Cyndi was on tour in Japan in 2004. However it would have gone to the top if promoted heavily. The songs on Shine are completely incredible Higher Plane, Waters Edge, title track(Shine), Waiting For Valentino, Eventually, Wide Open, Rather Be with You...are all fantastic.

So were the kids, who didn't want me to finish the book. Hearing about Ramona whining because she couldn't get her sheep costume just wasn't the type of Ramona entertainment we were used to. Although we did like the healthy bit in there about smoking, the cons outweigh the pros, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stuff.","review":"I heard about Tanzwut from a friend who showed me their website and played the audio samples there for me. I almost immediately tracked down this CD on ebay. I just got it in the mail a couple days ago, and it's hardly left my CD player since. As a matter of fact, I'm listening to it as I'm writing this. The fusion of metal/industrial with medieval music creates a pretty unusual sound, but it works. I've been playing it for friends and telling everyone I know who I think would like them about this band. More people need to know about this. Now I want to get a hold of their other CDs too. This might prove to be a challenge.

A wrenching testimony to what ignorance, prejudice, and well-meaning but thoughtlessly cruel intentions can do, Brashear's novel is highly recommended for history readers and serious students of Native American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So....","review":"I hate to be the first one to give this book less than 5 stars, but I cannot help it...although it seemed some-what thoroughly researched, it dragged on. I also thought it was kind of hard to follow all the different names the author was constantly giving her.I must agree it is a very sad tale. I bought the book in hopes of getting more actual accounts of Cynthia's life after recapture through the eyes of a cousin in her diaries...I was let down. There was no such thing, even though I saw that statement in another review.I would recommend RIDE THE WIND by LUCIA ST CLAIR ROBSON. It is historical fiction but is well researched & a very knowledgable read about Cynthia Ann, the Comanches, and her life among them. A very beautiful book.This one was not as good as the other viewers made it out to be...sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Sick...","review":"I used to own this... but I lost it. I'd like to buy it again because it is pretty good. From what I remember, there is a lot of animal rights content as well as human rights. It is good traditional hardcore, well, not \\"traditional,\\" but not a lot of metal. It ends with an \\"Underdog-like\\" reggae song that is pretty good, and begins with a pretty heavy Earth Crisis song. I am not too fond of EC, but this is one of their better songs. One or two of the songs just shouldn't be on there, or even exist. But there are some good ones by Culture, Birthright, Painstake, and others. I would recommend buying it if you haven't already done so. It won't be your best cd, but it will definitely add character to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maisy Does it Again!","review":"My 2 year old loves all Maisy books, including this one.

I'm not an Apple fan, but the book looked amusing and I love things from the 80's.Authors David A. and Marianne L. Gardner do a nice job of explaining many computer commands to someone with no experience, especially all the 1980's text commands. They often use cartoons to illustrate their point, featuring themselves, Quentin the bug, and an unnamed, humanoid furry creature with tennis shoes.Unfortunately, the last few chapters of the book, as well as the appendices, are too mired in technical information, and the amusing cartoons have become sparce. Still, I can safely recommend \\"Apple BASIC Made Easy\\" to Apple fans, 80's fans, and collectors of old books. Others may want to stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some wrong info,, LOTS of good pics, and LOTS of good facts","review":"This book has alots of cute pics but also quite a few bloopers-the author doesn't even mention Leslie Carter in Nick's sibligns she just puts Aaron,Angel and BJ but not Leslie but other than that it's a great book for scrapbook wanters, bt some of the info you can find on the net for free and some new info.

The love story of Van and Ada, spanning morethan 80 years, is poignant enough to transcend theincentuous overtones; the richness of the language reaffirmsNabokov's status as a master wordsmith. It also gives thereader the fullest account of Nabokov's unique, intriguingtheory of time. Ada belongs on the bookshelf next toUlysses, Four Quartets, and Magic Mountain as the greatestworks produced by Modernism. It is not for the light ofheart, but tenacious readers will delight in its artisticwonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Book, 2 Star Kindle Edition","review":"There's no need to repeat what others have said about the novel. However, the notes at the end of the book are one way links. You can follow links from the notes to the passages, but there are no linked footnotes enabling the reader to reach the notes as the book is read. This is unfortunate because the French and Russian phrases are translated in the notes. But how to reach them? There are also brief explanations about allusions, anagrams, and such. But again, they can only be accessed easily retroactively, after the reader has completed the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing hyperlinks to the annotations; ebook = broken","review":"Nabokov's finest novel and masterwork is presented here in a fundamentally broken ebook, as the annotations are not hyperlinked from their appropriate italicized words in the text. These annotations (added by Nabokov himself in a later edition of the book) are absolutely crucial to getting the most out of the text, and the publisher's failure to hyperlink them shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the necessity of such a feature in ebooks, especially at an overpriced-for-legacy-title publisher-mandated price of $13+. Do not purchase until the price is corrected, especially in light of this book-breaking oversight. Ebooks are not just lazy and effortless scans of their text counterparts - they are a unique digital product that must contain hyperlinked footnotes/annotations and full indexed navigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious time consumer","review":"This is the worst book of Nabokov. No 5 star will change this fact. Read it only if you are in prison with this book but no other in the reach of your hand or if you want to see some literary monstrosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nowhere, hardly nothing. Only the best dream I ever made....","review":"Forget about reality. Forget about space. Forget about people. Evreything here is build around two beings whose life is the most delightfull poetical creation I've ever red. Any of their act is full of sense and sensuality. Nabokov worked hard to write what he would like us to remember. Far from Lolita's common lands, or even Pale fire's, threw which we can guess his genius threw a too incarnated and immature writing. Ada is accessible to a few people only. Those who can appreciate a very fine style, and who can find themselves in such subterranean characters. I hope you will be within them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nicest story of Incest and Insects","review":"The reviews above have all hit it on the mark about 'Ada's' mastery in prose. Yet, I am only compelled to speak of its sheer elegance and beauty. It's breathy and breathless. \\"A sore rose of Eros.\\" Fluid as a still photo moving, blurred by the texture of time, it is so full of motion and emotion moving at the pace of a locomotive. As outrageous and comical the scenes become, we know deeply that Ada and Van Veen do live beyond the final pages. \\"Quel livre, mon Dieu, mon Dieu.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"*sigh*","review":"If I were stuck on a desert island and could bring only one book, this would be it. Not only is it passionate, beautiful, and witty, but it is so many levels deep that one could spend a lifetime tracing its paths. Lolita is beautiful and accessible, and Pale Fire is deep and intellectually fascinating, but Ada is the pinnacle of Nabokov's skill. His use of acronym alone could be the subject of a year's study. Best of all, his heady wordgames only augment the emotional power of his work. This is not a passive read. One must work and cry simultaneously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nabokov amuses himself","review":"This is a masturbatory fantasy. Nabokov has created his dream world: The United States and Russia are one country and everybody who's anybody speaks French, too; World War I never happened, let alone World War II; and Van Veen has a lifelong love affair with his cousin Ada (actually his sister), full of passion, yearning, intellectual stimulation, and the thrill of the forbidden, plus a soupcon of jealousy provided by Ada's full sister Lucette, who wants Van to love her, too, and finally kills herself for want of him, spicing Van's life with a touch of sweet remorse. Oh - I forgot to mention the voyeuristic lesbianism when Lucette describes her own affair with Ada, and their threesome.If this isn't the stuff of your dreams, you may find Nabokov's mandarin literary style a little heavy for the subject matter, like a g-string made of real cloth of gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"only a non-russian reader can be so confused as to admire this narcissistic exercise in stylistic acrobatics - it's empty, empty, empty"},{"rating":"1","title":"huge fan of most V.N. but not this!","review":"mon, i have de PHD in de comparative literature (true!) & my favorite novels be de \\"Lolita\\" & de \\"Pale Fire\\"; i have read ALLNabokov--& a number of de texts multiple times, mon. excepting dis piece of...unmitigated indulgence...perhaps N. was too close to de material. i no know. remember udder of me heroes--VS Naipaul & Paul Theroux--agreeing that NO ONE HAS READ THIS NOVEL. dees odder people be lying tru der teef, mon, if dey say dey made it tru dis turgid murk of a mucky-sloppy morass. avoidski, kiddies.mon, havlf way tru de novel i realize \\"i couldn't possibly care less 'bout dees oafs, dees pawns in de hands of yes, de master, my favorite novelist, Vladimir... it truly an excercise in solipsism, mon\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Most feel love; a select few feel ardor.","review":"A burst of light, a entymological treatise, a love story,a dirty old man's sexual fantasy, a miracle.

Only Nabokov would have the audacity totry to write a literary masterpiece around a simple -- evensimplistic -- plot of youthful incest, and the skillto pull it off in such a brilliant fashion. If wordy pretentiousness and precocious kids turn you off, you shouldn'tbe reading Nabokov in the first place.

The world is aggravating and you want an escape. Turning on the TV would just make noise. Reach for Jesus, Elvis, and Coca-Cola (who could resist the title?). Everything about the book is improbable, from the Jewish Texan cowboy private detective living and working in New York, to the ridiculous and repetitive language used (repetitively) to describe ordinary things, to the plot (which makes our hero appear to be an idiot at the same time that he solves the case). The book provides a heavy dose of cynicism about nearly everything it touches, which can be a good thing if you are in one of those moods where a positive and upbeat perspective would be just too annoying. The book is mercifully short, so that nagging feeling that you are TOTALLY WASTING YOUR TIME doesn't last much longer than the (hopefully temporary) bad mood that might have drawn you to it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as ever","review":"I have read 4 of Kinkys books in the past few months, no one is better than the other, they all include very interesting characters and come bundled together with laughs a plenty. Kinky has a wonderful habit of making the extraordinary seem very ordinary, and he gives the ordinary an added twist of the extraordinary. This book is really harmless, and it is an easy read.

When the women are deepsearching, some even back to when they first landed on the planet, are there no traumatic memories of the loss of their fathers, husbands, brothers, sons, male friends? It is an interesting society that has been built, but I found myself waiting for some explanation for how the women reacted to this shocking part of their history. I also found it odd that every single women in the story was homosexual, whether native, Mirror or from Estrade. Millions of years of evolution on earth would still produce a majority of heterosexuals on GP unless some other process intervened.

I read it to myself and then out loud to some of my friends and i laughed just as hard the second time. The dialogue and actions of the pushcart owners and truck drivers is well written and original. And the suspense is super. Even though the favorites win in the end you are kept guessing right to the end. Although it is fiction,it is realistic enough that it made me feel like doing some research! The plot is an exciting contest between truckdrivers and their trucks( they are too many and too big)and the pushcarts owners and their carts who are harmless and small. I would advise teachers to read it to their classes and parents to their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pushcart War, Pushy?

The people of New York do not know quite what is happening while thousands of trucks all get flat tires and tie up traffic everywhere. The truck drivers don't know what hit them.

You can really tell the quality is not the same as my mother-in-law's set that she purchased over 15 years ago. Hers are really heavy and the anodized layer on her pots and pans hasn't scratched off like it has on my set already, and I have only owned mine since 12/06. And I take care of them...it's just that if they bump into one another in the cupboard or something the black anodized coating can scratch or dent showing bright silver aluminum underneath. I haven't found this to effect the way they perform however, at least not so far.But don't get me wrong, I love my set because the price was phenomenal and I wouldn't want any other kind of cookware (esp. teflon with it being so toxic) but you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"From the first dish we cooked, my husband and myself knew we did not like this cookware.

We have had many sets of Calphalon pans in the past and always been happy with them. But this set is defective. Firs of all they weight 3 times as much as any other set I have ever seen, which is a bit of a hassle. But more importantly EVERYTHING sticks to them, whether you use butter, oil, pam etc.I don't even know how it is possible, but its true.

I use this cookware every day, and the only damage at all has come from stacking the pans rather than hanging them (a problem that will be rectified this winter with a hanging pot rack). There is a reason why you see Calphalon pans being used by Food Network Chefs (at least the ones who don't have their own line of cookware to advertise...) and the reason is that they are a superior product. Buy these - and never look back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful cookware","review":"I have been consistently disappointed with Calphalon cookware and have had to send for factory replacements several times due to manufacturing defects. One rivet holding the handle on a pot started corroding. While it looks like stainless steel, it turns out it's stainless over some other kind of metal (zinc?). The hard anodized coating only looks good until you start using this cookware. Don't believe the hype about \\"harder than steel.\\" It will be destroyed if you put these in the dishwasher, it stains under normal use, it scratches easily, and it rubs off over time even with just hand washing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Non-Stick","review":"When I opened my package I was very disappointed in the quality of the items. I was surprised to see that the items although they resemble Caphlon they are not quite the quality I expected. I currently own other Caphlon products and in comparisson to these items they are no where near the same level of quality that the Calphon name is known for. I tried out one of the frying pans this morning and followed the instructions on the pamphlet to wash with soap and water and pretreat the pans. However, when I placed the pan on the stove with medium flame I noticed that the pan started to turn black at the bottom as well as my eggs stick to the pan aalthough I had lightly sprayed with cooking oil. Im very surprised that the scramble eggs I was trying to make instantly got stuck to the pan. These items are not non-stick I am very disappointed in the quality of these products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better then GLUE","review":"PROS Great at boiling water, great at not flaking like many nonstick pans.CONS These pots and pans are great except that anything you cook in them sticks.And I do not mean stick like any normal pan. Did these guys add a secret ingredient to make everything adhere? I tried the pans a few times and my wife, kids, and myself ALL quit using them to cook, after just a few attempts. Good for building muscle in our attempts to clean them.Who wants an almost new set (some not even used) for 65% off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be!","review":"This is not the same Calphalon Commercial used to be.

These are imported, & made especially for internet purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the American-made Calphalon","review":"This is the Calphalon made in China, so it is much thinner and lighter than the American-made Calphalon option. If you need a sturdy professional quality, this is not it. Having bought this set on sale, I broke up the set and made some presents for some young people just starting out and setting up a beginning kitchen and who were not developed cooks. It would not be worth full-price.

After only six months of use (the reputation of this maker is that it is of lasting quality), the pans are sticking to everything...and the recipient cannot figure out why.The Amazon replacement warranty has expired, and the manufacturer has thus far refused its return.My advise: buy a triple clad stainless set like the Chef Emerol sells ( i have his stuff and it is wonderful)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cookware ever","review":"My wife bought a calphalon pan from kitchen aide that was and still is amazing over a year ago. So I thought I would be nice and get her a full set for christmas. This set is the worst set of pans ever. Everything sticks to them.

I was prepared for the non-sticking issue as everybody mentioned. However, when I started to cook food on these pots and pans. EVERYTHING stick to the bottom of these cookware and started to burn. It doesn't matter how you turn the knob on the stove!!!!!! Not only that, I tried to soak them in hot water in 2 days, the burned food on the bottom of pans was still not coming out. Pieces of junk. I called Amazon and they told me that I can't return these items due to the 30-day return policy. I am going to dispute them through my credit card company. Junk product and crapy customer service from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calphalon Has A Quality Control Problem","review":"What frustration! EVERYTHING sticks to these pans. I'm an accomplished cook, I own other Calphalon, and I'm here to tell you these pans are terrible. I have no doubt that others who rave about them got a great set of pans--like I thought I would get. There is obviously a QC problem here, and Calphalon's problem has become my problem.I'm returning the set, plus the Everyday pan and stockpot. It's great that Amazon has an easy return system (been shopping here for years and never used it until now), but it still means I have to repack everything, lug it to the UPS store, and ship it. I shop online to save time and money...and this experience has soured me on Calphalon. There are other anodized pans out there and I'm looking for a brand that offers CONSISTENT quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems like a cheap knock off","review":"I purchased this set soon after purchasing two calphalon omelet pans at a housewares specialty store. These pans are NOTHING like the omelet pans I purchased. These pans are made in China, the omelet pans are made in Ohio. The handles on the omelet pans are polished these are rough. The omelet pans cook everything I have put in them perfectly and forgive a little too much heat. These pans stick, and spots can not be removed with a dobie and bon ami powder. I wish I had saved the box, so I could return them easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calphalon in name only!","review":"This has to be one of the worst knock-offs to come out of China. I have other Calphalon products [made in Toledo, Ohio] and this just doesn't compare.

I guess you get what you pay for so, buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid cookware","review":"I love how solidly built this cookware is - I don't think I'll ever have a problem with handles becoming loose. It browns food very well. It seems to maintain heat better than other cookware I've had so use slightly lower temps than you ordinarily would. Food doesn't stick to this nearly as much as it did to my stainless cookware. However, I still keep a nonstick pan in addition to this collection.I haven't used special cleaners - just soap and water - but it does seem a little more difficult to clean than stainless, particularly the exterior of the pans and tops.Overall, a very good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product for The Price","review":"To buy this product at such a cheap price was excellent. I'm not sure if it was last years range or something but at the price you pay i paid who cares. You walk into any high end cooking store and find these products for full price and you probably pay the same for one pot as you do for this set of 6.Although not dishwasher friendly they heat quickly and are extremely easy to clean.The ability to use then in the oven is also a big plus. Cannot fault this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low cost and poor","review":"For $150 its a great price for 5 pots and pans. However, you get what you pay for.Assuming they are delivered with flat bottoms, they continue to warp very easily and are poor choices for smooth top stoves. For whatever reason, they do not saute well. The balance and handling is poor. Between the riveted handles and the lack of a non-stick coating, keeping them clean is tough.If you are on a budget, you can probably do just as well at your local supermarket. If you have the cash, start buying good pans one at a time. They will last a lifetime and are a pleasure to cook with. Think Italian or French. There is a correlation with countries that have a history of fine cooking and the cooking products they produce. The Italian ones tend to be very expensive. The French are far more affordable and cook just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to clean","review":"The Calphalon 9 pcs set is impossible to clean and so unusable.After talking to a copany rep and folling all instructions I'm still unable to clean the frying pans.a $200+ not well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product","review":"Food sticks to pans. this was made in China not the USA.

Ultra special instructions for how to NOT get stuff to stick to them. Can't put them in the dishwasher. Can't wash them IMMEDIATELY after use. Have to let them cool down. I wouldn't recommend.

My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.I am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental. After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp. Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads. After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food. I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.

The pans are smooth and clean, but they don't look clean, there is a weired blochiness. The brochure says to use ajax to bring them back to new, but I don't have the guts to try it.

The price was great, and over a year later we're very satisfied.The only tow minor issues we have are these (each work half a star):1) It is VERY difficult to completely clean these pans. It can absolutely be done, but it requires me (manly burly elbow grease style) and a great deal of time, materials, and force . . . so pretty much we don't deep clean them all that often. (To restore them to pristine after every meal would take as much time as cooking the meal did . . .)2) There are some difficulties in cooking. Eggs are a challenge every time. Some types of meat are very tough to work with (bacon is a good example) as well.

Having used baking soda and taken the anodized finish off my 2.5q pot, I looked for a replacement. This set provided a 2.5q shallow pot, as well as the casserole and fry pan I was also looking for. Calphalon does tell you not to use baking soda in the pots. Ok, the shallow pot was not the one I wanted but was accurately described. However, the older set made in Toledo Ohio is constructed of much heavier aluminum. I am disappointed at the significant drop in quality. And, with china having less quality control, I am uncertain these pans will perform well and have the metal alloy content I expect. I will now look to All-clad made in the USA rather than continue to buy Calphalon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy These Pans! Buyer Beware","review":"I read many of the product reviews and also own other Calphalon pans, these don't measure up and everything, and I mean everything, sticks to these pans.I have other Calphalon pans, all with smooth handles, these have cast iron handles and are a cheap knock-off of the originals. Save yourself the frustration and don't buy these pans!I purchased them for Christmas and I am calling Amazon tomorrow to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factory 2nds, or maybe 3rds?","review":"Compared to other pieces from Calphalon hard-anodized line, this set is much lesser quality. The handles are not as smooth as the other pieces I own and purchased separately. I don't claim to be a gourmet cook, but I've been cooking long enough to know the quality of things I paid for. The set quickly became dull and has discoloration on the bottom like I had it for years (it's only been a month). And I did follow care instructions and never put it in dishwasher. Not to mention that I got 8 pc. instead of 9 being advertised. Very disappointed and would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I absolutely love these pans. Hand washing them is no problem. I keep a small towel in between the pans when stacking them so they don't get marked up. I'm sure these will last a very long time as long as they are taken care of. A little effort will take you a long ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this set!","review":"This is my first Calpahlon set and I love it. After reading the enclosed directions on how to use and care for the pans I have had no problems. They cook great, are very forgiving, and my steak tips have never tasted more tender. They clean up easily with a little Bon Ami and a Dobi pad, even scrambled eggs are a breeze. The trick is letting the pan heat up before cooking and letting meat sit out for about 10-15 mins before cooking, use very little olive oil or butter and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible set!","review":"Don't buy it - this is a terrible set! Amazon being a reputable seller should remove it from the site.I read very mixed reviews before buying this set but still decided to go ahead because I owned another piece of Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware. The pan that I had was also made in China and worked great for me - so I didn't mind the origin. Probably at least a half of the things we have in a typical household have been produced in China anyways.So this is not about the country of origin - this is about the quality of the product. Everything people say here about food sticking to the pan is completely true! Cleaning these pans is almost impossible! No, I didn't expect them to behave like non-sticks do but I didn't expect everything to stick regardless of the amount of butter/oil I put.I'm returning this set and will continue my search for a good set of cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE IN CHINA!","review":"THREE WORDS.....made in china!

Maybe if it was free. Honest review here. No Fluff...","review":"I would tell anyone to STAY AWAY. I have heard so much about Calphalon being the best nonstick pans and such. So I shelled out almost 400$ at Boston Store for the set, since I love to cook. I have had them now for 2 months. Everyday I cook with them EVERYTHING sticks. It doesnt matter if I use a table spoon of cooking oil or a cup. My food never turns out right and it sticks and chars. Honestly, I bought a Tephlon pan from Goodwill for 79c and it NEVER sticks and was a far better buy then the Calphalon.

I know that they are not supposed to be non-stick but food sticks to these pots and pans like glue, even when just warming soup or frying an egg with properly heated oil, butter or non-stick spray.

I will say that the return process through Amazon, left me very pleased and I will not hesitate to continue to buy products through them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, great pots/pans!","review":"First, I would like to say to watch the price of these after you buy them - the price varies a lot and you might be able to improve your deal with a refund. Anyway, these are great! They conduct heat much better than any other pot/pan I have used. There is some adjustment if you are used to Teflon - they do stick a bit more. With that said, they don't give you cancer as many now suspect Teflon does, they are oven safe, and you can use metal utensils. A scotch-brite pad is safe to use (according to manufacturer's instructions) and will restore the pans to their new condition with little effort. There are some other tips for minimizing stick included in the instructions. Machine washing is not recommended. Also, remember that since the tops for these pans are metal, they may get very hot and require a potholder for removal. The handles on the pans themselves, however, generally stay cool enough to touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM - it is like a cheap knock off of the Calphalon One product.

There is a learning curve though, you MUST let them warm up slowly and cook on a lower temperature of ALL your food will stick.

A little butter (I use earth balance) and cooking on a lower temp and nothing sticks!

It doesn't go in the dishwasher, and the pans are probably too heavy for people with limited hand/arm strength.

Then I proceed with stir-frying the vegetables but that is hard because there are brown bits on the bottom of the wok left from the previously cooked meat and that starts burning before vegetables are even done. I end up adding water to it so it wouldn't burn but then I don't get a nice sear on the vegetables.

Two months ago there are many dark recessed circles showed up at the bottom of the wok. I contacted Calphalon since it has lifetime warranty. In order to get a replacement wok I have to ship it back (with a tracking number) on my cost. The shipping cost ranges from about $20 to $30 since the wok is quite heavy. I don't think the 25% to 30% of the product price for shipping is worth the effort. So I contacted Calphalon again to see if I can just send some pictures of the defective wok instead. To my disappointment, Calphalon insisted that I have to ship it back. A few months ago my golf cart, which is much more expensive than the wok, broke within the warranty. All I need to do is sending some pictures to prove the golf cart is broken and the manufacture immediately send me a new unit.

He even read his first book today without too much trouble.I think that HOP is definitely worth the money considering everything that is in the box.The only thing that I was disappointed in was the CD-Rom. The CD-ROM is so out dated and wouldn't run on my newer computer.

Next day she started the yellow workbook with audio CD and start reading books. Because first few books start with simple few words, she could read them easily and it made her confident at reading. She completed whole thing in 2 weeks. She love to read to me at bedtime and it became our routine, she reads 2 books to me and I read 2 books to her before bed.

The author is too much of a lefty dreamer to realize what real development (and life) is like. Like so many on that coast, he imagines living in houses that simply use electricity and warmth from the sun, that are designed to make use of nature, and that create perfect little communities. It all sounds like a far-fetched fantasy to me. In the townhouse I live in (which I just bought three months ago and love), I can not imagine how all these schemes would be accomplished.

Time to hang up the camera and go fishing, Mr. Konigsberg.This film was buttock clenchingly awful, from the wooden masturbatory fantasy of a plot to the painful effort of the lead to be Woody Allen.

Annie Hall it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was Woody thinkin'?","review":"This is a shockingly inept movie with few redeeming features. Larry David in particular can't act - he can only be himself, for better or worse. The film (more of a TV show, actually) was shot on the cheap with the minimum effort. Weak, cheesy script. Superficial acting. The assumption seems to be that jokes that (might) work in a Brooklyn shtetl will universally apply. Perhaps not. There is no fun in the film, no depth, little actual humor - just a leering David. I liked the Barcelona film for its depth and awareness of the humanness of attraction, passion and suffering. But this? Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"This movie was terrible. I could not even force myself to watch the whole thing.

I like Larry David but this seemed forced. Also as a Christian I was offended by your repeated attack on Christians. Surely you can be funny without repeatedly making fun of something that you know nothing about.For that reason alone I would not recommend this movie to my friends.

There are a few instances of mediocre acting (the scene where mother of the child rushes into cafe to argue with Boris about her kid's mistreatment by Boris). In any event, I hope he makes more movies like this one. Also, aside from a few anti-American slanders on race and religion, I enjoyed the movie and its message.

Larry David is great in his own projects, but really lacked the ability to deliver the nuance in the Woody Allen character. Normally, you feel somewhat sorry for Woody in his enactments, but in this case, you felt contempt. This is the same story that Woody has done over and over, which I expected, but between Larry David's acting problems, and the one-sided leftist propoganda themes, it was really hard to take.

Woody playing Larry David's role might have raised this to two stars but even that is questionable. I never shut a movie off before it is over but this dreck pushed me to the limits of my patience.

Is he really so one-dimensional, returning time and time again, with diminishing returns, to the themes that have filled too many of his films? Forget for a moment the older man/younger woman relationships - how about the persistent hatred of popular music, the affairs without any emotional consequences, the Manhattan that resembles no Manhattan I've inhabited in the last 40 years?The problem is that this film, like so many of his films these days, is positively hermetically sealed off from any new experience, any new opinions, any new take on life. You would hope that his recent series of films made overseas would result in a fresh perspective once Woody Allen returned to NYC, but no.

A married couple of Middle American bumpkins visits NYC and before you know it, one comes out of the closet and the other embraces a \\"bohemian\\" relationship with TWO men (in the same bed)! Golly, is that all it takes?I think we, duh Audience, are supposed to see Larry David's character as a crusty but loveable misanthrope, but actually, he's a tool, a mean, self-absorbed tool.There ARE several genuinely funny moments in \\"WW,\\" but not enough of them.Buy or rent \\"Love & Death\\" or \\"Take the Money & Run\\" for Allen films from when he was laff-out-loud FUNNY and not loaded with contempt for his non-NYC audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"My wife got me this movie for Christmas.

I felt no connection with any of the characters. In fact I hated most of them. The story line is very unrealistic. I don't think I laughed once during this movie. However I did like Evan Rachel Woods character, she was sweet and the only believable one in the movie. I also would have liked to see more of Ed Begley Jr, he always puts a smile on my face.

This need for fame and (even my writting my own review) highlights how little we value the Nobel and how over valued is the oscar.

It is filled with practical wisdom, and helpful insights, none of which are seemingly impossible. It has small practical insights, that if adhered to can, and eventually will, radically alter someones life. I highly recommend this book because anyone can follow through on the wisdom contained within it, much more they could with modern self-help books.

It should say: 302 of the world's greatest hymn stories. It is volumes 1 & 2 complete and unabridged. This great compendium of the actual hymn scores, coupled with stories, is a must for those who love hymns and especially for choir directors and all church musicians. These stories can be shared in rehearsals and discussion or Bible study groups. And it is hardcover. A great collection. The only downside to this set is that v. 1 and 2 have just been bound together with separate title pages and separate indexes--no overall index. But for what it offers, this is truly a great book.

This book sits up there with government forms as a shining example of mindless waste of natural resources. ( At least it uses cheap newspaper style material).

Each one satirizes an area of contempory life (as it was in 1958 when these were published) in the Western world. An Hungarian violinist, two Russian authors struggling with communism, a Spanish bullfight that gets completely out of hand, and that had me laughing out loud many times, an English colonel growing plants in the title (and best) story, an English scientist who can put a man on the moon, a tragic Czech couple, an English man who is the voice of a rabbit on a BBC children's program, and four World War II generals in a frozen Russian shack. All are immensely entertaining, unpredictable, very original, and touchingly human.

You'll discover that Andrew Thrasher has written a phenomenal book. He managed to cover a lot of territory in a fresh, psychologically accurate, unforgettable, and sometimes-humorous way.The characters are as unique and individual as those you meet on a daily basis. But seeing them through the main character's eyes, you see his rational in categorizing them and follow his progression of thought to accepting and even admiring them.Don't make the mistake of calling this a religious book. It's larger than that. It seeks to reveal the basic needs of human kind and how we try to fulfill those needs. No matter your background, race, or creed, you'll see that we're not so different.

Some of the drawings are downright confusing such as the drawing of the \\"fixing plate\\" on page 19 and the \\"vacuum operated steam brake controls\\" on page 162. Also, some of the british names for things are a bit hard to understand over here, such as the \\"hanging jubilee clip\\" and the jigger valve\\".

Perhaps with the increasing interest in written works by Asians there will be a belated audience - author Choi deserves it. There were elements in reading Ha Jin's \\"The Bridegroom\\" stories that rang a responsive memory bell about Choi's book, encouraging a return to re-approach Choi's work. On second reading it gains in quality. Choi has quite successfully captured the sense of buried secrets carried by us all, but epitomized in her Chang, her Katherine, and the entire tenor of contemporary life in the South - both American and Korean. Similarites to the youthful struggle with ideolgies, loss, muted desire, resolution or dissipation.....Choi captures it all with smooth, elegant yet walloping writing. This is a fine novel.....let's hope more are coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Searing, Flawed","review":"Katherine Monroe and her mother, Glee, are two of the most vivid women I have encountered in fiction for quite a long time. I began reading this book about two years ago, and although I put it down, I never was able to put out of my mind the opening chapter, when Chuck arrives at Sewanee and meets Katherine for the first time. Finally I have read the entire book, and I feel that it will haunt me for quite a while. One flaw in this beautiful novel is the love affair between Katherine and Chuck. I don't see that these very different people would attract one another. I found myself rooting for the depraved Charles Addison. Another flaw lies in the sometimes-lengthy flashbacks to the Korean War. They were sometimes labored and struck me as the product of fastidious research rather than first-hand knowledge (which would be impossible given Choi's birth in 1969). Aside from this, the novel is well worth reading and I look forward to Choi's future novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BIBLE - King James Version (KJV)","review":"What can I say?

I read two thirds of it and skimmed the rest...I would call it a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader","review":"\\"The Big Con\\" is an excellent read from several perspectives. It is extremely well written. The pages fly by, which is saying something considering that it is non-fiction. As a 40's period piece, it is a must read for any fan of the crime/detective genre. Lastly, for anyone interested in the \\"confidence game\\" or related artforms, it is an esstential primer that considers the con at its most developed level. If the text has any weakness, it is that it leaves one with a craving for more details on the \\"short con.\\" This may be forgiven because the point of the book is to examine the \\"big con,\\" but as the author often notes, the masters of the big con nearly always get their start with the short con."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Deserved One Another","review":"The only thing more astounding than the degree of thought, care, judgment and energy these con men dedicated to their dishonest trade is the fall-on-the-floor-laughing GULLIBILITY of some of the victims (marks) they ripped off. Given the plain old greed that propelled most of the victims into the traps they pretty much set for themselves, they absolutely deserved to be skinned as thoroughly as they were.The stories in this book are eminently enjoyable, and they really make you wonder what sort of big con games are flourishing across the USA even as we speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't matter the era, still true today...","review":"Being the victim of a conman I found this book to be amazing. No, it wasn't a quick money con but the person I worked for was a confidence man, and what I learned from my experiences in dealing with him first hand and reading this book. Wow, it's fascinating at how no matter the age, the game is the same. This book does get a little redundant in parts. But, the stories, the game that's played, how it's done, those things are all the same and as times evolve so does the hustle. This book gives you an inside look at how the mark is done, the roots of where the modern con extended from, and in all honesty, human nature and how easy it is to get played. Reading this book also gave me some insight into watching the TV show White Collar because a lot of the cons they run there have roots from this book.

I have practice meditation on and off and I do have actually noticed that smiling and focusing on breath can make you feel much better. Once you know that, there is absolutely nothing to find in this book. All the pseudo philosophical discourse is cheap, amateurish, worthy of the TV series Kung Fu. As I read the book I almost heard somebody called be grasshopper. So do yourself a favor, if you want to meditate, just sit in a calm and quiet room, start focusing on your breath, put a smile on your face and don't bother about the nonsense in The Miracle of Mindfulness.

Thich Nhat Hanh's philosophy is astonishing, helpful, amazing, enriching.So is the book, too. Unfortunately, my budget is quite tight, but I will continue buying some of his books if I will have more money again. The book is clear structured.

Some letters are wrong (n for rr), some words get extra spaces, and you will find images of entire pages from the paper version in-between the scanned text.

I diagnosed the problem as a failed bulb, as I could clearly see the filament was broken. I ordered a replacement which was NOT CHEAP. It too lasted 5 minutes, and yes, I know enought not to touch the bulb with my bare fingers while installing. Bought two more bulbs next time around, and you guessed it, about 5 minutes use for each.

As a matter of fact, all the chapter-end review questions seem to be are \\"hey, bet you can't figure out how we got from equation 4.56 to equation 4.57.\\" It makes for somewhat easier homework because it's simple algebra and trig most of the time, but what am I learning, exactly?

I could hardly put it down. It can renew the confidence of weary Christian students who struggle to find an identity outside the suffocating boundaries of liberal theology. The merits of the book are many:1) Reads well; 2) It addresses a number of important issues; 3) Very well researched; the footnotes supplied me with new reference material (is he the Evangelical Hans Kung?).The only reservation that I have is that I don't think that the author has extensively presented the intellectual foundations of evangelicalism; rather, he has successfully refuted or stood up against liberalism, postmodernism and pluralism. He has not sufficiently documented the reasons for being an evangelical at an intellectual or academic plane, though he has given plenty of reasons for NOT being a liberal a postmodernist or a pluralist (in decreasing number of arguments for each category)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landlocked by Doris Lessing","review":"This entry in the Children of Violence series has Martha fed up with her life in Africa and desiring an escape to England. As she is \\"Landlocked,\\" she cannot get true independence and is left with friends she is growing distant from and a Communist ideology she is becoming disenchanted with. She spends the majority of the book feeling mentally and spiritually stifled and taking up with various lovers. It is an enjoyable book, just as solid as A Proper Marriage but nothing akin to the masterpiece The Four Gated City. However it sets Martha up well for that final novel, and makes her later transformation believable. It also gives the reader a very stark view of life in WWII South Africa, an area too remote for warfare but always full of the sadness of the time. The Children of Violence novels are a great achievement and should be enjoyed in their entirety, so although this is one of Lessing's less well-known works it would benefit any fan to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powder Burned","review":"If you enjoy 257 pages of strung together clichés - this books for you.

While the lyrics could use some work at times, every member of the band demonstrates his virtuosity with his instrument. Soaring, powerful vocals; tight and imaginative bass lines; powerful guitar, both rhythm and solo; and drum work reminiscent of Neal Peart all combine to make this a thoroughly enjoyable spin. The individual performances hardly take away from the overall direction of the songs; the band is good enough to meld these efforts into a seamless, satisfying whole. In contrast to the incredible raw sound of Keeper Pt. 1, this album has a much more produced and mature sound that is just as satisfying, if in a slightly different manner.

His work is uneven, and there are parts that are an effort to get through, but when he gets it right he reminds me why I love literature, and how thrilling it is to be shown a person's truthful, inner life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever published","review":"Brodkey is dead and his book is still a loud obnoxious snore.

Jack and Annie find themselves hiding out from a man flying about and now have to figure out a way to get back to the moonbase before their air supply runs out.Quite different than their early adventures this one helps to teach kids about gravity.

I agree completely with the reviewer who pointed out that the author seems to know little about history, science, or the English language; I'd add to that list logic. The heroine Annie is an airhead, though she's portrayed as the one who seizes the initiative; her favorite word is \\"Wow.\\" Her brother Jack, though far more prudent, is forever saying \\"Oh, man.\\" This is junk food, with empty mental calories.

The call is an announcement ('I am here' or 'this is my space'). They certainly do not have conversations. Since each dog will be miles apart and calling at random intervals, the calls should be at different volumes and at different stereo locations.I think one reviewer said it sounded like the dogs were in kennels and suffering because they were crying continuously.Intrigued, I managed to obtain a copy at a realistic price.The music IMHO is of typical quality for CDs of this genre.The reviews were accurate.

Shortly after he retired he married twice, each marriage being relatively long lasting, and he led a quiet life. He attended various baseball ceremonies, raised some money for charities, and coached a bit. Leavey demolishes the \\"recluse\\" nonsense.She also sets out clearly why Sandy had to retire early. He like other starting pitchers of his era were exploited by their teams. Throwing fastballs for nine or more innings per game game after game would have ruined anyone's arm. Baseball had not yet appreciated the middle reliever and the closer. Had Sandy pitched 6 or 7 innings per game, his career would have lasted another 5 years easily. I have to admire his and Drysdale's work ethic though.The book recalls the late 50's and early 60's well and makes you realize how much society and baseball has changed. It is a fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaching across the generations.","review":"I bought this book in hopes of gaining some insight into my late father's baseball allegiances. He was a Dodger fan and a Koufax devotee. Growing up in the suburbs of Washington D.C. I was never sure why that was so.Leavy does a great job in allowing the reader to get a grasp, albeit a loose one, on this enigmatic and utterly unbelievable athlete. As a baseball fan I had always known about Koufax's legacy as a player.In reading this book I got a better idea about the attitudes in baseball and society during that era. I also discovered what my father could never quite explain to a young boy growing up playing baseball. That there is so much more to this game than the game and Koufax knew that and somehow my dad knew Koufax had that awareness.This book will shed a lot of light on Sandy Koufax for most readers but it will be even more illuminating about an era for those who did not live in it. This should be required reading for every major leaguer today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Baseball Read","review":"This is a fantatstic book, interweaving chapters about Koufax's career development with chapters on his perfect game in 1965. As I was reading the chapters on the game, during which the author succesfully intersperses quotes from an amateur tape of the radio broacast, I felt the tension of the night - and I even knew the result of the game.The book also does a fine job of explaining Koufax as a cultural phenonemon and as a baseball marvel. The comments about Koufax by other players give fans who never saw Koufax play (like me) a sense for his level of greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a baseball fan . . .","review":"This is a great book. I couldn't put in down. The story of Sandy Koufax, as told in this account, is fascinating and illuminating. The way the author intertwined each inning of Koufax's 1965 perfect game with his life (one chapter on each inning of the game, the next chapter about a phase of his life)was brilliant. Whether or not you are a baseball fan should be irrelevant to the enjoyment of this book. The commentary about life in the '50s & '60s comes through clearly within the context of an extraordinary persona.

It is great fun going into the ethnic neighborhoods which existed in most cities during that time. We meet theTorre brothers, and others who were part of Sandy's early life.I also like the style the author used in telling the story, going every other chapter to THE GAME!It was also nice to learn of Sandy and his respect for my favorite player of that era, Warren Spahn. It is more that a sports book it is a snapshot of urban America during the days of Sandy's youth.

THE AUTHOR JANE LEAVY, DOES A GREAT JOB FOLLOWING HIS CAREER AND EARLY LIFE, BUT I FELT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MATERIAL ABOUT HIS LIFE AFTER HIS CAREER ENDED IN 1966. SAND KOUFAX IS THE GREATEST PICHER I HAVE SEEN. I ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE HIM ON TV ON SATURDAY GAME OF THE WEEK, ALL STAR GAME OR WORLD SERIES. WE HAD NO CABLE OR SATELITE TV THEN. LOOK AT HIS STATS, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT HE JUST DOMINATED ALMOST EVERY GAME HE PITCHED. I FOUND IT VERY INTERSTING TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HIS FAILED MARRIAGES ALONG WITH THE HIGHLIGHTS OF HIS FABULOUS CAREER.

This was one of the most disjointed baseball biographies I have ever read. The author spent so much time jumping around from periods earlier in Koufax's life to current reflections on Koufax, that the book did not flow the way I feel a good biography should. The nine chapters on Koufax's perfect game was not worthwhile to the flow of the book and did not add any real insight to Koufax that was not covered elsewhere in the book. The author kept trying to make Koufax a product of the 60s, but no strong argument exists that he was much more than a very good baseball player during this period. This book does not stand up to excellent baseball biographies by Robert Creamer or Charles Alexander or even good ones like the book on Joe Dimaggio by Richard Ben Cramer or Jackie Robinson by Arnold Rampersad. Koufax is an excellent subject for a biography, but this book fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed.","review":"This book is very disjointed.

I found all of the lavish praise to be boring.This book also includes much too much social commentary/histroy by the author that doesn't really belong in a 'sports' book.The long lists of celebrity name dropping, Milton Berle, etc. also adds NOTHING to the book; as well as the references to names that must be a who's-who in Jewish America - names that most people who aren't Jewish & don't live in New York - have never heard of.Don't waste you time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooklyn Flamethrower","review":"I am a Jewish New York Yankee fan who grew up in Brooklyn, so I read this book with mixed emotions. I would pray, when Sandy was scheduled to pitch against my Yankees, that his arm would fall off or Mickey Mantle would hit a home run every at-bat. But neither happened.This is a well-written book that brought me back to a time in my youth, of happiness and sadness. A time I don't often revisit as I am a live for today kind of a guy. It was certainly interesting to read Jane Leavy's take on him. She is a premier baseball biographer, as she recently again proved with her Mickey Mantle book, \\"The Last Boy.\\"I highly recommend \\"Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy\\" as a view into a private life and a re-creation of a time and place that produced greatness 8in so many different fields.Jane Leavy, ya done good!Neil L. Yuzuk, AuthorBeachside PD Series"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great account of one of baseballs best pitchers...and person!","review":"If you enjoy going behind the scenes and learning about the lives of great athletes you will enjoy this book. Sandy Koufax is shown as a man with discipline and principles beyond most of us. It is too bad that he threw a baseball so hard that he had to cut short his brilliant career because of a sore arm. I saw Koufax pitch in Wrigley Field in Chicago and it was a great thrill. He and Don Drysdale brought so much to major league baseball and helped establish baseball west of the Mississippi river. The author does a nice job of explaining what kind of a person Koufax was and her account would be a good book for any aspiring athlete to read. Norman Jones,Ed.D-author of Growing up in Indiana:The Culture & Hoosier Hysteria Revisited and Main St. vs. Wall St: Wake-up Calls for America's Leaders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor biography","review":"The author who is Jewish spent far too much time on Koufax being Jewish. As a biography it was poor. Jews may appreciate the book, but gentiles probably won't. The book didn't take you through enough of Sandy's life or his career as it seems to emphasize 1965. I usually like to read biographies rather than auto biographies, but I've read many auto bios which are better. The author may have been hampered by the fact that Sandy is so quiet and reserved that he makes a poor subject for a biography. There's a caption under a picture about Sandy being twice divorced, but only a few sentences about his first marriage. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Win for Sandy","review":"This is truly a great book. Growing up in Los Angeles during the Koufax era was and incredible time and this book rekindles the many wonderful moments, especially Koufax's perfect game against the cubs. This book also goes deep into Koufax's life with great respect, honor and appreciation for the person he is. Contrasted with the current crop of baseball players, Koufax's accomplishments as well as his humility stand out as exemplary. I recommend this book to anyone, baseball fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a Brooklyn Dodger fan, I loved it.","review":"Sandy was always one of my heroes. And he's a baseball immortal. I'd not heard of the author, but anyone who can turn a phrase such as \\"quiet as a cat pissing on cotton\\" earns my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant !!!

Barry Werth has successfully presented point of view for all the parties involved without an obvious sense advocacy for any one of those involved.As a hospital employee, with family members who are lawyers, doctors, and family members who have experienced \\"bad outcome\\" births, first-hand, his dialogue smacks of a realism that I have witnessed.Bravo Mr. Werth !! I know the reality of which you speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling real life account of the justice system","review":"I'm a medical doctor embroiled in a battle to expose a corrupt insurance company engaged in racketeering. I think (and have been told) that this is a story that needs telling. There are lots of twists and turns, corporate and government cover-ups, some drama, many sympathetic characters in the form of other victims of the abuses of this company, and lots of anguish. Thousands are suffering and some committing suicide because of the actions of this company. It will take me years to get to court, if that is even possible. Except for the Internet contacts I've made and a few friends, I am working practically alone. The legal profession has all but abandoned the public and their actions in covering these crimes up with confidentiality agreements, for those who can even afford lawyers, is allowing it to continue and worsen and spread, like a cancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and instructive tale.","review":"This is a fascinating story of real life in medicine and law, well told. However, it will leave you believing that the legal system is an terrible way to resolve questions about the quality of medical care. It is so vividly and accurately told that it also left me wondering whether the doctors and lawyers on either side of this heartbreaking conflict really cared what the truth was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of a Roué","review":"Given that Nick's 80s output (\\"Nick the Knife\\", \\"The Abominable Showman\\") never got their due, it's refreshing to see the critical reverence he gets today.

She was telling me about her big crush on Tom Potts (Richard Fiske's original name). She used to stay at their house when she was young and Tom's mother was like a grandmother to my Mom (Doris Karnes-Graham). We have letters Mrs. Potts wrote to my Mom when she was with the \\"Hollywood People\\". Tom was 10 years older than my mother and used to take her up to Seattle with him like a little sister. It was very devastating when he was killed in the war. She still thinks about him today.

The goal is to get it to stick to the inside of the front window. The instructions to accomplish the task are clear and direct.

The author is an amatuer, and it shows. Hundreds of books like this are published every year, this is no different from them, except it was written by a kid, and you can tell, it's like reading a 5th grade book report.

Good luck finding it though, it's off the assembly line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Beautiful Dishes for Guests and Everyday","review":"I have 6 sets of dishes..all nice and some beautiful. But this set is the one I use most often. They look lovely on your table, especially for those who love Old World designs and the glorious rose pink color. They are very sturdy and wear wonderfully for everyday dishes as well...they don't get super hot in the microwave, or chip in the dishwasher. Yes, the tea cups could be more delicate...but that is the beauty of this set....it holds up to just about anything, and looks elegant doing it. It's not tacky, such as Corelle wear dishes etc so you can be proud to set a dinner party table with this dinnerware. So, I'd say, they are the perfect dishes for family use and entertaining. I'm looking for a service for four place setting set to add to my collection. I agree, though..this place setting here is over-priced. Ck out other online sellers to get it for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"For xtreme dieters only","review":"Really wanted to love this set, even with the relatively muted colors, but it is practically impractical. The dinner plate is indeed 10\\" round, but nearly half of its width is taken up by the very wide, slanted, fluted rim. This leaves a flat surface of only about 5.5\\" wide for cutting on or eating off of. A chicken leg couldn't lie flat on it. The salad plate is similarly proportioned, and the cereal bowl holds only about 1 cup, or 8 fluid ounces. Try eating your breakfast out of the 1-cup measuring cup in your kitchen drawer! If you are looking to cut your portions to 1/2 of itty-bitty, this set might be perfect for you; but otherwise, you'll be going back for 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, and still have leftovers...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The quotes in here are not that great.

I found this book hard to read because the author did not spur or hold my interest. Her references require the reader to pick up another book to see what she is refering to - Such as the Chatechism of the Catholic Church or the Bible. You must have a good understanding of both books to understand her viewpiont.

As a result the content of the book is written in a conversational tone and would be a great aid to anyone wanting to know more about Orthodoxy. Some of the questions seem dated since the original content came out of the 1950's and was edited for publication in its current form in the mid 80's.

No phone seems to do it all for all people, I just cared what worked for me. I don't care about the shared phonebook deal. I just want clear calls, some handset customizing and decent battery life. I got most of those. The calls are exceptionally clear. No hiss or echo. It's amazing coming from my old uniden 5.8. I have the handsets spread around the house. I have one in the bedroom with the ring volume set to off. That was an important feature. The battery life isn't very good. They say you should get 100 hours standby, buy I just get 10 hours. So if you lose a handset for more than 10 hours, hitting the locate handset button on the base won't help you. The handset is nice and the lighted buttons are a plus. The answering machine works just fine, but you can't check the messages from the handsets. Kind of a bummer on that. But, as a clear cordless phone, it works great.

In retrospect, it's easy to think of Atkins picking jazz, but at the time it was still unusual for country artists to cross over. Those who know Homer & Jethro from their comedy records may be surprised by their top-notch guitar and mandolin playing. The material is a mix of pop and jazz, and the group (which included a changing line-up of session bassists, drummers and pianists, as well as fiddle player Dale Potter) gives most of these tunes a hillbilly twist. Haynes, Burns and Byrd each sing a few, but the real charm of these sessions is the high-spirited instrumental interplay.

It combines elements from many genres, spinning themes that could easily be stereotypical together in a dynamic fashion that results in something new and innovative.At its heart, this book is about Vanessa, a college student who merely dabbles in the occult until she acquires a book that contains a spell for eternal life. With a goal clearly in mind, Vanessa grows in power, as her life becomes entangled with werewolves, vampires, ignorant and selfish witches, disembodied souls, and various other characters, while she searches for the components necessary for eternal life.The writing is fluid and easy to read, although there are points where the author gives more information than we need, not even offering the reader an opportunity to guess the mysteries before they're unfolded. But this isn't a mystery novel, so that can be forgiven, especially from a first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like sitting at John's table and conversing.","review":"This is not a literary classic,and I normaly do not read books about celebraties, but this paperback is just great. John Lennon goes through many of the Beatle songs and lets you know who did what, and what he thought about each song. Many little story's, and some verbal feedback on his solo album's. I cannot say I have/had a favorite Beatle, I liked all four of them and this book is just like sitting down with a Beatle and discussing the old days. It's not a Bio discussing the dark side of a rocker, or a sunny picture of a celebratie. It's just a Beatle on The Beatles. For a baby-boomer like myself it is pure nostalgia. It also re-kindles the old depressing feelings I had when he was murdered back in 1980, and I wonder why anyone would kill a Beatle."},{"rating":"2","title":"get the original version cheaper","review":"Search \\"The PLAYBOY Interviews w/ John Lennon and Yoko Ono\\" by David Sheff - it's the same exact book (minus the new foreward) and it's selling for a lot less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Compilation","review":"This is surely the best Clannad's collection.

This compilation should stand at the end of every Clannad-fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"Yes it's another compilation; but it mixes old and new really well. Nil Sen La is a live version from 1973 which I think I will call it fresh. Half is from early Clanad and rest from new Clannad. I love compliations where it hasa good mixture; and I'm not fussed it it's another compilation. I first heard 2 songs from Fuaim that I wasn't sure if I would like but having played this, I had no problem when I went Fuaim I got used to it after hearing 2 songs.

You'd think Epson could send a new part, some glue, or some solution that would save money at a time when everyone is looking to cut costs. Boxing, shipping and waiting were not pleasant solutions. No, said the \\"service\\" person, \\"this is simply procedure. There's nothing else we can do.\\" I asked to speak to his supervisor and was told that would not be possible. I thought Epson corporate leadership might like to know their system is broken, but they force all contact back through the product groups and ultimately one of these unhelpful service people.

Asprin's stuff was light-hearted and fast-moving - these are drawn out and plodding. Asprin included modern concepts like credit cards, computers, and novelty items (Rubber Doggie Doodle with Realistic Life-Like Aroma That Actually Sticks to Your Hands!) as props, just enough to get some fun and a bit of satire out of them; Nye appears to want to build an entire story around them and milk them for every nuance - in this case, computers and televisions.

It's impossible to remember who the characters are because there are so many of them and the story switches to a different character's point of view after every couple of pages. It would have been far superior to limit this book to 3 seperate character's stories. Then the reader would be able to relate to the character and follow their stories easier.This book was really a dissapointment considering it contains two of my favorite subjects, alternate timelines and WWI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this timeline","review":"Haven't read anything from Turtledove yet that i haven't liked. This is a great book and would recommend to anyone interested in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"suffers greatly from the style","review":"There is no doubt that Turtledove has thought through all of the details of his work in this alternately history story. The major issue I take with it is how he chooses to tell the story.Rather than one viewpoint character, or even a handful, the reader is bounced to a different person for each scene with few repeats. In fact, his few \\"main\\" characters could be argued to have less page time than most other novel's minor ones. For me, it is a slow, plodding process of being introduced to someone new every chapter, and after a while you get wise to the fact that you're probably not going to see them again. All the effort quickly struck me as wasted, and I had to stop about a third of the way through the book.The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because I feel that Turtledove is a gifted writer, and an exceptional wordsmith, but his choice of how to convey the narrative cripples the story beyond rescue for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning","review":"OK, this isn't a review so much as a warning, and it'll probably get lost among 100+ reviews, but just be aware what you're getting yourself into. This was originally going to be a four-book series but now it's SIX (two trilogies, not counting the somewhat interrelated HOW FEW REMAIN prequel).Browse the reviews for the third and fourth (when it's out) books in the series and see if you still think it's worth your time. Like many HT series, THE GREAT WAR gets off to a great start and then quickly turns tedious and repetitive. I gave up after three books; I have better things to do with my life than slog through this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premise spoiled by no denouement & boring characters.","review":"This book is part of an un-announced seriel and so it does not reach any resolution, a fact which I found annoying. Its one thing to buy a book knowing it is book 1 of a trilogy, and quite another to buy a book and not find out is part of a serial until about 3 quarters of the way through the book, when nothing of interest appears to be happening. The book lacks any focus on the grand picture, concentrating instead on \\"slice of life\\" glipses of uninteresting characters. The book's premise is interesting but the execution is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much exposition in what should be character conversation","review":"I agree that not enough historical figures appear in this book, too many ordinary Joes and Janes. The fun in alternative history is to show how the Great Ones may have risen anyway. The other problem: Too mcuh exposition in dialogue, too many times, characters who would be talking shop or talking about girls instead go into longwinded historical summaries. Makes the dialogue slow going, Harry T. should shoehorn the background in more realistically. He has some great concepts, but I wish he'd make these two changes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, lacking some backround and thinking","review":"This book is mostly good execept Russian presence is lacking,(It was a major player early on)and the lack of information on Austria-Hungray,the Ottoman Empire,Italy(the other members of the German Alliance system), and Spain(Spainish-American war ends Spanish empire).

This book (And in fact, \\"How Few Remain\\" as well) aren't quite as good as his \\"Worldwar\\" series, but it was nevertheless enjoyable. Parts of the book DID get somewhat tedious--mostly during the winter months when the fronts stalled completely and there was relatively little action--but for a history buff such as myself, the book was satisfying overall. Perhaps the best way of describing my reaction to it is simply this: I will be buying the hardcover version of the next book in the series as soon as it's available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below Turtledove's previous standard","review":"World War I style trench warfare alternated horrifying danger with stupifying boredom, all in squalid living conditions. Unfortunately, the first book in Turtledove's new great war series is just boring. The interweaving of plausibly developed historical figures with fictional characters which was such a delightful part of his Worldwar series and his two Civil War books is mostly absent and he doesn't juggle the multiple plotlines as adeptly as in prior works. Sadly, the book reads like a plodding pot-boiler. Hope springs eternal, so I'll probably finish reading the series.....but I'll wait for the paperback version for the next volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly intriguing look at the fragility of the U.S","review":"Good Book about the Second war between the states"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confederate fighter planes?","review":"I'm waiting for Turtledove to expand this series to World War II and beyond. So far, the only way he's done that is in the sci-fi based \\"Worldwar\\" series--I'd prefer an \\"us Earthlings only\\" approach. This book gives those who are far too used to Amerca as a superpower an opportunity to realize that events leading up to World War I would have happened even had there been no Western Hemisphere. And I tend to wonder whether Custer was really all that obsessed with the Mormons. One thing I find disquieting, though--literate Afro-Confederates reading the socialist theories of Marx and Lincoln (? ) and seeing in it the potential for a race war. Especially since all through the Civil Rights 'Sixties, Klan publications were calling the drive for racial justice \\"the influence of godless communists\\". It's a bit depressing to think that the Red Tar Brush might be there for racists to apply to any move towards racial parity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good start to another series","review":"This is a very interesting book. Much better than \\"How Few Remain\\" which takes place 30 years before and which I guess you could say is the 1st book of this series. What I like about this book is the twists on established history it plays. The USA does a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor which the British control. The Japanese are allies with the British and Russians and they have taken over the Phillipeans back in the early 1900's. What I think is missing is comment on how an alternate America fighting the CSA and Canada would have affected the war in Europe. Without those Canandian troops over there might not the Germans have won it all? Anyway I am hooked again and will have to read the 2nd 3rd and 4th novels that he produces."},{"rating":"2","title":"War From The Trenches, War From The Airplanes","review":"Turtledove's fans has come to expect the kind of writing The World War introduces. Thank you, Harry, you didn't let us down once again!!! The unmatched ability of the author to portray a continent-wide conflict from the point of view of ordinary and not-so-ordinary people in their everyday lives - the so-called view from the trenches - is what makes this book a must-read, along with Guns of the South, How Few Remains, and the Worldwar series. My only complaint is that the pace of this book is a little too fast, although I understand that, unlike Guns of the South, this is a multi-book engagement and therefore should not drag."},{"rating":"2","title":"a slow begining but it gets better as it goes on","review":"This book is a little harder to follow than How Few Remain because there are more characters. The story is very hard to follow the first hundred to hundred-fifty pages. In How Few Remain many of the characters were real and famous people. This makes the story easier to follow. Unfortuantly the only actual person that has a large part in this book is Custer. In my opinion this book doesn't let you choose sides. Just as you might start feeling sorry, or rooting for one of the sides, Turtledove starts telling the story from the other sides point of view. This book shows how horrible war really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST book I have ever read!!!","review":"Turtledove has another best-seller with this book. He clearly shows views of this altered war from every walk of life and every angle. This is a masterpiece and a must read for all history buffs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I really tried to get into this book, but gave up after about 200 pages of jumping around from one underdeveloped character to another. The problem is that there are many potentially excellent characters, whom I would have loved to read more about. By the time one character sparked my interest though, the book jumped to another location, with a new character to become aquainted with.I like the concept of the series and would like to see read more stories like this, but instead of having to keep up with so many characters in one novel, why not just spread them out into seperate novels alltogether?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a war story","review":"Turtledove has written some good stuff (Guns of the South, How Few Remain), but this is just a war story about a war that never was, for the most part.What makes alternate history special for me is the chance to understand real history better, and what might have been had things turned out differently. Despite the title and hype, there isn't much of that here. Instead, Turtledove follows a bunch of fairly ordinary folks through long and not particularly compelling narratives.Very disappointing, but then The Two Georges, another letdown, should have warned me. Turtledove has skill at characterization and can write a crackerjack book when he wants to, but it seems that now he is just riding the crest of popularity and churning them out.Be warned, folks, and give this one a pass.

Alternate histories are good because they give us things to think about, but in order to be good it has to be based in some truth. It is my opinion that the South was missrepresented in this novel. I mean, blacks become communist? That's a bit extreem. I did like the concept of the book though and I do agree with Turtledove that if the South had won Lincoln's War they would have sided with the allies. Weather the North would have gone with the Central Powers is food for thought. I give this book 1 star for idea only. The concept is good even if the basis of the story is very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Turtledove has written an engrossing, devouring tale of an alternate history. This series has (so far) been far superior to his other works such as \\"How Few Remain\\" because most of the characters are fictional or mostly fictional so he is much less limited in character development. Of course, there are many (too many?) subplots, the depth of detail and breadth of vision of Turtledove in this series is remarkable. The most surprising aspect of this series to date has been his sense of humor and sublety. For example, 3-Finger Mordecai Brown makes a subtle cameo appearance, and (not to give too much away), when the AMERICANS bomb Pearl Harbor, a casually tossed in line about \\"this day will live in infamy\\" is too rich to pass up. Outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but a work in progress","review":"It becomes obvious towards the end of The Great War: American Front, that all the loose ends are not going to be tied up. I am pleased, because it whets my appetite for the succeeding volumes in this alternate history. Turtledove is not creating a utopia here, this world in which the South defeated the North in the 1860s and again in the 1880s is a much poorer and more dangerous world than our own. Nor is this a story of good vs evil. Both sides commit brutalities as a matter of course, and there is no high flown rhetoric about saving democracy or ending war forever. This World War I is openly about aggression and power. I await the succeeding volumes breathlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Arithmetic Geometry Book","review":"This Book is a cornerstone in Arithmetic Geometry.It is the first time in a single Book so differentarguments find a common place.Let me say that the idea of dividing the work intothree parts,depending on the approach, is entirelynew. In fact,Part 1 starts with elementary theory & applications(primes,diophantine equations& approx)Part 2 gives an account of recent ideas and theory(ch.3:Logic & Recursion, with a sketch of proof ofMatiyasevic's Theorem;ch.4:Algebraic NumberTheory;ch.5:Arithmetic of Algebraic Varieties;ch.6: dealswith Zeta functions and modular forms;ch.7:gives apicture, complete indeed, of Wiles'proof of FermatLast Theorem)Part 3 gives \\"Analogies and Visions\\",i.e. the linkbetween numbers fields and function fields(usuallythis analogy is only admitted, but never explainedin other books) and other analogies involving manyrecent arguments in Arithmetic Geometry (such as :Schottky uniformization, Arakelov Geometry, Zetas,Dynamics and Cohomology)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok Tool","review":"Ok, I am not a professional floor install, but I do consider myself to have better than average skills in the DIY arena. The product arrived on time in a nice carrying case. However I found that neither of the two interchangeable base plates worked well for my flooring. One set the nail in the top of the flooring, the other set it well out on the tongue. After some fiddling I ended up using the thinner base plate with some shims. This seem to get the nail set in the correct place on the flooring. The biggest problem now is that the nailer frequently marrs the edge of the flooring, causing a noticeable blemish that has to be rubbed out.I am willing to concede that this may be due to my custom shims, and I have to admit this is the first floor nailer that I have used. It could be that my shims are causing the blemish, so take this review with a grain of salt. I have to say though that I cannot imagine flooring with out a pneumatic gun, I'm just not sure this is the best one for the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tha Life of W.

But correlation is not causation: look hard enough at a large collection of data and you're bound to find some patterns, even if they have no significance whatever.Hilariously, Holway devotes several pages to debunking biorhythms, which are no more ridiculous than astrology, \\"good luck charms,\\" \\"omens\\" or any of the other foolishness the book presents as fact.Odds-on favorite for Silliest Baseball Book of the Year. Total Sports should be ashamed of itself for publishing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcopy of A Southern Women's story","review":"The book was worth reading but the quality of the book was very poor.

I especially like it's small size, it slips into a pocket easily and is not noticable. One thing I don't like is that it doesn't hold and edge real well. I seem to be sharpening it frequently.

Look at the pictures!\\"","review":"That's what my friends all said when they picked up this book, right before they sat down with it and were immediately engrossed. After having read the first edition many, many times, I was a big fan of the Goofy Foot Press's work. The second edition is even better, with more tips, more chapters, and some extra special added pictures. This book is honest and refeshingly humorous without being silly or patronizing; in fact, it's a lot like talking to a friend about sex. One of the best parts of the second edition is the personal quotes from readers. This book offers hints, tips, and ideas that you might not have thought of before. I know I didn't. It's an easy and fun read to share with your partner. Good luck, kids, and remember, it's more than just pictures! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Find the Right New Job from $25,000 to $250,000","review":"This is one of the best job-hunting books ever!Being a handy condensed version of the whole Job Changing System, it is easy to refer to during a busy day, while traveling or job-hunting.Chapters include Resumes, Unadvertised Jobs, Creating a Job, Answering Ads, Interviewing ... great material in a small, well-organized package.Highly recommended for that extra boost that every job-seeker needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I was looking for, and no way to tell from info on Amazon","review":"The book I was looking for is very similar --same author, same main title, same year of publication, but different subtitle.

The places she recommended were tourist traps, her comments were perfunctory, and her information was woefully out of date (not by one year, but by several). There wasn't one valid tip in that entire section of the book. Hey, if she doesn't like shopping, eating in Shanghai or staying there, then why is someone forcing her to write a book on it. Of the five guides I bought before traveling there, this is far and away the worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seaviews","review":"This book is a complete waste of money.

It is snug and I don't even notice on the back of the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design","review":"The basket assembled in minutes and was very easy to mount. I did it by myself with no problems. Unit is very sturdy and easily accommodated 4 large suitcases. The design allows the basket to be applied in different ways to best suit your vehicle. We were able to open the lift on our Expedition and load and unload without having to remove the basket or the luggage. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, built well, however...","review":"I purchased this carrier for a 500 mile road trip where we did not have enough room inside our SUV. As always did tons of research and read all of the reviews. I won't reiterate what others wrote so just a few brief points. The basket comes in two pieces that are supposed to slide together. After an hour of trying to make this fit, I had to resort to several wacks from a hammer bending the metal to make it fit. The instructions called for two bolts to be torqued to 10 ft. lbs. I used a torque wrench and one of the bolts snapped before reaching the 10 ft. lbs. click. I'm glad this happened at home and not on the road. I would plan on replacing the two 3\\" bolts with a heavier grade.The unit is solid and fits well inside a 2\\" receiver. I used an after market locking hitch pin that also fit perfectly. No regrets on this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta Adequate","review":"I purchased this item to augment the cargo carrying capacity of my Highlander. It does that, but it is of typical \\"made in China\\" quality. I used it to tote coolers and Rubbermaid tubs totaling about 100 pounds and it worked fine but I would not put any heavy items in this as the floor is fabricated from very light expanded metal mesh. It was cheap enough but you get what you pay for. Do some research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley delux hitch mount cargo basket","review":"Worked great! I would also definitely order the rola expandable cargo bag with it. We weren't going to at first then decided it wouldn't hurt to get that also for the 17+ hour trip we were taking.

Everything about it except for the 2 inch bar seems week. I also found that one of the Supports underneath the unit had only been Tack welded on and had broke loose I am going to take it to a Fab shop that I know and see if they can fix that, and maybe add some strength here and there. I just thought it would have been a stronger unit. Lets put it this way I would not try to stand on it accept maybe over the 2 inch tube but not on eather end I think it would just bend right down. We are taking it on our vacation and I hope we do not have any problems with it. I do not think I would buy from this Company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valleys, no peeks","review":"I guess my biggest dislike is that this \\"Deluxe\\" hitch mount Cargeo Basket does not fit the Valley Tow 91190 Deluxe Basket Folding Shank that I bought for $99.

I set up a return for the original as the box was mangled on arrival and the basket had scuffs and dents. The replacement arrived in worse condition; same problem with the box.

It's mostly domination/submission stuff. I only finished one of the stories, because it was actually funny it was so bad.

Since I feel compelled to say something nice, it is a good feather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what I needed.","review":"I found this item while searching for hammered dulcimer music to use in a play I was directing. I never would have thought a recording like this existed, and it was perfect! The songs were selected for what would sound good on the instrument, which was wise. The album makes for pleasant dinner music, or just something fun and random to have in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Beatles fan, and have enjoyed instrumental versions of their music for decades. I also have all three of Wilson's holiday CD's, which I really like. That being said, this collection suffers from the same problem as her other material...it's kind of flat. The sound is lovely and the arrangements are pleasant, but the renditions are so straightforward as to be a bit lifeless. I guess one doesn't jam on a dulcimer, but this is a bit like an artist reading a music sheet and following it note per note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I am just amazed that people would really want to listen to the Beatles this way.

We each look for the latest excercise books and give them a fair go of it before making conclusions. This one did not pass our tone test after 3 months.

But we split the cost of the book so not everything is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gardening?","review":"After getting this book as a hand me down gift and going online to find other fitness books, I have come across this one and feel I should give it the review it deserves. I was amazed that the author could put a title saying you can be sleek and sexy after 8 weeks. Ok I know it's a commercial ploy to reel us plump suckers in but Yeager includes GARDENING in her fitness recommendations as \\"the ultimate workout for women who hate to exercise.\\" The exercises are simple enough but come on. That's a lot of vigorous weeding. Could anyone stoop to a lower come on to patronize us slower matabolized folks? I guess only a coupon for fat free donuts may help sell more books. Try Pilates Workbook: Illustrated Step-by-Step Guide to Matwork Techniquesby Michael Kingfor a good way to ease into a nice exercise program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic approach","review":"I think Selene Yeager's new book is a well-written and realistic approach to fitness for women who have been seriously slacking. It tells the \\"how to get there from here\\" version of fitness and actually provides hope that all is not lost. Many fitness books make people feel like they must be in shape to even get started. Yeager has taken her years of training and her experience in coming back from being unfit and worked out a great resource for women of all levels. Good job!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly fit for who","review":"As a former athlete who's fallen away in the last few years, I found this book was not as worthwhile as I had wanted. I think I'd have to do these exercises WAY more than 8 weeks to get back in shape. A bit unrealistic given the types of exercises that are presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real Challenging","review":"This book was OK as a motivator maybe for some but the exercises are somewhat awkward. Seems unrealistic for a 190 lb gal to hang under a table and do pull ups on the edge. Obviously no doctor wrote this book.

Although I feel better about myself for getting started on a workout regimen, I am certainly not sleek. And forget about slim. I asked my doctor about this and he said 8 weeks is really unrealistic and potentially dangerous. To try to meet exaggerated fitness expectations through people who purportedly can guarantee extrordinary results through thier books is plain ignorance.

It may be helpful to others but was not useful for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angered by this book.","review":"I was very excited to read this book after hearing the author speak at a Christian homeschool conference. He was warm and compassionate at the conference but his writing lacked that. After reading it I was saddened by the advice he gave in it. I found he made some Biblical leaps and claimed them as Biblical truths. I think his heart is in the right place but I could only see his methods to be anger causing not anger solving. The overly strict methods he recommended seemed to discount knowing your own child and teaching them from birth. I would not recommend this book to someone already struggling with anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heart of Anger","review":"This book was recommended by an acquaintance who neglected to mention that, in order for the book to make sense, the reader would have to be a biblical expert. The text is sprinkled with references to chapter and verse. The reviews on Amazon gave no indication that this book is really only relavent to someone who believes the bible--old and new testament--are absolute and literal truth. As someone who does not hold that belief, the book is totally a waste of paper for me.I only wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to expectations described.","review":"I have a 75 gallon aquarium for a red eared slider and was so excited when I saw this. I hoped it would really work since I love decorating his tank. The first thing I noticed when I installed it, was that it was smaller than described. It claims to be 18\\"x48\\" and that is exactly the dimensions of my tank. After installing, both panels together were more like 17\\"x45\\".It is a nice idea but this item did not work correctly. I noticed more algae build up in fact. I realize that it takes a week or something to kick in which it states. So I did wait and wait but nothing cleared up, just kept getting worse. I didn't want to wait any longer seeing as though my time to return the item would be up soon and I didn't want to risk losing $50 over such a waste. Looks like I'll just be back to the difficult cleaning of a large tank still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nutritional value","review":"This product is very easy to make--just add water and spice packet and 25 minutes later you have lentil rice pilaf.

The book is a fascinating and fun journey through our far-reaching and sometimes far-out efforts to discover aliens. It is written in an easy and often witty style that allows the novice explorer to become educated in the whys and whats of this pursuit of the unknown. At the same time, Joel Archenbach digs a little deeper and gently persuades us to also consider searching for the truth in our own back yard. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and look forward to more writings from this very talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, funny, wise-an amazing book","review":"I got into Joel Achenbach's work years ago when I lived in Miami and he wrote for the paper there. He has an amazing ability to take complicated science and explain it with humor and excitement. Reading him is like going on an adventure with your smartest and funniest friend. I wanted to be one of the first to read his new book and I wasn't disappointed. If you want to understand the search for life in the universe, this is the book to read. Meet everyone from the purest scientists to the wackiest Ufologists. I can't decide whether my favorite character is the late, great Carl Sagan or the former lounge pianist, now in the employ of the Jet Propulsion Lab, who is trying to design a space sailboat with giant light sails propelled by the world's biggest laser. If you ever gaze into the night sky and wonder, you're going to love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book of ideas","review":"In this wide-ranging exploration of intertwining cosmic concepts, Achenbach shows a persistently inquiring mind, observant eye, and wry sense of humor. A rigorous reporter, as well as a fine writer, he clearly did some serious legwork -- interviewing everyone from NASA scientists to Heaven's Gate survivors. Their stories are fascinating. Achenbach's ability to weave them together even more so. A completely entertaining read for all earthlings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, but mixes apples with oranges","review":"This lively, amusing book touches on many ways that people relate to the cosmos, from astrophysicists to the Heavens Gate cult. That is a virtue, in the sense of providing the reader with a wide variety of material. It also is a weakness, in that highly reputable scientists are implicitly equated with flakes. The author should have drawn a sharper distinction between those he took seriously and those he found ridiculous. The net effect is to introduce a giggle factor into our views of anyone who finds the external universe fascinating and relevant to our future.Achenbach is a bit too worshipful toward Carl Sagan and former NASA Administrator Dan Goldin. In particular, he glosses over the fact that Goldin's faster, better, cheaper policy led to three major mission failures in the late 1990's."},{"rating":"1","title":"alternate reality","review":"In addition to the misleading title, this book is rambling and superficial.

On disc one Tomas Bodin is, unfortunately, absent. He is replaced by Robert Engstrand, a competent but uninspiring musician who is unable to fill Bodin's considerable shoes. Disc two is outstanding, the band cuts loose on wonderful versions of Big Puzzle, Sounds of Silence, Eyes of the World and The Flower King, often extending their length with some wonderful improvisation. They also do a terrific job of covering Three Stories from Bodin's solo An Ordinary Night. The only disappointment is, perhaps, with Stardust We Are/part III. This is not my favorite section of that epic compostion as Hans Froberg dominates the vocals and I much prefer Stolt's voice over the higher pitched Froberg. Still, a brilliant disc. Side one isn't bad it just isn't as inspired or as tight as when Bodin man's the keys. Still, given this two-for is the price of a single disc you can't go wrong.

Many of the 'As I Please' articles are pithy and rather delightful to read before bed.Also, this book contains 'The Lion and the Unicorn', which is an analysis of the English and their approaches towards what Orwell saw as socialism in the 1940s.

This work follows the history of Virginia from that point until 1660--one of the most turbulent times in English history. The central colonial figure during this period of Virginia history was Sir William Berkeley, who served as royal governor, with interruptions, between 1642 and 1676. Governor Berkeley, whose rule prior to 1660 was extraordinary for its evenhandedness, was successful in restraining the colonists' itch for land, particularly as the encroaching frontier settlements set the stage for Indian reprisals. The period under study by Professor Washburn ends with the Restoration and, in an act unprecedented in American colonial history, the recall of William Berkeley by the Virginia Assembly in 1659."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $10","review":"How could this little $10 pamphlet be called a book?

I enjoyed Pay it Forward, so I took a chance on this one. This book is loosely based on the book of Job, but at one point, a priest tells the main character, that Job's family was restored to him, this of course isn't true at all, Job had more children, but his previous family didn't come back to him. I couldn't like any of the characters, even when she went back in time to show what a lousy father he had. It started out pathetic and got more so the more I read. It finished with a Hollywood b movie happy ending. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric God","review":"Another triumph for this author.

I could not find any empathy for the protagonist who solves all his problems with his fists. The reasons given for his anger are the usual cliches: Stern religious father and weak mother, guilt over the death of his brother in an accident caused by the brother's stupidity, and the death of his son at birth. If these factors were so traumatic that they caused him to be such a violent, manipulative person it is not believable that the love of his daughter and wife will heal his anger. The story is just not believable. It is a good fairy tale and easy reading if one can numb the violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was good","review":"It was a good book.

So many of us have trouble seeing what's important in life, and how to make right what is wrong. Hayden Reese's struggle is one we can all identify with. His reactions may not mirror ours, but the pain and confusion he feels is easy to empathize with. This book has elements of sadness but there is redemption and Hyde's prose are masterfull. I found much sympathy in my heart for some of the characters, as well as trully despising others. That to me is a good book, when you curse the bad guys, and cheer the good guys out loud while you read. This is not a polorized tale of good and bad, Hyde has done a wonderfull job of making her characters well rounded and representative of real people winning and losing in the game of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macho Anger Run Amuk","review":"A very odd and unsettling book, about a macho-kinda guy you lets his anger rob him of a life, and who leaves behind him a string of emotionally and physically battered people. Despite the interweaving of the Jonah and Joe stories, this is not a gentle read, or even a very sympathetic one. The first few pages of the story are unsettling, and perhaps a cheap trick on the part of the author to pull the reader into a story that simply does not really make it. Hayden Reese meets obstacles in his life, but rather than acknowledging them head on with the grace of God, he strikes out at everyone until he only has himself and a mean, lonely existence. Hitting bottom brings about all kinds of changes in his life, and hopefully there is a message here of hope and grace, if you can get past the hurtful (long lasting) anger. I was unimpressed and unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old stuff","review":"I cannot recommend this book. It's the same old stuff, an establishment archaeologist clinging to 1930's theories. He closes his mind to paradigm shattering works that render this book obsolete--works like \\"Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings\\" by Hapgood; \\"The Origin Map\\" by Brophy; and \\"Giza Powerplant,\\" by Dunn. Instead of addressing the theories of researchers like Z.

This book describes the more realistic and rational theory that civilization began slowly over hundreds of thousands of years. It should not make any sense to a logical person to think that humanity went from hunter-gatherers to city-builders overnight. With the archaeological data of this book, it makes the transition much more smooth and believable; a slow accumulation of knowledge and technology that may have fluctuated but always persisted until the creation of the historical civilizations who have left their mark on the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudgley relies heavily on linguistics but misuses it","review":"Rudgley's book cannot be taken seriously as an attempt to re-write pre-history. His argument is confused at the outset by his failure to define 'civilisation' and his apparent tacit adoption of an unreasonably wide definition, which makes it very easy for him to claim cheap success. The mainstream ideas he attacks are mostly 'straw men'. Much of his specific 'evidence' is linguistic (or at least involves what are claimed to be early manifestations of written language), but this is discussed within the framework of the highly controversial ideas of Gimbutas. The evidence for anything resembling written language at the relevant dates is, to say the least, tenuous. Rudgley also relies heavily on fringe philological theories. He has in no way demonstrated his case and his scholarship is highly suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to pack up","review":"Pleased with the product and how quickly it came.

I guess you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Worst","review":"This is the absolute worst player I have ever dealt with. I have been through 2 units now. Both just freeze up (On a brand new store bought DVD) You have to shut it off for 5-10 minutes before it will start working again. I also haven't found a universal remote that works with it, so you have to use the way too small remote with the way too small buttons. I would never waste my money on this brand again. Only reason I am on my second is because it was replaced free of charge. WORST PLAYER EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The battery in the remote lasted longer.....","review":"This DVD player looks like a bargin, but steer clear. I bought one 12/03 and it didn't last a year. It started to blink and not play discs. I thought that the disc was dirty, but it was fine. I shut it off, unplugged it and it worked for a bit longer. Then it just conked out. It wouldn't play anything else after that. It wasn't worth the aggravation to save a few buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what to think....","review":"I just bought this DVD player last night, along with two brand new DVDs from Target. I came home and set up the player and put my new DVD in (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). The screen on the TV showed that the player was Loading ,the screen stayed like this for about 5 minutes, and then it finally changed from loading to Bad Disc. So I put another DVD in the player and received the same message; Bad Disc. Just to make sure it wasn't the DVDs I put in a regular audio CD to play. Again the same thing happened, the screen flashed Bad Disc. I tried unplugging the player and reconnecting it, and then putting another disc in but I just keep getting the same message. I know that my discs are not bad, because all of the ones I tested worked just fine on our Sony DVD player downstairs. I plan to take this DVD player back to Target tonight in exchange for another one. I will let everyone know if this one works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable DVD player.","review":"This player worked great through about 20 uses, then died. Too bad; it has lots of features and is nice and small (semi-portable). Very disappointing. I'd stay away from Cyber Home."},{"rating":"1","title":"unexpected death","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewers. This machine worked excellent for the price. Also because there were only a few buttons on the front, it's simple to operate. But, just like one of the other reviewers, the player died on me unexpectedly. I have no idea why, but it just refused to turn on... no lights, no sound, no nothing. The worst part was I had a rented DVD locked inside. I ended up have to pry the door open, breaking it, in order to get the DVD out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disposable!","review":"I bought this under 18 months ago and it is DEAD. I RARELY watch dvds, so I'm guessing it played about 20 during its brief lifetime. In addition, I had to finish at least 2 of those on my computer, because it couldn't read them. It was cheap, but I still feel as if I threw $40 down the disposal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The DVD player won't last long. I have had the player since December but only used it for 2 1/2 months. I probably only played 20 or less dvds on it and it is dead. You get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Dvd player","review":"I got this DVD player last christmas and is still working great. At times it is hard to use the remote, like in a dark place because all the buttons are the same size and shape. It can also be loud and take a while to open and close, and to start the movie. I reccommend it for bedrooms that dont use it that oftem, any other room and you should buy a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LIKE IT","review":"My husband and I have bought two of the DVD players and are very happy with them. There has been no noticable noise, fire, or refusal to let the CD go. The remote is not quite a &quot;joke&quot; but it's not the best. It's a cheap DVD player and we feel it's worth the price and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable DVD Player","review":"- Lasted less than 1 year- Bad picture (very pixilated)- Stopped playing CDs right away- Lots of dirty disk errorsWhat do you want for the price?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, BAD, VERY BAD","review":"when its working its great but i havent even had mine a year and it just died today.

They were purchased in August for Christmas gifts for my 2 boys and on Christmas day right out of the box one would not power up and the other would lose sound and have a messed up picture like I was watching satelite in bad weather. I do not recommend anyone purchase this item....."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DISC error. It's too bad, really.","review":"I enjoyed this player for almost one year to the day. Tonight, mid-movie it froze, and displayed the Bad Disc message on a practically brand new disc (as others have complained). I tried another disc, and it played part of the studio intro, then went to Bad Disc. A third disc worked, but I can tell the player is dying. A real shame though, because I liked its compact size and simple design while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware after 6 months","review":"I bought this 6 months ago and it worked fine until yesterday, when suddenly the audio track would not play. Audio played during the root menu and during all the special features, but no sound during the main feature. I went online and found that this is apparently a common problem, and usually occurs around 6 months. No one had a fix that worked for me. I have not contacted cyberhome's customer service (apparently very difficult to do), but at this price, I'm just going to buy a new one of a more trustworthy brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyber go back home.","review":"I bought the cyberhome dvd player back in December '03. I thought the value was great and it was also compact. A few months later when I tried to play a cd, the unit wouldn't come on at all. I unplugged it for a few days and then plugged it back in but no luck. Unfortunely, I will not be buying anymore cyberhome products"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bang in a small package for little $$$","review":"I bought this player just to play DVD+-RW as my panasonic could only play DVD-R and this thing delivers like a champ. First off it is small which makes it easy to transport to other rooms + has gotten many compliments for its size. Secondly, it plays every format!!! DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, CDR, CDRW... Very impressive. This little box is packed with features, component output, screen saver when playing MP3s (very important to avoid burn in) and it also saves where you left off in the DVD even after you power down. I've only had it for 3 weeks, so I can't comment on its reliability, so that's why it's only 4 stars and not 5. Runs quietly also.After some use, this unit does not last long. Had to return and got another. Seems to be lasting longer this time around though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I had this player for less than one month before it broke. All audio just shut down completely, and it began to refuse to fast forward or advance through chapters. Beware of this machine"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!!","review":"Yep, just as many of the other reviews state, one year is about all you get with this DVD player. Actually, ours lasted 10 months and died, no power, lights out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Little Thing","review":"It does play DVD's without a problem and is very compact but it is so noisy that it's not really worth it. I'm going to get rid of this one and spend an extra $30 for a quieter player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine performance and excellent value","review":"I wanted a multi-region DVD player to replace an ailing 5 year-old Philips, this player has surpassed my expectations. Very compact size, the lack of a display is not a material handicap as the on-screen messages are clear. The player has shown no difficulty with at least three regions to date (use the region override explained in other reviews here). Set-up is simple and allows you to change the output screen size, perfect for my widescreen. Plenty of cable outputs and while the remote is fiddly, it has good functionality - eg. the separate button for sub-titles. Picture quality is as good as I have seen with DVD. Why spend more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly a year","review":"I purchased this DVD player in mid-January last year. It worked well all year and died last weekend. Not bad for the price. The only complaint I had before it died was the humming sound, it's quite loud, but you get what you pay for. I probably won't buy another, but I feel it was probably worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good while it lasted","review":"I bought this one the day after thanksgiving last year. It worked pretty well until the day after Thanksgiving this year (conveniently the day the warranty expires!).I know it is inexpensive, and it weathered a good deal of use in my house over that year, but in the end it was not a good buy! I could buy a more expensive unit that will last me longer and in the end cost me less than replacing this one every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good advice, some unique information","review":"This book purports to assist you, O Baby Boomer, to remove 10 years of aging in only 10 weeks. This book has no schematics to build a time machine, instead it's a guide to vitamin supplements, health issues such as sexuality, diabetes and heart disease, how to preserve your mental accuity and much more. I was surprised to find some interesting nuggets of information that, taken together, form a good blueprint for healthful habits. Some of the habits (quitting smoking) are a given. Others, such as finding supplements like bilberry to ward off eye problems, are not so well-known.This author is not on the low-carb bandwagon (recommends the more usual lower-fat, whole-grain diet) but this is in keeping with such books as \\"South Beach Diet.\\"What's valuable to me are lists of supplements and what degenerative processes they help deter, and a general plan for good health in your middle age and beyond. This is a readable, useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Thermal Management","review":"This unit, from the factory, has severe thermal problems. It will overheat and shut down, even under light usage. There are updates that will reduce the temperature slightly, but the best recommendation is to install a cooling fan.If you buy one of these, expect to pay $125 for updates and a fan to be installed. Otherwise is is essentially unreliable and useless.A cute mixer, very badly designed. I would not recommend this product to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light reading -- my mistake","review":"I should have research the contents much more, it has the basics but that was then, need updating to today's environments and projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fusion Feast","review":"I've been a fan of Greg Howe for a number of years, own all of his solo albums, and only recently became familiar with this project after discovering some video clips on youtube. These guys totally blow me away! I'd never heard of Tetsuo Sakurai (bass) or Akira Onozuka (keys). (Evidently the former has been playing fusion in Japan for 20 years, and, judging by his chops, deserves to be in every fusion fan's vocabulary). Dennis Chambers,... duh! 'Nuf said.I won't babble on about every single song. Suffice it to say that if you liked Greg's last disc, \\"Extraction\\", with Victor Wooten and Dennis Chambers, then you'll love this. Yes, the cost* is a bit prohibitive, but if you can afford it, it's worth it.*By the way, I did not shell out $160 for this. I got it on the Laser's Edge website for $50. Still a bit steep, but a heck of a lot better than $160. Do I regret spending $50 for it? Not at all. It was money well spent, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny at times, but makes parenthood look depressing...","review":"The authors can be very clever, but most of the jokes seem to come at the expense of the children that they created and raised. Is parenthood really this much of an unpleasant chore, and are women STILL stuck in such stereotypical roles? Not in my circles. If you don't have children, beware, this book could scare you away from parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two bitter women","review":"My wife picked up this book somewhere. I took a look through it, and was surprised at the bitterness that passes for humor. Such scheming and mental manipulation of family members I have never seen openly joked about in print this way. The co-writers mistakenly assume that most other woman are like them. They need to stop congratulating themselves on their own cleverness and concentrate on the positivity in life--or they should get some help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Awful Smell","review":"I am pretty shocked to find that this product has so many positive stars. I usually use Hagerty Silver Cleaner but they did not have it in stock so I opted for TarnX. I was cleaning a silver bowl and the smell was so bad I couldn't handle it. It stunk up my ENTIRE house like rotten eggs. I am going to return this immediately and would highly advice against purchasing this product. If you do decide to give it a try keep your receipt as they have a 100% money back guarantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"This is a really nice, inexpensive leather strap. I was a little surprised to see that what I received was a shade or two darker than the picture but I like it better. Seems very well made. The embossing is certainly visible but not very deep so it looks about as faint as the picture. (I like that part also.) Not stiff, but not like a thin piece of naugi-dog either. Looks and feels like very supple. For the money you can't go wrong - just watch the color shades and, from my experience, expect that it might look a bit darker than you thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, cheap little watch.","review":"Absolutely no problems. Nice simple watch, pretty plain face, all black.The band is a maybe a notch or so shorter than I'd like, but that's pretty minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"way smaller than it looks","review":"im a guy. thats the problem with this watch. maybe a child could wear this small thing i actually just gave it away to a really tiny 130 pound looking dude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids watch, not for Men","review":"This is not a men's watch! I guess I'm different than most because when I received this watch, I immediately started laughing. This watch is very small, the face is smaller than a quarter. I tried to give it to my daughter but she didn't want it, lol. I will probably give it to one of my nephews. To sum it up, the watch probably works well but it looks cheap in person and is extremely small and no, I repeat no grown man should be wearing one if these watches..lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CHEAP WATHCH !!!","review":"I whole heartedly agree with the other reviewer. This watch is great for many reasons. The price is right. Less than $10. Come on, anyone can afford it. It doesn't weigh a thing! I personally don't like heavy watches. This is the opposite of a 10 oz Rolex or other expensive watch. It actually looks nice. Kind of a \\"classic\\" design. Gold hands and accents on black. A sweep second hand and a simple adjustable wrist band. A very simple, no-frills watch. It is my casual weekend watch that I wear when I don't need to know what day it is.It is all plastic. The bezel can be easily scratched. But, it's easy enough to just buy another one and replace it if that happens. I'm on my second one in 10 years and I also have a spare in reserve. Once you've bought more than one battery for this watch, you have already reached the purchase price.I hope Casio never stops making this basic model. In fact, they should expand the line to include other colors, designs, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, plain watch","review":"I'm in college and I really needed a watch for time management. This second hand is great. I wear it with business attire and even when I workout.

If it gets stolen or misplaced, no big deal. Works fine, and the price for the watch was about what a replacement watch battery costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimal, Reliable, Accurate","review":"Got this watch as an alternative to my Omega Speedmaster, which is a heavy, bulky, and complex timepiece. This Casio is so light, so comfortable, and so accurate that I haven't worn the Omega since this came in. Moreover, I don't take the watch off for anything. Even though it doesn't claim to be waterproof, I wear it each morning in the shower, and even when I go swimming. Your mileage my vary with that, but mine is still dry inside.Additionally, these watches are accurate. I keep a radio-updated clock near my desk, and my $8 watch is almost always dead on.Best of all, when it dies a replacement costs about the same as a battery. Better yet, buy a half-dozen in with different faces for different occasions.You really cannot go wrong with one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch for the price.","review":"I just received this watch in the mail today. The shipping was fast. The watch itself is durable, adjustable, attractive, accurate, and is water proof. You really can't go wrong considering it's only a little over $10. My only complaint is that the face of the watch is rather small. Only a little larger than a quarter, but that's alright.

This piece of garbage is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looses time","review":"It looks a little cheaper than in the picture. But I shouldn't expect much for $11.00 and free shipping.

This is an alright casual watch, but don't wear it and expect to get compliments!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This picture is misleading","review":"If you take a good look at this picture the watch doesn't look plastic, I purchased several of these watches and the watches wasn't what I expected at all the watch should say little kids plastic watch.

However, as a martini glass, it is a bit of a failure. The glass is really bulky. Handling it and drinking out of it is like eating after a trip to the dentist where Novocaine was administered.

That lens only focuses to 25 cm (9.8\\") and in auto focus only to 28cm. But with the tube in place, at the wide end of the zoom I have to bring the camera within a couple of cm to the subject, which is far too close. The only way to use the tube is on the long end of the zoom, which removes the effect I was working to: the exaggerated foreground.Note too that this lens does not speak to the camera when the tube is installed: you have to manually focus and manually set iris, both of which are relatively easy to do with Magic Lantern installed on the camera.With great regret I am returning the tube.

The problem is that it tries to blame him for wasting money on something he knew wouldn't work. I don't feel that is an honest account. He thought that he could work, just like going to the moon was a dream that people dismissed. Technology expands quickly, and I am always amazed by breakthroughs that I see. To blame Reagan for wasting money is accurate, to blame him as the book did is misguided. This book is obviously written by a Reagan-hater who only wanted to push book sales to the liberal community. I wish the writer stuck to the facts and presented readers with the tools to make their own decisions. But that is not why the writer wrote this book, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansive and well written","review":"This book was about far more than Star Wars. Fitzgerald also gets into US foreign policy with the Soviet Union and the demise of the USSR. This is not a light book: it is thick and excellently researched with great references. There is no doubt the book backs up the liberal perspective on all of topics, however, as I've mentioned, she backs up everything she says. I have no problem with people disagreeing with her - just be as thorough in your disagreements. PEACE."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent appraisal of the Star Wars Initiative","review":"If ever there was a book that answered a crying need, it must be Way out there in the Blue. With meticulous research and a touch of psychoanalysis, Fitzgerald disects Reagan's billion dollar initiative -- which most physicists (with the exception of Edward Teller)found unworkable. Along the way, Fitzgerald sheds light on Reagan's enigmatic personality and shows how his experiences and his acting career made him susceptible to proposing the defense shield. A truly superb work, this book will persist over time as the definitive account of the SDI. Note: For another good description of the issues underlying SDI, see Edmund Morris's Dutch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tiresome Leftwing Screed","review":"This tiresome leftwing screed would be funny if it were not so poorly written and badly researched. The book is presented as a debunking of the SDI concept and a refutation of the idea that it contributed to the fall of the Soviet Empire. The book really is a window into the tortured mind of the left, and how their denial of Reagan's role in destroying the Soviet Empire is as crazy as those people who deny the Holecoust. Technical inaccurancies riddle this little rant, which along with selective quotes and scurrilous conclusions condemn the book to be an embarssment rather than a contribution to the history of the 80s.--Mark R. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and ideologically biased","review":"Of all the books written on the Reagan administration, this one may be one of the worst. Poorly written with excessive attention to detail that makes the story plod, it makes one wonder if Frances Fitzgerald was a one hit wonder. Fitzgerald's portrayal of Reagan as out of step with reality - starting with the book title and included throughout its content - is less of a description of reality and more, I suspect, the blowing off of ideological steam. If you despise Reagan and think he was a dunderhead this book will do more than reinforce those beliefs. If you want an intelligent and useful discussion of the Reagan Administration and its foreign policy walk right past this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Anti-Reagan propaganda from the Left - AGAIN.","review":"Ms. Fitzgerald, while a skilled writer, is apparently incapable of logical thought processes when it comes to evaluating a conservative political figure, which she obviously views with disdain, along with many of her leftist friends. This book is simply the latest salvo in the relentless battle being waged by the Left to discredit Ronald Reagan and his policies. More tired references to Reagan's purported \\"simplemindedness\\", his \\"fixation on fantasy\\", and \\"mysterious inability to relate emotionally to his own family\\". As if Ms. Fitzgerald has any way of knowing this to be the case! This book is poorly researched, riddled with factual errors, and laughably obvious in its attempt to smear Ronald Reagan and belittle his accomplishments as President. His record speaks for itself, no matter how hard his opponents attempt to rewrite history. Don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)drivel","review":"Let me save you the time and money you might have spent on this book. The premise is: Reagan was soooo stupid that it was only his inability to tell the difference between US foreign policy and B grade movies he starred in 40 yrs earlier that led him to push for SDI. The premise that Reagan was stupid is contradicted by the work: Reagan in His Own Hand...and is standard liberal drivel ie: I am sooo right and sooo enlightened that whoever disagrees with me must be stupid.You don't need to go to the opposite extreme in defending Reagan, but this book is a collection of the author's self-righteous prejudices, and all her \\"facts\\" are used only to confirm her original diagnosis that she, and her readers, and others like her, are smarter than Reagan and really did know how to handle the Soviet Union, unlike Reagan who bundled through foreign policy (and life) like Inspector Clusseau on a case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Fitzgerald Missile Defense Expert?","review":"I may be one of the so-called Reagan idolizers but I also think I have common sense. Ms. Fitzgerald is being lauded now as the \\"expert\\" on the U.S. missile defense - her book is dangerous for future students of the Cold War. She says that the United States didn't do anything to win the Cold War and she said that a space based missile defense could never happen- well the Pentagon is testing it tonight and and an SDI type missile defense is on track. president Reagan said that SDI may never happen before then end of the century and he was right. Ms. Fitzgerald also says that conservatives want SDI to be an offensive systems- something that is far from the truth - Way Out in the Blue is where Ms. Fitzgerald has hidden the facts for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author is a Fool","review":"The author is clueless. Saw her on History channel interview. She stated that any laser weapon that can be used for knocking out missiles in space can be equally effective against ground targets - like people. This demonstrates her incompetence. She obviously doesn't know the first thing about propagation physics, like the fact that WHERE the phase distortions occur drives weapon effectiveness. Fact: A space-to-ground scenario would result in both linear and nonlinear effects such as turbulence and thermal blooming in the far feild. Such phase distortions cannot be corrected because where they are sensed and corrected differs from where they are generated. This woman is a fool and so are those who believe her."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same tired Reagan bashing","review":"The Amen Corner of Reagan haters will love this jejune diatribe against Reagan and his policies. Aside from many factual errors relating to science, her attempts to analyze Reagan are laughable. What Ms. Fitzgerald doesn't understand is that Reagan's ABM proposals were as much of an economic threat to the Soviet Union as a military one. What is especially galling to the author is that Reagan was right and made the single biggest contribution to winning the Cold War in the last twenty five years. If an even moderately unbiased account is what you are looking for, pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"It what amounts to nothing more then an attack by a leftist writer, Fitzgeralds focus is to demean the charcater of a great president. Weather he was a bumbling ... or was just acting, like in his movies, fitzgerald argument does not deal with the fact that when Ronald Reagan entered office the Cold War had never been colder, and by the time he left office it was essentialy over. Was it a matter of luck that the collapse of the Soviet Empire occured on the watch of the most anti-communist president in the history of the country?

At the end of each chapter there are exercises in the form of questions, concrete to abstract, that you can use. However, no suggested answers are provided. In my mind, when I purchase a teaching addition, there is an implication that the heavy lifting will be done by the authors. That's what they get paid for.

To quote her, \\"I found this hotel around the corner from the Danieli.\\" The Monaco & Grand Hotel is completely across the San Marco Sq. from the Danieli. She also talks about eating on the rooftop restaurant. There is no roof top restaurant at the Monaco. The restaurant is either on the terrace or in the building. If ,as she says, she is eating Croque monsieur at lunch at Harry's Bar she would have discovered that the Monaco is four steps from Harry's. By the way Harry does not serve croque monsieur at lunch! Only as a snack during off dining hours.If the shops she reviews are as poorly done as these hotels and reatuarants I don't think I will take the trouble to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Don't bother buying this book. First, none of the Born To Shop books get updated much between editions, so lots of information is out of date. Second, Suzy Gershman is totally out of touch with reality. I took a shopping tour to Italy with a company called Shop Around Tours and obviously a lot of us had this book. The tour leader warned us not to pay too much attention to it and she was right. BUT we went to Mantero, which is one of the places mentioned in the book, and it was great. Otherwise, the people that went off on their own following Suzy's wild goose chases were very disappointed. So the shopping in Italy was great, but this book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I agree with many of the other comments here. There are glaring errors all throughout this book, as well as the other Born To Shop books. If you have an older edition, there's no need to buy the new one, as there has been almost nothing updated.

I bought this book after a first year seminary Biblical Hebrew class and while I am the first to admit that I am no expert in Biblical Hebrew, I cannot say that I would recommend this book to anyone.

He focused on other outbreaks of witch hysteria other than Salem in 1692, and this proved to the book's only strong point. Salem is the best known outbreak of mass hysteria relating to witchcraft in Colonial America, but it was not the only one. Some outbreaks were simply accusations against 1 or 2 people at most. Other outbreaks may have seen several people accused, but not on the scale of Salem. I give this book a \\"1-star\\" rating simply because Amazon does not have one for \\"0-star\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book friggin' sucks","review":"This is absolutely one of the most boring books I have ever been subjected to in my life. I only had to read 5 chapters of it for a class, it was truly one of the worst experiences of my life. Seriously, save yourself, stay away from this book if you have a choice. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This game is pretty good. Its graphics arent great, and you need a pretty good computer to run it. If you like The Matrix movies its worth having because now its price has dropped! And with the DVD version you dont have to wait half an hour wile installing the four disks of the original version. Its too bad you can only play as Niobe and Ghost though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called Enter a headache","review":"It is more trouble than it is worth. You can't even play as Neo or Trinity. The major problem is that Niobi and Ghost who you can play as are hard to control it is like they do the opposite of what you say. And dont even talk about the System slow down it makes your system become a paper weight ... so dont buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"forget the matrix","review":"I am running an advanced machine and so the only flaw I had was a loss of the cross hairs as I played, which wouldn't be a big issue if the third person game play didn't make it impossible to shoot. I was able to resort to using martial arts. But in all honesty I felt that this game had a hitman 1 quality in its game play. Well intentioned...but ultimately failed. Better off getting max payne 2 and actually getting fun game play and a decent story. If you are a matrix fan...stay a fan and rent the original matrix and avoid the video game. Sorry to the makers, but i couldn't in good consciousness recommend this game to anyone, of any age, or any skill level."},{"rating":"1","title":"shit game of the year","review":"first of all let me tell you that the game is a rip off and why you ask ok frist the game come's in DVD-ROM and what happen's if you don't have a dvd-rom tough for the buyer ok most people have the late'ts mode's like Pent III to pent 4 computer and the best graph's card but my best tip for all people is to bye a PS2 OR XBOX XBOX-360 and at lest you don't get your computer crashing when playing games on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome but could have been perfect","review":"the graphics are normal,the controls are easy to get used to,focus is the best,interesting hacking engine,good combos,unusual story,the game does not slow my computer down, and i only have p4 2.4 ghz and loading times are extremely short (less than a minute per load). p.s if you use cheats use enemies cant see to win easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been more fun...","review":"Enter the Matrix isn't a terrible game, but it is sort of a rip-off of Max Payne with some of the neat time-slowing tricks you can do. Another problem is that it crashed repeatedly on my desktop. And also I could only get the sound to work about a third of the times I played it. I might try playing it again now that I have a newer video card, but so far I'm not sure if even that will fix the no-sound buisiness. No patch has been released yet. If one has and I don't know about it shout it out at me! I would have given this game three stars if I didn't have these sound and crashing issues.In the end, the movies were wayyyyyyy better."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"...Matrix\\" is synonymous with FRUSTRATION","review":"I bought the DVD version of the game, played for about an hour, then had my high-end comp crash mid level. Since then every other level I can play one in normal mode, and the next 2 or 3 in safe mode. I don't know if anyone else has these issues but there's no technical support on a high-end comp crashing at the start of every other level..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print Artist Gold I am not happy with","review":"it worked fairly well when I had windows 95 but I got alot of GPF's with that software and blue screens. It is not a friendly software to other clip art software. Now I cannot use it at all on windows XP in fear that it would crash it. The system freezes and locks up when I scan. I cannot import/export or select a twain driver. But I want to leave off saying that Technical support is a joke. All I got was run around automation, with no way to email or to contact a live person. I got bad tech numbers- which leads me to an operator saying that the numbers have changed and is no longer in service and all of this is on sierra's website which now deals with gaming materialI cannot get an update, because it does not download. bottom line is think hard to pick a software and you cannot reach any support at all!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not entirely happy","review":"the package says for beginners(and I'm as beginner as they get), I was first dissappointed that there was not a user manual. A quick reference card is not that useful for a beginner. The tutorial does not answer any questions that I may have about using the program. Needless to say I am a little disappointed but I will figure it out eventually. If there is a manual available I would like to have it cause it would make using the program a little easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave us alone and send more money","review":"The previous reviewer is exactly right. Leave us alone and send more money is the only answer Bracey finds viable. A shame that he devotes himelf so desperately to trying to find ways to avoid the mountains of evidence against the system which has failed so many kids so badly and not to finding solutions.Does he really believe the current situation is acceptable? Perhaps it is not as bad as the statistics show in his non inner city experience. Unfortunately, I don't even believe this is completely true. I think he just doesn't want to see the questions because he, and the other defenders of the education status quo, are afraid of the answers.It is also laughable that he feels supporters of his position (which includes, presumably, the teachers under so much criticism) are so hapless they actually need a step by step guide to dodging the questions they should be asking themselves and the reality they see everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monolithic Drivel","review":"It continues to amaze me that evidence, whether it be anecdotal or data driven, is systematically ignored (in step) by educrats who refuse to accept a shred of criticism, and in turn, refuse to change their ways. \\"Leave us alone and send more money!\\" is the monotonous message of this book, and Bracey will tell educators (who apparently are incapable of thinking for themselves), step by step how to do it. There is nothing more annoying than an educator who argues against education. Gosh, who needs to be smart anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"notable departure from form of first book, a good read","review":"this book is a notable departure from the byzantine political and familial entanglements of Shadowline, becoming a much more straight forward Cook military sci-fi story with some mystery elements involved. It brings one character forward, Mosato Storm, from shadowline, along with his colleague, as they work for Fleet Intelligence to penetrate the starfishers.Great Cook work, can only find it used though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This book would make an excellent textbook for a beginning ceramics class. It covers a wide breadth of topics and is clearly written and easy to understand. For experienced potters it is a good choice for a overall studio resource. One of the things that I like most is that the examples of artists works shown have a decidedly European bent; it is nice to see the work of different artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really is the \\"Complete\\" potter's book!!","review":"I recently got this book for my dad, a new potter, who absolutely LOVES it. He takes classes several times a week at a local potter's guild, but uses this book often to supplement as a teaching aid for more in-depth instruction. The pages are colorful and glossy, and the instructions/techniques outlined are easy to understand. I'm so glad I took a chance and purchased this book!!"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],x={key:0},M={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=m("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(H,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-bdf5ba3f"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/15.md","filePath":"quotesmag/15.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/15.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
