It does cut their fine, fine hair very nicely, however, it is made of plastic and will not hold up very well if you ever drop it - even on soft ground. Also, it is a little too small for me to grip comfortably, probably why I dropped it when one of my bunnies was moving.So, no, this is not for me. I have Oster A-5 Turbos that I use on my Angora Goats, and have dropped them numerous times while shearing, and they keep on going.

The last Wahl Arco SE clipper I bought, fell apart after three months. In all my years of grooming I have never seen anything like it.

The speakers are bigger than expected and don't come with mounting bracket/arms. The speakers have metal clip on the back where you can put them flat on the wall with a nail or a screw. So this means you can't control the angle at which they point.

It has HDMI inputs and outputs, BUT THEY DON'T PASS AUDIO! The whole beauty of HDMI is one cable for everything, but ONKYO has only added the plugs to fool you into buying their unit. You still have to use the regular audio plugs, in addition to the HDMI cable. If I had known this, I never would have bought it. I wasted a whole day trying to get it to work, because ONKYO isn't honest enough to warn you about this in the manual. This system is great overall, so it's a shame that some sleazy executive chose the low road, and resorted to misleading us like this. I'll never buy another ONKYO products again: you can't trust people qho behave like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this system!","review":"I had researched every website I could find for reviews on all the HTIB and I finally found the one!

I have a 52 inch Sony XBR Bravia, PS3 and Silver Onkyo HT-SR800(S)set up for my home theater now and couldn't be happier. I was going to buy a $3500 system from Best Buy but I couldn't see spending that much after hearing one of these bad boys... Mix the price with Free Shipping to HAWAII for $400 total on a 100lb system, WOW!They only problem I had was the back left speaker didn't work when I got it. All I had to do is call their support center and they sent me a new one, no problem. I bought new speaker wire for it so if it makes a big difference i'll be even happier.If you are anything like me and have big aspirations w/o the big purse, buy this system!!!

It has made a big difference in the overall experience. The Onkyo system was extremely easy to set up. The wires and assorted hardware were all appropriate to the task. Calibration was perhaps the most enjoyable part of the whole enterprise. Simply placing the supplied microphone in three listening positions and letting the calibration program do its thing resulted in a totally balanced system that produced excellent sound immediately without any additional balance settings. This is definitely a fine system that was completely thought out by Onkyo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly rated in Consumer Reports.","review":"Onkyo HT-SR800S 7.1 Home Theater Entertainment System (Silver)Awesome. The only regret for me is aesthetics since it is much larger than \\"some members of the family\\" would have liked. I chose Silver since it blends in better than black. The sound quality is great and beats out the 2 other 5.1 surround sound systems I've had for years. Anyone can plug in the speakers, because they're color coded and have ample length, unless you keep it in the Back of the room like I do. If you do that, maybe because of a projector, be prepared with some extra speaker wire, or just use your own throughout. There are plenty of hookups, including HDMI which can seriously reduce the need for cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive system at an impressive price","review":"If you're looking at an easy-to-setup, all-in-one home theater audio system that delivers, you can't go very wrong with this. Output at >100W/channel is adequate for a good-sized room. Subwoofer delivers the sub-sonic punches nicely. Front and center channels are crisp and clear. The av amplifier has enough listening modes for almost every imaginable kind of audio. It's definitely not the best out there but for its price, it is hard to beat. The only flaw I've found so far is a slight hum coming from the sub-woofer. You can hear it even when it is on standby leading me to believe it is a transformer hum. This in no way takes away the listening pleasure though. Just a little annoyance when you walk into a room that's supposed to be quiet and you hear this hum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Set of Speakers + AMP","review":"It has all that you need: 1080p HDMI switching, digitial audio inputs (coax and optical) that can be assigned to any input.

This has so much more functionality, although the speakers here are monstrously large (not exactly bookshelf!). Only odd thing is that the the sub goes idle (red light) if the volume is below a surprisingly loud level. Some have noted the low quality (and length) of the speaker wires, I replaced the rear only to 18g due to length but do not feel sound is compromised by the stock wires. Still, for the money this unit is a great value. Read the manual, take your time, all will work in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Fine audio system for those with lots of space for speakers. Excellent bargain.

It's more of the same. More of the same flat, stale grooves and memory-defying melodies that have been his stock in trade since the Gold Experience, his last worthwile recording, in my opinion. If you, like me, remember when Prince made music that was clever, challenging, and exciting, then pass on this. You will definitely be disappointed. Most of the Artist's problems with WB were his former label's reluctance to let him release as much music as he wanted, whenever he wanted...if albums like Rave are the results of his \\"emancipation\\", then, as I said, maybe Warners was right after all!

Yuck.","review":"When did Prince go from deliriously inventive artist to mediocre R&B hack? After the grandslam of Sign of the Times, Lovesexy, and Grafitti Bridge, I thought he could do no wrong. Turns out he can do nothing but. After spending the 1980s being one of the biggest Prince fans ever to walk the Earth, I've spent the 1990s hoping that his next CD will be his renaissance. But sadly, each CD released that I dupe myself into buying is worst than the last, with absolutely no inspritation, ingenuity, or music sensibility to be found. Listen to \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" from Sign of the Times for a perfect example of Prince's former talents compared to his current songwriting crisis. It's a sad loss for me, but I don't like Prince's music anymore, nor do I appreciate a diatribe about the inhumanity of lamb's wool on the CD case. Oh well, no one can stay on top of their game forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal: Tries to sound hip and still thinks he can rap!","review":"I can think of twelve songs he wrote in the 1980s that are both unreleased and much better than the insipid pap on this CD. Some artists stop making records when they get to be about 40 years old. Some continue, but no longer have hits because they don't sound cool to the 15 year olds. Then there's Prince. He threatens to retire every five years but releases albums that are neither mature nor appeal to the under 20 crowd. I used to look forward to a new Prince album -- and I bought them all (since 1984) on the first day (including this one). Never again. There is too much truly good music out there to waste my ears on this CD. There will never be another Prince. Sadly, 0+> is just a parody of Prince.When I see Mohammed Ali, I feel sorry for a man who clearly didn't know when to give up. Prince has done little but embarrass himself for years now. He is completely out of touch and I hope one day he'll realize that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon reviewers, what am I missing?","review":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!

Why is he so bent on producing a \\"Top 40\\" hit and trying to sound \\"current?\\" This is when he fails the most. Dude, you can't rap! Stop trying.

Other great songs include \\"Hot wit u\\" with Eve and \\"Baby Knows\\" with Sheryl Crow. Thank you Prince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better","review":"When I've heard The Greatest Romance Ever Sold on the radio, I was amazed with The Artist's new song, i really liked it ! After I bought the CD and listened to it, I had to admit that it's not his best work. I am a BIG Prince fan, I have all his albums, and just cannot say to Rav Un2 ... that it's as good as eg. Emancipation, Chaos And Disorder or Come which I really like ... Of course the songs are quite good, but could be better, I mean sometimes I have the feeling when I am listening to the tracks that there are less instruments used that it should have. The best songs I think are Undisputed, Everyday is a Winding Road, Baby Knows and Wherever You Go, Whatever You Do. Songs like Strange But True really disappoint me ... But I just cannot give 3 stars to this album, because it's not bad and it is far better than 3 stars, but less good as his previous works with NPG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost...","review":"Don't believe the hype. Coming from a huge prince fan, this album is incredibly mediocre. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you nuts?","review":"Yet another bunch of vault-cleaning leftovers. This is horrible.

I gave up on the real thing. Rave isn't bad,(I do like \\"Greatest Romance Sold\\") but it isn't as good as some of these die-hard Prince fans who are reveiwing this CD is making it out to be! This is certainly not something that deserves five stars! Prince is beyond this...Or so I thought. Whatever happened to that delicious, innovative and beautiful music he used to make? Even his live concerts are starting to stink! I guess that all I can do now is curl up to his past legendary work and look out for other artists who are reviving the Purple One's old sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal effort.","review":"A most disappointing effort. Prince clearly has lost the ability to create uptempo music. He is turning into a falsetto Luther Vandross. All of the non-ballads are terrible. His use of 'celebrities' was poor. Chuck D was not used to the best of his abilities. And Pretty Man? I think I'd rather hear Morris Day sing it. I loved most of the ballads, with the exception of the 'Greatest Romance Ever Sold', which is too generic. This CD is only slightly better that the Vault.What happened to the creativity and innovations that drew me to Prince? And to think, I'm a diehard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Definitely worth the wait...there's a lean, funky vibe throughout this CD. \\"Hot Wit U\\" with Eve had me pushing replay on my CD player over and over again....\\"So Far, So Pleased\\", while not his best rock record, is still a rousing number that's addictive...and \\"Baby Knows\\" is fantastic! U can tell Micheal B is playin' drums on that track, and the singing is hard and fierce...I hope it gets released as a single, cuz I'd love to hear it on the radio. All in all, a huge thumbs up. Falls a little short of the best of his '80s stuff, but ranks right up there--if not above--Gold Experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The final blowup of a once promising career","review":"This is another in a long line of below average to average releases from Prince. Prince (as he once again wants to be know as) no longer makes great albums. Unfortunately, he has also lost the ability to write good singles too. His remaining talent is that he is incredible live. Save your money for his next concert.At 43, Prince would seem to be running out of chances to pull out of the death-spiral his career is in. Efforts like \\"Rave\\" are not helpful. Even the presence of popular artists like Sheryl Crow weren't enough to keep this uninspired mess on the charts. If he is not careful, he might be remembered for the past ten or so forgettable releases rather than the brilliant first ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and desperate","review":"prince was bad in the 80's and lost in the 90's.this album is a bad joke .two things why the guest artists? and why the covers?he needs wendy&lisa back.being prolific has become a decade pain.one or two good songs but alot of filler.none of these songs are on level with his 80's output.and for the folks who say you are living in the past check out who is credited with the production i rest my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best ever, but come on give the guy a break","review":"Im really suprised at some of the one and two star reviews if read here. This is one of his best releases in recent memory. Not a classic like Sign o' the Times, or The Gold Experience, but this is definatley filled with a lot of energy and funk. In my mind, no other artist even comes close to keeping up with his music ( and yes I am a huge music fan, with over 1000 cd's). To this day, he is the most exciting performer around, and a true original. So come on people, try and keep up... he blew me away in the 80's, a genius in the 90's and this is a great start to Y2K Best tracks are The Sun the Moon and the Stars, Prettyman(very funny and funky), and the title track. If only the world would catch up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT WITH HIM.....","review":"Just when we thought His Highness had lost his purple touch, he goes and fulfills his promise to rock us!

Pretenders take note!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic!","review":"He's returned to form with a collection of tunes he seems passionate about. I think he's finally struck a balance between business issues and creativity. So Far, So Pleased/The Greatest Romance.../The Sun, Moon and Stars/Silly Game/Pretty Man, all make welcome additions to his songbook. I also love what he did with Sheryl Crow's Everyday Is A Winding Road. It has a sound that straddles the late 70's into the 80's, and could have come off Dr.Buzzard's Savannah Band album. So folks have slighted this cover, but just tuen off the lights and put on the headphones, it will all be made clear. Without question, from start to finish, it's his best album this decade. Rave on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it totally blew me away","review":"I think the 'Artist' has made some of the finest music of all time and this is definiteley no exeption. So many people give him a hard time but if they could just listen to those beautiful songs like 'I love you but I don't trust you anymore' or the funkiest tunes like 'pretty man' they would be screaming for more. I wish I could give ten stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salute the Sarge","review":"A one-album deal with Arista Records was slated to be a solid comeback album for Prince, though company president Clive Davis really cluttered things up with guest performances that makes it seem like a tribute to the artist.The 18 tracks (clocking in at 73:50) are a mixed bag due to the collaborative nature - artists appearing include Sheryl Crow, Gwen Stefani, Eve and Ani DiFranco - with the single, The Greatest Romance Ever Sold, limping in at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The second of two \\"hidden\\" tracks, the funky Pretty Man, is the standout, as Maceo Parker sizzles on the sax.One year later, Prince released a remix of the album on his Internet subscription service. He symbolically showed his displeasure with Arista by \\"smashing\\" the CD at the end of his album. That action speaks clearly on Prince's \\"appreciation\\" of the meddling by another major record label, this time on what could have been a true comeback."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Royal Badness on Autopilot","review":"After the stunning excellence of \\"The Gold Experience\\" and \\"Emancipation,\\" Prince's first Arista release is a total bust. The bland, directionless \\"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\\" (1999) does not contain a single noteworthy track and evaporates from memory. However, prolific musical geniuses are entitled to the occasional misfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"Undderrated, exciting and utterly danceable, this CD was an example of Prince trying new things. It's a fascinating bridge between his megahit albums of the '80s and his safer, mellower tunes of recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"This band is freaking amazing. the only reason i rated it four stars instead of five is because it is there first album and i have a feeling the best is yet to come.

The performance IS electrifying. Guess in way you couldn't find a better live audience for The Man in Black. Who doesn't love Johnny Cash? His music connects with people across the planet from all kinds of backgrounds and people that might have almost nothing more in common than they like Johnny Cash. The Folsom Prison recording was my first real introduction to Johnny Cash while riding down highways and country roads through Appalachian foothills to do some backpacking with friends. It was a perfect listening experience and haven't forgotten how much I enjoyed it to this day. This performance will always be in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Cash","review":"This magical recording of Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is a warts and all live recording in front of several hundred plus prisoners in January 1968. The atmosphere is electric, with frequent shouts and spontaneous applause and whistles from the crowd. Even some of the official prison announcements are left in the recordings.Highlights are many as Cash has chosen his set carefully with the audience in mind. So '25 minutes to go' (a reference to the electric chair), 'Cocaine Blues' and his own 'Fulsom Prison Blues' are all brilliant performances.I first heard Johnny Cash through his later American recordings. These are great albums but on the last three or four his voice getting weaker after each album. The difference in his voice here is pretty startling and he puts it to great use.The CD is very well packaged with interesting sleeve notes by Cash, written in 1999 and also by Steve Earle. There are also plenty of stills from the show itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time country classic.","review":"This is Johhny's historic 1968 live show restored to its original order and UNCENSORED. It also contains an impressive cd booklet with many photographs taken throughout the day of the performance. This cd also contains unpublished material as well as three peviously unreleased tracks.

Johnny Cash brought stone-hard country music to the masses back then and he is clearly still doing it today. This is an album that belongs in every collection of popular American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC CASH RECORDING!","review":"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about \\"Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison,\\" which is one of the most impressive albums ever recorded. Johnny Cash was an American legend, and this album proved that he could indeed put on a heck of a live show, especially in front of a crowd of 2000 inmates. Not much else needs to be said, except that this is a fantastic album that belongs in anyone's collection of great music.Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk the Line with Johnny","review":"I have always liked Johnny Cash as a casual listener having few songs in my library and no CD's in my collection. After seeing Walk the Line recently I needed to hear what he was really saying in his music. This CD has opened up my perception of both the man and his music. It is fun and from what I can tell has a great mix of his songs that I have been enjoying since cracking open the seal!

Similar but a little disappointing. But this recording is an exception. Johnny's patter with the cons, the quiet noise in the background of prison speakers and cells opening and closing all add an amazing amount of atmosphere. Ive recommended this to cure fans and black flag fans, everyone loves it, spend the 12 dollars for a slice of heaven"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never gets old.","review":"There is a reason this ablum is still on the top 100 of my list.

Hope you can see my review and accepted my childish apology.I recommend Carrie underwood's Some Hearts together with this. they will make a perfect match in your two-disc player set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poser Cash","review":"Honestly, I don't find much here to like. With a few exceptions (e.g. Jackson)the songs all sound pretty much the same and it's tough to make it through the whole album as a result. This leaves the album to stand on its lyrics which paint a colorful picture of Cash's life as a violent criminal. Of course, Cash wasn't a violent criminal, he's just another musician who got strung out on drugs. So here we have a recovering addict playing the role of a violent felon in an attempt to seem \\"real\\" to his audience of violent felons. This makes the whole thing seem really fake to me and sad for Cash when I give this album a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about dying and jail","review":"I hated it but I already knew that I bought it for my husband who is in love with it. the songs are all about dying and jail time and one about killing a Dog for easting eggs. But hey it is old fashioned country."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible!","review":"the level of intensity in this cd is just monumental. Cash's deep baritone is the best element of the music, making it connect with the listener in a deep way. My favorite song is \\"greystone chapel,\\" deep and hopeful and probably the best representation of what this cd is all about. This is Cash's defining moment arguably, and is an essential in any collection, especially for fans of country music. Even if you have an aversion to country music you should check this out; it is so much better and really raw and rocking compared to modern day country (which is a joke)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you are looking for a LIVE DVD.","review":"Do not buy this if you are looking for a LIVE DVD, or really if you are looking for ANY LIVE performance shot with Cash at Folsom. This is a doc,and most of the songs featured on the DVD are supported by graphic \\"eye-candy\\" and are quite dull. It is an ok doc, but they clearly had nothinghistoric to start with and jammed this thing together to have something to sell with the CD's. All Folsom footage is modern day b-roll. Truly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"live 69!","review":"its hard to believe this album was done 30 years ago! its as powerful now as it was then.its raw,and to the point,you wont see any country stars past or present doing a live album with so much emotion! a must buy for any true country fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Fun","review":"It's an appreciative audience and a loose Johnny Cash that makes this CD so wonderful. He totally connects with this crowd of inmates and the songs are so funny, sad, and basically, they are a mix of country and blues that is completely missing today. You should get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash before a captive (literally) audience","review":"This is a magnificent recording from the days before country and western became indistinguishable from bad pop music. Johnny Cash, whose own life was pretty hard and dirty at times, commands the respect of his audience and establishes a rapport with them that few entertainers could achieve. Not surprisingly, a number of the songs are about prison life. Country songs often deal in maudlin sentimentality, but great performers like Cash sell these songs because you just know they mean every word of it. This version presents the full set, preserving Cash's banter with the spectators and including several minutes during which the tape was apparently left running, allowing us to listen in on snatches of conversation from the milling crowd, announcements over the prison PA system, and other sounds that make this a valuable record of an extraordinary time and show."},{"rating":"2","title":"live johnny cash","review":"its hard to believe this album was done 30 years ago!its as powerful now as it was then.its raw,and to the point,you wont see any country stars past or present doing a live album with so much love and emotion as this. a must buy for any true country music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crucible of Cash's powers","review":"Although hoarse on several tracks, and the presence of asmall # of duds, the force of this live performance resonateswith character, humor, and pride.

At times he plays it up a little bit much with the inmates, but overall one great performance after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed in Prison!","review":"I don't think anyone should be rewarding a convict by buying an album they made while incarcerated. Plus this music is depressing, isn't fun and doesn't rock. He even has an song glorifying Cocaine! While I'm sure Motley Crew and Warrant did there fair share of Cocaine at least they rocked and stayed out of prison. Plus the guitar solos are boring and use no effects like a wah wah peddle. Not recommended for fans who want to ROCK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny Cash","review":"The dvd was disappointing as I thought it was the actual concert. It in fact was a documentary with very little actual footage of the concert. The music qualtiy was also very poor. One cd does have the music the other is mostly talking. Had I looked into it more I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison","review":"Although Johnny Cash had performed at Folsom Prison before, this was a groundbreaking concert as it was recorded to be released as a live album. That it became hugely successful is already known. The Man in Black knew his audience and played songs that appealed to the population in Folsom. I confess that I prefer the follow up album, Johnny Cash at San Quentin, to this one. Yet the risk that Cash took in releasing a prison album to the general public needs to be acknowledged.My favorite cut on this album is \\"Jackson\\". Anytime Johnny and June sang together was a thing to behold. I can highly recommend Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison to any Cash fan or anyone who loves good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good cabaret mix","review":"I enjoy the openness of Cermele's voice. I took a chance on him with this album and altho I Remember You is a great opening(there are a few alarming scoops I needed to hear more than once to attenuate), I didn't really kick into it until he launches into Come On A My House and tickles As Long As I Live and A Sleepin' Bee into life. He also tackles the chestnut My Shining Hour, which I didn't even care for when Joan Leslie sang it in WWII, but Charles has a way with a ballad. If you must have uptempo songs dominate your taste, this isn't the album for you. However, the man has considerable charm and I'd love to see him live on the cabaret scene in New York. In lieu of his presence, it's a great cabaret 'soundtrack'. Good job,Charles:>"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Ask Me Again' and I'll say no","review":"I bought this CD because I loved the classic songs, but what a boring, bland album. Mr. Cermele seems to sing most everything (''I Remember You,'' ''Blues in the Night,'' 'My Shining Hour,'' etc.) in the same monotonous baritone at the same slow and draggy tempo. The only cut I liked was ''Come on a My House'' because it had some life. Otherwise, ''Ask Me Again'' put me to asleep; I would, however, recommend it to anyone with insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong one","review":"It was supposed to be 7A....and the package and receipt says that...but 5A was delivered.

Little did I know that this rather obscure artist would have a profound impact on my life!! My 2-year-old girl prefers Papillion to every other children's artist we've tried. We must listen to this CD DAILY. One of the other reviewers made a comment that it reminded him/her of Barney, and I can see why. This is good music, but heard with a 2-year-old's desired frequency of repetition, it can really get under an adult's skin, much the same way that Barney can. But the point of buying childrens' music is not to make adults comfortable - it's to entertain a child. In that respect, this works, and the only hope for me personally is that Papillion will come out with a follow-up CD so that we can at least have greater variety...."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the \\"Reggae for Kids\\", I thought I'd add another favorite music style (Cajun) to our collection.

What meaning a person gives to the phraseology can only be conjucture and is limited by the capacity of the intellect, meanwhile, the imagination runs rampant, hopefully, to open the door to higher intuitional knowing.

The rest of the gun was plastic. Very cheap. Very disappointing. I could have purchased this same unit at home depot for much less.Note that the 1-star rating is not due to the performance of the unit as I never bothered to use it.

Put it this way, unless you are using this to water your plants forget using this machine. Anything you attempt to spray through this must have the consistancy of filtered drinking water.

Today's tell-all world sees camp as largely a quaintly archaic coping mechanism of yore; this book, with its provocative photos, sly, gossipy text, and astonishing breadth of subject, makes one wish it were not so. For here the flamboyant shares the stage with the subtly subversive. Where else could one find Hemingway and Oscar Wilde sharing equal billing? Where else could the Bright Young Things of 1920's England find themselves in close proximity to the rock group the Kinks? This book offers the kind of sophisticated, flashy wit, dreamy sensuousness, and naughty kinks that are in scant supply in our overblown, overexplicit, media-mad world nowadays.

Honestly, I leave tightly packed products in my toilet that are more interesting and stimulating than this...If you are seriously considering purchasing this product, you should seriously consider investing in health insurance for your children too, as they might have seizures and fall into comas after hearing such densly packed crap emmitting from a speaker.

If I were allowd to I would personally see to it that the Kidz Bop never destroy another song ever again. If you agree with me, then I'm very glad to know that so many people care and that so many people perfer quality over mass production.PS I'm Sorry for this being so long, but I had to say /something/ about those flippin' Kidz who are just about as good as *censored*."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE IT STOP!! PLEEEASE MAKE IT STOP!!","review":"Oh my god!! These songs are SO annoying that it would be the worst form of torture in the world to have to listen to them all! The original artists should just sue them or not give them premission to sing there songs because they are THAT bad.Take Jessey Mccartney for example...I hated him and his songs to begin with but to hear these childrens ugly little voices screaming the lyrics make me hate it even more (if thats possible), and then they do the WORST thing possible...they sing Alicia Keys, HOW CAN THEY DO THAT!!The original artists aren't even on this CD (as if they'd disgrace themselves by doing so). These kids cant sing, the orginal artists aren't even on here, they change the words to make it \\"better\\" (dosent work) and they absolutly RUIN the songs we know and love.If you want to keep your hearing....DO NOT and I mean do NOT buy this CD..EVER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's No Point In These","review":"Yes, it's nice to have kid appropriate music. But, there's no point in having these songs re-recorded by a bunch of random people pulled off the streets. If you want these songs, buy the originals and burn them on a CD. However, I don't recommend teh \\"Now\\" series either, due to the fact that lately, they've been pretty bad, although the early installments are decent.

Like what you hear on the radio? Don't feel like getting any of the Now That's What I Call Music compilations? Want to replace the vocals with kids screaming? Well, we've got just the plan! It's the Kidz Bop series! It attracts youngsters because of the intentionally added Z, AND IT'S TILTED! It's too cool to conform with the group, it's a rebel!I don't see how taking out vocals of popular songs, and replacing with screaming brats and some older person who sounds nothing like the actual singer attracts anyone. If you want to have your children grow up on the Top 40, so be it. But please, for the love of god, HAVE THEM LISTEN TO THE ACTUAL SONG!! I was against Kidz Bop from the start, and I've only gotten more and more angry at it (because it's gone out of hand).

Many parents are upset that everybody says Kidz Bop is bad becasue of language issues. I'm not flippin' saying /that/!

Some of these songs shouldn't even be remade for kids by these \\"singers.\\" (For example, from album 8 of this series, Boulevard of Broken Dreams.)

It's almost mocking those songs. Most of the songs [correct me if I'm wrong] weren't even that \\"dirty\\" in the first place! If you want children's music, buy them ORIGINAL CHILDREN'S MUSIC.

The commercials are beyond annoying and make me want to throw my TV out the window. They get kids to sing the songs instead of the real artists and the airbrushed, talentless brats ruin some great pop songs I love. Instead of KB, I reccomend the NOW, That's what I call music series. The songs are wel selected, sung by the original artists, wont break your eardrums, and never have the dreaded \\"Parental Advisory\\" on them so they are very rarely inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidz Plop","review":"This c.d is a pile of crap. I feel bad for the kids who have to later in life say that their voices were on a c.d this bad. I also question the morals of the artists who give the rights to these songs. I am a die-hard modest mouse fan, and love their earlier work as well as good news... but letting kids tear apart your song is terrible. If you want your kids to listen to clean music either get them edited c.d's or make them listen to kids songs. Not actual artists songs being belted out by pre teen nobodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"maybe i don't understand this series of kid's albums because i unfortunately, had to grow up on my parent's harsh beatles records... so, i end up feeling badly about this kid's album in two ways: (1)sorry for children raised in households that willingly subject them to this, and (2) disgust at pop cultural soul rot. this makes more sense as a parody album for drunk adults than something honest for kids. why does everything have to be dumbed down in order for it to be marketed towards children? if you want your children to be raised on wonder bread and think like a loaf of the same, play'em this. if something is true to the human condition it doesn't have to be targeted toward a particular demographic; it would appeal on some level to everyone. there's no way to prevent your kids from physicaly growing up, but this sure can retard their mental development. just make sure to put \\"my boo\\" on repeat. oh yeah, and i think walmart sells thongs with cartoon themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY THIS IN A TRILLION YEARS","review":"THIS CD IS TOTAL TRASH.I LISTENED TO LETS GET IT STARTED FOR EXAMPLE AND THEIR ARE HORRIBLE VOICES THAT MAKE ME LAUGH OR JUST YELL TURN THIS GARBAGE OFF AND OUT OF SITGHT.WHEN THE WEIRD VOICED KIDS JOIN IN THEIR ARE JUST YELLING OUT THE LYRICS AND MAKE THE SONG EVEN WORSE.BUY THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS INSTEAD.

They can't sing very well; their recordings of the songs often stray from the music itself; and the lyrics are rarely the same.I understand the purpose of Kidz Bop Kids is to sell CLEAN versions of popular songs, but it is possible (especially with iTunes) to buy clean verisons of the songs sung by the real singers. A \\"bleep\\" is much better than a half-thrown attempt to replace a swear word with something sounding similar or \\"criminal record\\" with \\"school record.\\"What is wrong with singing \\"criminal record says I broke in twice\\" anyways?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary... Is All That Can Be Said","review":"Holy.. I never knew how twisted up a song could get from it's original version. Now I know. First of all, the main female vocals? I'm sorry, but it sounds like it's being sung by a 45 year old woman. And when you add the kid's voices, it's like a wave of voices crashing down on you. I mean, it would be ok if the kids' voices blended in with each other's. But they don't. So these songs are basically, crap versions. You're better off buying the originals and finding the clean versions of the songs that are.. Ahem, unclean.

I get a kick out of hearing this and seeing the reactions from radio listeners as their \\"Numba one hit\\" is completely demolished. Mainstream music has sunk to a new low with this and I love it!

It is written in the classic style of children's book with magnificently executed elaborate illustrations. Here we witness not just the depths of the Nazi hatred but also their great skill in poisoning the minds of the very young.As for the particular product itself, I must say that I was disappointed. I have seen an actual edition of this book on display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (of course in the original German). Several years ago, I was able to print out a full color copy of it, in English translation, from a neo-Nazi website.

At first, IRC was mostly for bulletin board users. But as the Web took off, it also greatly expanded the pool of users and the extent of the Internet's physical reach. Now Mutton shows how today's IRC has so much more than that 1988 version. Being able to format messages, or colour them. Hey, you can even send and get sounds, in various common sound formats like wav files.Numerous of his hacks revolve around managing an IRC channel. Problems of success, really. As IRC usage soared, what were once small communities of shared interests and values now often have to contend with others with different values. Channel operators may want to check out what Mutton offers.Perhaps the most intriguing hack concerns finding social networks from many channels. Neat possibilities. Social networks are quite hot these days, though no one has yet found a viable business model centred on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful collection of tips and tidbits","review":"IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an overlooked means of communication in this era of instant messaging, texting on cell phones, networking sites and the like. Yet IRC remains a great source for on-the-spot and authoritative technical knowledge and help; leisure time socializing and just observing how many nutty people there are online. (Some of the poltical, religious and other IRC channels are absolutely hilarious to observe.)Relatively few of the tips and hacks in this book will be of use to the ordinary IRC user. Most presume a modest proficiency in programming Java or Perl and a more than modest understanding of how IRC works. Still, even though the book will not be of great use to most IRC users, it is still worth a read if for no other reason than to expand your own knowledge of IRC and what can be done with it.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is very biased about his articles","review":"I have just read an article on slashdot on how the author has \\"analysed\\" IRC networks and concluded 99.9% of the traffic from the top 60 channels is illegal.

It is impossible to use this tool without inadvertently turning it off. It is one of the most annoying tools I have ever used. It does, however, do a decent job of dustless sanding, but at a stiff price both in money and comfort. Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Bosch 6 inch random orbit sander model 1250 DEVS. I bought the Bosch at the same time and use it over the Fein 9 times out of 10. And the Bosch is $500.00 cheaper.

Christopher Lee graces the film as a werewolf hunter on the trail of a wolf clan, and other than that there isn't much else to the story; just cheesy gore, werewolf sex, and Sybil Danning's large endowments. Just as the next Howling sequels would be (believe it or not they get progressively worse as they go on), it's all downhill from here, and if you've seen the original Howling and have never seen any of the sequels, don't expect anything good at all from this cheese fest directed by Philippe Mora.

It does have a couple of scary moments, not-bad though very brief makeup effects, also some well-done locations, production design, and photography (and a heavy use of New Wave-y music on the soundtrack if you're into that); this is sabotaged by wooden acting from almost everybody involved, a REALLY idiotic script which either makes no sense or seems as though it came from a comic book, and some really strange, choppy editing that renders a few parts incoherent.

Her rip away bra scene is shown over and over again at the end of the movie. The reason for this is because it is the only special effect worth watching. Sybil is one Amazing Beautiful Woman! Anyhow Reb and Christopher go to Transylvania and try to stop Sybil from having her werewolf clan take over the world.

Some quick highlights:1) Lots of good wolf kills, albeit you have to sit through most of the movie to get to them.2) The Ina Klina twins getting eaten, very good camp humor.3) Christopher Lee, just being scary.4) Weird wolf sex, that I'm positive, introduced sexual dysfunction in one of my friends.Defiantly a good movie for teenagers that are board and stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"April showers lead to May flowers","review":"April is a graphic design genius, so it's hard to go wrong with the subject matter of this book.

The nice thing about this book is that it covers her work in the 90's, and while the web stuff doesn't shine - her print work and dish sets are damn good. Sadly the book doesn't capture her magic as it's rather on the small side - so you can't see all of that wonderful detail that April has in her work. In the end this book is a good appetizer, but it leaves you wanting a full meal. However it will make a good addition to your personal library, and it would make a nice gift for a creative friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brewer's Yeast from Vitamin Shoppe","review":"Excelente! realmente ayuda a evitar la caida del pelo!!Excellent!

The world of the hero and heroine is fully realized because of this. But in Lady of Quality we spend too much time with the secondary characters. I like Annis Wychwood. I would have liked more time with her and Oliver Carleton. They are an interesting pair with great potential. I love the way they make each other laugh. But their love affair constantly takes second place to the background noise. They don't even get the final scene. That honor is reserved for Annis' brother and his wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heyer's last book, but not least","review":"Although \\"Lady of Quality\\" has a lot of similarities to her earlier \\"Black Sheep\\", both books are delightful in their own ways. The lady in question is Annis Wychwood, and this beautiful, intelligent and independent woman meets her match in an outspoken man who is neither handsome nor polite (but he is very, very rich!). The dialog between these lively characters is the main pleasure of this Regency romance, but the best laughs come from the nonsense spouted by Maria, the chaperone, and the reactions of all the characters who have to listen to her. Maria Farlow is brilliantly drawn, and her maddening and moronic utterances are worth the price of the book.

When I opened this can up, the first thing i noticed was the terrible smell. When I layed it out in his platter, it smelled like a combination of dog poop and cat food. I nearly barfed. When I heated it up a bit, it smelled like medicine. Needless to say, after a few bites the puppy lost appetite.He will only eat it when I mix it with Cesar Dog Food (any type really).

Cedric is a fine leading man--humorous, attractive, caring, if not particularly exciting. He's just a good man. Emma starts out very stiff and dour as she tries to be wholly unremarkable. But Cedric sees past that facade. In fairly short order, Emma comes to care about the eccentrics who surround her. We don't get to see enough of this change, however. In fact, she almost loses Cedric because of her stubbornness.The really annoying thing about the book, which was perhaps explained in the first title, A Christmas wish, which I have not read, is why Emma is not received in society but her sisters are. If the sole rationale for Emma is her highwayman father, then it should apply to the other two ladies as well. This so irritated me that my true rating is 2 & 1/2 stars, when it might otherwise be three."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating and informative survey","review":"Kids live in a world filled with animals both real and fictional, from Black Beauty and Barney to Pooh and more.

It doesn't really fit in the half-life universe.But still, this is one of the best games I've ever played! It gives you a nice feeling, and creates a great atmosphere!

It attempts to emulate the success of HalfLife and somehow fails totally.For example, HalfLife had a really interesting variety of weapons. Gunman has dull weapons which they've tried to make interesting by souping them up to the point of being annoying. There's one particular gun that can be configured in about 50 different ways (OK, I exagerate: it could easily be 30, though), to be a rocket launcher, grendade launcher, or tripmine, but it's such a pain to configure it that it's just not worth the effort.And the plot. Well. I didn't stick around to see what the rest of the game was like, but the first 20 minutes or so that I played was so bad, I couldn't stop laughing. HalfLife's plot was convincing and believable, Gunman was like an badly written episode of Walker Texas Ranger.The graphics were also pretty ugly, but after the problems with the weapons and plot, who'll notice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I finished this game within a day.

It is full of old manuscript illuminations and masterfully designed with professional and tasteful content layout. It is not too complicated and rather explanatory. It concentrates on the mainline Jewish traditions about marriages, so you will not be introduced to the marriage customs of Jewish communities you have never heard of. The book does a good job explaining the major concepts. It offers different Ketubah wordings; it gives an example of traditional wedding ceremony with brachot in Hebrew.

While I expected a cross between \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Shipwrecked\\", what I got was a mess of a story with preposterous plot elements.

I was really nervous to try something that i hadn't heard much about, but after doing research and reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Well, after two days of application, my car looks excellent. I am very happy with the shine and the feel of the finish. I spent almost a day doing paint prep--scratch removal and touch ups, and clay barred the car before the Liquid Glass went on, this is key. I do think that some of the scratches might be more visible now just because of the sheen of the finish, but overall the car looks excellent. I will put a good coat of Zymol wax over the LG soon just for a deeper shine and more protection. One thing to consider with this product, is that it takes 4 hours between coats, so plan accordingly. You can't put it on, take it off and then reapply.

So far, I like the ease of application. Much easier to apply and buff than other waxes and polishes, and you can do it in the sun. This alone is worth the cost differential.

Opposing forces was another good game but then again, it alone is not worth the money for the platinum edition. My suggestion?

All military units consume food every month, and all units fielded in the battlefield will gradually wear off, and have to rest in camps. This makes the game so much more strategical (as opposed to tactical), as players have to balance a big army and financial feasibility.However, the game is so TEDIOUS !! The game does not start with a fast scout unit with good line of sight, and the fog of war is not designed well. So a player has to spend a lot of time scouting. Before a battle, a player has to build a supply wagon, and assign villagers to stock it up with food. And it takes FOREVER !!So, with so much meaningless micro-management required, there is little time to think about strategy. And without strategy, this game is definitely inferior to some of the better titles on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING game!!","review":"Well, all i can say for this game is that it has nice graphic.

For RTS fans of Starcraft, and Age of Empires, it as an even bigger waste of money. Fate of the Dragon seems like an exact copy of the major RTS games out there, with a couple of new features added on. There are resources to collect, armies to build, and once you play the game once or twice, you've played it forever. The repetitveness of the game is mind-boggling. With only three different troop types, maps that look all exactly the same, and the same stupid music over and over again, how can the game be fun after a couple of days? The graphics need work, and the battles are worse. Because you're so limited in the troops you have, all you do is put your troops into battle- unlike Starcraft where there are dozens of unit types and Age of Empires where you have to use your brain for what units to use for a certain situation. Whatever you do, don't buy Fated of the Dragon. You'll be wasting your time, and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this game","review":"I don't know why so many other people love this game.

Thus, I bought 'Fate of Dragon' the moment I saw it in a store. However, I am very much disappointed. The game comes no where close to StarCraft, Age of King, Red Alert 2 or Emperor: Battle for Dune. It is the WOREST computer game I have ever own (on the other hand, I have only 10 pc games). The game surely offer many tons of upgrade, but you pretty mcuh upgrade all of them anyway. Since there are so many upgades, I can't keep track of them (must be 50+ of upgrade). Please don't buy it. It is a horrible game in my opinion.

I finally figured out that removing the card from the Pocket PC lets it break free and start acting normally. It seems there is some problem accessing the card, so the iPaq just sits there retrying ad-nauseum until finally, after 15 minutes or so, gives up, and the machine starts to settle down.

This book isn't your normal cinderalla story type book, but it is about a woman who is in the time of when men and women were looked at differently, and had totally different jobs. It was unheard of when a male did what a woman generally did or when a woman did what a man generally did. Samantha (main character) is hated by her father for not being the son he had always wanted. She turns out to be a really powerful woman despite the era of time that she is living in. Samantha gets a job as the town sheriff, and with the job comes great responsibility. While she is sheriff, she goes on many adventures while also learning that the father is a bad guy. Thankfully, Samantha finds a man who loves and respects her as the woman she is. This is a great book for anybody who likes old western books with a twist or a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too costly... does not last more than one tile..","review":"Just two things you need to know about this blade:1.

If you can swing it, the Fein sander is usually available for $290 somewhere-- plunge cuts, sands, rasps-- and is far safer than a rotary tool because of it's oscillatory motion (like a bone saw for cast-removal).

I play only brand new DVDs, so there are no marks or problems with the DVDs themselves. Whatever I try, the machine refuses to work. It gives the messges \\"No disk\\", \\"check disk\\" etc. After removing and re-inserting the DVD and plugging and unplugging this machine it may occasionallly work.

She said there's just no way to get a good grip on the handles and hold the lid in place with only two hands. Even if you had a third you'll be there awhile because the draining spout and holes are minimal. It does appear to be a decently made pot however, but with the venting you can only do so much in it. You'll also need alot of cabinet room to store it because of it's odd shape (as compared to regular round pots.)

It is heavy duty but light in weight. The only negative is that the handles are above the pot level which is a hindrance to poring boiling water out. This configuration makes the pot easier to store, but harder to drain. There are holes in the lid for drainage, but you need 3 hands to do so because there is no locking mechanism for the lid. Storage is not a problem for me because I use it so much that it is always on the cooktop so I would have preferred handles that stick out on the side. This pot is not just for pasta.

If you've read any of her other \\"In Death\\" books, you won't be able to believe this was written by the same author. I can't, and won't be buying any more books with Roberts' name on them. I like to know that the book I'm reading is actually written by the person whose name is on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable","review":"All the elements in this book is overplayed. This is the first book I've seen in the series and it will be the last. The conversations made me want to gag. It got to a point where I couldn't read beyond a few more paragraphs, and indeed I only read up to page 62. The storyline was not very interesting either."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Service, Great Book","review":"The book on CD arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I am very pleased with the service and the selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary potato chips","review":"As with the other books in the series, the latest is the literary equivalent of potato chips - not very substantial, but very addictive - and hard to put down.As usual, the minor characters are as much fun to read about as the major ones, and the plot is almost incidental compared to their interactions. The humor is sharp and character-driven.My only quibble, as with all the books in the series, is that the love scenes are definitely written by a romance writer. But I just skim past them, so this is a minor quibble."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best in the series.","review":"Finally, Roarke is beginning to show more of a human side. I guess J.D. Robb listened to my complaints last time ;) In this book he is a little vulnerable, though he certainly fights it, and Eve gets to help him, once she realizes she needs to. Roarke is still sexy, richer than Midas, of course, and all that but now he's a little more down to earth.The mystery was excellent, as usual. Thank you for another great offering in the 'In Death' series... I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew.....you've got to be kidding me","review":"This is a great game, but....... man you have got to learn the keyboard. Not just hot keys, also key combinations. You can pretty much get your people to do anything, but you've got to know how to do it. I am not a veteran of the previous versions and I am definitely paying for it. I normally play FPS games, i.e. quake III, and thought I would stimulate my brain a little better with a strategy type game. It was a good move, but after a couple hours I am exausted mentally. I am no genius but I am an engineer so I consider myself fairly intelligent, this is a hard but challenging game. I would recommend it, but have some patience. Try to learn as much as you can about the movements commonly used and you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Game","review":"I had played the original Commandos and wanted to play this one too. I must say that this game is real fun. It is a little hard but if you like challenges and you are a hardcore gamer, you will master the techniques quickly. Can't remain a n00b for a long time with this. You need to understand which commando is suited best for which action, although there are a lot of specialist activities which only one of them can perform.The main upgrade or improvement I would think is that you can see inside closed doors, peep through key-holes, change the angles of viewing (this may have been there in the previous version too, can't remember). Wonderful gameplay, wonderful music, good graphics and very good missions.Overall a very good game. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoops !","review":"I was used to play shoot-em-up games only, now I've changed my mind a bit.

It carries the commando series to an amazing level. With so many new options and new characters it tops all other games. Great gameplay, very realistic, but if you can, buy the PS2 version instead. This is the best game ever, if you can get it to work. It always crashes, or freezes, or just wont install. Its a great game When it works, but dont get it unless you want to risk ...up your computer. I've tried it on 4 computers and it only works on 1, and then about only half the time. Great gameplay, will drive you nuts trying to get it to work. That is a garantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dirty eight are back....with a Bang !","review":"It was the game, the commandos series, that made me an instant fan. The voices and hand drawn bitmaps took me to the world of the wars, the world where shooting wasn't the way of life, or life would end. I was astonished to see how the game taxed my brain, and influenced me to fight my way out. It gave me joy, and showed me the realities of the war. Still I like it the most, and can say proudly \\" I owned the best war-game ever \\". On August 1st all this will change.....as Commandos 2 will be here...and everybody knows \\" Something is Moving \\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, if it follows on the previous games!","review":"I also have no idea if this will be any good, but it has to be better than the two before it which were brilliant. The game play was good and the graphics and real life situations were superb. So we can only hope that this will follow on how good it was. I will certainly be getting this when it comes out on release because i believe that it will lead up to all our hopes and the previous games in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not qualified to write this book","review":"This woman owes myself and hundreds of people their paycheck from her business she withheld and did not pay!!

It is highly recommended for any software developer who uses Oracle technology to run their B2B applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"A primer for XML support in Oracle","review":"There are several problems with this book. One is that very little coverage is given to the Oracle XML SDK. I could not find useful documentation on TechNet regarding use of the XML SDK via PL/SQL. I had hoped that this book would provide examples of SDK and a more complete set of documentation. To my disappointment, this book does not provide much more than an overview.The other problem with this book is that it was written with examples for Oracle Application Server, which has been replaced by iAS. Bottom line, this book reads like it was written for the first release of Oracle's XML SDK. Your better off on TechNet and the newsgroups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technet on paper","review":"If you've ever tried understanding Oracle's XML offering from the technet documentation, you've probably given up in despair, as the information is available, but it's totally disorganised.Unfortunately, this book suffers the same problems. Many of the examples can be found on technet, and the organisation is no better. Like many Oracle Press books, this layout is poor, and the examples are either superficial or non-existent.Instead, try Steve Muench's \\"Oracle XML Applications.\\" It's superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oracle XML Handbook","review":"I am not too happy about the contents of this book...

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Constellation Double eagle was available. My '68 Constellation is in perfect running order and has been a joy to own. It was passed down to me by my family. When I saw the affordable price from Amazon for the 2500 Co-Axial movement, I could not pass it up. This watch keeps perfect time just like the '68 and looks so much better in person than the picture. The champagne face is actually a classic gold color..very tasteful. This, along with the 1968 Constellation will be passed along for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, and Word Analysis","review":"This product was exactly as described and has been a great help in my phonics course.

I enjoyed Magneto because of the way Alan portrays his voice in the songs... after all he was the singer and has a good voice compared to some other guys out there; not mentioning any names... one more thing; the producer of the CD its the producer of \\"A medio Vivir\\" and \\"Vuelve\\" 2 master albums from Ricky Martin; for me his bests.. plus most of the songs are written by the writer of \\"experiencia religiosa\\"... so that makes \\"azul\\" a good quality CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every couple married,engaged or divorcing.","review":"Dr. Wheat provides both biblical insight and practical application for couples who want the most out of their marriage.

The author's message of being a good spouse yourself is quite convicting. That is, if you are loving, you will be loveable. The pages are filled with good tips and ways any person can become a more loving spouse. The book emphasizes that the grass is not greener on the other side; it is green where one waters it. It is not about \\"If you do A, you will get B from your partner.\\" The blessings you receive from obeying the Lord's directions for spouses in the Bible might come in the afterlife only. Although, I do believe change will come from your partner if you take the author's words to heart and start living them.

Wow, sooooo comfortable! I wore them for over 2 years until they finally died. I replaced them with a pair of Reefs because Amazon did not have the brown color of these in stock. Big mistake! As soon as they have these in brown, I am snapping up 2 pairs so I can have them for many years to come. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent survey of Mozart's life and works.","review":"This is not a work of original research into primary sources or a close technical analysis of Mozart's compositional technique. What it is, and is an ideal example of, is a synopsis of where Mozart scholarship stands today with respect to his life and music, and a survey of his major works with brief discographies. It can serve as an excellent introduction to Mozart for newcomers but is also of interest to Mozart aficionados who listen to his music, play some of it, and have read a few biographies. Thus I learned that the K?chel numbering system we have lived with for so long is being updated, though the new system is not yet in general use. Most of all, and not typical of survey books, this book is well-written and enjoyable to read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise, but fell very short.","review":"The story had alot of promise, but it just dragged. The characters were uninteresting, seemed very flat, and had little chemistry. The dialogue felt very forced. It's been a while since I have read this book, but at one point, I glanced at the page number, which was near 200, and thought to myself, \\"Wow, nothing interesting has happened.\\" I'm sure he had good ideas/plans for this, but it was executed poorly, which may be harsh, but it didn't work for me. I did read his collection Emporium, which I would recommend over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Hannah rocks!","review":"This is the best book I've read this year. You've got: frozen South Dakota, a deputy sheriff with a chip on his shoulder and a pack of yappy Pomeranian pups at his feet, a university town, an anthropology graduate student trying to live his dissertation as a primitive man in the quad (but aren't those undergrad women leaving his hut in the mornings!?), an illegal archeological dig at the foot of the Thunderbird Casino (hence \\"Keno man\\"). Throw in a Corvette, a GTO, a custom van, and Dr. Hannah, a love smitten anthropologist who narrates these, the end days of North American civilization and you've got a great read. From the first chuck of the Clovis point spear at the 4-H prize pig, you'll be hooked. I found myself laughing out loud on public transportation. Adam Johnson's imagination is boundless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review as artifact.....","review":"Ok, just a little inside joke there, for people who have read the book.....What a great story! I've read a lot of \\"plague takes mankind\\" books, and this one has by far blown most of them out of the water. A really well written story, laugh out loud funny when you least expect it, and all around satisfying reading. I recommend it hugely."},{"rating":"1","title":"not emporium","review":"I purchased emporium some time ago and loved Adam's Short stories. They were well imagined and the action moved quickly. This novel, his first, is well written. Adam Johnson knows how to write. However, the story just sort of plods along like a basset hound without legs. The first hundred pages or so are deluded with foreshadow and the imaginative although totally unrealistic plot suffers. I read about 120 pages hoping I'd make it to some sort of action packed-adjective soaked-ground breaking sequence... but unfortunately it just never comes. Buy emporium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal","review":"This is a phenomeal book--it's a classic dark comedy. Humor runs through this novel, even at its darkest moments--and there are a few laugh out loud moments. The book has a deeply philosophical bent to it. The characters are likeable, even the most annoying of the bunch, and the storyline is plausible, even if it stretches here and there. I do think the ending is a littl weak, but overall you are dealing with a great story: humor, philosophy, anthropology, and the apocalypse. You just can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put Down","review":"After reading the first paragraph I couldn't put this book down until it was completely read.

Some of the subplots left as cliff hangers in season three have been settled and the series continues to make use of Simon Baker's terrific screen presence as Patrick Jane who is able to touch the untouchable aspects of people's minds in solving some very clever crimes. Baker's ability to carry off this enigmatic role is what makes the show tick, but it is his faithful crew of detecting minds that make the series always watchable and enjoyable - Robin Tunney as Lisbon the boss, and her associates Tim Kang, Owain Yeoman, and Amanda Rigetti. Some of the irony of Jane's abilities are growing a bit thin, but the scripts snap and the camaraderie that emanates from this group of detectives remains magical. So far, no disappointments. But the season just started so we have to wait and see how the entire season develops.

The character of Elsa was too exaggerated to be believable, but I could suspend my disbelief enough to accept her as she was. The plot doesn't bear close scrutiny, but it isn't meant to.The production was professionally done, with beautiful scenes in Madrid and Rome for a backdrop.

Maybe I'm just not paying enough attention to the subtext of the album. It doesn't matter. Even if you're as opposed to \\"Christian\\"-themed stuff as I am, you won't mind.

I have however had the fortune to have layed a \\"beta\\" version of the game. I did fall in love with Gangster 1: organised crime. The TBS aspect has somewhat been killed off in Gangsters 2. This may diss-appoint some players such as myself who enjoyed that aspect in G1. However the game does make up for this in it's silky smooth gameplay and visually stunning GFX. I have 1 complaint about this game, the box it should come in should be violin shaped just to give that extra touch. Bar doing this the good people at Hothouse have made a masterpiece.

I played the first game and it [was bad] like a taco canned rice and jellybeans. I thought this one might be good because of improvement in disc space and graphics, but they just [messed] this up. The concept is one of the best I've ever seen. Run a city to make it simple. However, the gameplay is so utterly terrible that the few good aspects of the game are completely countered.Don't buy this game. I like tacos, but I have to advise against eating thi one.

If your gangsters are wanted by the police, and getting shot at, they will pace back and forth in front of the cops like ducks in a shooting gallery until dead. This happens ALOT.Also, if you tell someone, say a wimpy specialist, to go somewhere, he takes the direct route, even if it takes him past a hundred enemy troops (well, he'll be dead after 12 so no matter)The idiotic ai takes what could be a simple but fun game and makes it feel like someone just wnated to put out their software a couple of months before they were finished.A patch could fix this, but not too likely from eidos, customer service isn't very important nowadays.Avoid this game.--Alex"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really want this game, just let me give you mine","review":"Boring and dull. You lose all control over the game to the scripted missions that you must complete,(and by the way, it is confusing as to HOW each one is supposed to be complete) and you can't buy weapons or cars until the third or fourth level. The first gangsters, despite its flaws, was one hundered times better.

As far as strategy and gameplay though, Gangsters 2 is nothing like the original. Sure its graphics are an improvement but its gameplay, for the most part, is shallow, repetitive and dull. I imagine the boys at Hothouse Creations spent a lot of time and effort designing Gangsters 2 but I just can't fathom why they would think this game would be appealing. Each mission seems to be a repeat of the previous and ah blah, blah, blah...What's the point? This game blows! It hasn't been out two weeks and it is already marked down at Best Buy. My suggestion?

Recorded in 1993 while J.T. was away from the group, there is no way I can thrill to \\"Celebration\\", \\"Ladies Night\\", or any of the other smash gems, without the sultry tones and magnificent vocal control of the \\"original\\" J.T.

It's great!!! I can wake up at different times on weekdays and weekends!!!Overall, this is a great CD clock radio and don't let any other reviews fool you.

On the only good songs of the album (\\"Let's get married\\", \\"Keys to the range\\", and \\"He can't love you\\") they do an OK job, but it's the production that saves those songs. On the other songs, the production isn't as good and the woeful lack of vocal talent becomes apparent. I would suggest that you get their first album first if you just want some JE. On that album, the production is more consistent (at least for the first six songs), and though it's shorter than their second (10 compared to 12), there are more good songs on the first album (6 compared to 3). If you're willing to consider other albums for purchase, I'd recommend Joe's latest, and if you have Joe's and you like it, I'd recommend Profyle and Ideal (who each have a similar style to Joe, but they are both groups)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I really liked the songs on the new album you guys did a great job on this album keep up the good work and in all things put god first and all of your goals will be accomplished in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreak or Ear Ache?","review":"Jagged Edge's second attempt to me was no better than the first.Jagged gave me two songs that I listen to and the rest is pure filler.

I liked there other album even though alot of people think that this is there first. I think that they should stick to slow love songs cause their voices are to beautiful to waste on hard loud beats where you can't appreciate their voices.

To me, the c.d. is very in touch with the feelings and emotions that go on in a relationship. Basically I can identify with most of the songs.Too bad it came out a few months to late for me and my relationship, because those songs summed up how I felt about my man in a nutshell.

Here are the instructions for cutting the lock off that Targus doesn't post on the website, but will email to you:Obtain a hacksaw from a hardware store or similar location. Make sure that it has a high-speed metal cutting blade. After stabilizing the tail of the DEFCON CL in a vise, saw through the head. Do not try to saw the teeth of the DEFCON CL, it is much easier to begin sawing at the gap next to the cable attachment ring.

In order to choose the combination you want, you use a flat head screw driver to unscrew and loosen the lock so you can rotate the number dials. Then, just tighten it up again. I did this. However, when I went to test out the combination I set, it didn't work! And when I went to unscrew it to reset it, my attempts at unscrewing the cheap screw stripped the head and I was unable to reset it. I called the company and they said they would replace it but only if I sent them the old one. Now I have to spend my time and my money to get a cheap lock replaced. And, based on the other reviews of locks spontaneously changing combinations anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if this happened again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't do it!","review":"This lock is absolutely a piece of crap. The lock reset after a few uses and was stuck in my computer. When I called the company, this is what they emailed me:SUGGESTION 1: Manual DecodingStart with 0000 and sequentially enter combinations until you find the proper combination. Remember to press the silver button after each number change. On average, it takes about 45 minutes to discover the code. While manual decoding may seem to be a time consuming option, it prevents damage to the notebook and allows the user to continue to use the DEFCON CL.SUGGESTION 2: Sawing off the DEFCON CLUsing a hacksaw with a metal cutting blade, saw through the plastic head and metal post as shown in the picture below. You can then unscrew the portion of the metal post that remains in your computer.I cut the cable with wire cables to make it portable again and then started at 0000. I finally stumbled upon my code.

Yet, I am missing a feature that I had in a cheap clone lock looking almost similar to the Targus Defcon CL. See the black bulk that closes the cable loop ? On the clone it was actually a metalic disk with a hole (similar to the one you find in the laptop). This allows you to lock the cable to itself when going away with the laptop. You might think noone would steal a lock cable because they don't know the combination and would be useless, but it happens (especially because they get a better chance to steal your laptop later on). This forces you every time you need to walk away with your own laptop to have to carry the cable lock with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock easily broken","review":"I just had a notebook stolen that was \\"locked\\" with this lock.

I purchased the defcon cl because it was inexpensive, widely availible, and easy to use. Unfortunately, it has one major drawback, occasionally it decides to change the number combinationss which unlock it. I went to the company website and they suggested trying the numbers immediately around the combination and if that failed trying all the number combinations possible (there are 10,000). Several hours, one blister, and 1787 combinations later, I got frustrated and used a jewelers saw to cut through the connection to my computer (this solution took only five minutes). I would not suggest this lock to anyone who lacks the patience to try trial and error experimentation until they reach the correct combination, nor anyone attending a school with a metalsmithing program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combination mysteriously changed","review":"I had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble.

So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites.

Even after doing that, it took me 10 minutes before I finally got it out. When I called, the guy asked me if I had an ibook before anything else. He then told me that they are tight in the ibooks and people have trouble getting them out. It is not worth the struggle if you have an ibook.

Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it. After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out. That took over 30 minutes of struggle. My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw. Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.

I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem.So, now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop.

The beginning of the movie shows how he becomes disillusioned with the system of apartheid. But, he becomes a bank robber to enrich himself and his gang, not to make some grand statement against apartheid. The story is neither compelling nor admirable. At the end of the movie there is a statement that Nelson Mandela was freed and became president of South Africa, as if Stander had some influence on that. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bank robbing a protest against Apartheid? Give me a break!","review":"Based on a true story, the 2003 film sounded interesting. It's set in South Africa and starts in the 1970s when the evils of Apartheid were apparent. At that time Andre Stander was a young newly-married police officer. During an uprising, he shot and killed an unarmed protester. This disturbed him so much that he turned to bank robbing. Eventually he went to prison for this. In prison, he met up with a couple of fellow inmates. They escaped and went on a bank robbing spree. The ending is inevitable.How the criminal bank robbing activity was a protest against Apartheid is rather fuzzy. But I watched the film anyway, always waiting for something to grab my sympathy. The film is almost two hours long and I was soon bored. Now I think I should have turned it off early, rather than waiting for the end. But I saw every single scene.

He is a 'supremo virtuoso' at musical composition, and a wonderful singer/songwiter/guitarist. Sadly or not (depending on your perspective) soon after his second album 'The New Earth' he became a 'Franciscan Monk' and stopped briefly recording. He started again but under the auspices of the Catholic monestry which mean't initially and for a time his musical expression and freedom was stifled to a degree (and still is). I suppose you could liken his position he found himself in similar to that of 'Cat Stevens' though I should imagine not nearly as dramatic! Fore when it comes to Cat Stevens (now Yusef %$%**&) who knows, the world has lost a truley exceptional prolific songwriter and I feel the same thing has happened with John Michael Talbot.

I'm often asked what are Japanese people like (ie, their behaviour in society). From now on I'll simply advise people to read A Pale View of Hills. It beautifully (and economically) portrays Japanese people as they deal with social issues. As an added bonus, Ishiguro is very descriptive of post-war Nagasaki - one can almost feel the humidity and smell the odors.If I might sin and compare this book to the popular Memoirs of a Geisha, A Pale View of Hills is much more understated and less fanciful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"Highly Recommended.Kazuo Ishiguro illuminates a microcosm of Hiroshima from the atomic shadows of the post-WWII era, as he delves into the interpersonal relationships of a Japanese mother and her two daughters. Despite their move across the world to England, those shadows will always haunt as patriotism and loyalty clashes with the younger generation's psyche to move on, and how the equilibrium of life could be disturbed and turn people into shadows, memories into ghosts, the past into an obscure pale, yet powerful, view of Hills."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought -provoking; multiple messages.","review":"I kept waiting for the part where we would find out what happened to Jiro and how Etsuko met her new husband, but instead was jolted toward the end of the book by Etsuko becoming someone else in my mind. At first, I thought the story was actually about Sachiko and that she had changed the point of view for most of the story to protect herself from the painful memory, however, after much conversation with friends who also read the book, I decided this particular section that seems so out of place, is forward in time and is showing us Etsuko talking to her own daughter just before leaving Nagasaki. The book is an experience in cultual differences, personal tragedy, and community/world tragedy after the dropping of the bomb. Its gentle, yet disturbing tone affect us and lead us to a greater understanding of the time and place"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and Dull","review":"This book is particularly dissapointing if you have read Ishiguro's Remains of the Day, which was such a lovely, perfect understated novel. This novel does employ some similarities of style and Ishiguro's prose is crisp and lyrical. But the book is confusing and unclear. The fewer than 200 pages drag on without drama or motion. At the novel's end the reader can't even feel that he or she has been offered any particular insight into the main character's mind or motivation. Too much is left unsaid or unexplained for the book to be effective. If this book were a person, I'd want to shake it by the shoulders and demand an explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"ishiguro at his best? what a disappointment","review":"i'm quite amazed at the many good reviews this book has received. Finishing this book is like having a nice discussion with a friend who, at the end of the hour, tells you he's dosed your tea with LSD. Is he serious? Why would he possibly do such a thing? This writing is nicely crafted and subtle, the narrative shifts easily between London and flashbacks to postwar Nagasaki, and beautifully skates along the rim of cultural chasm. But the \`surprise twist ending' is silly, amateurish; like mixing coca cola and Bordeaux, the climactic melange of genre falls on its face. For a beautiful cross cultural novel that carries itself through from beginning to end, skip \\"pale view' and go straight to \`the samarai's garden'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate lines","review":"An early work by the award-winning author of Remains of the Day, it defies Ishiguro's British citizenship and has a most distinctly Japanese air to it, taking place largely in Japan after the bombing of Nagasaki. Much of the tale is Etsuko's first-person flashbacks of those times. This is not an action story, but a delicately written character study, etched with Japanese precision and with clear lines, but no unnecessary elaboration. Ishiguro says it clearly and sharply, but kindly lets the reader make connections. The way he presents Japanese social propriety, but allows the underlying mood and intent to show brings the reader fully into the story and characters. Terrific writing and worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An aimless orbit in 'Ishiguro Space'...","review":"So I thought I had a few pages missing from my book, or something; that's how unfinished the story was/is to me. Didn't get it, not even remotely. We are introduced to a bunch of characters, none particularly random, yet all still disconnected from one another. Readable enough, but to what end? And I thought 'Artist' felt hollow; this book is the defination of boring. And anti-climatic to boot. I am rather confused; isn't this the same Ishiguro who gave us 'The Remains of the Day'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy cookbook that brings great food into your home","review":"Many years ago and upon a friend's recommendation I bought Jaffrey's well-known Indian cookbook and found it complicated and intimidating.

Thanks to Batra's wonderful book this is no longer true. I'm not sure why one reviewer found this text hard too use. It's as simple as an ordinary recipe out of Cooking Light and the results are astonishing.While I am still new to the art, and my dishes don't always look like somethiing from a fine Indian restaurant, the taste is remarkable.

The CD's do not depict the emotion felt by the crowd since a good portion of the bands are not even featured on them (so why did they even perform???). The video could have been split up into several tapes to show the three days in which peace led to inevitable violence on the last nights. It could have been SO much more worth the purchase.

I agree with everybody else on this page that complained about the CD's \\"roster\\". Either present the whole thing or the high-lights--not just random selections. My other gripe is that the sound quality sounds little better than an off-the-sound-board tape. Anyone playing in a band knows the clogged, bass-heavy sound I mean. The live radio broadcast sounded much better in that it included ambience. I suspect they tweaked some vocal performances (on the CD) and had to mix out the ambient mics so that we wouldn't hear the sour notes in the distant echo.

Beethoven's 9th is a top, maybe the top musical piece in the world. When seeing the orchestra actually perform this, in only rises in greatness.To say one thing that can be improved: I found the camera perspective too narrow. Only closeups of Karajan and the then current lead instrument. On TV I saw another 9th of Beethoven, recorded in Leipzig, and here you also had full overviews of the Orchestra and Choir. I found that visually more pleasing than just these closeups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legitimate problems here compared to other DVDs","review":"I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs. Yes the recording is old....but can't imagine why video is so poor. The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor. We don't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time. I would agree there is little cinematography going on here....which seems criminal with such an important piece. I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer. I have a solution in Beethoven's masterpiece. Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition. You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance....especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is only for Karajan fan.","review":"If you're a serious Karajan fan, this DVD maybe for you. It's just another Karajan's conducting show. But if you're a regular classical listener/watcher, you'll be very disappointed as I am. You can see at most 15 to 20 players and singers on screen during the same time. But hey, this is Choral Symphony. There are 200+ people on stage. The sound quality is in distance from Karajan's 1963 cycle. I would suggest the DVD Kurt Masur conducting Gewandhaus Orchestra. This DVD is much better for your ears and eyes. And you'll get an idea why Choral is so splendid before you go to the concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible camera work","review":"I did not have any problems with the sound although I have CDs with better sound tracks. But I was very disappointed with the video. The camera work was atrocious even by 1983 standards. No wonder I have never seen this broadcast on TV or cable.Neither the orchestra or the choir are shown in their entirety. There are only side shots, no direct shots.

It is totally unacceptable to buy a dvd without the chance to see the whole orchestra."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fault of SONY........","review":"First of all, i must said that i rate this disc because of the poor dvd quality of SONY, not Kanajan's performance.After playback of the whole disc, i found that this dvd is totally unacceptable:1. Audio quality is BAD! I m not saying Kanajan is bad. But the sound quality....it can never made me feel of the orchestra. Very flat.....maybe i usually listen to DG's CD version of 1962 and 1984.2. What a damn camera angle! I bought this dvd because i want to see live performance of Kanajan, but the film producer seems thinking that he is making the film 'Face-OFF'.....how come a live orchestra performance will take such kind of camera angle? Those sudden shot make me feel very confusing.....as like some previous review here, the film producer seems thinking that he/she even know no.9 more better than Kanajan.......Anyway, if you want to have Kanajan's no.9 of 1984, pls go buy the DG CD version, this one should never come.....Hoping SONY will re-issue a normal camera version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video quality substandard","review":"This performance of the 9th symphony by von Karajan is certainly not his best (I refer to the 1963 recording). But more disturbing is the low picture quality and the highly sterile and colorless images of the concert. The absence of an audience is well noted. In general there is a lack of good classical music dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor audio & video quality","review":"As others have noted in reviews of Sony's Karjan series, the audio & video quality are very poor. This would not even be considered adequate for VHS. Aside from the DVD quality, the camerawork is disappointing also. It is full of closeups of the conductor- and some of instrumentalists. The result is that you never get a sense of the big picture, the whole orchestra. The same could be said of the sound. It focuses on specific instruments, and sounds artificial. The performances are otherwise fairly good, though I find them a bit cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that it?","review":"Heavenly bureaucrats believe angel Giordono (Krzysztof Globisz) is hanging around unsavory types in Purgatory too much so they send him off to Earth to assist the struggling humans.

In Krakow he meets up with a comically crazy homeless guy (Jerzy Trela) who hooks him up with a single mother, Hanka (Ewa Kaim). A friendship ensues but Hanka suddenly passes away leaving Giordono to take care of her son.Polish comedy, Angel in Krakow (Aniol w Krakowie) (2002), is the directing debut of Artur Wiecek. This film has a few enjoyable moments but the main storyline is far too underdeveloped. As the closing credits roll viewers will ask, Is that it?

The quality is smooth and easy w/any material I've used so far, mostly latex paint and shellac. I'm furious that it only comes w/one spray gun and a second costs almost as much as the entire unit. Otherwise I would have given the system 5 stars. It would be very handy to have a second cup so that you can at least run water through the gun to clean it w/out emptying the one cup that came w/it. Plus, it's very difficult (if not impossible) to find a gun from another company to fit the Wagner specs."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent performance at a fair price","review":"I should have purchased a sprayer years ago! I used to dread painting-especially intricate things like picket fences or railings. But this sprayer is convenient to use and easy to clean. I can now paint a 6-panel door in under 5 minutes when it used to take me 15-20 minutes with a brush. And I can clean up the sprayer faster than I could clean a roller or brush! Since it is an HVLP sprayer, overspray is very minimal compared to high pressure sprayers-minimal paint cloud. Plus it is quieter than my compressor. Wagner makes some smaller and cheaper HVLP sprayers that would probably be adequate for spraying stains and laquers, but for spraying latex paint I would get this model (paint still should be thinned). My only complaint is that the power cord is too short-only 6 ft. 10-12 feet would be much better for reaching outlets higher up on a wall. If you can afford it, get this machine-it makes painting easy, fast, and enjoyable when you see the smooth results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product - Poor Support","review":"I have been very happy with my Soft Spray 2600.

I ordered two packings which each about the size of a half cigarette filter and weigh less. The Wagner Store On line charged me $9.95 for shipping. After one month they have finally arrived destroyed because the were not properly packed. When I contacted Wagner they said they are not responsible because the \\"Wagner On Line Store \\" which is reached via there web site, uses their name and logo, and is identical in appearence to the Wagner web site is a different company. Enough said, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck to the consumer.

I've used it with several different materials with success.However, I'm preparing to spray some waterborne lacquer and the product manufacturer suggested a 1mm tip diameter. So I went looking for one.I spent a half hour searching the documentation and Wagner's multiple web sites for replacement tips. The standard tip is a #3, so a reasonable person would think there must be a #1 and #2, but noooo, #3 is it. Not only that, a replacement #3 tip is $32 and the air cap is $59! Not surprising I suppose when they charge $1.99 for a 5-cent lock washer.I'm retired from aerospace and a $600 toilet seat is looking like a real bargain.If it weren't for the aforementioned problems, I would probably give this unit 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard game","review":"Pong has good graphics for a computer game, and is non-violent, but I almost screamed the first time I played it.

An some songs I have never heard before. I have gained a new respect for Michael Nesmith. He has written some great songs that are on this cd. One of my new favorite Nesmith songs is \\"While I cry\\". His voice is so great on that song. I also have found more respect for Micky Dolenz as a song writer. The song on this cd called \\"Mommy and Daddy\\". At first, I thought it was a little off of the wall. But the more I listen to this song, the more I like. In all this is a great cd for any Monkee fan. I suggest it greatly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One more \\"one night stand\\"","review":"I love Beverly Barton, but this is just one of the same old things. One man, one woman, one night = one baby. Of course the baby is kidnapped and then the father is the only one who can help find her, or him in this case.I will say it is nice to hear a man admit that it wasn't all her fault. He can accept that he is equally at fault for the pregnancy. However, He can't be a loving husband and father because of a bad experience with his first wife.The Protectors is a good series. But this plot has been done to death, and even Beverly barton can't save it.I wonder if it is a set-up for her next book. Maybe about Kate or Dante.A very so-so read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidnapping is not light reading~","review":"Having never read anything by Beverly Barton, I'm unlikely to pick up another one after reading \\"Keeping Baby Secret.\\" The first half of the book deals with the kidnapping of the heroine's 2-month old child! This is NOT a subject matter for light reading, nor would any normal mother be able to \\"get over\\" this kind of trauma to fall in love with the baby's father in a few days! I liked Frank very much and appreciated that this couple was not young and dewey-eyed. Still ... kidnapping? And the shameless 'set-up' of two characters for (no doubt) another novel bothered me--it just came out of the blue! And PLEASE, when selecting a name for the heroine in your next book, pick something other than Lurleen (with a nickname of Leenie). I found this name, in itself, very distracting. Not a keeper for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to it!","review":"Ill keep this short and sweet.

As good as the game is, it shouldn't be more expensive than your average casino or hunting PC games at Walmart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use (which shouldn't be the case for this type of product!)","review":"The product itself is fine, but for whatever reason, it was really difficult to pull one individual wipe out of the packet. It didn't seem like the outside edge of each wipe was centered so as to be able to easily access it through the opening in the middle of the packaging. That opening is fairly small, too, so it was hard to dig around in there to pull out one wipe. I wound up tearing the top wipe trying to separate it from the one underneath it. I wanted to get this to have a travel pack, but one that was more environmentally sound than individually wrapped wipes, but I wouldn't buy this particular product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"on the go","review":"quick clean up when you don't have a chance to get to a full shower and need a quick refresher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly happy (and fresh)","review":"brought these along on our 3 week euro trip and I am glad I did!

It did not. It is horribly predictable and read like a childrens book. The author feels it important to detail everything that is not important. In the books defense I did just get done reading the first four books of the Songs of Ice and Fire series by George Martin before picking this up. Interestingly enough I picked this series up because I enjoyed the female POV characters in Martins books...Arya and Brienne. I did not get my fix. I finally setteled for Lion of Macedon by David Gemmell. Im halfway through and its a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly unreadable","review":"I am glad this is not the first book I ever read by Elizabeth Moon. I am even more glad that Elizabeth Moon writes books that are not fantasy, otherwise I would have a lot less to read.Unfortunately, this book is unreadable. It suffers from severe middle bookitis. I cannot identify with the main character. I cannot find myself interested in what happens next. I cannot keep myself from finding some convenient spot to put the book down. As soon as I do, I somehow manage to forget where it is.If you like epic fantasy, strong moral questions, skillful writing and all that other stuff this is probably a book you will adore. Personally, I try to forget Elizabeth wrote it because the story bores me. There is absolutely nothing objectionable in the book, I simply can't stay interested in the story long enough to finish the darn thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crummy way to end a book!","review":"The first 3/4 of this book was perfectly acceptable... not great literature or anything, but quite entertaining and held my interest well. Then close to the end something happened, and the farther along I got, the angrier I got at how the book was going. I had a very hard time actually finishing this book because of the direction it seemed to be heading. It would be hard to describe what happened without giving away the plot, so I'll just say it made me so angry I was ready to throw it across the room. The level of incompetence and irresponsibility by certain characters depicted in the last few chapters was just staggering and really detracted from my enjoyment of this book in a major way. I can't see how it was necessary to write it this way. I read fiction for entertainment, not to be frustrated and upset... there are enough things to stress me out in every day life that I don't need something like this to make things worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the second part of Moon's trilogy and she continues to take the reader thru a world both real and exciting.

Unfortunately, the instructions were vague at best and completely leaves out steps at the end, so you end up with a flabbergasting flat mush of felt when you are finished. Easily the *worst* pattern instructions I have ever worked with. What is worse is that they never show you a photo in the back of the hat, so you literally have no idea which end is up. I ended up having to search online for other people that managed to piece the thing together and look at those photos.

We needed a space, for a couple of days, to keep our koi until we were able to repair our pond.We were extremely carefull about sweeping the area where we set it up. We pumped up each of the three sections then filled it with water and moved the fish. After a couple of hours we noticed the water level wasn't even. We did not find any holes but the lowest chamber was losing air. And it kept losing air. Long to short, we needed to pump up the lowest chamber every few hours.This is the most disappointing purchase I ever made but once the fish were transferred we had no option but to continue pumping air into the pool around the clock to keep the fish safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last!!!","review":"This is the second Intex 120X72 pool we've bought in the past year. Cheap price and the size is great allowing the entire family in the pool with room to spare. So much for the good parts. Last year's pool made it through the summer, but didn't last beyond off-season storage and one week inflated this season. Problem was a seam on the air chamber split open. Not repairable. So we bought another one figuring for fifty bucks, we'd get one summer out of it. Well, the second pool lasted 5 weeks before the top air chamber burst scaring the #$#@ out my son and me! Bottom line, these pools just don't stand up to continuous Florida sun and chlorine needed to keep the water clear. Also, the newer second pool didn't seem to be as sturdy and lost it's shape (sagged sideways even when filled with air) rather quickly. We're going to seek other options since the quality and durability of these large inflatables don't seem to be worth the headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"No easy way to empty!!!","review":"I like the pool... it is big enough, appears to be sturdy enough, however, the one that was sent to me did NOT have a plug on the bottom. Therefore, to empty it required my wife and I to lift it, full of water, and dump the water out over the side. It is the end of the summer, so I have no desire to return it and then wait another two weeks to get another one.

The only thing that keeps this from being a truly great album is the relatively static nature of most of the songs. They start off low-key and build to a soft whisper.

Before purchasing this product I used a traditional desktop mic to record audio. I wanted the Microsoft Lifechat so that I could have the flexibility to walk around the classroom without causing variation in the sound and audio quality.The Lifechat does what it says it does. I was able to record audio at a consistent quality throughout the large lecture hall. However, the quality was pretty poor and I needed to spend a bit of time enhancing the audio in Camtasia to make it playback OK.The biggest problem, however, is that the wireless mic caused my audio and video files recorded in Camtasia to be out of sync. I recently read that this is a typical problem with wireless recording devices.I had to discontinue use of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought the wrong item","review":"I thought I was buying my son a wireless headset for xbox.

Unfortunately, the sound quality is HORRIBLE. It sounds like you are talking over the phone, like someone calling in to a radio show. It is NOT crystal-clear sound at all.

Good for most applications shy of sound/music recording or anything that requires high quality sound. Also, it comes with a USB accessory to connect wireless Microsoft products to your PC. Hence, you can use it to use 360 wireless controllers. The funny thing is, my wireless 360 headset (which works with the same charger even) works on my computer through the wireless adapter.All-in-all, it's a good product and not quite as nice as similarly priced wired headsets, but probably worth it for the wireless freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works unless you forget to plug the receiver in","review":"So, i bought this even after reading the neg reviews, and i still have to give the 4 stars... have been using a month now for skype usePros-decent sound-works well for short/moderate distances-clear volume-works well with skype and msnNegs-drops off a few times-if you forget to plug in the receiver, doesn't work (ok an unfair neg, but with all the things one uses USB ports for its easy to forget once and a whileit did help that i paid $25 for it, so i think i got value for money"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRUST ALL THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS - THEYRE CORRECT","review":"EXTREMELY FRUSTRATINGLY DISAPPOINTED- ESPECIALLY W/ THE MICROSOFT NAME ATTACHED.

For example, if you run out of Cyan ink, even if you select Black Ink Only in the Advanced print options, it will not print until you go out an buy/install another Cyan cartridge. It also will not scan, fax, copy (in B&W) or anything. It locks you in a \\"Replace ___ ink\\" cycle of doom. There is no way to bypass this.

The Epson rep said that sometimes bad batches of ink can \\"get through\\" their quality control. Who knows. But I would avoid this model if at all possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanner Biggest Disappointment","review":"Wow! What a mistake. I took a sales rep's advice and bought this item from O.M. Print quality is certainly satisfactory, but I had to clean the nozzles after FIVE PAGES! The worst of this device's issues is the scanner. Regardless of how high you set the resolution, the scanned object looks horrible. B&W images come out impossible to see. The accompanying photo management software is about the worst I have ever seen. If you're looking for a printer, this might be OK, but for other features, I would not even remotely recommend it. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epson CX6X00 (6400 or 6600) Support for Printer Drivers","review":"The Setup CD that came with my CX6400 Epson Stylus printer has become lost (HELP!). I've gone to the web site to download current drivers (at the recommendation of the Epson CS response to my dilemma), but can't seem to find the \\"original CD\\" driver information at all! I get pieces. Since this is an \\"all in one\\" printer, I would like the original software, not pieces (one driver for printer, another for the scanner--that doesn't work). If you are searching for a printer, stick with the tried and true HP printers. I've never had so much trouble with an HP printer.

THANKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware All Things Epson","review":"Unfortunately, we have an Epson printer, the older brother of this model (the CX6400). Epson had a class-action suit brought against them a couple of years ago, and with good reason--their ink cartridges register empty when they are nothing of the sort. You can hear the ink slosh around inside after the printer tells you it's out. The result of the suit was a coupon for $45 of Epson swag...obviously, printer manufacturers get you on ink, but Epson's the king. The printer doesn't even fade, it simply refuses to go another step. Perhaps the Epson Jackass would be a better name? What's more, the nozzles clog regularly, the print quality suffers consistently, and you have to perform diagnostics and cleaning routinely. Avoid this model and anything like it, lest you have a giant money-sucking paperweight anywhere near your workspace."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN AWAY from this printer - Deserves NO STARS","review":"This printer is the worst printer I have ever had in my entire life.

Photo quality print was excellent but it really sucked a lot of ink. Ink was costing me twice as much as with my Lexmark Z52 and the photo quality was not significantly better. Less than three months later the factory had to ship me a replacement. Why? Because just after I printed out about 20 beautiful 8 x 10's of my wife, the printer sat idle for two weeks, and the print heads dried and would not work with brand new Epson ink cartridges no matter how many times I ran \\"head cleaning.\\" Epson said the second printer they sent me was new but it had the loudest paper feeder I've ever heard. It also sucks ink though so far it produces beautiful prints.

I'd not buy this printer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just fine","review":"I was hesitant after reading reviews here - and after my CX5200 just stopped working. My 5200 was NOT old, and it seems it was the old loose tube business.I was NOT planning to get another Epson due to what I read AND the nonsense with the print cartridges - which IS a rip-off...however......with the $40 discount they offered on top of the rebate of $50 I gave it a shot.I use this printer for personal use - letters, scans, photos - and it is very good. I am very happy with the way pictures print and the text is sharp.I do not use this for business reasons or for regular mass printing, but for an all-in-one, I am happy. It WELL worth the cost.I researched for a long time, but came back to Epson for the ease of use (on a MAC), price and quality.Again, I cannot say how this would be if printing a lot on a daily basis, but for personal use the copies are great, photos look better than the 5200 and the scan quality is good for basic use."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a year and then useless","review":"as some other reviewers have mentioned, this Epson worked great for about a year or year and half, and then printing and scanning problems started.

I had it for about a year and used it a maximum of three times during a six month period. At about the sixth month, it quit printing altogether. Purchased new, compatible generic ink cartridges and it produced only blank sheets of paper. Switched to new Epson cartridges and got the same result. Tried cleaning the print heads using the software and still got blank sheets of paper. Tried cleaning the print heads with a solution and got identical results. Epson is already settling a class action lawsuit for new printer cartridges being needed when there was still plenty of ink left in the cartridges. Perhaps another class action suit is justified because of this inferior product. Wonder if the FTC would look into this. I must admit the scanning feature is top notch, but that is the only thing worthwhile about the CX6600."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogged print heads after 15 months","review":"I tried the built-in \\"Head Cleaning\\" and even bought a cleaning solution from a third party.

There are many all in one printers that don't take up the space this one does. Ink Usage: ok in fact one of the positives about this printer is there is a lot of inexpensive generic ink out there. Scanner: Works very well a positive for this machine. Copier: I thought very slow. Functions well though.I've used a lot of printers and if you like the quality of oem ink canon and hp are excellent.

The support rep had me try several things to get the printer to work as a shared device. By the time they gave up, the printer would no longer work even from my XP computer. The driver would say printer not ready even though the printer status said everything is fine.So the support rep basically says, \\"sorry, nothing more I can do - have nice life.\\"Time to return the printer and of course unintall the printer software and drivers.

Overheating occurs far too easily when any of the following conditions occur: extensive point sanding (using just the tip of the tool), continuing to use a velcro paper to beyond about 40%wear. To avoid permanent damage to the pad, you MUST do the following: use appropriate sanding technique, change the paper before about 40%wear and spread the sanding load across as much of the paper surface as possible (avoiding extensive point sanding).

The base is too light for any hand work like planing, but I expected that. I bought it with the plan to make a new heavier base. So the 4 stars is based on the top being what I expected and meeting my needs at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing function, beautiful form","review":"I really wanted to like this watering can, but it's only got good looks going for it. As a simple watering tool, it falls surprisingly short. The last two-thirds of water comes out in spurts, as opposed to a steady stream, which makes me think something about the design is prohibiting the uptake of water. Then, it's nearly impossible to completely pour out the can until empty, unless you rock it back and forth sloshing the water out or turn it over and shake it out. Since I was looking for a more than just a decorative object, I'm afraid this has to go back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware!","review":"i bought this watering can to replace an old metal one that i had purchased from walmart over two years ago. i was searching for something to replace my 'perfect' can that had sprung many leaks due to being left out in the sun...i am, however, disappointed to find out from the sticker on the bottom of the can that it contains lead. having small children, i am now going to be returning this product to the store i purchased it at and searching for a different can.also, as a previous reviewer stated, this can does not pour water easily during the final half quart or so that it holds. i would tolerate that, because it's very elegant looking, but i cannot tolerate having a product with lead within easy reach of my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"For 14 he's pretty good!","review":"Hey,Adam is a great singer.

This might not sound like much but, given that these are Ursula Le Guin's opinions, it is well worth reading. She writes entertainingly and even though she wants to make you think it does not hurt one bit. Given the dearth of decent criticism of Science Fiction available at student level prices this is an excellent introduction to the genre for them. It is probably the first time most of them will have discovered serious thought behind SF. She also addresses other issues, often concerning her own experiences and the problems of being a woman writer, which would make this a useful text for anyone interested in gender studies. To sum up, buy it; it is very good; you will read these essays more than once, guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Container as the First Human Invention","review":"Around pp. 165-167, in the essay \\"The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,\\" LeGuin discusses the possibility that the first human invention was not the weapon, but the container -- the sling, the sack, the bag, the carrier. (I remembered it as \\"the vessel,\\" but that term doesn't appear in the book.) What good is generating a lot of stuff to eat if you don't have any way to get it back to camp? She argues the point persuasively and passionately.I read this book in 1991 or 1992, nearly 20 years ago. I've not seen the idea anywhere else (although she cites an anthropologist writing in 1975) but it has shaped my perception since.

It's a readable attempt to discuss a very complicated subject; who are the oppressors in Society and what are the causes of intercultural strife? Without the usual ode to victimology that is common in sociological texts this book approaches these questions and lets the reader extrapolate his own conclusions.The book is written in a simplified, non threatening style while discussing profound human qualities. I think this should be used in middle schools where now politically correct rubbish and the Myth of Egalitarianism is being promoted. At that age the kids understand they are different and can see every student has his own forte and weakness. This book could add clarity to the differences between between people without necessarily stigmatizing certain groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little New","review":"McGrath presents many side issues in a pleasantly readable fashion but he dodges the biggest question of all, is there a God?

The labels on the pack are the same, and both sets are clearly the Nassau design (same cotton and weaving). Maybe they were short on cotton one day. It unfortunately make sorting socks when doing laundry even more of a pain. I contacted the company and they wanted me to ship both sets of socks to them at my expense so they could inspect them to decide whether I deserved a replacement.Even worse, these socks showed significant wear and pilling after only one use, which is not something I would have expected from Gold Toe socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"This is one of the best biooks I have read in years!

When we watch a movie, we should feel completely absorbed and forget that we're watching a movie, we shouldn't be, as this movie does, constantly reminded of the existence of a very jittery person shooting the film on an ultra low budget (think walmart)-level camcorder.

The characters are all powerful and contribute to the story line, especially the poor farmer who is searching for the killer of his daughter.The story has some happy moments here and there and are well integrated in the story line.I can't tell you much otherwise it will ruin it for you in case you haven't seen it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-Framed, Poor Quality.","review":"Winstar did a pretty terrible job on this presentation.

One character inWinter Sleepershas a supposed problem with short-term memory loss (and it isn't even very serious) but aside from that there is NOTHING connecting the movies. \\"Winter Sleepers\\" is more of aCrash/Traffic/Grand Canyonmovie with the lives of six or seven strangers in a small German alpine town intersecting in ironic/surprising ways. The frozen landscape, long quiet shots and uber-moody music (Arvo Part, Wim Mertens & Sussan Deyheim/Richard Horowitz) make for an \\"arthouse\\" feel even as the plot unfolds as slowly and relentlessly as a glacier.Floriane Daniel and the cinematography are gorgeous but the viewer notices every second of its 117 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another \\"Run Lola Run\\"","review":"This is a different Tom Tykwer than I had seen in the past. \\"Winter Sleepers\\" is just as intense as \\"Run Lola Run\\" - but the intensity is unspoken - not an in-your-face adrenaline rush like \\"Lola.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tykwer.","review":"Beautiful scenery in this movie.

Camerawork, acting, story (except the denoument) are top-notch, the production design and color schema are intriguing, too. Perhaps not Tykwer's best work, but still well worth repeat viewing (my standard for a DVD purchase) -- and heads above the vast majority of American Independent cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"good movie, bad picture quality","review":"Picture quality is quite fuzzy, like a transfer from VHS tape.

However, as other reviewers noted, the legs are low quality and inadequate. Also, the metal shaft on the vises has started to rust.The included bench dogs and hold down that came with my bench are nice.My biggest complaint about this bench is that it really isn't very stable for handwork. When hand sawing, the whole bench rocks front to back badly. I guess I could build a new set of legs for the bench, but if I had time for that then I'd go all the way and build my own bench from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sjobergs SJ1600 Full-Size Jointer Workbench","review":"I was completely disappointed with this workbench.

I used to use the right side table of my table saw to assemble all my furniture, but that is no comparison to this. The clamps work well and the surface is excellent. Even glue doesn't stick to it. If you have an extra 6' of space in your workshop, give this bench a try. It is worth every penny of the price.

Some great tracks include \\"Bond Meets Stacey\\" and \\"Wine With Stacey\\" (which are both orchestral reworkings of Duran Duran's theme song), \\"Golden Gate Fight\\", and \\"May Day Jumps\\".

The title song is awesome but you need to be in the beat mood to listen. The best scores this side of the Biblical epics of Mikolos Rosa's melancholy love songs are \\"Bond Meets Stacey\\" and \\"Wine with Stacey\\". I should leave the comments of the acting to others -- it was overplayed but I have known real (and beautiful) women such as the way Stacey was played so it was not hard for me to believe the story. Its the first time I saw what appeared to be \\"real\\" tenderness acted toward a women by Bond rather than pure gratification -- interesting premise. The music helped to provide that appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A View...To A Classic James Bond Score.","review":"Regardless what fans think of the movie itself, the music for 14th James Bond adventure ranks with \\"The Living Daylights\\" as one of the best Bond scores ever (I'm not including \\"Licence To Kill\\" or the recent ones with Pierce Brosnan, as Mr. Barry didn't score the music for the films).

At my age, I admit to surprise in feeling such strong emotion at a display of justice/injustice in America, but this film hooked me and makes me feel naive again.

But on the strength of The Sigh and Nightfall alone, this record is a must-own for Towner fans. Like Blue Sun, Towner uses guitars and keyboards to paint a deep, brooding melancholy that has a characteristic grace and elegance. Alar, with its muffled detonations of very natural-sounding synth, is like an extension of Ogden Road from Diary, a long narrative in sound. Nightfall is almost shockingly sad: the perfect music to ruminate over the apocalypse of a long relationship. Peter Erskine's contributions on percussion are bright and a little busy, not quite necessary but inoffensive. If you're just getting into Towner, Solo Concert or Diary might be better ports of entry (after his records with Oregon, of course), but if you love Blue Sun, pick this one up too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great and easy way to learn HTML","review":"This book is , I think , the best to learn HTML.

They are caused by the lack of free markets!- Pollution certificates and fishing licenses can be used against pollution and overfishing.- The trade with less developed countries is unfair because the rules of market economies are not fulfilled by the industry states.

Now get down to business.I'm not very sure what Sarah is trying to lead us this time. This is more of an average pop album than anything else she's good at. I'm not saying that she shouldn't try new things. In fact, songs like \\"A Question of Honor\\" proves that a new blend can be very promising. But things are not going well in this album.Take \\"Harem\\" as example, it can be a song of great potential, but the way Sarah sung it gives it all away.BTW, I don't think we need her singing too much pop (not too much operatic vocal either), a balanced mix of all suits her better since she is so so versatile, and certainly can achieve a lot more.Well, if someone is trying to look for an SB commercial hit parade, I'll recommend \\"As a came of Age\\" over \\"Harem\\".Sorry for the harsh comments, please understand she can be so much better than this. Alas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for TV, insightful, rent it.","review":"Assuming you have followed the BTK case, you will want to rent this. Buy it? Guess that depends upon your level of obsession. If you know enough about Rader then you will find Gregg Henry's performance at least somewhat inspired if not borderline spooky. His mannerisms are spot on, and he does at least resemble the man. Although Rader is far from human in my eyes, Henry succeeds in bringing out his level of depravity. This work is something made-for-TV, sanctioned by local Wichita Author Beattie (multiple cameos), that was maybe on CourtTV (?) At any rate, it is insightful, yet never really makes you feel immersed or entirely sympathetic towards any of the protagonists. At a skim 88 minutes, it is simply an \\"addendum\\" to Beattie's excellent book. Read that, then see this. It is at least somewhat budgeted. Not every detail is accurate (miniscule stuff that only would bother the locals). 3 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Film","review":"The Hunt For the BTK Killer is based on the book Nightmare in Wichita: The Hunt for the BTK Strangler, which is also based on the real serial killer. The movie first aired in 2005 on CBS, but it later made its way to DVD. Between the years 1974 and 1991, Dennis Rader murdered ten people in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Gregg Henry plays the serial killer and he does a great job playing the psychopath.I'm aware of the case as I live in Missouri and Rader's capture in 2005 was all over the news. Despite being made-for-television, The Hunt for the BTK Killer is a well made film with decent acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best movie on BTK","review":"WOW! What a preformance from Gregg Henry who played BTK, i mean this guy REALLY got into his role, i mean have you ever seen this BTK's true confessions? Henry basically does a carbon copy of it, even mimicking BTK's speech pattern, hand gestures & other personal things. The other actors pull their load as well, Robert Foster is good as always. not to gory, but does show some disturbing BTK home invasion scenes, well worth the buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collection of Eclectic Poems Followed by Tales of Suspense","review":"This book captured my imagination all the way through out. The poetry spoke of many of the feelings that we all struggle through day to day. They celebrate the good of our lives and commiserates with you on the parts that we would sometimes like to forget. There are even hints of worldly pleasures within some of the poems. A so called, \\"modern day Song of Solomon\\".The tales capture your imagination and string you along so that you forget that you are reading and feel like you are living them yourself. One is a tale of utter surprise and the other of pure suspense. Both lead you to an unforgettable ending, one of which your not sure is over!I highly recommend this book to those who like something a little off the beaten path.

It certainly doesn't stand up against \\"Geogaddi\\" in any way. My advice is~ by-pass mum and head straight for BOC.As for the haunting soundscapes of Sigur Ros, or the indefinable art which is Bjork, they didn't appear here.The production is raw in places and just plain grating in others and the album never moves beyond the mediocre, despite the promises it will at some stage burst into full life.The lesson for me has been ~ buy the real thing at all times and wish the also-rans success as some sort of tribute band.I balk at giving 1 star, and I'm ashamed to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Icelandic hype!","review":"This album stinks!

Nearly every plane made requires some fine adjustment out of the box so that should not be considered a negative when purchasing this item.The cap iron may need a little lapping at the front bottom to fit smoothly against the plane iron. The blade comes with a serviceable factory edge but I honed mine nonetheless. Check the blade for flatness and lap the back if necessary. The bottom of the plane should be checked for flat and the sides for square before you commit to using this on your finer projects.Again, most planes need this kind of tuneup as they come out of the box. The only fault I have with this plane is that the rear adjustment screw has a bit too much free play (a sixteenth of an inch) between the adjustment screw collar and the blade adjustment.

They love them as much as their folks did. They especially love Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs. My four year old grandaughter Cyriana told me that Beauty and the Beast was scarry at first but she liked the way the story ended. I think that this collection of stories does a wonderful job of inspiring a childs imagination. I still enjoy watching these stories with the grandkids, it reminds me of many wonderful times watching them with their parents. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelly Duval's Faerie Tale Theatre is the best","review":"I was only 5 the first time I watched these; now I laugh as I see the adult themes when I enjoy them with my son.

When I became a teacher I hunted for these wonderful shows to share with my students during our fairy tale unit. I couldn't find them and was terribly disappointed.A couple of months ago my son showed me his complete set and I was at my computer in a flash to order. I am totally delighted with the set and have been using it in my classroom. I recommend this set to all parents of young childen, teachers and anyone who has a love or fond memories of fairy tales. They are delightful and very well done. Thanks to Shelly and her wonderful cast and crews. I'm grateful for their fine work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I can't believe that this series got released AGAIN on DVD without the closed caption tracks from the VHS and original broadcast. Does it really cost that much more to include the CC? It's not like they have to create it from scratch. It had already been done. My wife dearly loves these episodes, but her deafness prevents her from getting the full enjoyment out of them without closed caption. We bought the previous set from Starmaker only to be let down by the lack of CC. We had really hoped that Koch Vision would step up and release this new set with the captions intact. I believe it's a law now that all tv's manufactured for sale in the USA have to have the CC decoder built in. Why can't the media have the same specifications?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic packaged for reliving, new discovery","review":"This series is fantastic. I can't say enough good things about Faerie Tale Theater. It's one of those things, like Voltron, and Fraggle Rock, that defined my childhood.

You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faerie Tale Theatre is a treat","review":"If you're like me, and many of you are, you are replacing your VHS library with DVD's, but with care. Faerie Tale Theatre does not disappoint. I remember watching it as a (much!) younger woman, and being entranced by the stories, the music, the sets and, above all, the caliber of actor that Ms. Duvall chose for her stories. FTT is PACKED with familiar faces, some still with us, and some recently passed on. It was a pleasure to revisit some old friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about time!!!!!!!! Thanks!!!!!!!!","review":"I have been waiting since I was 8 yrs old to have this happen. I was a huge Faerie Tale Theater fan when I was a child. Then one day they just weren't on anymore.

Thanks soooooooo much!JakeWaukesha-WI"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't believe in Fairies!","review":"What Shelley Duvall produced in this wonderful set of discs is nor just a happy reminder of the stories that meant so much to us as we grew up, but a bunch of almost live entertainment for all ages of today. You see, there are so few avenues of \\"escape\\" for all of us to take and the \\"Faery Tale Theatre\\" opens the door to memory, happiness, and an unreality that becomes Real as we take in all the impossibilities of the lands we can never reach. I recomm,end this not just for your youngsters but for yourselves. It's a great journey into a space we have never really been to."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the wonderful Faerie Tale Theater shows","review":"I have been wanting to get this on DVD for a LONG time. I am ecstatic to pass it on to my children. They absolutely love it. If you remember the show from when you were younger then you know just what I am talking about. If you have never seen it before it is all the wonderful faerie tales told in a live person method. Anything from Rumplestiltskin to Cinderella. Each episode is about an hour long though so you might have to wait until the kids can sit through it. But my daughter is 8 and step is 5 and they watched about 4 in a row and wanted more. Certainly kept them entertained. I don't promote tons of tv watching for the kids but once in awhile is ok and if your looking for something magical then this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, bad case","review":"I was so happy to recieve this dvd set. I chose it over the earlier released set with some double sided dvd's because I though they would more easily get scratched.

While a majority of the story lines are boring, some of the CDs are entertaining to watch as an adult.

I do plan on having my children watch them with me when I have kids :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Go Home Again","review":"I received the Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection but was sadly disappointed. It was nice to see many famous actors before they attained greatness but it at the same time, viewing the various faerie stories was not as I remembered. It just proves the point that past experiences of one's youth tend to take on a patina of nostalgia that does not relate to the original experience. \\"You can't go home again\\" is definitely true."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this two years ago for a third of the price.","review":"This makes no sense to me at all. I bought this for $19.99. I believe the company that released it was Startmaker Ent. Why would I spend $90 to purchase it again? This is no way an ultimate boxed set! It's just a reissue. There is no digital remastering or THX sound. The only difference is some stupid game and the extra \\"greatest hits\\" episode that wasn't that good.Do yourself a favor, save $60 and purchase the Starmaker version on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this!!!","review":"I have been wanting this item for a LONG time when I found out it exsisted!!!

Don't judge it by the first episode \\"The Frog Prince\\" with Robin Williams, he's great but its pretty cheezy. There are so many celebrities and famous directors...including Tim Burton; fresh out of film school. My favorite by far is Rapunzel with Jeff Daniels. This box set comes with a little book full of information about each episode, its very interesting.

I ordered them for my Great Granddaughter's first Christmas present even tho she is too young now to watch them now.

This is for adults first, and children will enjoy it too. This is so well done.One comment on the packaging of the DVD SET. The disks are stacked one on top of another in the case. This subjects them to damage in handling. Not good. I put each DVD into a seperate sleeve which has the obvious disadvantages of being clumsey for storage. But, at least they are protected. A sign of the times...if they can make it cheaper, they will!Wonderful fairy tales. You will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children","review":"We were enormously disappointed in this. We bought it largely for our grandchildren (ages 4-12)--afterShelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collectionall this is a collection of fairy tales! In the two we watched the salacious content made them totally inappropriate for children. Example: Christopher Reeve biting off the sequins from Bernadette Peters bodice as she attempts to seduce him in Sleeping Beauty. In expanding the fairy tales into longer stories they became tedious. Despite the casts eminence much of the acting was poor. The programs were done live and seemed to be under-rehearsed and badly produced (e.g. cheap sets). The only good thing about our purchase was that when we returned it--with our complaints--Amazon gave us our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I was very much looking forward to receiving this and eagerly put it in the DVD player. I enjoy fairy tales, but what a disappointment! The delivery of the lines by well known actors is so annoying. Perhaps very young children like it, but I am surprised if older children and adults like that stilted, fake delivery. The packaging is nice, the picture quality is good, and the costumes are nice, but I cannot stand watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale jokes, sexual innuendo","review":"Here's a pretty good example of where American culture went off the tracks. These feebly modernized retellings are an insult to the original stories. I'd much rather my daughter read and reread the originals than gain the dubious advantage of watching Robin Williams share sexual innuendo with Teri Garr. Why would you want to have your child spend time watching hour after hour of this stuff instead of developing excellent reading skills? This is not a frivolous question considering that American kids have the worst reading skills in the developed world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mom","review":"Disappointed.

There are a faw standout tracks, but in my opinion, the best by far is Kimberley locke's \\"A dream is a wish your heart makes\\". This girl can really sing, her voice is flawless, and its great how she can belt out some parts, and give a quiet subdued performance, all on the same song. You can tell this song means something to her, with all the emotion she puts into it. It really showcases her voice, and is the best track on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is modern","review":"I bought this because I had heard PROUD OF YOUR BOY by Clay Aiken, His rendition of this song is beautiful.

Perhaps I simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs? This is not like \\"Kidz Bop\\" or anything related to that which \\"kidifies\\" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.

I am actually OFFENDED by this.For one, what the heck do they think they're doing to \\"Part of Your World?!\\" It's the most gorgeous song in existance! There's no depth in it anymore, no meaning, no beauty. Now, well, now it's just...crap.I dare you to listen to a clip from \\"The Little Mermaid\\" soundtrack of \\"Part of Your World,\\" and then this. It's just disgusting.Disney made gorgeous music. Why are they trying to destroy it? What is wrong with them? They're so greedy. They made the most entertaining music ever, and then went on to destroy it.Do NOT buy this. Instead, buy \\"Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic.\\" 125 of the original disney songs (including just about all of the music from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid\\") for about ten dollars more than all of these rip offs. Think about it - 81 more songs, more content, more beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"My neice forced me to listen to this in the car. I swear!! Anyway, it's quite cute. It's got older and newer songs on it, and each are done in a cool and unique way. Clay Aiken, The Cheetah Girls etc etc, I can see how younger kids will like this. I guess adults would love it too if teenyboppers weren't performing, but the music is funky and fun to drive to. The only jib I can poke at this, is that it's great for the kids, so they want to hear it over and over again, and you can tire of this easily. Good songs to sing to though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazia for Mania!!!","review":"1. Under the Sea-Raven-10/10 Awesome version of this disney classic!2.

They should at least ruin other ones. Also, Lalaine has no talent. Neither does Hilary Duff. I really think Disney should try to get some artists with real talent and not a \\"big name.\\" And why do all Disney Channel actresses sing? If you look through things, every blasted one sings something. It is ridiculous. Does anyone remember the good old days when singers had talent, were sponsered by Disney as only singer, and actresses were just actresses and nothing else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"It's a lot bigger than most of the newer wireless ones, if I'd known that I wouldn't have purchased it. Also, it doesn't have an \\"off\\" switch, so although it does go into sleep mode, there's no way to turn it off to extend battery life. It takes about 5 seconds to find the connection after it and the computer have been in sleep mode. It's okay, but there are better and faster ones available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I bought this mouse with low expectations. All I was looking for was a mouse the did what a mouse is supposed to do: point, click, and highlight. I wanted a wireless mouse because it is supposed to make work space less cluttered and leave the mouse more free to use. Well, it is wireless but that is all that is good about this product. It turns out that if you don't use the mouse for a few seconds it goes into sleep mode and you have to restart it by pressing the button underneath the mouse and hold it in until it reconnects with the USB. I contacted customer support asking if there were any way to adjust the amount time so that I didn't have to restart it every time I paused from doing work and they said no, not possible and sorry for the inconvenience. WHAT? How is this okay??? So annoying. NEVER buying a product from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible mouse","review":"I have been really disappointed with this mouse. It has spotty performance with poor precision and a ridiculously long lag when waking from snooze. The quality is pretty bad, with the right button going out only a couple of months after purchase; from time to time the other buttons will go back to their default settings for no reason (and the default settings make no sense whatsoever with many the reverse of a typical mouse). Also, it is worth keeping mind that this a huge mouse--even for a tall guy with large hands I feel it is too big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Worst wireless mouse I have ever used. Period. The tracking is horrendous and is so obvious when you slowly move from one side of the screen to the other. It jumps, lags and stutters, and this is with the USB receiver less than a foot away from the mouse. Also, the sleep time and wakeup response is awful. It sleeps too quickly and it takes some ridiculous and exaggerated movements of the mouse for it to respond. For those who need simultaneous left and right mouse clicks, this mouse will produce errors. Finally, it has a poor ergonomic design and is uncomfortable for anything longer than a few minutes worth of use. That's because it isn't tapered on one side (probably to allow for left-hand use)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"I liked this mouse because it is bigger and with continued use bigger mice are more comfortable for my hands. However it loses tracking, goes through regular batteries in about 2 days and expensive rechargeables about every 5 days. I had to start using rechargeables because it was too expensive to put regular batteries in. It's a real pain. Other wireless mice I've dealt with have lasted at LEAST 30 days on a set of batteries. I do NOT recommend this mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I've had this mouse for about 3 months now and the batteries are still going strong. For this being my first wireless mouse I'm very impressed. I haven't installed software because of previous reviews. The only negative things are that the forward and backward buttons seem backwards, and the back button is too far forward. I have huge man hands, and I like something I can finally grab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but doesn't work well","review":"I am disappointed with the function of this mouse. The cursor doesn't move half the time and when it does it's jittery. I can't seem to get the cursor where I want it to go and often close a window I meant to minimize because I missed the target. I thought it was just me getting used to a new mouse, but I've had it a month now and will replace it soon. I do see better performance when I take it off of my black mouse pad and use it right on the desk, which has a lighter color. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"what did kensington do","review":"i dont believe this i bought this cause i didnt have a problem with the other kensington mouses i have bought in the past but this was my nightmare it just doesnt work period i think it might be the solid plastic usb plug cause the logitech usb plug is clear if ur deprate for a wireless mouse do not go any where near this one ever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Item Twice","review":"I was really looking forward to this mouse working great.

I had to return it.","review":"After hooking up my mouse and installing the latest software off the Kensington website, I could not get this mouse to work. Tried fresh batteries, tried different USB ports, tried everything Kensington asked to no avail... So I took it back.The buttons and the rubber grip felt great. The buttons had a strong tactical feel and the rubber does not make your hand slip like on other Kensington designs. The software is very robust and highly customizable for Mac OS X too. At a store price of $30, it's not a bad deal, assuming you can find one that works. I opted to try another Microsoft mouse since I've been used to using one for several years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice optical mouse","review":"The Kensington has a great feel and fits my large hands perfectly. The rubber grips on the sides gives you a secure feeling, and the back and forward buttons on the side are convenient as well. It is so accurate I can set the mouse speed to fast without losing precision. I have become dependent on this mouse as others just don't feel as good or work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jittery - moves too fast","review":"I bought this mouse because it was a bit larger than the average. I don't know about you, but if the mouse is too small, I get a hand cramp. The feel of the mouse is really good.On the functional side, it works OK if you turn the sensitivity down on the control panel, but becomes quite annoying when I undock my laptop and want to use the touch pad - I have to reset the sensitivity again and again and again!Not Kensington's best work if you asked me. If you use this with a desktop, it will be just fine. I would not recommend use with a laptop. I am considering returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't track well","review":"I bought this mouse as a traveling laptop mouse, and haven't been especially impressed. The software included with the mouse overwrote my laptop's touchpad driver, rendering it useless. The mouse is also unbalanced, which (I believe) causes it to not track correctly, as it stutters quite a bit and sometimes hops across the screen. I'd suggest looking elsewhere, possibly at a Microsoft mouse instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wouldn't reccomend","review":"The mouse has a cool feature that let's you know when your batteries are getting low. The little light on the mouse and the light on the receiver turns red. The main problem is that you will see it often. The mouse really goes through batteries. At least the one that I have. One other issue is that when it goes to sleep, you need to click to wake it up. And if your pointer is on something clickable, it gets clicked. Not a huge issue, but can be annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than 100 seasonal recipes that will teach the reader to prepare vegetables in a wide variety of scrumptious ways","review":"Culinary educator and registered dietitian Jill Nussinow presents The Veggie Queen: Vegetables Get the Royal Treatment, and compilation of more than 100 seasonal recipes that will teach the reader to prepare vegetables in a wide variety of scrumptious ways, from Smoky Gazpacho to Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato Soup to Winter Squash Enchiladas and much more.

If your like me and have eczema and or allergies? I would not recommend this product, it gave me an allergic skin reaction, contact dermatitis, everywhere it was applied. It also caused itching for me, this product is not for sensitive skin. This is also not a replacement to cortisone cream as it is not an immuno-suppresent like hyrdorcortisone is.

It has allowed my boyfriend and I to discuss some really important topics that may have never just \\"come up\\" in daily conversations. I appreciate the comments at the end of each question.

Needless to say, it is somewhat interesting if you can get beyond Angela's use of four letter words. People need to consider those reading their books before they write them. I am sure she would not want her mother reading it with her filthy mouth. On the other hand, reading Courtney's chapters, I found none of those words. I have a different opinion of Angela. A lady does not use words like that to get her point across. Some things you need to leave to a person's imagination. Then again, I should not have been disappointed when I heard Angela say that Courtney waited until they were married to actually consumate the marriage, but she tried to entice him. I wanted my daughter to read the book to encourage her and to see when a \\"real\\" man loves you. Hopefully her chapters will get better, if not, perhaps I will black out the four letter words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yale/ Harvard","review":"My book club is reading this book for our March selection, so I went ahead and snatched it up because it was on a good sale in Sam's. I want to take it back. I can NOT believe that they are both Yale/ Harvard grads. The sentence structure in the Judy Blume books from my youth had more complexity. I wonder if they allowed the new twin babies to write the book. I am majorly disappointed about the story line, writing quality, AND length that the editors felt that they needed in order to convey the couple's points. A friend wanted to review the book (read the first chapter) as I completed another task and the expression on her face as she read it was telling. I still forced myself to remain objective as I read the same chapter and had a bad taste in my mouth. I skipped over to his chapter to see if it might be any better and have not found any luck in that effort either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It's good to see Black celebrity couples in love. It's rare to hear about these love stories in the media. I read one of the comments about how Angela Bassett used a lot of curse words when she described her life and career. I could careless if she did or didn't. I appreciate the fact that she kept it real about her self. It's her story and she saw fit to get down to the nitty gritty of what's happening, then so be it. I appreciated the realness and warmth of her story. I also appreciated the same from her husband Courtney Vance, which were the qualities that brought the two together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"Bravo Courtney for evolving into the man that you are.

The first thing I did not like on it was the wheels were too small and being plastic made them not very smooth to roll down the driveway. The first day I used it, it tipped over several times as I was trying to place leaves in it. Then within hrs. one of the 4 plastic insert pieces that holds the lid in broke. I was rather dissappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with this cart","review":"I ordered this for my grandpa who just recently had his gallbladder removed. He has since been healing, but is unable to drag and/or lift anything even remotely heavy. This cart is perfect for him so he can cut the grass and do yardwork and use this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, only a few drawbacks.","review":"I really like this product. It works great, just like it's supposed to. There are a few things I think could improve the product. The materials aren't very sturdy, so you have to be careful when leaning/resting another container against it to empty (i.e. lawn mower bag). The top opening could be bigger to allow easier dumping of a \\"rake-full\\" of debris. Also I've already lost one of the clips that holds the bag in place. I wish it came with a few extra. Oh well, I still like it. It has made yard work easier for me. I LOVE the fact that I can roll the bag around the yard with me then roll it to the front curb. I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly flimsy, unstable","review":"This cart is adequate (I guess) for light filling by hand but leaves much to be desired even for that. It offers virtually no lateral support to the plastic leaf bag; thus, as the bag begins to fill, it can pop off the plastic clips holding it to the top of the cart. (It took only one use to lose two of those clips which now lie either somewhere in the yard or at the bottom of a leaf bag in some land fill!) At that point, the cart can tip over and/or spill the bagged debris. It is entirely too flimsy and unstable to be used for emptying a blower/vac bag. The opening is too small and any downward weight on the top of the cart will cause it to roll out from under your vac bag and fall over.I strongly recommend spending your money instead on one of the Fiskar's Kangaroo collapsible leaf bags -- especially the one with the hard shell bottomFiskars 9413 30-Gallon Hard Shell Base Kangaroo Gardening Container. You can thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"Product is not as substantial as it appears in the photograph. It is really very flimsy and much smaller than it appears. It has a metal frame that the plastic parts snap onto. The plastic clips that hold the bag to the rim will unsnap and fall into the bag. The opening to put debris is small.I guess it would be fine for little ladies to put clippings after trimming their flowers, but for raking leaves and pinestraw, one would be wise to pass on this one. It also would be impossible to empty a lawn mower bag into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Was very disapointed with this Ames cart. I had one about 10 years ago and it was great. Like so many other companys over the years they make it cheaper. I hate the black clips that hold the bag on, Ive lost several already. Use to be a nice thick black band that held the bag in place. Although this works better than nothing I will never buy another one. I will just get a cheap one. What a shame this use to be a good company with quality products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted!","review":"This is a very sturdy and well-made cart! You can leave the lid off if you wish. The trash bag is held on by clips, so be careful you don't misplace them. A rim and a bungy cord would have been a better way to attach the bag, but you just have to keep track of where you set down the clips. I really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvement over metal one that bought","review":"Had to buy a new one because of plastic piece broke. Conctantly looking for clips to see if slipped off into the bag. Only complaints after 4 years of constant use.

The incomparable Bobo Stenson plays piano. The opening track alone, \\"Requiem,\\" will take your breath away (and bring it back paced more meditatively). Recorded in Oslo in 1991, but you can feel Big Sur's calm and rustic presence here. The title is a nice double entendre: the finely etched musical notes themselves doubled by a look inside a composer's mystical notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflective, slow-tempo classic","review":"The second of Lloyd's ECM albums, this one brings back Bobo Stenson but swaps out Palle Danielsson and Jon Christensen for Anders Jormin and Ralph Peterson, Jr. It's one of the strongest of Lloyd's ECM albums, and despite sticking to mostly slow tempos, holds your attention throughout.The album opens on a meditative note with the beautiful ballad \\"Requiem\\" (revisited on Voice in the Night and the Athens Concert). Then, that meditation over, the group launches into... another ballad! A lot of the album showcases Lloyd at his most Coltraneish - both \\"Pilgrimages\\", \\"Takur\\", and \\"When Miss Jessye Sings\\". The music is reminiscent of Crescent, A Love Supreme and Quartet Plays without being derivative.Of the five albums Lloyd recorded with Stenson, I'd put this one in second place after Canto, in a tie with the much feistier All My Relations.

The link in her family tree along with childhood memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"life through the eyes of a child","review":"Unbelievable look at life through a child's eyes. The hardest thing to believe after reading this phenomenal book is that the writer could have constructed this memoir from only childhood memories...and very fragmented disturbing memories at that! This is one of those books that is hard to read because of the empathy you have for Jenny...I found myself wanting to jump into the book and help this little girl that was dealt hand after hand of tough blows. That said, it is also a book where you learn from reading it. It is a child's perspective on an adult world; you learn from reading how much adults impact children...and how much better we can make the lives of the children in our own world."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Memoir","review":"This is one of the most hauntingly sad stories I've ever read.

I could not put the book down, and had to stop myself from skipping paragraphs to find out what happened next.I was initially hesitant to read this book, as it seems to be marketed in teen publications. However, as an adult who is an avid reader, I can verify that this is not just a book for teenagers. I was deeply moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blackbird:A Childhood Lost and Found","review":"The story was well written, however I would never recommend Blackbird: A Childhood Lost andFound to anyone because of the many times vulgar language was used throughout the story.I would think more non explicit language could and sould have been used."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever...","review":"The way the story is told is amazing.

I was left with many questions unanswered and extremely underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please - no more Snow White.","review":"While Jennifer Lauck's personal strength is to be commended, Blackbird lacks both a true adult perspective and a believable child's memory of her experiences. We are taken through a long journey of loss and a description of a child's stoicism in the face of cruelty and arbitrary actions on the part of her \\"evil step mother\\". That she repeats the Snow White theme as well as her particular sensations when she senses something is wrong - over and over agin - becomes tiresome. The only reason I finished it was to discuss it in my bookgroup - even this would not have been motivation enough had I not been new to the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book club selection.

The story is depressing and a real \\"downer\\" without the benefit of being even being interesting.

I was getting extremely tired of reading about superficial, un-sympathetic characters who left you the moment you closed the book. Jenny, the main character, takes you down a long winding road of childhood happiness and disturbing dielemas. Blackbird was discriptive to the point that you felt like you were in Jenny's body living her life. I highy recommend this book, and look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievable true story of survival","review":"I loved this book. I recently read the entire book in one day. Jennifer Lauch writes a beautiful memior about growing up in circumstances that no child should live through, the deaths of both her parents, abuse and abandonment from other adults who should have taken care of her. Yet, through it all she is determined to fight for her life. It is a remarkable story that demonstrates that even through the worst conditions, many of us have the resilience to keep on fighting for the life that we deserve. The book ends when she is 12.

This book and the sequel took me on a roller-coaster ride that I didn't really want to be on in the first place. It opened up some doors I thought were closed in my own life, forgotten childhood things that weren't quite as resolved as I thought they were.I believe that most women will find a strong voice in the words and true life story of Jennifer Lauck, but I wasn't prepared for the reaction this book would have for me on a personal level. Readers with unresolved personal issues are advised to proceed with caution - this is a good book to use in a discussion with a group, but some readers may not want to journey by themselves into the places and the emotions that Lauck so vividly writes about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I bought this book to read on my vacation next month.

I can't wait for the sequel to see what happened next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ten Year Old to Love","review":"I love the little girl in this book. So many times I wanted to go and find her and bring her home and love her. At times the book was so sad, I'd skip ahead, hoping for a happy ending. Though this brave little girl found moments of happiness whenever she could, the incredible pain strewn over her path in life just kept growing. Yet her spirit could not be conquered and in the end her goodness was rewarded. I can't wait to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, moving story","review":"I saw Jennifer Lauck on \\"Oprah\\" on Friday, and was so moved by her story and resilience that I bought the book on Saturday, and read the whole thing.It is an amazing story of hardship and survival, of added insults to injuries, and she not only lives to the tell the tale, but seems to have made peace with her difficult past.I had a difficult childhood myself, and her story rings absolutely true: she captures the loneliness and confusion perfectly. I can't wait to share the book with a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"deeply moving","review":"Like Scout in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" Lauck's childhood narration is full of life and grit. And she was very real for me. There were moments when the overuse of mundane detail became distracting. But overall, this memoir was solid. For an even better read, try \\"Hammerhead 84,\\" by Brett Hartman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Record Smooth Plane #04","review":"An excellent quality smoothing plane for the price. Fit and finish out of the box was very good. The sole was flat. The iron itself only needed a few strokes on a bench stone to get the edge sharp.

In fact, I bought this plane as an addition to a Stanley block plane I have owned for 30 years, which has given excellent service all that time. This plane, however, is a piece of junk. The casting was so poorly done that the sole of the plane was not flat, and spurs left over from the casting that had not been machined off prevented the plan from nesting in the plane body so that the blade had adequate throat clearance. I sent it back to Stanley for a refund and bought a competitor's plane.If you are, like me, a carpenter and cabinetmaker, and need a good block plane, don't consider this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"With some tuning - very happy!","review":"WIth a little tuning, I am very happy with this plane.

Out of the package it was fairly sharp and it did an excellent job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"After a little work of sharpening and smoothing the sole it is a very adequate tool for the money.

You will have to tune this lil guy to a fair amount if your using it for furniture work or other than general purpose.The only drawback I see is the minimal amount of contact there is between the blade and the tang that keeps it in place. The upside is it comes with its own lil carrying case/velcro to put on yer belt while working which is a pretty nice perc as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good for the money","review":"I love the feeling of a sharp plane slicing through wood. Stanley has been making planes for a long time and they really know what they are doing. You might veiw this as a plane kit. When you get it you will have some work to do on it. First you will probably need to lap the sole,and the back of the iron.This will remove the grinding marks from the factory. Then you will need to hone the bevel on the iron. Depending on the wood you are planing the angle might be right. Since this is a low angle plane 25 degrees is good for hard woods. You could even go as low as 15 degrees for soft woods. If you spend a little time tuning this somewhat rough tool up you will be rewarded by that feeling of slicing through the wood like it was butter. I prefer my Lie Nielson block planes over these.They are works of art and they perform like they are. But they cost several times more than these perfectly adequate stanleys."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first plane","review":"I am a beginning cabinet maker and my first case was not completely flush at the corners after gluing. Fortunately, this little block plane was very intuitive for me to set up. The instructions are very clear and written with consideration for all levels of skill. I was able to hone the cutter easily. It is now razor-sharp at 30 degrees. The tool's adjustments are easy to set, and they stay set. As with the other reviewers, I found I needed to hone the base to remove small burrs, but now that I have done that, I love the tool. Having a low-angle block plane restores my beginner's confidence that not every joint must be perfect from the start -- we have these little friends to help us out. Now the face frame fits to the case as if it was always there. Other planes cost more and might be better from the purists' perspective, but this plane is solid and true, and I can tell it will last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stanley 12-960 low angle plane","review":"I am not giving my age away but some of the tools I have purchased new and still use are now listed as antiques. I receiently purchased a low angle Stanley block plane to replace one that disappeared from my shop. I am not sure what country Stanley of England is importing them from but the quality is not the same as the original Stanley tools. The sole looks like it was hand ground with a 30 grit belt sander and the low quality steel blade was not ground at 20 degrees. The adjusting levers are made of poor fitting soft stamped metal. But the shiny brass colored knobs look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither of us like it","review":"Received my 12-960 this morning. Easy to open the packaging--it was secured with one staple. Hmmm. The plane was oiled and the cutter showed signs of hand sharpening. Double hmmm. I guess the previous owner wasn't too impressed with the plane. I spent about 40 minutes truing the sole, then discovered that regardless of bevel orientation the cutter won't extend beneath the sole of this meticulously engineered device. So much for Stanley planes. I give it a one. But it gets almost a three as a kayak anchor."},{"rating":"1","title":"12-960 plane is a waste of metal","review":"I received this plane as a gift and couldn't be more disappointed in the fit, function, and finish. Major problem with it is that the blade does not extend past the base so it doesn't cut anything even at full extension. It appears that they didn't finish machining the base where the blade rests. Second problem is that the base is very rough. Looks like they finished it with 20 grit and this is supposed to glide across a wood surface? I don't think so, not even close. This one is going back for a refund and I'll try another brand. I am afraid the Stanley name is now meaningless when it comes to quality image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern crap","review":"This is an example of modern crap!It is the most poorly designed machined hand tool I have ever seen with the name Stanley on it.The excentric cam (it tightens the blade) on my old stanley low slope broke and I thought I'd replace it (knowing I'd never be able to by the part...through it away and replace, we don't \\"fix\\" anything any more) I purchased this item. What junk ! I regret owning this. After much filing I can now actually retract the blade for storage and extend it for use without having to take it apart. The adjusting and tightening mechanisms have been redesigned and function lousey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plane for the money","review":"I had to do some tuning..about a half an hour. The mouth opening needed to be filed since it was a little thicker on one side and did not allow the blade edge to sit parallel to the sole. I also spent a few minutes flattening the sole and honing the blade. Now it works great. I've planed curley maple and mahogany end grain to a very smooth finish.I'm a Veritas fan after buying their 4.5 smooth plane. It was extremely impressive.....ready to go right out of the box....at half the price of a Lie-Nielsen. If I had a little more money, I would have bought a Veritas LA block plane.However, if you are willing to put in the time preparing the Stanley, it is a very good plane for a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little plane","review":"I ordered one of these to use around my shop. Given the mixed reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. The only real issue was a problem with the nut that secures the adjustable mouth. It was not tapped all the way so would not clamp the mouth. I happened to have the right metric tap so it only took about 2 minutes to fix. Except for the problem with the nut, the plane was useable out of the box. As expected, I honed the iron and flattened the sole and now it's a very nice tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"One of the reviewer said, \\"You get what you pay for\\". In this case I am sure you don't even get that. Stamped parts, and very soft metal make this plane useless junk. After more than an hour of tuning and sharpening, the blade edge just folded over on soft fir end grain. Take some time to find an old plane at a yard sale. I gave it one star because the Amazon rating system requires at least that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weights fall out","review":"I liked the design of the pieces and the size, but after some time (after play and lots of blitz) the weights at the bottom completely fell out.

Their knowledge of the bible is extensive and accurate due to these movies really sinking the stories into their minds and hearts. I am so thankful to have the whole collection for this price!The only reason I am subtracting a star from the rating, is that the collection is the Korean/English version.

Very nice song, although not groundbreaking(see Stevie Wonder's cut 'Too High' from the Innervisions CD). The other cuts on the album are far less appealing. Repetitive, cookie cutter beats and choruses (Don't Cry, Sweet Melody) and bland, melancholy ballads(My World, High Desert Woman) abound on this CD. Small wonder that we haven't heard anything from him since. He does have this raspy thing in his voice that is strangely appealing. I think some people might call it hissy like a snake, or maybe even froggy. Interesting, but its not awe-inspiring or powerful. But if you're a dedicated fan of neo-soul(I hate that title), and if you like listening to music by under-the-radar artists, or if you just liked the debut single and the voice, you might not mind investing in the whole disc.

His connection with some of the best blues talent out there is readily apparent in the energy of every song on this CD and makes it a \\"must have\\". The fact that this CD is still in the top 500 selling CD's on Amazon is a remarkable feat in itself and may mean that this exceptional guitarist, writer and bandleader is finally getting the recognition he deserves in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"I'll keep this short.

It is relatively comprehensive and has spectacluar photographs and line drawings. This is an excellent guide to learn the history of fountain pens and to identify fountain pens. While there can be no doubt that Mr. Lambrou cares very much about fountain pens, this does not come through in his prose style. Writing is straightforward and clear, but does not connect fountain pens to social history, industrial design, or the just plain joy of writing. Inclusion of several pages on the work of Classic Pens, Mr. Lambrou's own firm, which are of limited interest is a questionable decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed for vintage silver","review":"I have purchased and used many different silver polishes.

It is beautifully researched and covers the topic with great exhaustion over a wide area of chronolgical history. The story does have certain repeating themes as Christianity spreads which could, at times, test the interest of the reader. It also seems, at various stages in the book, that force and authority as a means of Christianizing a people is minimized at the expense of presenting the inherent qualities of the religion itself. The sections that show how the people themselves fought against Chritianity and maintained thier own religion help to balance this to a certain extent. The bias of the sources is also at work here as most of the original sources would have been Christain. A good book on topic that needs more work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but hard to keep up with","review":"This is a good book filled with facts directly relevant to the subject. It is obviously the result of extensive research by the author. The photos of religious evidence from early Christianity are extremely interesting as well. As opposed to a fellow reader who contributed his opinion below, I did not find any anti-clerical bias, just historical facts.This is not to say that the book will keep you glued to it. So many facts are crammed into it that you will find yourself wanting to turn the TV on instead. It is not an entertaining book but a very good reference document. If you can last to read it until the end, your reward will be a thorough understanding of this seldom researched time of our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but too long","review":"I don't have much to add to the other reviews which delve into the book's content. I agree that Fletcher does a great job of teasing out as much as he can from the limited historical material available on his subject. One thing that annoyed me was Fletcher's continuing assertion that there was only a very limited amount of solid historical evidence to work with, but then he goes on and on. I really question whether his work needed to be 500+ pages long. He could have been much more concise. This volume is probably best suited to professional historians, or hard-core medievalists. For others I would recommend a book like \\"How the Irish Saved Civilization\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overview and interesting fact-filled take on period and state specific slavery","review":"While this book offers an objective, historical look at slavery, it is useful primarily only to those wanting to study slavery in this specific American state and twenty-seven year time period. While I enjoyed this book from a historical perspective as a guide for creative writing, it would've been much more useful to me and most other readers if it covered a longer time period and a larger region, such as the entire 17th, 18th, and/or 19th centuries for the states of VA, NC, SC, and GA, or if a series for this extended time period with each state as a separate book were available. As it is, the book is a valuable historical asset for those that want to learn about all aspects of slavery from 1748-1775 in the state of North Carolina."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem","review":"These days (Sept 2007), it seems that writing a C++ coursebook that covers the fundamentals of programming for a computer science course is very much out of fashion (Java being the in thing).

He has not yet found his musical wings, although as a lyricist he has started to shine.At this stage Chapman has already found how to transfer his passion to paper, but hasn't quite figured out how to bring it to the microphone.

However, I think the Speechless CD is another in a line of great recordings done by SCC. I am always impressed with the lyrics, which touch the heart, and often grab you by the throat and say wake up. My favorite tracks are \\"Whatever\\" and \\"The Change,\\" both of which are upbeat and have an addictive style. I find myself jamming to these tracks to the point of embarrassment when others catch me singing at the top of my lungs in the car. I recommend the CD.

Not only that, there was nothing indicating any kind of support on the publisher's web site! I can understand publishers being in a hurry to get these books out to the public in a timely manner, but when the whole point is having a CD to work with, this kind of sloppiness is unforgivable. I will even admit that if I'd had a place to vent to the publisher I might not be writing this review here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimately Satisfied","review":"When I first started working with this book I had the same experience as these other readers and was quite annoyed. However, I emailed Hungry Minds and they said the problem was being corrected in a reprint and they immediately (same afternoon) sent me the missing files. Although there's really no excuse for their error, the new files filled in the blanks and it was smooth sailing from then on. I ultimately was quite satisfied: The author's writing is clear, friendly and informative, and within a few days (I did weeknights instead of the weekend), I had created a fairly complex site with Dreamweaver. (My friends are impressed.)The nicest surprise, however, was that after had written Hungry Minds about the problem, the author herself emailed me with her apologies! She said she was going to post the files on her site at wpeck.com and that they'd be on the HM site. Considering all that, I'd recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, but...many errors","review":"There is a lot of useful information in this book. It is obvious that Ms. Peck knows what she is talking about, has used Dreamweaver and is speaking from experience. Unfortunately, there are many errors in the tutorial exercises that are presented in the book. This makes them very frustrating to do and defeats their purpose. In addition, there needs to be more realistic projects/examples to demonstrate the concepts nd principles. Because of the many errors, I would not buy a book from her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It lived up to it's title...","review":"New to DW, I made it thru this book over a period of about four weeks or so, working between other responsibilities. The writing style is conversational throughout and the lesson progression is logical in terms of tasks and building concepts. The typographical errors didn't really throw me off. At some points the conversational approach seems to have misled me, and I had to read, reread...and some places had to complete sessions twice for things to work properly. Some of this may have been my own fault, but I think the steps could be more technically detailed in some ways. Overall, the book is comprehensive in covering the basics and the not-so-basics. Having gone through the end of the book now, I give it 4 stars because it lived up to it's title...I am comfortable enough with DW program and am moving with it on to Fireworks, CSS, and putting it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration Time","review":"Okay so I decided to learn Dreamweaver. Armed with my book, I set aside some time and energy to learn this. I was really annoyed to find not only the missing files and spelling mistakes in the book, but it took me a while to figure out that I could get the files from a website. By the time I had gotten to that point I had given up with the book and bought another one instead - this time going for a Sams How to Use title by Lon Coley, that not only didn't need a CD but was easy and quick to use. It also gave me a start in Fireworks and within a couple of hours I had a basic site together and no stress.Getting a book into a store quickly is one thing, but not everyone buys software as soon as it comes out, so it would have been nice if the book had been corrected or at least told me that there were problems with it.Mine went back to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wright's Most Mature Effort to Date","review":"Chely Wright is back with her first new album in three and a half years. Her first album for Dualtone Records. The title is THE METROPOLITAN HOTEL, a title Chely says is inspired by a hotel she stayed in England while she worked on the album. The album is very different from her other Nashville albums. This one is still country but much more of an artistic endeavor than a commercial one. The first few singles have slumped up the charts, with \\"Bumper of my SUV\\" cracking the top 40 a few months ago. The first single was \\"Back of the Bottom Drawer\\", which got a lukewarm reception on country radio. Her newest single is the moving ballad \\"The River\\". Other moving ballads include \\"Wheels\\" and \\"Between a Mother And A Child\\". The album closes nicely with \\"What If I Can't Say No Again\\", a personal favorite of mine. Overall a strong album from Chely Wright."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of Chely Wright's recordings","review":"I've always ranked Chely Wright a little higher than the typical C&W female singer. While there are numerous others out there with equal voices, most of them are crossover hit machines for their record labels with little else in mind. Ms Wright's previous recordings had much of the Nashville polish but the material and the performances were so much more appealing and honest. This current recording continues in the high standards adopted in the previous records with the added benefit of less Nashville production and more honesty. Ms Wright has never been afraid to be a country singer as opposed to being a country-oriented pop singer. I like the pared-down sound on the independent label recording. More, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her greatest work","review":"As much as I love Chely Wright, and DANG SHE IS BEAUTIFUL, I can't give this album the two thumbs up I wish I could. I am a big fan and loved the album Single White Female, and Let Me In, but I don't think this album was up to that level. I am a fan of Crossover Country Music--the not so twangy kind, so those are my musical tastes. Chely Wright has a signature style of telling a story with a song--kind of like Garth Brooks. However, the story doesn't always hold together well, or rhyme well, or make a good song. Back of the Bottom Drawer was probably the best song-but it's not enough to justify buying the whole album IMO. That said, I love Chely Wright, but this is not her finest work. You might be better off buying Let Me In if you don't have that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I'm a very liberal Democrat and anti-military, (as well as a member of a family with a large number of Marines and Army soldiers) but I was still moved by the song, \\"The Bumper of my S.U.V.\\" Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet!!","review":"Ironically, her best complete CD (and most radio friendly) is her first CD on an independent label. She has got to be one of the most underrated artists of our time. Though every song is great, 'I Got Him Ready For You' is the standout to me. I really hope it scores well at radio. If you like the new stuff from Sugarland, Julie Roberts, or country music from talented singer/songwriters who don't do just the same old same old. I highly recommend buying this album. Also, check out her other albums, especially Never Love You Enough. This CD is sure to not disappoint. BEST OF LUCK CHELY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect 10!","review":"This cd is a welcome part of my cd collection. This cd is very country and emotional, it tugs at your heartstrings, and everyone can realate to most of the songs for sure. This is what Country Radio needs more of! The new outlaw music of today, Gretchen Wilson, Montogomery Gentry, and Big N Rich, are okay, but lack the emotion and connection this does. This is good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to music","review":"Chely Wright is back with her first album of new material since 2001's NEVER LOVE YOU ENOUGH, and her first for her new label Dualtone. It's a good effort from Chely. The sound is more organic and stripped back than her last two MCA albums which had a more contemporary country polished feel for them. Chely has a great voice and it's a shame she went from being a hot country star to someone who is finding their way again. I will preface by saying I don't care for Bumper of my SUV. Not for it's content but I just find the song kind of boring, and I know she's making a statement/point in the song but I'm just not interested. She wrote a lot of the songs on this album. I can't quite get into her version of \\"C'est La Vie (You Never Can Tell)\\". There are some great songs on here, namely \\"What If I Can't Say No Again\\", \\"Southside of Lonesome\\", \\"Wheels\\", and \\"The River\\". Overall a good effort from Chely that I'm sure will get better with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Honest, Terrific","review":"Chely's newest CD, The Metropolitan Hotel, is her best album to date (and that's saying a lot being as she has some awesome albums!!). It has some great songs to sing and tap your toes with -- \\"C'est La Vie\\" and \\"Just the Way We Do It.\\" It also has some deep, heart-string tugging songs - \\"Between a Mother and A Child\\" and \\"The River.\\" \\"Bumper of My SUV\\" is one of the most simply, honest and patriotic songs ever recorded. But that's a trend I hear on this album -- simple and honest. She tells true stories such as \\"The River\\" and \\"Bumper of My SUV.\\" This album is a wonderful display of Chely's abilities as a song writer (and well as showcasing her talent in singing other's songs).

Then he added some hardcore lyrics with \\"Fire and Ice\\" and \\"Shake Me To Wake Me\\" which were excellent. ONE ON ONE is a notch down from those highs but still a great recording.Then he got divorced, got sad but kept recording. Feeling he had let down God, he got under \\"the law\\" and got \\"mad\\" at the church who turned their back on him so he got made at THEM and started pointing the finger.The result was--for the most part--a serious of bland albums (ABANDONED TO GOD, et al) which more or less document Steve's own grief.But ONE OF ONE and the ones previously mentioned--and \\"Taking Heaven By Storm\\" and \\"It's a Dyin' World\\" -- are pop/rock at its finest, with much joy and conviction in them.If only Steve had \\"camped\\" out under God's mercy, joy and grace..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Horrid Kindle Edition","review":"I must note that the poor rating has little to do with the author and everything to do with the poor quality of this Kindle edition.This Kindle ebook costs $31.56 to buy and yet all the images, figures, tables and illustrations in the book are useless due to the fact they are too small and blur when zoomed in. The Appendix in the kindle edition becomes a tasteless joke with all figures with the descents and genealogies rendered useless. Then the notes in the book don't link to their respective notes section.I was stupid in thinking that my inability to access the images and the lack of linking for the notes were restrictions the sample carried - and that those would be gone once I purchased the book.I'm disappointed and frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"a goldmine of information","review":"A most detailed reference book.

After completing the bootcamp, I spent a few years writing COBOL at various clients and this book is one of a few that served me very well during that time.

Why might you ask? Because unlike all reviews before that said this book was great, this book is written so technically and to understand it, you have to already know something about Cobol. If you need help with a program and want to look it up in the book hoping it will help you, forget it. There is no way this book is of any help and it is so hard to understand.

If you want to add inserts to hold an additional 300 photos, it is far more cost effective to buy a complete album, take out the inserts and throw away the album covers. Of course you would need to buy the two little posts from a hardware store (I priced them at about 89 cents) that expand the capacity. While Pioneer's product description may be technically defensible, it is confusing at minimum. I am satisfied with the album quality but I feel like I was gouged to the tune of about $70 due to a confusing product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes didn't line up","review":"Very disappointing.

This is all fine and good in theory, but in practice I had lots of gunk (glue, flooring, tile chips) get jammed in between the blade and the head. This causes the blade to turn into a parabola and thus gouge your floors if you don't notice it. I tried to remove the gunk by removing the blade and cleaning it out, but the present of additional material made the fit to tight and I was unable to open the head (2 screws). I stripped one screw, hacksawed a new phillips slot into it, and stripped that. When I returned it to the hardware store where I purchased it they told me that this was not the first time they had seen this same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO IT !!!","review":"Yeah, this is very, very good! The first Fairie's album, reissued with great bonus tracks, is a mind-melting mix of drug-fuelled psychedelic atmospheres and scorching, feedback-driven acid guitar garage rock, with a remarkable nod to what would be later called 'punk rock'. Great lyrics, raging vocals, a fierce rhythm section and veritable SMOKING classics, like \\"Uncle Harry's Last Freakout\\", \\"Do It\\", \\"The Snake\\" & \\"Teenage Rebel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star movie. 0 star amazon service!","review":"i am really sick to death of paying for instant movies from amazon and them freezing up several times during the movie! about to just stick with hulu!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulb Issue","review":"These pendant lamps have a very pretty globe, but I have not been able to find a bulb that fits snugly inside it - they all stick out on the bottom which looks ridiculous and spoils the effect.

The outcome...ONE IT'LL ALL MAKE SENSE, this album showcases Common's growth as an artist yet again. Collaborating with Lauryn Hill to make the hit \\"Retrospect For Life\\" brought Common into a more recognizing eye of the public, but still this album was slept on. Common stays in top lyrical form along side hiphop veterans De La Soul and the young lyrical phenomenon Canibus. This album reflects a more focused Common. The punchlines are more wittier, and the lyrics are more iller. No hiphop head should be without this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Day... another gem from Common","review":"Com has matured and it is evident on this album. He still uses the wordplay and clever lyricism that made Resurrection a classic on here, but the growth on One Day is amazing. Take Retrospect For Life for an example. In this song, Com speaks to his aborted seed and girlfriend on this cut. In my opinion, this is the best track on the album, and it is also one of the deepest songs ever. Other highlights are the: Stolen Moments(Pts. I,II,& III-great storytelling), G.O.D.(Gaining One's Defintion), Invocation(could have been longer), and Real N*&^% Quotes. However,I could have done without the tracks, Gettin' Down At The Amphitheater(a track that features De La Soul should always be off the meter)and Making A Name For Ourselves. Overall, with this album, Com takes lyricism to another level and the production is on point as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece...","review":"To tell the truth, I think that giving this album a \\"5 Star\\" rating isn't enough... This album ranks up in the 10 or 11 star range - if that many. In other words, this album is nothing less than a Hip-Hop classic. I listen to this album faithfully and I seriously believe that Common is way underrated. Even after this album was laced with countless cameos with people like Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Cee-Lo, Canibus, & De La Soul, he's still not being given the credit he deserves. It's a shame that so few people recognize true Hip-Hop when they see it... \\"One Day It'll All Make Sense\\" is without a doubt my favorite album and Common is in my top 5 favorite as well...Common - you outshine them ALL... One Luv..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop Classic","review":"Common is superior on this very personal album. If you liked \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\\" then you'll probably like this one. In fact, Mrs. Hill blesses listeners with her beautiful singing voice on the hit \\"Retrospect for Life.\\" I really got into Common after hearing \\"1999\\" off of \\"Soundbombing II\\"(another excellent album). This was worth the money and then some. His lyrics are on point, as always. This is a definite hip-hop classic in the tradition of \\"Illmatic,\\" \\"The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,\\" \\"The Art of Storytelling,\\" \\"The Score,\\" \\"Criminal Minded,\\" \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\\" \\"Reasonable Doubts,\\" and countless others. All of the songs(and the interludes!) are excellent, with unforgettable lyrics and background music. I highly recommend this cd. It is personal, intellectually stimulating, real, and true to hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the illest","review":"Common has made another classic. I always knew Common was was mad talented but, I didn't really think he could make an album as good as Resurrection. When you think about it, all three of Common's albums come together like one big story. When I heard him say on Invocation \\"Hip Hop is my garden/ don't give a f*ck where you chartin'/certain sh*t I can't honor/it ain't that you sellin'/it's your karma\\", I knew that he is the greatest emcee who ever lived. It's a shame that he's so underrated. Hopefully, with a few more collaborations with hip hop's other prophets, he'll get the respect he so rightfully deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common drops another dope EP.","review":"Common does it again. Nothing but pure lyrical genius, and beats to match. Bass heavy and mentally strong. He drops knowledge and kicks positivity, a true hiphop emcee. Great tracks like Hungry and Invocation, a must get."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The video of the fireplace was not relaxing as I had hoped.

The casting on this unit is rough and poorly machined. The iron (i.e. blade) is *wider* than the body, so you cannot easily use the edge of the plane to shape a tenon while guiding against the shoulder. The bearing surface between the upper and lower parts of the body is a painted rough-cast surface (not machined), so adjusting the size of the throat changes the vertical position of the nosepiece. The bedding surface for the iron is machined out of square. I did a lot of tuning and brought the tool up to a reasonable condition, but I still wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere.","review":"If you are looking for a rabbet plane, I might advise another brand. I put it on my wishlist despite reading other reviews because the wishlist is an easy way for me to communicate what tools I'm interested in to family members that might be shopping for Christmas, etc. When I took it out of the package the sole was visibly concave, the throat opening was slanted and not a uniform width, and the nose piece of the unit was not in the same plane as the rest of the sole. A plane that is not in one plane cannot be usable without investing a lot of sweat flattening it, so I'd rather return it and try another rabbet plane- even if it is more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"this plane is junk","review":"This plane is an absolute piece of junk. It came with the blade looking like it had been sharpened on a brick. I spent a half-hour honing it to a clean edge, put it back in the plane, spent ten minutes setting the gap and adjusting the blade (it has no in-out adjustment screw, and the gap can't be adjusted with the blade in the plane), and after four passes over a maple board, the blade had nicks in it. The city of Sheffield should sue Stanley to make them take the city's name off the package. In addition to the difficulty of setting the plane up, the blade is over a 32nd of an inch wider than the body of the plane, so you must either grind or file the blade down to match the width of the plane body, or spend ten minutes resetting the blade every time you change directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"first of all, besides the point that it's not worth a penny, it can't be more than $5 if you ask me. quality is aweful. the blade doesn't align properly, the top and the botton don't align. the botton of the plane (which should be _plane_) isn't straight. unfortunately there's not much choice, so i have to fix what i have already or make my own. i hear stanly 92 is good, i would try that if i can find one. but definetely not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality for a Stanely product","review":"Please don't buy this product. You will be very disappointed. I have returned the product. I agree will the other negative raters. I should have known better. Stanley and Amazon usually have good to excellent products from my experience. NOT this time. By the way, I cannot say enough good words about Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, lousy execution","review":"I quite liked the idea of this plane, being able to work closely into corners, so I bought one (admittedly the British version, but it looks exactly like this), but after spending quite some time with this I found myself unable to adjust it so that it would do any real work. I chucked it into a corner long ago (at least it is very small so it is not a failure you cannot overlook). I guess that it needs one of the heavier and more stable (also more expensive) models for this idea to really work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs flattening work","review":"The sole, including the leading tip surface were not flat in the same plane when the iron was inserted. I'm still grinding away to make a flat surface. Again, the iron, blade, was not flat. I'm grinding away to make a flat surface near the bevel edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical of Stanley quality","review":"I am just used to a much higher quality from Stanley. I bought based on my other three Stanley planes that I believe are well priced for the quality. This is a disappointment. The finish is rather rough all around. The set screw for holding the blade does not screw in and out smoothly as in the threads are badly formed. This makes it difficult to hold the awkward mechanism in place to set the blade depth. The blade is wider than the body so you have unsupported blade on each side of the shoe. I should have paid the real money and purchased a precision product for this task. While half the price of what I believe is a good shoulder plane, the money was wasted as I will now have to spend again for a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A noble experiement that failed","review":"I like and admire Joe Jackson's recent turn toward classical themes and structures; in my opinion, his last two records, Heaven & Hell and Night Music, are triumphs. But Symphony No. 1 is a misstep; it meanders instrumentally and has very little to say. At its most lively it sounds like a tepid imitation of Emerson Lake & Palmer's instrumental works; at its least lively it just fades into the background. Joe Jackson has done some fine work fusing classical and rock music into genuinely original music. If you find that sort of thing interesting, I strongly recommend you check out his CDs Night Music and Heaven & Hell instead. Both represent an artist at the peak of his creative powers; Symphony No. 2 is a noble experiement that failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk on by!","review":"Without any decent melodic passages, this so-called \\"Symphony\\" fails to generate any emotional momentum that would make it worthwhile. All it does is serve as a reminder why ELP and the other art-rock groups died. This is really boring stuff. I was looking forward to this CD, based on it's concept, but it's a total disappointment, lacking any of Jackson's trademark ingenuity. A decade ago, Jackson released his first foray into classical music, \\"Willpower\\". It's a beautiful CD full of inspiring moments. Do yourself a favor, and find that CD if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson is more creative than this experiement","review":"If Joe wants to experiment in his home studio with this kind of stuff then it's fine, a musician should explore all he wants for the sake of growth, but to pass this CD off as a smyphony,well, the joke is on us. I work hard and save my $ to purchase fine CD's, something Joe is worthy of producing, so why would he push this stuff off on us and call it smyphony No1? I'll pass on a Symphony No.2, Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would call it prog 20 years ago, will call it 'prog' now!","review":"Well, as some of the other posts imply, this album is deffenetly not for everyone. In fact, most great music and art will, in fact, be hated by over 75% of the population because it dares to challange it's audience. And this disc is no exception! If your in it for the 3 minute songs with cetchy vocal melodies, this is not for you. In fact, it's a 40 minute instrumental work that combines 20th century classical, jazz, and some progressive rock into an exquisite piece of color and imagery. The arrangement is incredible, especially considering the odd array of instruments. The best way of describing this work is by taking some early 20th century classical, a twist of Paul Winter, and a dose of Yes and Emerson Lake & Palmer. An amaizingly ground-breaking album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Jackson makes good music","review":"If you are interested in what happens to a musician that continues to mature throughout their life, then Joe Jackson is for you. He continues to explore the art of sound. He has been jazzy and bluesy, now he is classical.

His review of the theories on the influence of \\"lifetraps\\" in people's behavior are brought to life with humor, humanity and fascinating case studies. For anyone that is in the midst of a personal quest for happiness, (and who isn't?)this book is a gem! As we search for love and happiness, Dr. Novello's book reminds us of looking inside ourselves to find the peace and love we seek. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provided years of hard use","review":"I have owned and used this vise for almost eight years. It grips well and has been tough and very reliable. The quality is good and I would buy it again. The quick release mechanism is indispensible and has worked flawlessly.

The metal is clean, all parts align and the size and weight are a good mix for most applications.I would only suggest two additional things. The handle's end caps don't fit well (sometimes). Do not force them on or they will split. Lightly taper the handle and either screw, glue or do both. 'J' could send 3 to avoid user problems. Secondlyly, I would like to 'J' supply a pair of hard wood inserts for the steel jaws. TJS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and easy to use","review":"This is one heavy device. After spending many years improvising with clamps to hold work pieces steady, it is now hard to imagine how I did without a proper workbench vise all these years.This is best installed with the table upside down so you don't have to fight gravity. The jaws were well aligned. I added a Maple face on both sides. The quick release works well and the vise has immediately become an indispensable tool in my shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vise","review":"Vise is very easy to use. It was a great value for the price. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the mistake of buying this vise.","review":"When I first took it out of the box, I had to double-check that I was shipped the right vise. The casting of both halves was so mismatched, I thought it was a cheap knock-off. There was so much polyurethane on the wooden dowel handle that I couldn't fit the caps on without splitting them - I had to sand the finish off first.The quick-release feature was fun the first couple of times I used it, but it quickly became a pain. A half turn back releases the outer jaw so it can be pulled out or pushed in. But it doesn't slide very easily and the half turn doesn't fully release the work. And, of course, continuing to turn out doesn't do anything because the gear mechanism has released. I eventually \\"fixed\\" it by drilling and tapping a threaded hole into the quick-release gear from the front while the gear is engaged. A screw in this hole will jam up against the inner jaw and prevent the quick-release gear from doing its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jorgensen vise review","review":"I recently purchased this vise from Amazon and installed it on my woodworking bench. The machining is excellent, the fit and finish are great and the smooth jaws don't mar the wood it clamps.I really like the quick-release feature and have found it invaluable for quickly adjusting the vise to the work at hand.Installation was quick and easy and the vise included a template for drilling mounting holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - Quality Is Poor","review":"I was very disappointed when I opened up the box and inspected the vise. The castings were of poor quality, the front jaw was displaced about 3/16\\" to the left of the rear jaw when closed, and when viewed form the top the jaws were not parallel when closed (1/16\\" off). In addition, the quick open/close feature did not work well. When you consider the high cost (money) of this vise, it is just unacceptable. I have since returned it to Amazon.com for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is the best wood working vise that I have ever used, and I use it a LOT. It did not come with wooden jaws, but adding them was no problem as the jaw plates are predrilled. It is large enough to hold anything that a furniture-maker or hobbyist would need, and the slip screw makes working with it a breeze.

This book for adults is superb. I'd think it would be great for younger people to read, except that the venacular includes some swear words that parents might object to.

Rather, pay attention to the marvelous interplay among the characters--especially as Rose has to decide just who she is truly in love with. What also struck me was that so many issues she faces are the same as she'd face today--Rose goes to too many parties, her favorite cousin has a drinking problem, her best friend is scorned.

We purchased two of these units for our iPods and in less than 30 seconds, both units fried (literally) both of our iPods. To make matters worse, the customer service at iLive was horrendous.

It requires 8 C cell batteries. Also when running on battery power an attached IPOD will charge. For some this may be ok but for me it quickly drains the C cell batteries even if the power to the box is turned off. Also, on our unit, the ipod backlight turns on and off every 5 seconds.

It's worked well under moderate use for four months until today. When the ipod was pulled out of the dock, the connector came with it. I opened it up and found the docking connector was held in place by only four solder points, no screws!

(my mom would only let me spend $30)I bought this for my bedroom, and for school trips. As soon as it arrived, i put my ipod in it. I was SO impressed by how cute it was, and how well the radio, sound, and clocked worked. I was worried the sound wasnt' going to be very loud, but its quite loud! And clear. The only thing that some music snobs may have a problem with, is that the bass isn't the best. But for the price, it can't be beat.Another thing that impressed me is that it charged the ipod so quickly! it's just as good as plugging your ipod onto the computer and letting it charge.I STRONGLY suggest this. It is an amazing product! I am so glad i bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid at all cost","review":"I tried this product 3 times, and it was terrible!

We thought the description was misleading which stated that this unit charges all Ipods. The sound was nice for a small boombox, but strangely, the batteries continued to pop out and the battery door would not remain closed. We ended up taping the battery door, but ultimately we returned the unit anyway for the lack of compatibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ilya for the Ages","review":"Finally! An Ilya that has it all: brilliantly played, stupendously recorded, excitingly conducted. The Gliere 3rd hasn't suffered from lack of CD availability; the number of digital recordings is equalled by the number of older analog recordings. Unfortunately, except for Scherchen (C'mon Westminster!) the early ones are all heavily cut. Many of the digital ones suffer from boring conductors. But not this new one. It goes right to the top of the heap and is so good that Farberman, Downes, Talmi, even Scherchen will become dust collectors. Maestro Botstein sure records some interesting material, and I really wasn't looking forward to yet another Ilya, but I'm glad I got a copy early. Now, Telarc: How about Botstein and Tchaikovsky's Manfred?"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I'm a big fan of Russian symphonies but I didn't care much for this one. It represents the dead end of the romantic symphonic tradition. It's a lot like a Mahler symphony only more bloated and boring. Thank God Shostakovich and Prokofiev came along.

People have claimed that it stands up well to today's CCM, but I disagree. It may have held up for much of the 90's, but it sounds too light, almost weak in comparison.Sorry, too many synthesizers and echoing vocals for my taste. Not enough beefy guitars to be considered rock.

A computer A.I. that can't do math is so ironic I loved it. The computer is a more successful human than its depressed and brilliant creator. The only reason I did not give this movie a 5 is the computer's voice is hard to understand at times, subtitles would of helped greatly. Production costs were low and it shows.

This lovable, dumpy old venue (which later became the Palladium) hosted many, many great bands. I remember this concert was introduced by Scott Muni, one of New York's most beloved DJs on WNEW FM Radio. In fact, older New Yokers (like me) will recognize that the radio on the album cover is set to WNEW's number, 102.7. Unfortunately, WNEW and all the other great FM radio stations which championed many of the lesser known bands in the 1960s through 1980s have gone the way of the dinosaur. But I digress.....buy this album as it ranks as one of the all time great albums, right up there with Allman Bros at Fillmore, Lou Reed's Rock and Roll Animal, Band of Gypisies, Get Yer Ya-Yas out, etc, etc. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"I wore this out. This earlier live recoding captures arguably the best British blues band at the time. This is much batter that the Ten Years After live album (also good). Pete Haycock is an unrecognized master.

It may give some of them some degree of \\"closure\\" to read this vigilante novel: but they are more likely to be put off by the graphic and vulgar sexual content - and the atrocious spelling and grammatical errors, which occur on about half of its pages. Here's a sample, just from one page (245):\\"stood out like a SOUR thumb\\", \\"the SPEAR set of keys\\", and \\"breathed a sigh of RELIEVE\\". My favorite spelling error is prosciutto (Italian ham), which is spelled \\"prochuto\\". I'm not kidding!

You were either paid off or you will give anything 5 stars. While I applaud the author for venturing into such a controversial genre (pedophilia, rape, incest and such) and bringing to light some of the horrific things that are happening to children, I condemn the notion that we are supposed to overlook the glaring and obvious grammatical errors. It not only detracts from the story it overwhelms it. I for one am sick of books that are either poorly edited or not edited at all, especially from someone who once claimed to be an Executive Editor (??). It is just this type of juvenile writing that justifies the stigma that is attached to self published authors and small publishing houses.

In other words theres no substance here just a lot of fun-filler bubblegum hip-pop. Her first single \\"Make Her Feel Good\\" is really as good as it gets. \\"No Daddy\\" wont crunk up the club but it will appeal to any girl who takes pride in sassing her 6th grade teacher.

I wish that the Music Industry would produce some REAL talent and not give someone a record deal beacuse they THINK that the person is pretty. And for the person who said Teairra Mari is 12, she's 17 (duh). And in reference to another review, I actually think that JoJo is better than Teairra Mari when it comes to vocals, but back to the point.This CD is a piece of garbage. The only songs worth listening to are \\"Make Her Feel Good\\" (basically for the beat and she uses the \\"N\\" word too much) and \\"No Daddy\\" (and that's only for the beat, the lyrics are stupid.)DO NOT BUY THIS CD.

It's obvious she thinks this silly song is going to attract listeners because of these tacky childish lyrics. I am so sick and tired of these type of R&B songs. Mojority of the R&B artists cannot even sing that good but these producers give them these Hip-Hop beats and that takes away from the most important thing which is the singing.

But seriously, she has a bit of talent, but I don't understand why she insists on cursing needlessly on songs such as \\"Lala\\" and why she is talking about telling a \\"N*gga how to touch me\\". She is only 17, and that is inappropriate. A few of the songs have nice beats, but she is a child trying to be a grown woman and it's not working. The lyrics on most of the songs are either trying too hard or just not good. Did Jay-Z really have something to do with this project? Because if this is what he calls \\"A\\" material then he must be losing his mind, right along with Dame Dash.

The beats are straight but everything else is weak. This girl lacks the talent to be called a princess moreover the princess of the ROC.

Why glamorize not having a father and coming from a broken home? \\"I ain't have no daddy around when I was growing up/that's why i'm wild and i don't give a..\\" Come on now! True, many artists embrace the fact that they grew up in a broken home without a father but they also mentioned how it impacted them and made them a better person.

I don't know if due to the fact she's with the ROC which is why she has this attitude. She blames having no daddy why she acts so dumb. what a dumb song to write for a littel girl.

My employees have been having problems with the scans being light colored and can't seem to get the software to work correctly to make a pdf file that opens at the correct scale on my end.

The biggest annoyance is that you must set the scan page size in advance. There's no support to have it shut off at the end of the paper being scanned. And there's no support to trim the scanned image to the size of the paper after the scan.I contacted Pentax technical support through their website, inquiring about the API of the driver, but received no reply.

Quality of scan in PDF file is great. I have not tried other file type outputs.Cons: File created is saved using a default filename in one particular directory.

Scanning photos is a little more difficult. The maximum resolution is 600 DPI and the scanner is susceptible to dust collecting on the scanning mechanism causing colored streaks to appear in the photo. Besides this hindrance, photo scanning is sped up considerably over a conventional flat bed scanner. It does take some time to figure out how to efficiently crop the photos- the included software does not automatically crop photos for you- you must enter the size manually. If you have photos of various sizes, it's easier to scan photos grouped by size to get around this limitation. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Scanner","review":"From the moment I slid this out of it's leather case and ran the easy scanner setup software, I kicked myself for all the money poured down the drain on faxes and scans over the years, when I could have had this Pentax scanner in my laptop brief. It does exactly what it says, feed in a sheet(s), hit the button, scan, get the PDF, back in the leather case until next time, then fire the PDF off to your client, end of paper forever. Runs off the laptop USB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...as I expected","review":"I bought the scanner to digitize some of my old greeting cards, concert tickets, and other little memorabilia that became too unmanageable in physical form. The scanner works well for that kind of stuff. I would never use it for scanning photos, because the color is not totally accurate, and there are lines and anomalies on the image. I talked with someone at Pentax, who was very helpful and offered several tips, but he ended up saying that I may just have to get it replaced. Oh well...not worth the effort. The feed speed will not win any awards, but it is fine.I use Yep as an organizing software and a Mac for my computer; both of which this scanner is compatible with.Overall, it is a great scanner at a nice size and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well for me...","review":"I had read several of the reviews of this device, and noted some that commented on the users' difficulties in trying to get the pages to run through the scanner straight. I decided to take a chance and purchase this through gizmosforlife.I found that scanning straight was a near impossibility. It appears that there is only one roller running in the unit, so very few of my scans were completely straight. After about 30 attempts with different types of paper, and even placing the old newsletters I was scanning into a plastic sleeve, I eventually gave up and returned the unit.If the manufacturer added a second roller, I'd probably go right out and purchase the new version right away.It had a very small footprint, which I loved. My computer recognized the unit right away, and the software installed relatively quickly and with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SNOW LEOPARD!","review":"This scanner is not compatible with Snow Leopard.

It did not. Defaults were impossible to change. Sometimes, the desktop image would not appear and the computer has to be re-booted in order for the scanner to work.

It scans very effectively and is easy to use. I was worried that it would have problems with power from USB source only, but it works just fine, even off of a hub. The process to scan pages is quicker than a flatbed, as one doesn't need to get up, remove old sheets, put in new sheets, etc. One only needs to insert the sheets, scan, and the sheet pops out of the other side, leaving the scanner ready for the next sheet to be inserted. Very nice little unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great, easy setup on XP","review":"Product arrived on time and setup was easy and so far I have scanned 800 pictures and have had no problems, Color is good on scanned Images so I am pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this if you have a Mac","review":"This scanner was just delivered today and it was like a received a time machine to take me back to 1996.

Installation and calibration were straight-forward and took less than 10 minutes. The only three things on my wish list would be for the software to remember the chosen resolution for subsequent scans, a slightly larger case to more easily store the cord with the scanner, and for the ability to change the background color as, unless you place the items on paper, the background comes out black. Good choice otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received two defective units, gave up","review":"First unit I received had a broken servo drive right out of the box. After several weeks waiting for Pentax to deal with the warranty return, I received a replacement with a defective CIS (two thick black stripes across all scans).

The characters are poorly developed and uninspiring and a cohesive plot never seems to develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Combined Edition","review":"This softcover edition is an excellent combined presentation of Larry Niven's two smoke ring novels, including the original illustrations (maps). Both stories are outstanding examples of hard science fiction with interesting science, characters and plot twists. As a fan and reader I am left wanting more from the smoke ring but that is not a bad thing. These stories are also some of the author's favorite science fiction works (he has stated in interviews). My highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Get Into, But Worthwhile","review":"\\"The Integral Trees\\" is a novel from Larry Niven's \\"Known Space\\" that can be read without any prior familiarity with his other work. In this sense it is \\"stand alone.\\" However, it helps to have read his other books to have a feel for this universe.This book was difficult for me to get into. Part of the problem is that the fascinating world involved is so far different from our own. Time has to be spent reading and reviewing the charts provided from time to time to figure out how things are happening. Another reason for difficulty of getting involved in the story is that too much information is withheld, leaving the reader wondering for too long about what certain things mean.A final drawback is weak character development. The Smoke Ring itself takes center stage, so much so that the characters are mere shadows in the grand scheme of things.This is, however, wonderful science fiction. The fictional world created is truly remarkable and worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!","review":"The Integral Trees, well what can I say. I read this book quite some time ago and have read it three or four times since then. Compared to other science fiction writers, when it comes to setting Niven will blow your mind. I don't remember the directions right now (east, west, out, down...?)...I guess I should read it again in case I find myself in the Smoke Ring someday! If you enjoy writers who create universes then read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry Who??","review":"After reading this book I realized that Larry Niven must have been killed and replaced by a pod person. It's hard to believe that this piece of inane drivel was written by the author of Ringworld. A straight description of the physics of a toroidal gas ring would have been more interesting than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feel, good price, maximum durability!","review":"After 3 years of lessons, my coach told me it was time for a new racquet. This one, the Head Ti-S5 is the one he chose. I put it in my hands the first day I got it and it felt so good. The weight, which is about 8.8 ounces was unreal. Instantly, my power shifted, my serve went up 10 mp/h and my tennis game just all around improved.This is an amazing racquet. My high school tennis team practically endorses it. There are only 3 people who didn't use it because of preferences, but my coach talked with them all and convinced the others that a Head Ti-S5 was the best choice for them. They all agreed too. Some already used it and also thought it was a good racquet.If you want a good quality racquet, for a good price, and sick feel, a Head TI-s5 is the best way to go.

The three criteria I wanted in a new pair of sunglasses were that they have hinge-less frames, wrap-around lenses to cover the peripheral vision, and polarized lenses. These glasses delivered two out of three at a great price (compared to $200+ for Maui Jim's). The hinge-less frames are great- I don't get pain in my temples from the frames pressing into my head. The wrap-around lenses are great to keep the sun and reflections out of my eyes. There are only a few things that I wish different about these glasses- polarized lenses, a slightly darker tint, and the oval shaped decal on the left side of the lenses does not come off (at least not without using some sort of solvent). All in all, these are great glasses for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality glue on belts for sanders! :-(","review":"Had one on my belt sander and the glue let go after using it for 2 minutes.

Heavy duty and will last many years. I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though. If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack.

Prob 3: I am now at the point where game won't run (1 hour into it)so basically I wait for UBI to come up with patch or toss it. (I am in cave and video just freezes.) Game is linear, story line is OK, lots of those meaningless quests that have you running up and down. UBI should be ashamed, Anne McCaffrey should be totally ticked off and you shouldn't buy. Wish I hadn't. Do you ever get to ride a dragon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"The only reason I bought this game and still own it is because it's Pern. Too bad it's so BAD! Terrible, terrible loading time, wierd voice acting, you don't get to fight Thread, and it's SLOW (story-wise). I almost fell asleep playing it. I know this is really harsh, but if you really want to play the game, BORROW someone else's copy. It's only worth buying if you're a Pern Fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"This game plays terrible! This game has fixed cameras so it is very easy to walk off camera.

Adams aparently hasn't run out of variations on the cubicle, purchasing, and boss jokes, which are becoming repetative. Dilbert's mom and the World's Smartest Trash Man also are included, but only as incidental characters to a main storyline. However, Catbert's best strips are included and are some of Adams finest moments. Also, Alice is becoming a more mainstream character, and her handling of the Boss is humorous and refreshing. Overall a decent Dilbert collection, although not one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor to hang in an office","review":"This is Scott Adams at his second best. Though I am a Dilbert fan (and have been since '88) I must say I don't like his reletivly recent trend towards pleasing the wage slaves. This book is a perfect example. It is very very funny but not wuite as funny as his older, more outlandish material. I liked that every few Sundays Bob would give people weggies. I liked it when Dogbert would take over various third world countries. Now it seems that all he is shooting for is something for people to tack up in there cubes. He has already done that. Get back to your wackier roots, but in the mean time this really is funny (you might just want to tack a few up!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Amusing Read","review":"Scott Adams does it again-manages to tickle your funny bone and yet, at the same time, offers insight to the corporate world that are uncanny in their accuracy. This book is smaller than previous Dilbert collections, and offers no color. The strips are also assorted, with a mix of newer and older. Ultimately, this makes little or no difference to the quality of the read. If you are a Dilbert fan, or even someone just looking for a laugh, this collection is a must-buy. Scott Adams needling sarcasm and cynical sense of humor is sure to crack a smile on even the most dour countenance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice product, but it was delivered wrong","review":"I like the product, the stays are good, I like the finish of the product.

It doesn't fit well if you have the extra seat attached at the rear and reclined. If reclined, the rear part of the cover tends to ride up over the back of the seat allowing water to run into the rear seat.2. It is difficult to pass items to the child in the front seat, eg. drink, snack. A front access zipper/panel would be a great improvement.3. It is cumbersome to put on which exaggerates the access problem: once on, it's easier to leave on and hence a roll up panel or zipper to access the front child would be a big help.These comments also apply for the double sun cover. As someone who does a lot of walking/shopping with the stroller, I'm about to take the scissors to both my covers to do the mods myself...

Many Christians shy away from this picture of Jesus, but it is without a doubt biblical. Is He not called the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? Will He not destroy those who oppose Him at the Battle of Armageddon? Nevertheless, the author's handling of the Gospel narrative sometimes made me feel uncomfortable. It has been awhile since I last read it, but I vaguely remember hints of syncretism. Besides this, the Heliand is an excellent epic work. To all who are attracted to the Divine Warrior motif in Scripture or who simply admire Saxon culture I highly recommend the Heliand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is only good for starting fires.","review":"Ok I love Tom Clancy's books, but this one (disappoints).

Hitchcockian homages run rampant through most of De Palma's earlier films, and this one's chock-full of visual quotes, mostly cribbed from Vertigo and Psycho. But De Palma's indulgent depravity transcends simple mimicry to assume a vitality all its own. It's smothered in thickly atmospheric obsessions with [love], dread, paranoia, and voyeurism, not to mention a heavy dose of Psycho-like psychobabble about a ... transsexual who's compelled to slash up any attractive female who reminds him--the horror!--that he's still very much a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"PORNO","review":"I think this movie was HORRIBLE, and its WAY TOO risque for the 80's and even for now.

She can't even uphold the accent for more than one line!I can't even tell you how may times a burst out laughing while watching this movie due to acting that is soo bad that some of the school plays that I have seen in the past has acting that blows this movie away.I would give this no stars if I could.Defintly do not see this movie if you are expecting a wonderful depiction of Queen Elizabeth the first, because you defintly aren't going to get it.

And let's not forget about her completely inconsistant English accent. Just acting wise alone, this movie is a disaster.

I would recommend this game to gamers that do like racing and don't mind not having the more \\"in-your-face\\" action of an arcade with the steering wheel."},{"rating":"2","title":"hydro thunder","review":"i got this game because it was so great in the arcade. it is translated to the dreamcast beautifully, this game is excellent there are hidden passages which speed it up. it is realistic this game is downright awsome. i totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate Bulldozer Lyrics","review":"This book is hard to read, but there are intense moments of absolute pure Poetry. Is Leslie Scalapino a genius? Does she know what she is doing? If this book is so hard to read, why have I read it at least ten times already? With what insights am I rewarded for fighting my way through the jungle of what it takes to arrive at the moments of bliss?This book is sort of like John Ashbery's (now famous) 1962 THE TENNIS COURT OATH, and her writing reminds me most of Gertrude Stein's STANZAS FOR MEDITATION. except Scalapino's NEW TIME is more fragmented or disjointed, but also far more lyrical, and far more stunning (and simple) in its revelations.This book will not go away, and hopefully Scalapino will continue to forge ahead into new, unplowed terrain, sharing with her fans the layers of the pitch-black strata of her genius wherein sparkling diamonds can be unearthed, but only with a lot of work and patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like seeing Kyoto on valium, but more fractured than that.","review":"\\"This is despair\\" is one of the recurring fragments in New Time, and \\"being depressed is enhanced-- by the rim?\\" is another. Some find this book full of sublime poetry, but this reader found it full of elegant, smug, and fragmentary babble; the effect is like one of seeing Kyoto on valium, but the impact is more fractured and disturbing than that. I urge this poet to work out more, to see more, to connect to other people and the world beyond her own intense solipsism in love with its own twists and terms. The cold war of the US Scalapino hothouse is over, and despair and preciosity are not enough to engage this fallen fallen world. Go back to Go on this book, or listen to Basho or Dionne Warwick for some beauty that knows more than its own same-old language gaming. \\"New Time\\" is not new, just repetition of the same strategies times 94 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find it cheap, or forget it","review":"I'm not sure what T. Rogers who gave two reviews is talking about. Is he even reviewing THIS book? Anyway, I'll have to agree with one reviewer. No matter how you look at it, this book had $$$$$$ on it. David Donald wrote probably the greatest biography of LINCOLN in the last 40 years. Why something so shallow and pricey as this? As ABBA would say \\"money, money, money\\" - David Donald has not only sold the reader short, he has sold his own ability short. Anyone that can produce some of the prior works he has on Lincoln, and then this. Hey, this book isn't that bad as a gift (which it was for me), or something in the $1.00 bargain bin, not a bad deal at all. However, don't spend your hard earned money paying $30 (insane), $10 or even $5 on this book. Its ok, but not over $1 ok. Listen, for five dollars, I'd rather be looking over my five Dollar Lincoln instead of the five dollar Lincoln book. If your ever at a $1 book sale, I recommend! If you get it as a gift read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad transfer","review":"This movie appears to be a possible transfer from a vhs tape. The film is not clear and the color is terrible. Not much care was put in placing this movie on dvd. When there is a closeup of the cast speaking, their lips do not move with the words. I was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd. This movie is good and should have looked better on dvd. Two stars was given because it is a good movie. I have this movie on vhs, and could have saved my money by not buying the bad dvd. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Good Scenes","review":"I saw this movie when I was much younger and loved it back then. Now that I am older and watching the movie I did not find it as good as I remembered.

The good telepath Cameron ( Stephen Lack) comes upon the conspiracy and seeks to do the right thing. An evil telepath named Revok ( Michael Ironside) seeks to carry out his evil plan and stop Cameron.Horrible film quality that has every trapping of a \\"B\\" movie. Terribly outdated and overrated. The script is dull, the story is predictable, the acting utterly mediocre, and the special effects are cheap. It's time for this movie to find its Hollywood grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might need to butter your popcorn","review":"...with LSD in order to enjoy this movie. As many have said, the idea is interesting. Psychotic telepaths revolt against a defense contractor studying them for use as a war weapon. The story told is nonsensical, fantastic, and confusing, though. The acting is beyond the pale. The explodyhead scene is about as cool as this movie gets, I'm afraid. It's somewhat fun to watch Patrick Mcgoohan and Michael Ironside mug their way through the terrible script, I guess. The audio effects of the people talking in the scanners' heads might tempt the chemically impaired to think this movie is awwwwesome as well.Maybe if I viewed this as something of an abstraction I could have suspended my disbelief with some of the logical chasms in the film, but as a linear, plot-driven movie this was El Bombola. Cronenberg is a daring director, always willing to explore the strange and perverse, but I'd call Scanners fairly overrated for those who would rate it highly at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, distasteful movie:(","review":"This movie is too gross to be taken seriously. I thought it was meaningless ( what entertainment does it provide us ). Was it made to make us lose our lunches? It was disgusting. The so-called \\"scary music\\" was phony and lame. The acting is HORRIBLE, and the special effects are cheesy and awkward. This movie isn't worth the dirt of my shoes. It's totally gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanners","review":"What would you expect from a Canadian movie? the movie is intelligent to a degree,however it is boring and it's cliched corporate espionage is played out. not really sci-fi not really horror,some gross moments but it still doesn't make it interesting enough for me to see more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGGHHHHH MY HEAD!","review":"The only thing I liked about SCANNERS is the scene where a mans head blows up. It is without a doubt one of the most realistic head blowing up scenes ever. I laughed.This is still, a very slow, dull movie and the only cronenberg film I like is THE FLY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, MGM.","review":"My one-star rating is for this DVD, not the film, which is Cronenberg at his brilliant best. I find it utterly contemptible that such an obscenely rich company as MGM would have the gall to release such a shoddy DVD. Simply put, the last reel is out of sync, effectively ruining the crucial final 30 minutes of the film. Don't make the same mistake I did. Avoid this DVD like the plague until a more reputable company gives SCANNERS the proper DVD treatment it so rightfully deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite working for me...","review":"This is another one of those movies that I wasn't really looking forward to watching but my boyfriend was very insistent that I see it. I know it's meant to be on of those \\"scary\\"/thinker/suspense movies but I ended up laughing through a good chunk of it. The acting was terrible but the music was semi-decent. I'll give it that much. Of course, I'm not an expert on this genre but Scanners just didn't click with me. The whole thing was just too predictible. The ending just added to the predictibility. If you want a classic stereotypical thinker movie, then feel free to watch it. Worst comes to worst, you laugh instead of quaking in your boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed at all","review":"I saw this with a friend based on the fact that he said there was an exploding head scene. There definitely was and it was truly disgusting, which was nice but the movie was pretty awful all around. Like many have said the transfer from VHS to DVD was not kind to this film and at a certain point in the movie the voices are not following the mouths of the actors. The acting was pretty awful too if you ask me. I can't believe this is called an essential film by Amazon when this truly is just a rather weak attempt at science fiction. I guess it is worth seeing for the head explosion and the ending scene, but if you want to see a quality movie I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical goof up","review":"I'm not going to comment on the story line. Others have done that well. This review concerns the DVD release.Despite that the film has mono sound, it still appears fine...until chapter 12. About 2/3 of the way into the film, you can tell they did voice overs for the rest of the movie, and poorly. The voices are so out of sync with the lip movements, that I was unable to enjoy the rest of the film.I have the video tape as well (purchased when it first came out many years ago) and although being pan and scan, it is clearly superior. Not only are the voices original and therefore in sync, but the background sounds are noticeable too. For example when the characters are talking and a door is closed, you can't hear the door shut on the DVD because the voice overs muffle all other noises. On the video tape, it is as clear as day.I recommend watching the video tape until they come out with a better DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"true elegance & decadence","review":"Not only are the pictures exquisite, but the text is extremely engaging. This book really speaks to me. Of all my design books (and I have a lot of them), this is my favorite. I re-visit it again & again. The introduction by Donna Karan says it better than I can. This is an inspiring and amazing book if you are passionate about color, art, fabric, antiquities, and most importantly objects with a genuine patina. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no stasis to her stunning environments....","review":"Quatermaine's living spaces are tangible creative thought processes one can experience physically. Sensuous light, peeling paint elevated to the status of rich silk through placement of contrasting textures, objects and forms... Her contrasts are sublime. Rich jewel colors, curvaceous script and grafitti, common objects shrouded in diaphanous veils. She lives an ever-changing landscape of exquisite beauty, revealing the connections between the mundane and the etheric. Stunning photographs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection!!!","review":"I adore Carolyn Quartermaine! Several years ago I was captivated by a House Beautiful cover that featured gorgeous, lusciously colored printed silks. I saved the magazine, and later bought this book, only to open it and find the same photo. I was thrilled to finally find the artist who I'd been carrying in my head all those years. Carolyn is absolutely amazing, an incredible textile artist, as well as a beautifully creative individual. This wonderful book includes not only pictures of her work, but also a section on arranging food, and everyday objects that will make you feel like you've slipped into some heavenly version of Wonderland. An excellent book by an inspiring artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst abridgement ever","review":"I listened to the 3-disk audio CD of this work and was irritated from beginning to end. Burke dashes from one discovery to another at breakneck speed with hardly an interesting detail to pepper the narrative. In the chapter on electricity, we leap from Faraday to Coulombe to Watt to Ampere with hardly a breath in between. Unlike in Connections, in which one discovery lead almost inevitably to the next, Universe, Burke leaps from one advance o the next on the lightest gossamer thread of a connection. Even Burke's wonderful narrative voice can't rescue this mess. The order of cuts on the last disk is scrambled, as another reviewer noted. But worse, Burke's last chapter, on understanding the way our thinking bumps against prevailing paradigms, was near gibberish.Not having read the full version, I can't recommend it. But by all means stay away from this butchery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder!","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, but I did had to read it quite a few times. I was not familiar with Burke's styles of writing and the way he explains things so it was a bit confusing for me to understand. Once I read it long enough and started to ponder on the things he'd mentioned in his book, it eventually made sense to me. A good reading without a doubt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, rambles all over without finding a point","review":"This book was very disappointing. Its fragmented writing style reads like a 6th graders' attempt to summarize of all of European history in 5 pages or less. Instead of coherently showing how each of the eight discoveries changed human thought, it just meanders around them at random, never seeming to find the common thread."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Book on the history of Technology","review":"After you read this book, you will look at the world in a whole new way.It outlines on how random the pace of discovery of new ideas and technology really is. If you want to be really challenged intellecually, then go no further. Mr. Burke has done an outstanding job. I just wish that I could afford the DVD that is based on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle FAIL! The Kindle version is a disappointing mess!","review":"To be clear, this review and rating is strictly about the CRAPPY transciption of the book to Kindle. James Burke's book is wonderful.The Kindle edition is full of formatting and transcription errors, and the book's illustrations and plates are rendered meaningless on my small Kindle 3 screen. I love the content of the book, but wish I had bought a hard copy instead of wasting money on the Kindle download."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Better","review":"Burke has a way of making history, science, andthe human condition fun while telling you somethingthat makes you think about it.The Day The Universe Changed shows, as Burke hasbecome known for, connections between many aspectsof human life, the universe, and those odd, sometimessilly bits of everyday life.James Burke is one of the better popularizers of science,his prolific works (all the while being the consumate \\"geek\\"in big glasses and almost balding) make for, not just fun,but learning. Great stuff, and even better for kids whowill appreciate his quickness and ability to get to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful review of how the development of science and technology changed everything!","review":"Watch the TV series as well. Burke's ability to connect the people, the times and driving motivations behind the ascendancy of Western science and how it then changed all areas of human life is beautifully presented. The one major flaw in the Kindle edition (not applicable to other higher rez devices like the iPod) is that all of the wonderful illustrations and photos are almost unviewable on the Kindle- zooming makes them even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK DOWN MEMORY LANE!!","review":"THIS IS JUST ONE THE BEST R&B OLD SONGS TO LISTEN TO, THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every single song in this CD...","review":"...is really special!

Hope's Edge is even better than Diet for a Small Planet, and serves as a remarkable guide in a world that has become much harder to live in.Two books that have really changed the way I think about the world are Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point and Hope's Edge, by Frances Moore Lappe and Anna Lappe.

My only complaint is that many smaller, residential neighborhood streets are not listed. For that, you'll need a much larger, detailed map.

Written almost like an interview, Highsmith details the writing of her various books and short stories. If you're a fan of hers (as I am), these stories are entertaining since they show the genesis of her ideas and insights into her writing.However, it is difficult to see how many of her suggestions could be applied outside of the situation where she used them. It was almost as if she provided great anecdotes, but couldn't render general principles that would be useful in varied writing circumstances. If you're a Highsmith fan, you'll really enjoy this small book. If you're looking for general writing advice, another book might serve you better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insiteful in more ways than one","review":"I read this book after experiencing a couple of Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley novels. Since I liked her mysteries so much I thought this book would provide interesting insite into the mind and technique of the author, which it did. In terms of revealing the brain child behind the Ripley books it was quite revealing.ALthough I am not a professional writer of fiction, I found the advice in this book interesting and helpful because it was suplemented with real life examples. Highsmith fills this book with examples of what she did right and what she did wrong throughout her career. She explains the general--and fairly sensible--principles that guide her writing as well as the little details that can enhance or ruin a novel. If I were an aspiring author, I think I would derive useful and interesting information from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Surf Instrumental","review":"If you really like surf instrumental music - this is the one to get.

The devils are really devils, as in satanic, as in goat-boy, fire, brimstone, in my twisted nightmares, etc, etc. Not devil as in \\"oh you cute little devil\\" when an actual child does something mischievous.

The idea behind it and pictures might be too strong for younger children. I have 6 8 and 11 yr old children and took it to read in the classes. The 6 year old class was quiet the entire time unlike the other two classes. Also I felt after the story was read I had to explain to the classes the learned lesson behind it.

He saw a lot of the war in that part of the world and tells his story well, if not with any particular literary flair. The tale includes frank details of his personal life at that time which add to the richness of the story.

I am a surface Navy Vietnam vet and had three west pac tours, the names/places in the book our familiar to me, spent some time while reading trying to imagine what it looked like back then when the war could have gone either way.

After reading the Navy Seal book titled \\"Good to Go\\" I was able to feel the emotion of the experience, but was unable to get that same sense from this book. I think the author really missed the boat (ha ha) in allowing such an exciting story to be told in such a factual manner. I had no trouble putting the book down. I did pick it back up later because I did enjoy the educational factor of the text. All in all this was a very weak book and I do not recommend you waste your time reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB ACCOUNT","review":"Historically and technically accurate. Excellent description of the maturing af out first line of offense and defense. Boyne really knows, and shows tempered perspective covering 50 years of increduble advances in Air Force systems and management"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent representation of the USAF, past and present.","review":"Walter Boyne provides a great account of the first fifty years of the USAF. From the early Army Air Force days when the US had barely enough aircraft to hold a missing man formation, to the end of the Cold War where the US won out on sheer firepower.Mr. Boyne, having flown personally is the right man for the job, due to his sometimes first hand knowledge of events he is highly credible. He addresses key events in the USAF's history, like the end of WWII, KOREA, and VIETNAM. These events make up the very essence of the USAF. He is very thorough in describing the ever changing culture and strife the USAF has gone through in the last 50 years.I highly recommend this book and frequently go back to relive the last 50 years of the greatest service this country has ever known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the Price","review":"After a month's use, I'm still enjoying this product. There are a few caveats that users need to be aware of, however. First of all, you cannot play DRM protected music files on this player - that means no mp3s from iTunes or other legitimate online music store. Also, the user interface can be a little arcane and takes some getting used to. The included manual is sparse, to say the least. If you can get past these limitations, though, this is a great player for the money. The FM radio works fine (weaker stations are a little staticky), and if you have an OS later than Windows 98, you can transfer files to the player without using any proprietary synching software. Plus, the player is a fully functional thumbdrive, so you can just plug it right into an open USB port and drag and drop files to and from it. You can also run portable programs like portable Firefox, winamp, Open Office, etc. right off of the drive. Very handy and great for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstandig description of interesting times in a novel","review":"A look at actual history through the eyes of a participant The description of shipboard life in the eighteenth century actually brings one aboard these heavy wooden ships."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I own...","review":"Between this title and \\"Come to the Quiet\\" it's hard to pick a favorite.

He's one of the pioneers of the form, and this is one of his earliest, best records. It may sound a little dated now because of some of the instrumentation, but there's no hiding the pure fun and musicality of the songs or the musicans on this record. Howard never received the kinds of kudos that a lot of other musicians after him that copped his style did, but they never made records as strong as this one, either, so it all kind of balances out in the end. If you're looking for your first Howard record, start here or with \\"Personal\\". If you're just looking for some good cookout, early evening, after 6 party-without-dancing type of jazz, this is your record anyway. Long live the pioneer."},{"rating":"2","title":"E.T.

This game has both. You can play well minutes after opening the box and with something like 20 characters, there are always challenges to master each character. My only criticism is of the Championship mode where you train boxers and take them through title fights. The mini-games to train the boxers are pretty weak and the whole process is somewhat tedious. Otherwise, it's a solid game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best fighting games.","review":"This is one of the best games that I've ever played. It kept me busy for hours. It's graphics are incredible. It's incredible the amount of detail in facial features.

In defense of Radner and Wilder she was suffereing health problems while the movie was filmed and I can understand this-- but gheesh the editing didn't make any sense- Dom DeLuise gives the audience a warning in his monologue when he says-(paraphrased) It gets worse than this-- and it does!!The script becomes a parody of itself- the acting was ok - but the story never evolved. There were one or two special effects that almost sparked an interest 3/4 of the way through the movie. Should have never been released-- The real horror in this film is the fact that one doesn't realize how bad it is until they sit through it-- A good cure for insomniacs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun","review":"Hard to think of a noted comic actor or comedian (or comedy team) that has not been thrust into a haunted house. Generally, the outcome is good. So, too, here, save that the one who does the thrusting is Gene Wilder, who assumes various roles besides acting. The outcome is worth seeing. The cast supporting star, Wilder, and his late wife, Radner, runs from competent to quite good. Surprisingly, the few songs imported into the film for no particular reason, make a disproportionate contribution to lightening the atmosphere. More than a quarter of a century has not aged the picture a bit. Oh, yes, Dom DeLuise is clearly an acquired taste, as they say; I'm still working on acquiring it. He doesn't mar the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for closet storage.","review":"This is great for closet organizing. Men's shoes fit in the shelf pockets with room to spare and the side pockets are an extra bonus. I plan to buy one for each of my closets.

It sounds very nice.The Charley edition has some updates plastered on the (still original) artwork. It is made in Germany. It is noted as \\"Digitially Remastered at Charley Studios\\" and is in fact a sonic reworking. It is brighter, with more sound teased out of the original source (not that there is anything wrong with the original). Whether you think it sounds better may depend on your tastes. It has more sound but may possibly border on pushing things too far.There are reasons to like both editions.All the other versions (with new cheap artwork) are suspect. I'm not sure what the origins are or whether they are actually legit or cheap knockoffs, but I'd be careful of them (not even really sure if the Charley version is totally legit)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent How To Resource!","review":"I am working on a tea house in my garden using traditional and modern methods, but wanted to make my own shoji doors.

I especially like the fact that the author talks a lot about his apprentice years, even down to the tools he received and the sorts of jobs he was expected to do. In the U.S., houses aren't built with this blend of art & science, but I think that may change as people become more unhappy with the slapped-together, junk-wood and drywall method of home building. MAKING SHOJI is probably not for the Black & Dekker crowd, but carpenters and other curious folk will find it very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great to hear ATF again, but two BIG problems","review":"I grew up on ATF, so I was delighted to hear them again (and I'd never heard the instrumental \\"Joy\\", which is cool). However, I was extremely disappointed by two things. First, three of the songs were remixed: \\"Dancing in the Shadows\\", \\"Starflight\\", and \\"One Rule for You\\". \\"Starflight\\" isn't too bad, but the other two are TERRIBLE. The originals are MUCH better. Second, how in the world can you release a Best of ATF without including \\"Carry Me Home\\"? I love the disk because it's ATF, but a plea to Sony, echoing other reviewers: PLEASE RERELEASE THE ORIGINAL ON CD!!!!!!! I would buy it in a heartbeat. And DON'T remix anything this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful Book","review":"Like most Sage books this book has a great table of contents which i appreciate.

It was strange because these (something like them at least) used to be pass-time items that I used to play with when I was a child, and now my children are doing the same. The initial draw to this book (not knowing what a 'cootie catcher' was beforehand) was the adorable little girl on the cover of this book. My five year old son said he has a crush on the little angel and that's what ultimately caught his attention. She looks so friendly, so kind and caring, and just precious as can be! They definitely knew how to advertise. Overall, book was helpful and I do suggest it as a HAVE for your children.

The designs are great! Bright and colorful--and there are ready made catches plus blank ones to fill-in too! They come in a spiral note book-type format...they are easy to remove and complete directions are very helpful! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice quality paper, not excited about the fortunes","review":"This book is printed on very nice, high quality paper. The designs are fun and eye-catching.However, I was really disappointed with the \\"fortunes\\".... a lot of boy/girl stuff and for other items I thought the overall tone was flippant, kind of \\"in your face\\".I have fond memories of making cootie catchers at Girls Scout Camp many years ago, so I was excited to introduce my kids to them. But I didn't think the overall theme here is appropriate for a seven and nine year old. It is very \\"worldly\\" for lack of a better term.There are several blank pages at the back, so you can create your own themes, so that is one redeeming thing.

If the sample function had worked, I would have realised that the illustrations were small, and black-and-white, despite the color cover. Since I can't zoom the images on my iPod Touch, it's like viewing a postage stamp. The detailed illustrations are useless. It's also for sportfish mainly, not reef fish.

I am a secondary level French teacher. The theories of instruction that this book explores are very enlightening, however the practical examples it offers are more suitable for university level instruction. My biggest complaint with this text is that the examples of communicative language teaching methods it offers are in English and are too vague to lend themselves to practical application. One is left wanting more specifics than the examples give, especially when the text advocates such activities as \\"brainstorming\\" or group input activities.

I have played it twice already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but very hard","review":"This game is so much fun and so intense, but it is very difficult (at least for me). Some of the controls are confusing and difficult to master. I have only played to Chapter three, and that is where I got stuck because of the controls. The game makes you do a kind of Simon combination of arrow pushes on the keys, but if you don't to them at precisely the right time, you fail. Very very difficult. The story behind the game is intense and full of mystery and I do like the game, it is just hard to play because of the controls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best adventure game of all time","review":"Simply put, i have never been so entralled by a game's plot or attached to a games characters...When it was over, I actually missed them.

Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE controls and functionality","review":"The premise of the game seems like it would have been interesting, however it is unplayable on PC, because the controls are HORRENDOUS. The worst, clunky, controls of any game I have ever played. I tried with both the mouse/keyboard, as well as with a usb game controller. The game I purchased was also glitchy. The game gets 1 star and that's being generous. If you can't get past the first moments because the controls are THAT bad, then that's saying something about how horrible it is. From what I understand, the console versions aren't as bad as the PC when it comes to the controls and functionality. I would definitely not recommend this game. There is no entertainment in a game this unplayable. Whomever developed the controls for the game made a serious error in judgment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indigo Prophecy","review":"This was one of the worst games I ever played as I could not use my mouse and I didn't have anything else to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun overall, left me longing for more","review":"This was a great game! So what if it was copied from some movies? I had fun and that's what matters. The controls were a little hard to get by but redefining the Num 1,2,3,5 to match the arrows keys did the job for me. The cinematics though nothing new were still awesome because you could feel the hard work that went into making it. Overall I would recommend playing it because its a great game for killing a whole day."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the controls alone, I cannot say anything good","review":"The pretext sounded interesting, but in the end I felt that I have wasted a few bucks, bandwidth and a patience.Trying to get through the first scene alone was a pain due to the controls.

My children listened to this not only as babies, but growing up they enjoyed and sang along with these songs for years. There is even a wonderful song for Christening a child. Michael Card is an inspired and gifted songwriter and singer. Everytime I hear of a young mother who is expecting a bundle of joy, I always purchase this cd to start them off with. You must not miss out on this experience with your little one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Go-To-Sleep Tape for Children!!","review":"I was given this tape when my first child was born. We didn't use it for awhile, but when she began sleeping in a big girl bed, we needed a \\"sleep cue\\" to help her relax enough to go to sleep. This tape was it. By the time my second was through this stage, we had completely worn the tape out. They are 5 and 7 now, and I KNOW that if we could still use the tape, they'd enjoy going to sleep with it many nights. The songs are not just babish lullabies. They are semi-contemporary, ballad-style songs, and are appropriate for babies, toddlers, even pre-schoolers. We have strict, conservative views, and the songs were not objectionable to us. It is just wonderful! So comforting and calming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Purchase with the Book","review":"I love this CD, but I would suggest buying it with the book. The book has a wonderful (but some would call it mature) lullaby that isn't on the CD. It is for aborted babies, and one that cannot be sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of singer's voice","review":"I had a hard time listening to this CD that we received as a baby gift because the woman's voice sounds like she's singing in too high of a note.

The songs themselves are absolutely beautiful, but I wish the singer would have sung in a lower tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful illustrations and calming music","review":"It's hard to find music that calms my baby in the evening. This book has beautiful songs with a great message. We got the mp3 tracks to sing along with, since we were unfamiliar with the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very soothing, but...","review":"The music is lovely and soothing. The lyrics, for the most part, are profound and meaningful, but are occasionally sad and occasionally preachy. What bothers me most about this CD is the lullaby for the innocents, never to be sung. It's a poem printed in the book and CD jacket, and is a sort of requiem for aborted babies. I did not like thinking of aborted babies every time I put the CD in (listed as sort of the last track). Further, I would never give this as a gift to anyone who lost a child to miscarriage, my best friend being one of those people - her much-loved and desired little one also could not be calmed by her lullabies and is far beyond her reach. I think Michael Card was just not thinking of those poor women when he put in his requiem, and it would be heartbreaking for anyone who ever lost a child to read this poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"I had this tape for my youngest son and he listened to it for years.

I am now 17 years old, and I still remember these songs. I truely love this CD, and find myself humming the music when I want to fall asleep at night. I haven't listened to it in a few years, and it seems like my mom has misplaced the CD, so I decided to listen to the samples on Amazon. I have to say, this is probably the most soothing thing I've ever listened to. It even beats out my thunderstorm/nature sounds! I would recommend this CD to anyone who is going to have children or who has a baby. I know that my mother and I will always have a connection linked through this music, and recommend it to anyone who wants their 17 year old to love their mom as much as I love mine. Thank you, Mamoo! <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing and inspirational","review":"My Mother bought this for me before my daughter was born, saying she heard it was \\"absulute magic\\" for getting babies to sleep! It didn\`t exactly work for my newborn, but the soothing music, beautiful voices, and inspriational lyrics in this album certainly comforted me on these first difficult months of nighttime torment and I am sure as my daughter gets older, it will also calm her to sleep too! I am sure it will be a treasure for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"This is the best lullaby album ever. I was just purchasing it for a friend who just had a baby. When my little brother and sister were born my mom got it for them and when I babysat I would play it for them and now I am away in college and feeling homesick, so I downloaded a song from it just for myself. Very comforting, the lyrics are so awesome. Jacobs Dream is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifull music that's truely for all ages","review":"The first time I heard anything from this CD was at my friend's house. I heard it, and, as I can recall, fell in love with the music at the first song. The songs are not only soothing, but if you listen to the words you can actually fall in love with them. Michael Card certainly worked hard on this CD; if there was ever a CD I could listen to over and over again it would be this one. I bought this CD shortly after and always keep it around. All I can say is even an adult would fall asleep before the third song...!I would deffenetly recomend this CD for anyone with a young child, or an old child. This CD should certainly not go without praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for baby","review":"This was bought for my mother for one of my younger siblings. It has great songs - perfect for going to sleep or just calming down. I've bought it as a baby gift for several friends and each one has told me that their baby loves it.

My baby is here now and seems to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but...","review":"Thought watch was beautiful online. Very different. In person, it justs looks a little strange.

Psychoanalysis is compelling and convincing without the 'data' - much of it questionable - Vaughan cites.

The author has developed a well laid out and very intriguing plot. The author undoubtedly knows well not only the Tanakh and Brit Chadasha, but a good, if not excellent grasp of Rabbinic literature, and the interesting nature of many experiences among Jews who have come to know Yeshua as HaMashiach. However, I found the use of frequent anti-semitic slurs quite offensive, even when it was supposedly in friendly banter; as well, I would have preferred the Jewish Believers using more Hebrew terminology instead of westernized Greek when referring to Hashem and their being brought to salvation. Probably the only aspect of this book that I'll seriously kvetch about is that this is still a manuscript which definitely needs a proofreader and editor. Perhaps, the problem is primarily \\"farchadat\\" publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful","review":"These instruments have nothing whatsoever with an original Aboriginal didgeridoo.

Wow - I had an Orange Cube in there and none were on it - they were all hiding - 30 seconds after putting a lid full of this in there I had crickets 3 deep trying to get at it! And after 15-20 minutes they were 2-3 deep on the Quencher gel - and still none on the orange cube. Now after a week all my crickets are getting bigger and plumper!

After two days, the orange cubes dry up and I throw them away. I never see any of the crickets congregating around the orange cubes, so I don't think they like them at all.If crickets LOVE the orange cubes, aren't they supposed to eat it up and then it disappears? Why am I throwing out dried up orange cubes that don't look like any crickets have taken a bite?Lots of good reviews on this product, but I don't like it.

For two weeks after my first monumental viewing of this film, I couldn't get the closing scene out of my mind and 15+ subsequent viewing have left me with the dame feeling every time. But I don't want to praise this movie just for the ending. As said before, the story is very involving, the acting great, and the direction fantastic.

With the exception of John Travoltas character nobody else stuck out as being interesting at all. A few things that might have helped. A decent soundtrack. The music was terrible and did not make you feel the least bit of tension. It sounded almost out of place within the movie.

John Lithgow is the best thing on screen. I often like old seventies and early eighties movies for their 'look' but I was even left disappointed from that point of view. I found the score to be lacklustre, but at least for an early 80's pic it didn't enter into poxy synth territory.Finally I was underwhelmed with the Blu Ray transfer.

Lots more gore and people getting gutted, but not nearly as entertaining as the first. The same as most of Clive Barker's sequels, lacks imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"baaaaad sequel!","review":"I was expecting this movie to be way better especially from how good the first one is, when i watched it i was incredibly disappointed, this film is nothing like the first one and is boring and crap, i would rather sit through hellraiser than this pile of junk again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel","review":"Break the mirror- break the curse. A white woman had an affair with a black man, who gets his hand chopped off and killed by bees after being glazed with honey. \\"Sweet is the sweet,\\" the crowd said and gthey said \\"candy man\\" five times. If you say \\"candy man\\" in a mirror five times supposedly he would appear. His soul was trapped in a mirror. Wher the first Candy Man was scary, this sequel explains its origins. They raised Candy man's child as a white girl and no one suspected a thing. Not really scary, but suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corney Candyman seequel","review":"Candyman: Farwell To The Flesh is a dissapointing and chessey sequel. The cast is good, the story isn't, and the setting isn't orignal. The film could of been better and it was no where near as good as the first one, but the third Candyman movie is better. This film isn't all that great but I recommend it, and I only gave it two stars because the beginging was good because it had details from the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase, rent or see this movie","review":"Compared to the original and Barker's masterpiece which once again blurs the thin line between pleasure and pain this movie is a complete let down. The sub plots and annoying disc jockey mesh to form what one might call an extremely annoying and trite horror experience. The plot is predictable and obviously if your considering purchasing this film you have not seen it. Trust me, Clive Barker's other films Hellraiser I, II and IV are where you should be browsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel","review":"I thougth that this film would of been better but it wasn't. It was a corney, chessey, and cheap sequel. The film had no value in special effects and meaning, and it wasn't as close to be good as the cult classic orignal. I only gave it two stars because it had the same music, and themes, as the orignal, and that it had characters and pictures from the orignal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sequel...need I say more?","review":"As if the first was'nt bad enough and even now a 3rd candyman film is out with yet the same kind of plot. Tony Todd is good as the baddie, but these films lack originality, sure you may say I'm just a reviewer what would I know, I could'nt do better, but in fact I can, I've come up with better ideas.Sequels can be good and in some cases better ie; TERMINATOR 2, ALIENS but this candyman 2 is just very weak and the best bit in the whole film was the end scene where he breaks like a mirror into a thousand pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I JUST DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE OR THIS SERIES.

I still don't know if it is part of that series but if it is something went terribly wrong. I loved the other books, but honestly this one stank. I could not even read more than a few stories. Then there is this dribble in between stories that they didn't do in the other ones. Someoen please tell me...is this a Chicken Soup book?Or is it a rip off?

I couldn't believe how corny and fake the stories were. and the themes created by the authors throughout the chapters made it even worse. The book claims to be original but it is really a take off of the chicken soup for the souls and an awful one at that! i havent even finished the book yet and i don't think i ever will! if you want to read REAL stories by real teens then the chicken soup for the soul books are the way to go!! not these books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another Chicken Soup","review":"In no way did this book compare to chicken soup. The storieswere short and meaningless. The people who wrote this book must nothad ever been teens or they would have know that any teen it's right mind would not enjoy this book.

I think, similar to the Teen Love series, this book tries too hard to offer something more than the Chicken Soup books that it does itself a disservice... the author attempts to add in extra sections in between the stories that only come off as condescending. Whilst some of the stories are worth reading, none of them managed to stir up the same emotion and feelings as the Chicken Soup series and if you are looking for this type of book, I strongly suggest you look towards the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul series which now features over 5 excellent books full of encouragement, originality and inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"51 bad plans","review":"This book has fifty one plans. About 5 are less than 2,000 total s.f. About 8 are between 2,000 to 2,400 total s.f. The rest are over 2,400 s.f. up to 4,000 s.f. Most are a 60's contemporary design with 1,550 s.f. each side.

The box is highly deceptive - none of the games run under Windows 95/98 - only the helps system and the sneak peaks. Several interviews with the creator add some spice for the hardcore fans though. I wouldn't recommend it for anybody but the hardest fans or the extreme enthusiasts. My recommendation to Origin - update the games before republishing! Follow the LucasArts example with X-Wing and Tie Fighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use.","review":"I never got into the ultima title so I thought this would be a great way to get into it. It advertised it was the complete first eight titles in one. However it was only the first three adventures and they are uncompatible with the newer computer systems despite the claim it would be. My computer locked up every time I tried to play it. Over all I found it very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"It's pretty simple, here. Ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with Ultima 7. So you want three games if want old-school Ultima: Ultima 7, Ultima 7 Serpents Isle, and Ultima 8. The rest of the titles are just garbage, and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable. Is anybody really buying this? And will your PC even play the older titles? And would you even want it to? They're bad. I mean, really, really, bad.This is a nostalgia purchase, nothing more. It is to witness the evolution of RPG gaming, but definitely not to empty your bank account doing it.Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 Serpents Isle are still great fun to play; Ultima 8? A little less so, mostly because it is smaller in scope. This is where the Baldur's Gate Series began, which eventually spawned the Elder Scroll Games, so there is an historical component. Still, it's just not worth this price. I might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again (maybe). Yeah, maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has nothing to do with a Review","review":"I know that the Ultima games are awesome but I can't play any of them.This title has been on backorder since early January. Don't waste your time ordering. I will get my software the day after never..!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have collection of a truly groundbreaking series.","review":"No serious computer gamer should be without this collection. Nine of the most important and influential CRPGs ever to be released in one collection is something that should not be missed. And nearly all the games are excellent. Though the early Ultima games don't have the depth and complexity of the later entries in the series, the continuing fabric of the universe and the tapestry of the story progress and grow as you move from game to game. The games also serve as a highly entertaining window to gaming industry, allowing you to see how technology grew and changed over time. Whatever your reasons, there is no excuse for not getting this marvelous collection of important--and extremely entertaining--games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Immediately got my attention and kept it throughout the book. It was difficult to lay it down. It is hard to believe these guys escaped and never gave up against tremendous odds. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Words are not effective in reviewing this book. It is heartbreaking to learn of what occurred at Sobibor; it is unimaginable, unthinkable. As a Jewish woman, I wanted to know more about WWII and have read many books; this one being unique in that it was solely about Sobibor. It was painful to read of the cruelty - not an accurate word - the evil - that had been forced upon the Jewish people in this camp. Their will to survive was amazing. A tough book - not fiction - all fact - and difficult to comprehend that other human beings could be so inhumane. This book opened up my eyes to the excruciating and extreme cruelty towards the Jewish people more than any other. If you want to learn, to be informed about a death camp during WWII, this is for you. It was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"If you are looking for an essential work in indian philiosophy, look no further. \\"The Bhagavad Gita with The Commentary of Sri Sankaracharya\\" is, bluntly put, a poetic parable about the conflict of a man and his path to wisdom. The book is a translation, from the ancient indo-european language of Sanskritt, of The Bhagavad Gita, which is a discourse between Krishna (the creator of all) and Arjuna (his conflicted great nephew)about the path to self-realisation; and there is the commentary of Shankara which is a key to understanding the path and ultimately living it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon i80 Is it worth it?","review":"We've used this printer a little over one year and loved it. Unfortunately, now it is plagued with problems. First of all the print head is extremely sensitive to drying out and is very difficult to impossible to clean using the printer's clean function or doing it manually. Canon offers a replacement head for $65. Next the ink cleaning reservoir with normal use will fill up in about a year. To replace it will cost $120 and is only available through Canon. The print does travel well which is its intended use, but for an everyday printer you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"good at first but then has lots of problems","review":"I travel a lot and have a lot of Canon equipment, so I thought this would be a good choice. Prints look good and it is super small. Unfortunately, I had to take it in for a full rebuild 3 times under warranty, and I really don't use it much at all. That might be part of the problem. The heads dry out really fast, and after a while, it doesn't even see the new ink cartridges. My cost per print runs about $3 because of the waisted ink. It has definitely NOT worked a lot more than it has worked. Prints that I made on the canon photo paper faded right away. In conclusion, I have 6 Epson printers, and they have problems as well, but nothing like the Canon. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little printer","review":"Bought this printer several years ago and it's still going strong. One thing that amazes me is I sometimes don't use it at all for several weeks. You'd think the ink would dry up and have to be replaced. It doesn't. The first copy I print will come out with weird colors but after that it's fine. The tiny little ink cartriges also last MUCH longer than I expected. This is great to take to clients' home to print up our work together right on the spot AND it's nice to have a backup printer when my big one isn't working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing and not sturdy at all","review":"I purchased the Canon I80 printer as I wanted a small portable unit for training and conference events. The unit has broken down multiple times, the heads dry out and get clogged all the time and every time I turn around something else goes wrong...I purchased the unit for $250 and have spent as much keeping it going and only used it 12 times. It has now failed again and they want another $240 to fix it. Really a waste of money. I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer Heads Dry Out","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with Mark Page-Botelho's review. This printer is not for regular use. I had the same problem with the black print head drying out.

A little dry in some areas and could use improving, but overall a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best available","review":"One reviewer here has written concerning this text, \\"Probably the most useful textbook available to the undergraduate control student.\\" Based on my use of earlier editions of this text (1st and 3rd), which proved very helpful to me, and my struggles with numerous other texts, which did not prove so helpful, I tend to agree with him. It is well written, more clear, more understandable, etc. So, I give it five (5) stars, especially to offset the low rating given by others. On the other hand, the complaint made by the others had mainly to do with the text's lack of examples commensurate with the complexity of the problems offered. I think that these complaints are right on the money, but not so much in relation to this particular text as to engineering texts generally. One does not learn very much when most of his energy has to be committed to looking for a needle in a haystack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Larf Disturbance","review":"I cannot call this a laugh riot, as Mr. Cook is humorless. Yet there are laughs to be culled here by those who believe in a single standard of conduct. The author deplores the very IDEA of innuendo, guilt by aquaintance, and \\"wild charges\\"--then proceeds for several hundred pages to list every nutty and outrageous claim about McCarthy and to damn just about anyone who ever thought Stalin belonged in the nogoodnick file. He does not, however, mention Paul Hughes, who sold a false story to leading liberals that McCarthy was stashing guns in the Senate basement, and that the New York Post food editor was a right-wing agent. No, Mr. Cook is selective--and an ink blot test of what liberals WANT to believe. For a non-emotional view--and better history--pick up \\"McCarthy and His Enemies\\" by Buckley and Bozell or \\"McCarthy\\" by Arthur Herman. The only thing worthwhile here is a snicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it for one song.","review":"Only one song, \\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman\\" is worth listening to.

Without the input of Jim Vallance and Bob Clearmountain (song writers and producers of \\"reckless\\", \\"Cut's like a knife\\", etc.), Adams song-writing has clearly gone down hill. Klunkers such as \\"I want to be your underwear\\" and \\"Black Pearl\\" are scrapings from the bottom of the barrel. \\"Mutt\\" Lange's finger-prints are all over this album, from the corn-ball lyrics to the hackned riffs and choruses. Mutt produced one of the greatest albums in rock history, Def Lep's Pyromania, but since has done nothing but trivialize the genre. I'm sorry, but this album lacks quality and substance. The production is good, though. The vocals and guitar work are clear and crisp, also a Lange trade mark. I look forward to an Adams album when he's reunited with Vallance and Clearmountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always be right There","review":"That is the perfect song for anyone. please try this song out, maybe a wedding, a dance or even just to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Finest Work, But Not His Worst","review":"This Bryan Adams effort came after a small run of success with the two songs, \\"Please Forgive Me,\\" and \\"All For Love,\\" (from the motion picture The Three Musketeers).It had been nearly five years since an album full of new songs from this Canadian Rocker hit the markets (his last effort being the classic Waking Up The Neighbours.) With this CD came a string of good songs including:\\"Star,\\" \\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?\\" and \\"I'll Always Be Right There.\\"But then of course there's the bad:\\"I Wanna Be Your Underwear,\\" and \\"We're Gonna Win,\\" are the first two to come to mind.Bryan's work was starting to get sloppy and he was beginning to work strictly for movies pretty much. This album signaled what could have been an end for Bryan, but eventually he came back around with On A Day Like Today and then an amazing Unplugged performance.This CD is for die hard fans like myself - strictly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Stay 18 Forever","review":"Bryan Adams was a huge pop star back in the late '80s and early '90s, but this is the album that ultimately derailed his career. Released in 1996, the album marked the birth of the newer, \\"cooler\\" Bryan Adams: the one with slicked back hair. The image overhaul unfortunately overshadowed the album, which had its fair share of hits. \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman\\" was the big hit here, and deservedly so. However, the album has just as many misses as hits: \\"We're Gonna Win\\" is Adams' sad attempt to create something of a stadium staple. Also, song titles like \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You\\" and \\"(I Wanna Be) Your Underwear\\" are just creepy from a guy who once told us that everything he did, he did it for us. And that's the main problem with this album: Adams was the \\"nice guy\\" of rock and roll for too long. His new image and slickly produced album just don't quite work. Buy his \\"Best of Me\\" collection, or \\"Have You Ever...\\" as a single, and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know B.A. Fans Will Be Upset With Me...","review":"...But I don't care much for this album at all. I like the albums, \\"On A Day Like Today\\", \\"Waking Up The Neighbours\\" and love \\"Reckless\\", but \\"18 Til I Die\\" is a mess. The first track, \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good...\\" and \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\" are good songs, but that's it. These two songs book-end an album of incoherent lyrics, strange teenage boy-like fantasies, and pop-rock melodies which have no hooks to them. I really do feel like this album was made by a group of teenage kids in a garage band. It feels like a step backwards for Bryan. We're talking 1970's. Even the romantic ballads feel contrived and un-romatic this time around. Strange and disappointing album from a great pop-rocker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryan, Time to grow up.","review":"The titles give it away: \\"18 Til I Die,\\" \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You,\\" \\"Do To You,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Underwear.\\" This is a work of deliberate immaturity, not a valiant effort to recapture youthful exuberance. This is just a mistake for a performer who is capable of quality material. There are \\"guilty pleasures\\" from such obviously infantile lyrics but they do not hold up for more than any one song. Add in Adams' worst movie theme (\\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman\\") and you have what is possibly Adams' worst CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Westclox Ardmore Twin Bell Alarm Clock","review":"So far so good....easy to set time on this clock.....alarm is loud enough to hear on the clock.

BACK TO THE TABLE is a cookbook that takes us back to a time when the dinner table actually meant something; before frozen dinners and fast food.BACK TO THE TABLE is not about the latest health craze or the newest way to cram a meal in between soccer practice and violin lessons. This book is about taking the time to sit down at the table and eat with your family.The recipes are delicious and simple (if a little time-consuming) and the focus on southern tastes seems to reflect the author's background. Some definite winners in BACK TO THE TABLE are the Grandma's chocolate cake and the incredible chicken tamales.Art Smith has created a cookbook that is both beautiful and useful, with an important message and tasty recipes. 5 stars all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book","review":"This is the kind of cookbook that is not just great to look at but really inspires a person to cook a meal for his/her family.

Yawn! Yawn! This workout is awful. It's so slow and boring. She put more thought into her costumes and locales than the actual movements. I take a bellydance fitness class at my gym and wanted something with high engery moves. And despite it's claim, this workout was not high energy. I don't even think I worked up a sweat. I'm sorry but, I don't think that anyone needs to do 5 minutes of snake arms. If you haven't worked out in the last year, you might find this tape interesting. But if you've done any kind of bellydancing or excercise regularly, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goddess Workout with Dolphina: Introduction to Bellydance Fi","review":"This DVD is good for people that are more interested in learning how to bellydance. Dolphina demonstrated the basic moves but because she is wearing bellydancing garb it is difficult to see the mechanics of her movement. I wanted a workout not a bellydancing lesson. There are more shots of her face than her body movements. After 10 minutes I was still doing the workout but I was beginning to get bored! Overall, I think this DVD is better suited for entertainment purposes. There are better bellydance workout/fitness DVDs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I did this workout just once and had no desire to try again. It was boring, hard to follow, and gave no cardio benefit to speak of. The instructor's feet are partially covered by her costume at times so you can't see what you are supposed to be doing. And when they say \\"goddess workout\\" that is what they mean - you get to hear about the instructor's religious views as they relate to bellydance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, that sucked...","review":"...0 stars, actually. Gosh, I wish I'd bought something on salsa instead. I suppose they could have been less informative about how to do the different moves in the workout, but I'm not sure how. Basically I spent 15 bucks to find out how sexy Dolphina is, and how she knows nothing at all about chakras, kundalini, or the actual mechanics of belly dancing. Yee-ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I have been taking beginner belly dance classes and bought this dvd for home practice. Dolphina was horible. Her movements are very exagerated and do not represent traditional belly dance movements. Most of the shots are of her face which makes it difficult to learn the lower body movements. She is more interested in being a model than a belly dancer. Don't waste your money on her dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be bellydance?","review":"She might have tried to make an introduction to bellydance, but she didn't succeed. I've been bellydancing for several years. I don't know much about american dancestyle, but I dought that you will learn how to bellydance from this DVD. It doesn't look anything like oriental bellydance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad","review":"Sometimes the instructor is a little strange, but her workouts are nice and I enjoyed the instruction. Some of the setting were strange, but again, the information was useful for a beginner in this art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but...","review":"...not an effective workout. I didn't even break a sweat. Additionally, it's hard to follow because the camera is always focused on her face. If you want a good bellydance workout I would recommend the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners series with Veena and Neena."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and relaxing- I enjoy it.","review":"I personally really enjoy this DVD. It is relaxing and it is easy to follow. It is really simple. Her costumes are also stunning and music fits well. But if you like fast-paced real heart racing belly dance workouts, this one is not for you. I do not work up much of a sweat with this DVD and it is not fast at all, but I still find it fun and relaxing. It is just enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor instructional video","review":"I have been taking belly dance classes from a local professional once a week for over a year and thought that I would use this tape to fill in the rest of the days during the week. A number of the moves she does are beginner moves, but she never gives the proper name for the movements nor does she break it down for someone who is beginning. I was familiar with the moves so followed along easily enough. The worse part of the tape is the camera work! Horrible! The producers are so focused on using numerous camera angles that they miss a LOT of the movements that she is trying to teach. The editing is so bad and choppy that it significantly disrupts the flow of a movement. The \\"routine\\" is laughable. Not only was it jerky, poorly filmed, poorly edited, it didn't make any use of the music that we are supposedly dancing to. Nice costumes and sets, but save your money and find a tape that will actually teach you something about proper technique and give you a workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"While this isn't as fun as the Belly Queen DVD, it's much better if you're a beginner, not in shape, and really klutzy (like me) and she is very positive and talks about Goddess energy which can be very nice and soothing as well if you need to connect with female energy after working around males all day. I'm not very disciplined at exercising but I keep coming back to this one because it's fun and simple enough that I can do it, yet challenging enough in other areas that I know I have a long ways to go before I'll actually be able to move on to the next one in the series. Like the characters in Full Monty, I find myself trying to work out the moves in the oddest places. I do recommend this workout DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst bellydancing instructional DVD around.","review":"This is absolutely the worst instructional bellydancing DVD I have come across yet - and I've been through about 20. The beautiful costumes and sets cannot camouflage the fact this DVD is more about her ego and less about bellydancing. However, if you're looking for laughs, be sure and stop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I was excited at first. I started feeling the burn with the arm moves. Beautiful scenery & costumes. I quickly got fustrated trying to follow what she was doing for hip, leg & footing- kinda hard when the camera only likes her upper body. She would be in the middle of a move & the camera would zone in on her chest, face, move on her smile- she would be done with the move & onto another one. I kept rewinding with no futher luck.My opinion is that if your able to see her whole body doing the moves, it would be great for a beginner. I'm not wasting my money on her other videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Face Time","review":"This is the WORST belly dance workout video I have ever purchased to date. I have been belly dancing for almost two years and wanted to improve on basic movements and possibly learn a few new moves.If you decide to purchase this video, you will spend more time looking at dolphina's face and questioning what you should be focusing on. Also, if you do not have any knowlegde of this dance, you may experience some shoulder and neck pain as I did. Lastly, the video is very choppy. Dolphina focuses on several body parts then changes into a different outfit before giving new instructions. I found this to be very distracting.Don't waste your money. There are much better video's out there that focus on bellydancing and not the faces of the instructor or their outfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' bother","review":"This video is too concentrated on the instructor so basically, all camera angles are center towards her face. While she's trying to teach the hip movements, the camera is preoccupied on her face so you don't really know how you hip is suppose to go. This is an awful instructional video. Dont' bother paying for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the first-timer","review":"I got this DVD as a gift because it was part of the collection of videos which include more advanced work. Having danced for several years, I have to warn the beginner that this DVD is not going to teach you the right moves or give you the bellydancing workout that you crave.I was suprised to see that it was directed by a female because the video certainly spends the majority of the time highlighting Dophina's bellydancing physique and changing costumes rather than focusing on the actual moves and how to do them. So, in essence, this quickly became a Dolphina performance tribute rather than a lesson on bellydance techniqes.If you know what you're doing, it's a simple refresher - once you get past the glamorous Dolphina aspects.However, all in all, I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner or a learned bellydancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great form of exercise for the core muscles!","review":"Once you get past the camera guy being in Love with Dolphina, you can get some great instruction on Belly Dancing for fitness. It's amazing that you can get such a great body workout while working on your self esteem too. I found that after I was finished with the tape that I was inspired to dance more and the tape had taught me enough moves to freeform belly dance. Better than other belly dance instruction tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I guess the camera operator was a guy, because throughout the workout the camera is focused on her breasts leaving you clueless to what you're supposed to be doing. Your money would be better spent on another video. Although, it is good for a laugh because it's like having a playboy bunny talk to you about chakras and spirtual energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can't dance","review":"Dolphina is a not belly dancer.She is not flexible. Her technique is not good. Her upper and lower body can not perform most of the moves correctly especially the camel and snake arms. The camera focused mostly on her face. This is supposed to be an instructional video but there were too few body shots to display the technique.Dolphina has no business teaching belly dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO INSTRUCTION - NO BELLYDANCE","review":"The camera man is preoccupied with either her navel or her smile in this video. You have glimpses to the feet and leg work required to do the hip work. This could have been a great video had the camera man done his job. Instead, you have footage of unhelpful information throughout this video. It was like the camera could not get far enough in the space it where it was filmed. The best part of this video is the warmup which was professional (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really not that bad!","review":"If you're looking for an in-depth intructional video, this is not it. Nor is it a high-impact cardio workout. I'd say that it's more for muscular tone & endurance (my arms were BURNING by the time the warmup was over!), and it's also pretty relaxing. The camera work was pretty bad, but not quite as abysmal as it's been made out to be. When you can't see the appropriate body part, it's often during repetitions of a move she's already shown you - if you have any kind of dance experience at all, it shouldn't throw you *too* much.As I said, if you want detailed instruction in proper belly dance technique, this is not the video for you. If, however, you want something fun and different to add to your exercise repertoire, you just might enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffers from bad camera work","review":"The only real problem I had with this was that the camera work in certain places is positively awful, while in others it's quite silly. For most of the workout the camera is focused on her face and upper body even while the lower body is being worked. This is a particular problem in the \\"hips\\" section. It is possible to infer what you should be doing with your legs, but it's not always shown clearly. In other places, effects have been added which are unnecessary and actually made me laugh.You should also be prepared to hear a lot about The Goddess, since it is the goddess workout. Moves are often explained by the way they relate to the chakras or Dolphina refers to their healing powers.The sets are lovely to look at and the music is enjoyable. It is possible to get past the shoddy camera work and follow the video, but it's not always easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you learn to dance if you can't see the teacher?","review":"Most of the time the camera is focussed on Dolpina's face. Thismakes it impossible to see what her hips and feet are doing. Howcan you learn hip movements by looking at the teacher's eyes? You can't. Dolphina is also a poor dancer. She is usually off the rhythm of the music playing in the background and her technique is stiff. The cluttered backgrounds that she uses are distracting. I am an advanced dancer and I frequently couldn't understand what she was trying to demonstrate. One of my beginning students was completely lost. Save your money for a better video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"There are some positive points to this DVD, but the negatives far outweigh the positive.Negative: Camera work focuses on her face or her breasts or crotch area, not the body part where the particular movement she teaches is located.Negative: When the camera finally focuses on the correct area, her beautiful costumes get in the way of seeing the movement.Negative: She is way too fast in many of her movements and counts for the beginning bellydancer.Negative: The camera angle shows the movement from only one point of view, the front. It is almost impossible to tell where the weight distribution should be or how to do the movement properly from this perspective.Negative: She gives wrong directions at times for different movements. She does the movement correctly, but does not tell the viewer how to do the movement correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lightweight racquet","review":"I love my new Head titanium tennis racquet as it is so easy to handle.

It looks like a dragon (and I saw no evidence of it being a link between reptile and mammal). I laughed quite often during this flick. Especially enjoyable scenes include a traditionally dressed Danish family being attacked in their cottage, Peterson reacting to the dragon escaping, and the Pythonesque end credits. Watch out for Peterson operating the drawbridge.

I got into Rush about a year and a half ago. Sonce then, I've been a proud fan. This DVD is cool because a) they combine 2112, Xanadu and Working Man, to make what I call 21 Xanaman. b) they have all these funny little easter eggs and other stuff, like the Rush bobblehead super heroe thing. c)Cuz Neil still does those drum solos. The only con of thid DVD IS THEY DON'T DO FLY BY NIGHT! I love that song! i don't have on a CD either but fortuatly, i have itunes, so I bought from there. Problem solved. OK, overall, GET THIS DVD!

They are older and showing it. The perormance is lacluster at best and the audio quality is sadly lacking also.

I'd rather have one quality DVD without all the add ons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"There are so many songs missing from this set. The tour R30 had a total of 33 songs that were apparently played throughout the tour but for some reason that I can't understand Rush only decided to perform only 22 songs for there DVD release.

I was majorly disappointed when the DTS audio printed on the box was nowhere to be found on the DVD. The studio had to issue a correction stating that the DTS audio was not included because of the lack of space available to the DVD medium without affecting the video quality.This blu-ray release fixes this omission by including a DTS master audio track! WOO HOO! That was an unexpected surprise as the same DTS audio is found on the box... Not only do I see the band in high definition, I now can hear them in high definition too!My son can watch the drum solo (and the rest of the concert, of course) and hear the band in their full audio glory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Work, Integrity, and Excellence","review":"Rush proves that they can regroup with \\"Rush In Rio\\" and perform so well that they must continue for another tour. This is a band that cannot be compared to any other in the \\"reunion\\" category. After being apart for as long as they were, due largely to Neil Peart losing his wife and daughter, they restarted with back-to-back tours that are actually better than much of their earlier live material. \\"Rush In Rio\\" is notable for its crowd participation and the inclusion of old (but not forgotten) songs like \\"The Pass\\". \\"R30\\" is distinct due to its better audio fidelity (less crowd noise, better surround sound), a better video production, and a fresh approach to the old songs. The inclusion of extra vintage interviews and videos only tops it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"R30 Blu-ray and Region Coding","review":"For those wondering, this does play in a UK Blu-ray player.

I gave this DVD 5 Stars, but for some reason it came our four. FIVE stars is what is should have. Its worthy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Missing Songs","review":"This DVD/CD set is better quality than the Rush In Rio collection. The editing is slower paced and allows you to actually enjoy the musicianship on display. The sound quality is better, as well. The only problem with this set is that it is incomplete. Left off were such songs as Red Sector A, La Villa Strangiato, YYZ, and Bi-Tor & the Snow Dog. While the Rush In Rio set does not sound that great, it is the complete set list. Given that this is the 30th anniversary of Rush, every song they played should have been on there and there is no reason for the songs to have been left off. Otherwise, it is a good set and certainly worth getting. Hopefully, they'll release the Exit...Stage Left and Show of Hands videos on DVD, as these were great performances deserving of DVD treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Selection","review":"I love the song selection. Of course as with any die hard Rush fan, there are always songs that I wish were added to the set list. From what I saw online the boys only eliminated songs that were already released on Rush in Rio (RIR). I was expecting basically the same set list and thought it was too soon for a follow-up to RIR. I was expecting to be disappointed. There are 13 songs, including the Overture and Der trommler, that are not on RIR. I hope the sound has a little less crowd noise than RIR, even though those fans ROCK. Finally, you throw in the rarities! Rush never fails to amaze!Anatomy of a drum solo soon to follow. This should satisfy my need for new Rush material until the next studio album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at,, horrible sound","review":"I am a rabid, avid Rush fan but folks, give me a break: while it's really nice to look at and the video editing impressive, the sound quality (on audio CD)and musicianship of this concert was surprising disappointing to me.Too bad.I wish they'd hurry up and release the remaster of Vapor Trails already.~G~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost it","review":"After seeing Rush's live performance's during every decade, this is a very disappointing live performance. Geddy sound tired and flat, Alex is slow and Neil has lost his spontaneity. They are old men still riding the waves they generated when they had youth and creativity still flowing. But it's gone, they've lost it, and it sounds like it. For example, look at the old footage of Xanadu and Kings on this DVD and you will see what I am talking about. They sound and look burned out on this performance. The bell is tolling, they need to waltz accross the floor and close the bedroom door. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"If you love Rush as I do, spare yourself. I have to think the band must be at least a little embarassed by this product.

Here it is about to come and the only I do have no explanation for and I am pretty disappointed of, is that they left out 7 songs. I mean, what is the reason for that....????Anyway, the picture should be perect thinking of the equipment that was used, say some prayers that they don't spoil the soundmix as they did in Rio....But for all who were not among the probably 11.000 fans...it was a superb show and I can only recommend taking this \\"DVD-Chance\\" to -at least- watch it on screen!

In much the same vein as RIR, the band only recorded one show so left themselves with little breathing room. Frankly I dont care about a reproduced pick or backstage pass. Rush know that their fans are amongst the most rabid and overeager, so many of them wont see it for what it is. But if you can see past the free pieces of plastic, then you can choose to get the non deluxe edition.The major disappointment for the diehards (I include myself here) is the lack of unnique material.

I have to agree somewhat with the guy who complained about the concert set being trimmed down, but I say let's be happy with what we CAN have, as opposed to DON'T have. The remainder will easily serve as an excellent souvenir for one of the best shows I've ever seen. Buy it or don't, but this will hold me over until the next studio release, by which I'll have some vacation time, thereby allowing me to travel for a show if need be. One month and counting !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice overall, but alittle disapointed","review":"Just got this in and overall very nice product, but however the extra content really makes me wonder. The quality of the \\"74-Rock Concert\\" footage is REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE. It looks like a BAD bootleg vhs copy. I really wonder if they got the offical licensing rights from Don Kirschner to include it on the this dvd(my opinon I don't think so). Hell, my copy is better than whats on this dvd. All in all it does make a great addition to my Rush collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I had seen the video before and loved it so definetly wanted the CD's to play in my car. Awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better","review":"I bought this DVD awhile back and was a little disappointed - the concert was mostly very dark and you really could not see much. In addition Geddy Lee's voice is now in poor shape, his vocals are nowhere near the qaulity of the original recordings on the albums. However there is alot of material here aside from the conceet to dwell on, for a true Rush fan this set is a must, but don't overexpect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slowly but surely","review":"Another great DVD from Rush, but it doesnt always seem that way. The Live in Rio DVD sounded great, but why didnt they release the show from Different stages instead. To me, that sounded much better and you had much less crowd noise interfering with the music. Also, why can't they release \\"Through th Camera Eye\\" and \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" DVD's as well? It seems Rush gives us things only in segments. Anyway, I will always be Rush fan and of course I did purchase R30 mainly for the vintage cuts on the bonus DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush just keeps on truckin' even though the albums are getting worse","review":"I love Rush. They are probably tied with Dream Theater for my favorite band of all time. Ever since Roll The Bones came out, they haven't released an album that impressed me. I think that the live performance DVD's they are putting out are making up for the lack of good new material. This is a great concert. It's probably a toss up between this one and Rush in Rio. The content is nearly the same, except for the newer songs which don't really matter. I loved this DVD and I think that any Rush fan will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush is such a great live band!!","review":"Let me start by saying that the best way to learn Rush is through their live albums. This is no exception. The quality of the performance is second to none. Excellent production (better than the Rio disc). It's all up which album has a set list you prefer - I personally would go for Rush in Rio first, then Different Stages, and Exit Stage Left before this particular disc. That being said, there is a place for this disc in any Rush afficionado's catalog..."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Years of Rush!","review":"I saw Rush in Irvine, CA on this tour and it was amazing. They can still make a place rock! They gave their fans something new with the R30 Medley to introduce the show, and I think that is my favorite part of the show. They wanted to remember and express their roots and give their life-long fans a show they would remember for years to come. They pulled it off. Neil Peart continues to just get better with age and his solo \\"Der Trommler\\" is fascinating, no matter how many times you see it. Don't miss this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"musicianship, nostalgia, celebration, excellence","review":"hats off to Rush and the production team responsible for this dvd. excellent camerawork, sound, and editing abound. i was lucky enough to see the 30th tour at 5 american venues and the dvd captures the show quite nicely. the bonus dvd interviews were particularly interesting and show how appreciative the band has been of its fans throughout its career. most of items on the second dvd have never been seen by this long-time fan and are well-presented. congratulations to the band for their longevity and individuality. this collection is an incredible keepsake from their world tour, as well as a great introduction/career capsule of the band for new fans. most importantly, may rush continue to be the vital contemporary musical force they are. many of us are looking very forward to their next album! hope you are too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but very uncomfortable","review":"The product look fantastic, but after trying it out I was more sore then ever.

It was very apparent that what most Christians consider being Christ-like and a servant to mankind is off the mark. Gayle Erwin will point you in the right direction without any vacillating at all. There are several occasions where Mr. Erwin is critical of even himself and how he has behaved in his walk with God.If you consider yourself a Christian, other than the Bible, this is one of the most important books you will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenge to apply the Bible to you life","review":"It's easy to read and even consent to something but when you are challenged to apply it to your life, that's where many may stop. Yes, I agree that Jesus came as a servant, but if we are truly to live the life of a Christian, are we then willing to live as Jesus did? I feel I have too often not wanted to be that person, but we are commanded to (teach to obey all I have commanded you). To be willing to live as Jesus would look something like this: I hang out with the \\"loser\\" crown (sinners and tax collectors), I have no home, I don't seek anything for my self, but only for the glory of the Father... Though at this time I have not completed the book, from what I've read I really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and enchanting... the violin as you've never heard i","review":"I first heard this artist playing on the street of Oxford, England while I was a student.

When I found it on Amazon recently, I was very curious to see if it held up to my memory of its impact. Long story short, it did and does. One thing however: During the years when I would recollect this film, I always thought of it as having been a David Mamet project since when I initially saw it i didn't see the credits. Upon re-viewing it, I can see why I assumed it was a Mamet film because it had a certain Mametesque dark humor and very un-dramatic depictions of violence, but Saul Rubinek should not be accused of mimicry - he has infused it with a distinct originality and character developement so that it does stand on it's own, even with repeated viewings. I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not really a point","review":"The movie was sort of interesting, but it didn't seem to have a point.

My sister and I used to love that show, so we thought it would be a great idea to buy it on DVD, so we bought this product, thinking that we were ordering our favorite childhood show. Unfortunately, what we received was a compilation of several horror movies that we'd never heard of all converging under the title \\"Afraid of the Dark.\\" While we were able to return it, we still lost the cost of shipping as well as our hopes of having the TV show on DVD.

The murders revolve around the Shakespeare motif, and the \\"Pound of Flesh\\" murder is suspiciously used again in the movie \\"Seven\\", as is the \\"stuff the fat guy with food until he bursts\\" murder. (Think the writer of Seven saw Theater of Blood and the Dr. Phibes movies...?)Diana Rigg is great as Price's daughter, and the spectacle of the Great Vincent Price as an effeminate hairdressr is worth the price of admission alone. Theater of Blood is a true classic.

Price had a glorious time with this movie. Like in his Phibes movies his audience is kept cheering for him all the way. The bad guys (critics) are gruesomely slain one by one in highly creative ways. If you are a Shakspeare fan as am I, you should enjoy the carnage even more. My personal favorite scene is the woman getting electrocuted while getting her hair done. Unfortunately the movie is flawed by an ending much inferior to the Phibes movies. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"More HAMMY than a butcher shop","review":"It's great, I love this movie!

They soon discover that the acid burns and viscous black fluid found on the victims bodies have been left behind by an alien life-form that must breed with human women! BREEDERS follows four basic steps: woman talks about her virginity, woman gets raped, police are baffled, repeat. The mindless dialog is only made worse by the stifled performances from each of the talentless cast members. We haven't seen this much bad rubber monster rape since HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP!

I don't like these overpriced bibs beacuse they fall off every time you put your baby in or take your baby out of the carrier.

I tried sticking a burp cloth there but it wasn't really helping, slipping out of place, falling, and still getting the carrier wet. We bought these and are quite happy to say we stopped washing the carrier after every outing. ;-pThey have:a water-proof barrier,are easy to pop on,stay in place,look good,and yet still seem tasty enough to gum and suck on.We are very happy and will buy another set of 2 for vacationing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Your Carrier!","review":"What a wonderful product!

I guess alot of kids do and that's why baby bjorn made this bib and decided to charge $8 a piece for a terry cloth. Their marketing team must be pretty smart since they figured out there will be parents willing to spend that money to decorate their baby carrier...So it's a thin piece of terry cloth, just as thin as the cheapest burp cloths you can buy in bulk. The reason we bought these is because we're doting first time parents who spend money on the top of the line baby items (orbit baby, etc...)and as a dad who is wrapped around the pinky of my daughter I thought a pink bib would be cute. We also bought the bibs since she sucks on the bjorn and we did try putting a burp rag between her and the bjorn, only to have it fall out. Well, I lost one of the bjorn bibs in a parking lot, it fell off when i removed the bjorn. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"It's a good product and fits very well with the Original, the Air and the Active-Sport carriers.

But with a baby that loves to suck on the red (and fading fast) bib, I thought this would be a great purchase. Not so. Its fit is less than perfect. It's thinner than paper, and it constantly falls off - EVERY TIME you take the baby in/out.Really, I could have just lived with the fading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjorn bibs are ok...","review":"I was hoping that these would be thicker. They're super thin.....much thinner than a cheap hotel washcloth.

I almost hit Christina in the face with a pool stick once. It was first going to be called \\"Claudine's Return\\" but they changed it. I wish someone had told me. I had to find out several years later from a friend of mine who found it on the internet. I thought that the movie had been scrapped or something. When I finally watched it, it bored me so much I had to fast-foward it to the scene that we were in. My friend did the same thing. Christina did a great job acting though.

And the quality of Strand's work certainly deserved this kind of high quality printing.

Long before the end of the film, you wish someone would defenestrate Ivy and set the /audience/ free.The '70s color cinematography is dreadful, with bright, generally flat lighting that rarely makes any attempt to set a mood or express emotion.Wise was pretty much an uninspired \\"hack\\" director. When the script and actors were good, he usually delivered a good film. When not, he contributed nothing of his own to fix the problems, or enhance the better elements of the material.

Sir Anthony Hopkins , Marsha Mason and John Beck also star in this bittersweet and horrifying film based on Frank De Felita's best-selling novel.Watch this one with the lights out.If you're skeptical about reincarnation it might just make a believer out of you yet.If you like this one I also recommend \\"The Changeling\\" (1979) staring George C.

As such, I looked forward to reading The Microsoft File with almost obscene glee.What a disappointment! This book is so poorly organized and so badly written that I barely got through it at all. The author fails to explain critically important events and concepts in depth, yet wastes pages and my patience on minor and insignificant details. Worse yet, she places no particular emphasis on either, so attempting to separate the meat from the bone is nigh impossible. The strongest impression the book left me with is that it was written under an all too short deadline. The story suffers from a lack of organization and structure; as a result I'm still waiting for the definitive anti-Microsoft book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Facts, Ackward Story","review":"Overall, the book contains what appear to be well investigated facts and plausible conclusions. However, from page one, the book starts to read like some dime store spy novel. Fortunately, it sheds that drama, but it still remains ackward by jumping around chronologically.If you can get around the attempt at high drama (rarely do \\"behind the company curtain\\" stories make great high drama for those who were not involved), you will certainly find out some interesting facts and understand how Microsoft executives have been able to delude themselves into believing they are not doing anything wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well researched and informative","review":"Much of what this book contains one already suspects, but to see it all in print and supported by references gives one hope that all is not lost, and that one day we can move beyond Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of shrill, ill-informed drivel","review":"It's hard to imagine an author could take a subject as interesting as the Gate's emprire and reduce it to such shrill, trivial drivel. Books like these only contribute to the notion that critics of Microsoft are just a bunch of wacky, paranoid malcontents. The subject demands the attention of more serious writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak. There are better Gates books available.","review":"I found the writing to be choppy, and some of the ideas presented to be a bit of a stretch: For example: The author attempts to make us believe the Bill Gates is 90's equivalent of John D. Rockefeller. On the surface there are many similarities, but where the comparison falls apart is that people truly need oil, they don't need software. I, as a user of a personal computer can happily run WordPerfect on DOS 5.0 for as long as I want. The same can't be said for the oil to heat my house or run my car. Oil eventually runs out.I think there are better books about Gates, if you're interested, I liked Mane's \\"Gates : How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry-And Made Himself the Richest Man in America\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The book now sits in the trash","review":"It's not very often that I read a chapter or two of a book and get so iratated that I throw it in the trash. Ms Rohm's book is full of cliches, at least as far into the book as I coudld force myself to read, and the narative is disjointed, like driving over speed bumps. There's been alot of inside gossip in the newspapers about how Microsoft fights dirty. What's needed is a story, which Ms Rohm obviously can't tell. Don't waste your money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too tabloidish for my taste.","review":"I bought this book hoping to find the real \\"case against Bill Gates\\", or more specifically against Microsoft. Goodness knows he and his cronies made plenty of secret business deals that, exposed to the light of day, would really damage the company. A book detailing (and, more importantly, documenting) all these things I've been trying to tell people for years would at the least make me seem less of a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist among my peers.But, unfortunately, this book seems to concentrate mainly on what kind of a person Bill Gates is, including a truly baffling amount of coverage of Bill's courting of some woman who worked for Microsoft. I don't care about that [stuff]; I want to see the LEGAL case against him, not things that belong in the gossip column.Thus disillusioned, I never finished the book, so for all I know it may contain what I hoped to find, but if so, it's not in the first half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A torture to read","review":"Awful, awful, awful. This book is truly awful. How this dreck gets published, I'll never understand. Wendy Goldman Rohm manages to reduce the interesting and complex saga of Microsoft and Bill Gates into a lurid, third-rate soap opera. The writing is out and out laughable at times, especially when the author delves into the main characters' heads to tell us what they are thinking. You'll have to look elsewhere to find the real story of Microsoft's rise to the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I couldn't get past the first four pages -- I wanted factual reportings, not some drivel from a would-be novelist. The book is written from a first-person perspective of the characters involved -- Bill Gates, folks at the Justice Dept., Microsoft Lawyers, etc. In trying to capture their states of mind, and then writing as if she were those people, she's stepped outside the bounds of journalism and into TV-movie scriptwriting. I tried twice to read this book, then I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched, poorly written","review":"I approached this book expecting to get a good overview of the case against Microsoft. Instead, the author spends the vast majority of the book spewing out allegations using adjectives that can hardly hide her personal opinions and which she rarely backs up with facts. There are so many obvious opportunities where a little additional research could have provided a more damning case that by page 100 my mind was screaming for me to simply throw the book away.But I did, unfortunately, finish the book. It didn't get better. An example of a quick-to-market book focusing on breathless speculation rather than fact. Don't waste your money or your time if you're doing your own research on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing job on an interesting topic","review":"I whole-heartedly agree with:* elsie@cshore.com from Connecticut, USA , October 11, 1998 who said: Terrible rendering of a great story* A reader from SF Bay Area , October 11, 1998 who said: Editor Asleep at the Wheel on this one.* And ghill@hal-pc.org from Bellaire, Texas , October 16, 1998 who said: The book now sits in the trashThose three reviews voice my opinion.

And so it goes. The normal and the commonplace are hyped to seem like the secret and the mysterious. I learned nothing from this book. Unlike Pam Edstrom's book, \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" which has some real \\"insider\\" insights, this is a pretentious, boring book that rehashes well-documented old stories about Microsoft and its competitors(a huge amount of space is devoted to how Lotus was sold to IBM, for example). What has not been told before was simply made up. A titillating title, but \\"where's the beef?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for readers from 16 to 76","review":"The Portly Princess Of Thynneland by Wisconsin native Kathleen Marie Marsh is a kind of adult fairytale that utilizes a fantasy story to convey very real issues arising from childhood obesity. Superbly enhanced with illustrations by Tom Lowes, The Portly Princess Of Thynneland is set in the kingdom of Thynneland where, in a misguided plan to win his little daughter's affection, King Rollo lavishes sweets and treats upon Princess Volumina. Queen Reeda is dismayed to see her daughter grow up to be a fat girl in a land where it is illegal to be an overweight adult! On her 18th birthday, Princess Volumina is sent to the Hinterland to lose weight. Her journey (and stormy relationship with her bodyguard Favo) are the stuff of adventure and romance. Then when famine threatens Thynneland, Princess Volumina is the only one who can save the realm. The Portly Princess Of Thynneland is witty, fun, and highly recommended reading and recommended for readers from 16 to 76."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nasty guitar swinging","review":"Bill Jennings played with the great Louis Jordan in the late 40sand early 50s, and took some time off to record 5 tracks featured on this CD. This is raw, swing guitar, bordering on R&B;, setting the table for the rock & roll explosion. Jennings gets a hard distorted tone from his hollow-body axe, with just a sax, piano, string bass and drums backing him. Crucial sounds for those who love Charlie Christian at his wildest and T-Bone Walker and that whole school of swing/jump blues guitar playing. The rest of the CD features some great Tiny Grimes sides. Fine stuff at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"only bad purchase from amazon","review":"This is something my husband has asked for because of his outside job always made his coffee get cold to quick.

The final scenes never fail to bring me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important critical anthology","review":"This was one of the first anthologies of critical essays to center on American- Jewish Literature. One of the essays entitled 'Breakthrough' spoke about the new place in American literature Bellow, Roth, Malamud et al. were making at the time. What is interesting is that thirty years afterwards American Jewish Literature is still alive, and that many new voices have emerged who have a more positive relation to their Jewish heritage, than most of those in the fifties- sixties generations did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly fantastic","review":"Before I ever played RR Tycoon, my idea of its replay value/interest to me was pretty bleak. A game where you run a train company and just watch little digitized trains go to and fro? And on top of that you have to manage your stocks and bonds? Yuck! But after playing a demo of the game, I was hooked and had to buy the full version. It's one of the most engrossing strategy titles you'll play, StarCraft, WarCraft, Myth aside. Those games are all very fulfilling, but RR Tycoon holds its own against them when it comes to the gaming hours I spend each week.

As usual, she writes the words and music to almost all of the songs on this CD, with the exception of \\"I Stand In Awe\\". Although she didn't write this song, she makes it uniquely her own as she does with everything she sings. Her soaring vocals have the ability to soothe, yet uplift at the same time. If you are looking for an artist who creates Christian music and lyrics which are understandable and inspiring to the listener, Annie Herring would be a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"I woudn't recommend this product.","review":"After using these hex sockets on a impact the roll pins that hold them in snapped off. The hex bit is not a press fit into the socket like most other brands. I traded them off for a different set and am glad I did. S-K ususally has pretty good tools, and I would recommend their combination wrenches to anyone. However, this product simply has a poor design and isn't worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are a fine choice.","review":"There is nothing wrong w/ these SK bits. They are strong and have lasted me a long time. I use metric hex regularly at work and usually go to the SK's or Stahlwilles. If you misuse ANY tool, it will break... Do not put these in an impact driver, they are not designed to be used with power/impact tools. The sockets are designed to replace the bits when the bit breaks or wears out, new bits can be purchased form a multitude of SK dealers/retailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording, even worse filming","review":"This video was originally recorded in 1987 and was not very well done. There are only three cameras: one on von Karajan conducting from the harpsichord, one on some string players, and one on A. S. Mutter. The one on Mutter is too close so that for the entire concert, you never see her right hand. You see the violin, and this disembodied bow playing. The camera angles never change, so when other instruments are playing, you aren't shown them (as they're shown in most every documentary of orchestras). The bravura directing of von Karajan is mostly absent, as he's playing the harpsichord, and he seems capable only of waving time here and there rather than truly directing the group. Finally, the sound is poorly balanced: There are solo sequences in which Mutter is very difficult to hear.Finally, I should add that the video is low-res and narrow screen. Overall, a very disappointing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finely balanced in every way","review":"I have to disagree with the review who said that too much attention is focused or von Karajan himself. This would bother me quite a bit if it were true, but I don't think it is. Instead, everything about this production strikes me as finely balanced. It shouldn't be forgotten that in this performance, von Karajan is playing the harpsichord, so there is really some logic in focusing on him to some degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantitative Evaluation","review":"Audio Merits:7/10; Video Merits:8/10; Musical Merits:9/10; Artistic Performance:10/10; DVD Extras:7/10; Recording Total Quality:8/10.

Its oversimplified style makes this book accessible to most any reader, yet sacrifices accuracy for the sake of attracting the pop psychology/pseudoscience crowd. Hamer and Copelands biggest mistake is to underplay the roles of multiple genes in affecting behavior, and instead give a kindergarten level account of \\"one gene, one behavior\\" that is flat out incorrect and hugely disappointing. Added on top of the scientific oversimplification/inaccuracy is a writing style that is insulting to the intelligence of many readers, and flat out insulting in some of its sexist, racist, and lewd commentary. My suggestion is to avoid this book, but if you're reading it without a solid scientific background, PLEASE take this with a grain of salt and use it as a stepping stone to get to works that don't sacrifice truth for readability."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading yet entertaining pop culture book.","review":"The main problem with this book is that it fails to introduce any new information regarding the so caled \\"nature-nurture\\" debate.

This is a page right out of Blue Notes classic history book. McGriff fronts a classic blues band setup with a perfectly balanced brass section and a swinging rhythm section. Smartly McGriff employed the help of legendary drummers Grady Tate and Mel Lewis who take turns laying down the foundation for some rocking funk grooves and then was able to show case the beautiful talents of Blue Note great Blue Mitchell on trumpet.

It doesn't tell you how to feed the child in a manner that is anthropologially correct. There is a chapter in Dr. Sears' \\"The baby book\\" on how to bottle feed a baby safely. Granted, he prefers breastfeeding, but he has TONS of information for those who (for ANY reason) choose to bottle feed. And he states, over and over, do what is right for YOU.

She assumes that those successful women are all anti bottle feedding zealots. It is not fair to judge people by the way they feed their child. Nobody can know their true feelings. I think that the authors obvious anger makes her book very biased and so it does not give out good information.

(My older son was both breast and bottle fed.) This book however does NOT focus on bottlefeeding without guilt, but rather it focuses on discrediting breastfeeding and mud-slinging towards breastfeeding mothers. The author seems to have a HUGE chip on her shoulder against all breastfeeding mothers and uses the topic of bottlefeeding as her own personal vindetta against breastfeeding. If someone chooses to formula feed, I do hope that it will be an informed decision because of their own personal feelings and not because of the misinformation that this author chooses to perpetuate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thinly veiled attack on breastfeeding advocates.","review":"Bottlefeeding Without Guilt was of special interest to mebecause I have one child (adopted) who was bottlefed, and two I havebreastfed.

All her husband wanted was an annulment so he would be able remarry with good standing in the church. Was that too much to ask?

Did she accomplish anything by writing this book? Maybe to those women whose husbands have treated them wrong, and whose annulment wasn't necessary in the first place, but she only caused more ruckus amid her family, and probably with those who truly care about her. This book should have never been written, and the annulment should have never been objected to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vindicated?","review":"In a 1997 Amazon review of this book, canon lawyer Edward Peters called attention to a review he published in an October 1997 issue of the National Catholic Register: \\"I am convinced that the Church's canonical system for assessing marriages is theologically sound, juridically coherent, and pastorally effective. It deserves better than it received in Kennedy's book.\\"I cannot speak/write the language of a canon lawyer. Yet, 12 years later, it is well worth noting that the Roman Rota apparently agreed with Sheila Rauch-Kennedy, with regard to the declaration of nullity (of her marriage to Joseph Kennedy III), being itself invalid!Since first reading Rauch-Kennedy's book, I have become an avid follower of JP II's & Benedict XVI's annual addresses to the Roman Rota. Again I am no canon lawyer. However, it certainly appears that the Holy Fathers have had serious concerns about the operations of tribunals in the past few decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased look at Annulment","review":"As the daughter of an annuled marriage, I would find this book to be laughable in its manipulation of facts if it didn't concern a subject this serious. This book is just another example of how Catholicism is willfully misunderstood in culture today. The author stresses the fact that she is fighting the annulment primarily for the sake of her children. Having experienced annulment from a child's perspective, it is obvious that absolutely none of her concerns for her sons are valid, leaving the reader to wonder about her motives for writing this spiteful book. An annulment is not an indulgence, nor is it something that exists to raise money for the Church (my mother paid only $30 for hers); it exists to minister to those in need. The Church cannot and must not be held accountable for those who may misuse it. And from the glimpses into the personality of the author, it does not appear that even a Kennedy is abusing the annulment in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very accurate account of annulment proceedings in the US","review":"I am a Roman Catholic. My parents went through the annulment 'process' a year ago and based on personal experience - Mrs. Kennedy's book is, sadly, quite accurate. In an attempt to cater to the spirit of religious liberalism entrenched in american society, the church here no longer defends its own sacraments or the truth at all. But rather cheapens them with easy annulments. My parents paid their $600 or whatever, and poof, they were never married. To Catholics who really don't care about their religion, the annulment is just a piece of paper. But to Catholics who really believe, it is quite devastating. In my particular case, it has literally torn my family apart. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to gain a first hand insight into the absolute absurdity the US catholic church has sunk to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and cheap printer for home use","review":"I have not had any major issues with this printer after two months.

I will not upgrade again solely becuase of the popup approach (from an antivirus company!).Never has caught anything dangerous on my machines. Waste of money.I bought the 3 machine package last year.

After many hours of trying to upgrade from 2006 to 2007, including using all those specialized uninstall/install tools from the Norton website, I never did get NAV 2007 to install correctly (Windows XP with SP2). On top of that, those Norton uninstall tools corrupted the start-up process which launches many background tasks during reboot (such as automatic backups, Hotsync manager for Palm, etc.). I haven't yet figured out how to fix that problem, so I have to manually start them on each reboot. What a pain! No decent product should put the user through these problems!I did not try using live support, but that approach seemed hopeless after reading other reviews at Amazon and elsewhere. Something is definitely very wrong at Norton: Bad Quality Assurance. Bad support.

It blocks VPN traffic and no amount of working with any of Symantec support could resolve it. They blamed it on everything under the sun. This software is broken for sure. VPN traffic is blocked by the firewall and when you turn the firewall off VPN connections work perfectly. This has to work because an awful lot of telecommuters use VPN to connect into their offices. There are methods to configure this but Symantec support could not configure it in a way that works. I did the chat routine and paid support (which I refused to pay). I have removed it and will never use it again. There are products out there that actually work. Given the problems, I have to question the overall product quality.

Major problems include:1) It's a *hugh* resource hog. My computer was pretty much worthless for at least a minute after login due to NAV's virus scanning.2) Buggy. I had different problems with it on two different installs. One time, Windows had to keep killing off some \\"missing virus definition\\" process after logout. This happened even after doing Live Update. On another install, I had problems right clicking on any file or folder without NAV hanging.3) Difficult to use.

Seems like it should only full-scan when I request, e.g. 2 am, and otherwise just monitor ports, e-mail etc. Plus the startup at login is ridiculously slow - be prepared to be crippled for the first couple of minutes after you login.

Vasseur's voice speaks eloquently of the New South and the Mississippi Delta area. His world travels and non-academic life and work experiences give him an insight that couples well with his erudition. Vasseur writes each character with a parental attitude that he loves them in spite of their flaws and that he loves them because of their virtues. He can mine those virtues well. Each story is compelling in its' own way and each story tells us a little moral tale which compels the reader to look inward. I found myself rereading sevgeral stories before I went on to the next. This author writes with an optimism about daily life; that is refreshing to me. There is no air of ennui in these stories.

Yes, the Christians in the Western part of USA (that is, west of the Rockies) were one in the Spirit and one in the Lord, and I definitely recommend this 2-record set to anybody who is interested in contemporary Christian music during its heyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Sounds Good After So Many Years","review":"When I was 15 (back in 1985), I had the good fortune to start working at the local radio station in my hometown of Andrews, TX. I worked weekends and on Sunday morning, I got to play Christian Music. My job was to play records from 6am until 10am then air the church services of the two largest churches in town. I really didn't know anything about Christian Pop/Rock music at that time, so I was playing about 2 or 3 records that I liked by Dallas Holm and Amy Grant over and over again. After a couple of weeks, this guy walked into the station with a huge stack of records and \\"How the West Was One\\" was among them. I had never heard of Phil Keaggy, but he was one of my favorite artists from the moment I played this record. He is even better live than he is on his studio albums, that is what makes this recording so special. 2nd Chapter of Acts is Great live too. Matthew Ward has probably the most amazing voice of any male vocalist I have ever heard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To much of the original full movie is missing on this DVD","review":"I viewed this movie on Cinamax when it was free with your cable account when cable first came, it seems to me after purchasing this DVD a lot has been cut from this DVD, the main story remains but there are missing scenes, likely lost scenes from degression sitting collecting dust in heat of summer or cold of winter, where ever it was stored, what does remain is very much worth a viewing, it is spiritual though not religious..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little hokey","review":"Almost a sub \\"B\\" movie. If I didn't like scifi so much, I would probably give it a one star. It's difficult to try to judge a movie on the character based on the time and electronic wizardary available when the movie was made. The acting is stilted and a little stale. If you think of this movie as a re-enactment of supposed events, it's tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story ruined by a crappy movie","review":"A good history legend made crappy by overzealous hollywood writers. As is typical of most movies from the mid eighties era. The writing is crappy, the actors could just barely pull it off. And who cares about a lil kid with progeria. Id rather have a real life midget in makeup play the alien than the kid with no acting experiance. This all seems like a Make-A-Wish foundation event gone horribly wrong.

The special effects are no longer special, the acting bad, the dialogue corny, and the action scenes terrible. For a good Tobe Hooper film, check out Salem's Lot instead. For real sci-fi/horror, check John Carpenter's The Thing instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres no place on earth to hide!","review":"From this terrible dvd that is! IF you don't mind the terrible acting and story, this could be a fairly enjoyable film. The only positive thing to say about this film is the special effects are pretty good for its time. Other than that, it is very bad. Unless you really like B-movies, steer clear, it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This is terribly awful. I didn't like the original, and this was about 20 times worse. It contained senseless cursing from a \\"all american family\\" and a terrible child actor to saying it. It's like they took the corniness of the first and thought, \\"Hey, this needs to be even MORE cornier!\\". The special effects were better, but not good, even for the 80's. I did appreciate how they gave the big brain thingy more of a part, because I felt in the first one, he wasn't around enough. Yeah, there's no reason you should ever watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invader","review":"This movie is one of the ultimate classics for early semi-comical horror sci-fi hits.

Bud Cort and Louise Fletcher. This one is far-fetched too, but it might make you like the original instead. The boy is played by Karen Black's real son, Hunter Carson.The boy from the original 1953 film, Jimmy Hunt, plays a Police Chief in this one. He is the one on the right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremelyl awful","review":"I've never really liked Tobe Hooper. His Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist struck me as quite overrated (especially the latter). As a matter of fact, my favorite film of his is Lifeforce (which is not a great film by any means), probably due mostly to the presence of Mathilda May.Anyway, Invaders from Mars came out after Lifeforce and it's nowhere as entertaining, tense, or fun as that sci-fi flick was. Instead, Invaders was just dull and stupid. The solutions for fighting the aliens is nothing creative, just straightforward shootings, and the cast is full of terrible actors. And I thought TCM and Poltergeist were pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disaster!","review":"Invaders from Mars is probably the worst b movie I have ever seen. I used to think this film was a little cool but jeez I was 8 years old when I first watched this. I caught this sci-fi turkey on t.v. awhile back and this movie is garbage from start to finish. The peformances are even worse, I recommend you don't see this film, you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"eerie B- movie that scared the crap out of kids in the 80's!","review":"First of all Tobe Hooper gets a PG rating again! That's scarier than The Chainsaw Massacre! I was a beginning horror fan and 11 years old when this little film came on cable, before my mom got rid of it! This scared the crap out of me! A very young boy is watching his family and teacher get possessed by aliens, with little help. This is silly now but at the time really creepy. First of all this was a not a PG movie or an R but at least PG-13! The movie involves a child and is aimed was aimed at the wrong audience at the time. That's because Tobe, who I'm a fan of is not right for this kids horror type of movie without Spielberg involved. Watching it now its just an OK B movie and somewhat entertaining. As a kid I turned it off. I've seen thousands of Horror movies since and eventually,\\"The Exorcist\\" beat this one out! Anyway that's why this one didn't go over big. Tobe realized he needed to stick with the older kids later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listener beware: this product is NOT what you think!!!!!!","review":"Although incorrectly indicated on Amazon's titling, this CD does NOT contain music by various artists! These songs have been re-recorded by one band, and they are NOT the original artists for any of these songs. This is the equivalent to listening to a wedding band perform renditions of these songs. If you are seeking the original recordings for any of the great songs on this CD, you had best look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Ugly Martian Runs Amok on Space Ship!","review":"Do you ever yearn for the days when the Million Dollar Movie would scare the bejesses out of you? Well, turn down the lights, get your popcorn and Bosco, and watch this classic from the 50s.A rescue mission to Mars is bringing back the sole survivor to stand trial for killing his commrades in order to survive. Unfortunately, they bring something else back too - one big ugly nasty creature intent on sucking every drop of moisture out of the unsuspecting crew. As the plot unfolds, they try everything to kill this thing off, but to no avail. A thrilling climax tops it all off.This film is pure 1950s, and [many suggest] was the model for the film, Alien, because of the many similarities (including the infamous \\"C\\" deck and air duct fiasco). Although dated, it's great fun - a must see for all affectionados!Bax"},{"rating":"2","title":"B Movies","review":"Loved this movie when I was a kid and was surprised to find it on Cd. It is good quailty movie with good actors for their day. Very surprising to my friends that this movie was an inspiration to the Alien movies...........Check it out good old B movie laughs at early monster makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shocker","review":"As a comedy I would give this 4 stars. As an attempt at science fiction I feel I am generous giving it 2 stars. Bad acting, bad sets, bad costumes,bad directing. I know the film was made in the 50's but so were other great films like, \\"Quatermass Experiment\\", \\"It came from outer space\\", \\"The day the earth stood still\\", \\"Them\\" etc. Give this movie a miss if you like 50's and 60's Sci-fi movies and go for the ones mentioned above. If you want a laugh then buy this as purely comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old classic alien horror","review":"This movie is only 69 min long but you won't be disappointed at all. It remained me so much of \\"Alien\\". The story is quite the same. The crew of a spaceship accidently have an unwelcome alien guest that kills several people and the crew tries to get rid of the monster. \\"It ! The terror from beyond space\\" has a special atmosphere because it was made in black & white. If you like classic b/w sci-fi this is absolutely the movie for you !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but missing scene not included","review":"Years ago when I was a lad, the Detroit TV show \\"Sir Graves Ghastly\\" accidentally showed the missing scene, which was five guys racing through the desert in a jeep dust clouds all around them. They shoot wildly at the dust clouds as one after another they disappear pulled out of the moving jeep. Sadly this scene is NOT included in this print or the special features... I am very glad to have seen it. However this still is an excellent atomic age sci-fi gem on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I hate to disagree with the majority here but I was disappointed with this one. It relied too much on the guy in the monster suit rather than trying to build mystery and suspense, which is so important to a low budget sci fi like this one. I found the acting to be sub-par, even for a 50's sci fi. Definatley obvious that this film inspired the now famous Alien, though. If you're looking to build a 50's sci fi section in your video library it would be wise to start with the other 'It' movie, It Came From Outer Space. This one also had a low budget but the acting and suspense make it far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frantic and Fun","review":"This movie isnt one of my favorites as the 50's technology didnt allow for much realism in the shots of space ships (although some were done better than others). However the action inside the ship was fast paced and pretty intense. The monster wasnt to bad although a bit awkward at times and the charecters were well acted. As for dvd quality this movie played quite clean and crisp."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sandpaper","review":"This Mirka sandpaper is the best I have used, and I have been a craftsman for many, many years using a lot of different hook and loop sandpaper, from other companies.

Sort of thought maybe the band should've changed their name to Amon Duul II Revisited. This isn't the SAME Amon Duul II that was on the lp masterpeices, like 'Phallus Dei', 'Yeti' and 'Tanz Der Lemmings'. It's a so-so progressive effort, at best. The playing is decent, but the writing and song arrangements simply didn't do much for me. I still plan to hang onto my copy, just the same. The better tracks would be \\"Flower Of The Orient\\" (believe they still might play this tune in their reunion sets these days), the instrumental \\"Crystal Hexagram\\" and \\"Telly Vision\\". Pretty much for AD II completists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Works Fantastic!","review":"I would definitely recommend these cables, just make sure that your TV actually has an S-cable connection (as I tried initially on a Samsung Plasma HDTV but found that the tv did not have an S video connection, but instead only component connections. Just remember there are ports that LOOK LIKE S-video connections but may say something like \\"3D\\" or whatever, but just ensure that the connection actually says \\"S-video\\"over it. Anyway, pay no attention to the reviews that state that these cables feel cheap and flimsy, they don't in the least. They feel just as solid as any other cables you would buy, and for the great price, it's really a no-brainer. These cables DO improve the look of Gamecube games, things will look overall sharper and colors a bit more refined.

Read it outside of its autobiographical context, as the set up to an indeterminate future for young narrator John, already unable to risk failure, and it's heartbreaking.Read it as the runway from which Coetzee later takes flight, however, and it's pure inspiration. So often in life, especially later in life, we're expected to accept what we have become. This book quite brilliantly details the agony of falling short and accepting. And the later success achieved by its author is a reminder that though such acceptance might be self-defining, it isn't necessarily self-directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This is the kind of book that stays with a reader long after the final page. Coetzee once again delivers a kind of realism through words that few can achieve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy","review":"Very beautiful written. But don't expect an easy-listening afternoon. This book is black. Very black. A very depressing athmosphere but interesting to the reader. It gives you the chance to look back yourself and see what you reached so far in life. And are you better off than John, who is in fact Coetzee himself? You look trough the eyes of a young man who has thrown himself into the big world while in fact he is not ready. Coetzee reveals his youth in London and wich kind of person he was.

Over the long haul, counters are as likely to lose as Mister Rogers is to be caught in a Watts cocaine bust. Mesquite, Nevada, is growing faster than Warren Buffett's bank account.

The paper covering, similar to wax paper, was stuck to the candy and impossible to completely remove, so that you were spitting out pieces of wax paper with each chew.Placing a piece in the microwave helped, but the paper problem was still there. I managed to eat a couple of small pieces and the rest I threw away.I ordered based on the name \\"Torrone\\", remembering from the past an individually boxed candy, maybe 1-1/2\\" by 3/4\\" size, certainly edible when removed from the box.

You feel Molina's pain with a wife that has left him, but still trying to keep it together with a tough exterior that turns the town against him. And who better than to epitomize the river gypsy than Johnny Depp?This movie is like making chocolate: it takes some work in the beginning to get it going, but once it gets in the oven (stove? wherever you make chocolate) and the smells start to waft over you, it is delightful and pleasant right up through swallowing the last bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"Both my wife and I thought the premise sounded ridiculous and were reluctant to watch this. However, I made a last minute sweep of Blockbuster for our New Year's Eve movie watching and it was in plentiful supply so I grabbed a copy. Wow, what a surprise!!We both loved it and it is now on my \\"buy\\" list. A cute story, wonderful photography, some excellent acting and a happy ending.A great way to start 2002...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Humor and Delicious Fun","review":"This movie was about bringing out the fun in everyone's life. I enjoyed the subtle hints and jokes here and there. All in all, this was a tasty film to watch but not overly pleasing to the mind and eye. It could have been a little bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat? Mais oui!","review":"Chocolat is a wonderful, sensual, and touching story that will satisfy you to the very end. Sweet, witty, and endearing. Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Lena Olin, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Johnny Depp all give fantastic performances. Hugh O'Conor also shines as the Elvis-imitating priest.This is a great adaptation of the novel by the same name. This film teaches us to measure our lives by what we indulge ourselves in, as well as what we deprive ourselves of. There is strength in both virtues, and only one who finds that equilibrium can be truly happy in life.Chocolat, anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairy tale for adults & some kids","review":"While other reviewers focus on the way that Juliette Binoche's character brings savor and tolerance to a repressed French village, the moving thing in the story for me is how she learns that she doesn't have to keep running from place to place, and can in fact be happy and free even though she settles down. An important lesson for \\"free spirits\\".I watched this with my girls aged 8 and 5, and while there were a few semi-explicit sex scenes that some parents would prefer their kids not to see, mine were impressed with the characters and the story. They enjoyed it greatly along with me, which I don't mean to imply makes it a kids' movie in any way. But there is a story here that appeals to all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice fairy tale","review":"Chocolat is a nice movie about a woman who sweeps into a tiny French town and opens a chocolate shop during Lent. Viviane(Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter soon have most of the people trying her chocolates and revealing their secrets. The people to watch here are Judi Dench and Lena OlinAlfred Molina plays the well intentioned but uptight head of the community who gets into a battle of wills with Viviane.Johnny Depp adds to the chaos by coming into town with his band of 'River Rats' and being Viviane's love interestThe movie is beautifully photographed and the music is great. This is a great movie to watch at home with your boyfriend when you're in the mood for romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolat Not","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, and I think it had potential, but it ended up being a yawner. The only thing I got excited about was the chocolate. The artistry used in filming the chocolate will make your mouth water. If you want to enjoy chocolate with no calories, see this movie; otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the two hours of your life.","review":"Heavy-handed dreck about a woman who brings \\"enlightenment\\" (through libertine ideas and the metaphor of confections) to the supposedly close-minded rubes of a small French village. I watched it for the scenery, but even that small hope went largely unsatisfied.I suppose it's a wonderful little fable for those who were born in the 60's and got stuck in perpetual adolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Really Like It...","review":"This movie was alright, but I wasn't really blown away by it as much as I hoped. At times it got extremely boring, and I was a bit irritated at the continuous snobby, bitchy look of the actresses. Also, i thought this movie was just too long. I don't mind a movie being 2 hours, but not if most of the movie could have easily been at least an hour and 45 minutes. But oh well, obviously many reviewers found something to like in this movie, but I didn't. Yes, it's a sweet and seductive treat of a film, but nothing to brag about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Imitation of the Novel","review":"DO NOT READ THE NOVEL BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE!The movie is a cute little piece, but a pale imitation of the novel. The producer tried to capsule the story on his own terms, and failed.The biggest mistake is replacing the priest with the mayor, as the Advesary of the character played by Juliette Binoche. Ms. Binoche did a fine job in her role, but her role was toned down and so stripped of the mystic and magic of the novel.I realize it is a challenge to capsule a 300 page novel in a two hour film. However, the producer would have done better by sticking more to the original theme of freedom versus tyranny of religion.Let me warn you in even sterner terms. If you read the book, don't see the movie. If you see the movie, don't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to dull","review":"Chocolat is too long and dull for 2 hours. I cannot belive this film was nominated for Best Picture. Though the other nominations were well deserved except for Best Score. I usually am a sucker for a film like this, but this film tries too hard to be a good romantic comedy. In my opinion, the only thing that saves this film are the wonderful performances by Judi Dench and Johnny Depp. Depp's performance deserved a oscar nomination. I absolutely flipped when I heard this received a Best Picture nomination, and it's nomination should have gone to Wonder Boys. Overall, I give this 2 stars out of 4, only because of the great performances by Dench and Depp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but it's a Bore-alot","review":"'Chocolat' wants to be a charming, enjoyable, heartfelt experience, sort of like strawberries dipped in melted chocolate. Sadly, it somes off more like a Sneakers Bar. It's about a mysterious woman who blows into town and sets up a chocolate store. The woman, Vianne, is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. So, of course, she is hated by people that art not. There is an intolerant, unhappy mayor who forces the local priest to read his sermons who hates Vianne because she would not listen to one of his sermons. Vianne uses her chocolate confections to fix problems in peoples lives and messes around with Johnny Depp without any real chemistry.If you like things light and fluffy (possibly like a Three Musksteers), then this movie is for you. If you like things more dark and flavorful then please watch \\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for your teeth","review":"Set in the late 1950's, a gypsy woman and her young daughter literallly blow into a tiny French town to open a Chocolaterie, during the period of Lent no less. This causes problems for the town mayor and his precious townsfolk. He thinks her prescence will tempt his folk into succumbing to their sinful vices, such as erm, chocolate. Glossy, saccharine and dripping with sentimentality, this \\"chick flick\\" for the over 30's cannot even be saved by the creditable direction of Lasse Holmstrom. \\"Chocolat\\" is not an International art-house movie, it's actually as close to Hollywood feel-good sap as you can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullified retro Jive","review":"Was this really nominated for a an Oscar? The bar keeps lowering . All this movie turned up into as a cheesy Flashdance ripoff which was worse than Coyote Ugly if that is humanly possible.Other than the lead actress I never saw so many canned hams in 1 picture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tranquillite'\\" - that means \\"tranquility\\", ya' know!,","review":"Any film that combines Juliette Binoche with Johnny Depp seems worth seeing just for the absurdity factor. This one is *such* a Hollywood-esque take on small-town French life. You know you're in trouble when the opening voice-over (in English, as is the entire film) describes the \\"tranquillite'\\" of the village ... and then feels compelled to translate \\"tranquillite'\\" into English. And then there's the foolishness of Johnny Depp playing an Irish traveler who plays steel guitar - including a very uptown version of Django's \\"Minor Swing\\".This is another example of an interesting and slightly strange slice of European life made innocuous and comforting for American audiences.Nonetheless, I'll confess that the film is fun, predictable fluff. It's probably worth watching on a flight to Europe, if only because your actual experiences there will be *so* much more thought-provoking and rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring pointless story!","review":"I am just now seeing this movie for the first time in 2010 (lol). However, it is classified as a \\"romance\\" film so I decided to check it out. This is far from a romantic storyline. I was hoping to see more of Johnny Depp in the film but he had a passing character that showed up mid-film, had a brief encounter with the main character, then disappears again until the end of the film. The whole storyline is dull and pointless. The main character opens a chocolate shop and the town is against it and the mayor goes through everything to sabatoge her store. For what? It's just a chocolate store not a strip club. Who would go through all of that to close down a shop that sells candy? I just found the story to be ridiculous. The acting was excellent, the set, costumes and classic French town were beautiful but the movie left much to the imagination. I was highly disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat","review":"I agree with other reviewers who believe this film is filled with cliches and is predictable in its progression. But, in my opinion, that's the whole point! When we watch a movie like \\"Chocolat\\",we do so for a bit of escapism and comfort-and comfort is ultimately what the characters in this film find. Vianne and Anouk find the comfort and familiarity of a permanent home. The mayor begins to be comfortable with the fact that his wife has left him. Townspeople become comfortable with their various relationships and the young priest begins to become comfortable in his role as the town's spiritual advisor. We see these changes develop against a backdrop of the ultimate comfort food---chocolate! I believe that watching \\"Chocolat\\" leaves one nearly as satisfied as consuming chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, great movie","review":"Chocolat was a great movie.

I thought that viewing the film version would be a way to share this wonderful, rich story with my boyfriend, but I was sorely disappointed!I realize that when a film version of a novel is made, there always have to be some changes. Yet it is possible to stay true to the novel's characters, plot, themes, etc. in the film. This was not the case with the film version of Chocolat. I don't want to give away too much...but significant changes are especially noticable in the central characters, Vianne and Reynaud. The ending of the movie is almost totally different as well. Be warned - Chocolat has practically become a different story!Overall, the characters and plot just did not seem developed enough to make this a satisfying movie. I would highly recommend reading the novel instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rich and Creamy Delight","review":"Chocolat is a movie to please all our sensations!!A delicious blend of sensuality,idealism, and a sprinkling of magic makes this film so addictive that once I see it in the listings, I,m hooked to view it over and over again.Alively and bawdy soundtrack as well!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat","review":"Fun, mouthwatering movie.

That'll be--as John Wayne once said--the day.\\" -- Roger Ebert\\"Chocolat\\" is a paint-by numbers tale of of a confrontation between a village dominated by humorless, legalistic, pleasure-denying Catholics and the pleasure-seeking, chocolate-making Juliette Binoche who seeks to liberate them. The Catholics are for the most part wooden and sterotypical, though not portrayed as outright evil. It all plays out predictably. The ironic thing is that this day in age it is often the politically correct secularists who are the dour puritans while religious people are the ones who just want to be left alone to enjoy life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left off the \\"e\\".","review":"Another entry in the indie-film-genre-featuring-beautiful-women-who-are-really-good-cooks. This time, it's a chocolatier in a small town in France, who has the cheek to open her shop during Lent. When she arrives in town with her fatherless daughter, both wearing Hawthorney red cloaks, the experienced filmgoer will emit a weary sigh: it's to be another harangue about narrow-minded villagers who've yet to fully experience Life, which is represented in this movie by bon-bons. This has all been done better before. Not only that, director Lasse Hallstrom imbues the set with a pseudo-art house surrealism, which is not alleviated by the \\"international\\" cast, most of whom (except for Juliette Binoche and Peter Stormare) don't know how to speak with a French accent. Johnny Depp is especially jarring as an \\"Irish gypsy\\" (!) Finally, the title itself is pretentious: since everyone speaks English, the dropping of the \\"e\\" at the end of \\"chocolate\\" is an obvious bid at art-house respectability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious load of garbage","review":"I have yet to see a less horrible movie since I saw this one. The symbolism is not so much thinly disguised as it is like getting hit with a freight train. It is one pretentious load of garbage that attempts to disguise just how bad it is by being a period piece set in France. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie with an original plot","review":"This is a wonderful movie with a very original plot. It shows the prejudices of a small and narrow-minded community towards anything that comes from the outside. The local aristocrat rules over the village as a feudalist landlord. The opening of the chocolaterie comes into this - to say the least - conservative setting like thunder and lightening. Obviously, the landlord immediately sets out for maintaining desperately the social and moral status quo undermined now by the exotic owner of the chocolate shop.You cannot better show to what results prejudices and sudden judgements can lead. Wonderful. I would recommend this film to everybody who is interested in the display of various characters and their interactions. All the characters are wonderfully played.I liked especially the young priest dancing to Elvis' tunes while working in the garden. Just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmm....chocolat....","review":"I watched this again recently after purchasing it and was reacquainted with this lovely film. It is a sweet fable about personal freedom and the simple enjoyment of life. The acting is superb all the way around from the always great Judi Densch and Alfred Molina to the small but vital work of Johnny Depp (nice guitar work on the Robert Johnson and Django medley!)and culminates in the excellence of Juliette Binoche. It is a shame that her subtle and understated elegance lost out to the over-the-top performance by Julia Roberts for the Academy Award.The pacing, the tender storyline, the acting, the gorgeous scenery, and the precise musical scoring allow for a total abandonment of the self so that one can revel in the deliciousness of this film. Chocolat is rich, warm, and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting impatient with fake Irish","review":"This movie seems to be universally loved, and the cinematography is lush, but the pace thunked to a halt for us with the appearance of Johnny Depp. Maybe it is his unconvincing Irish accent, but a slow, charming film became self-conscious and unwatchable when he showed up as, for Pete's sake, an Irish \\"river rat.\\" We like Depp but he seems out of place. (For a wonderful, also slow, but unerring Lasse Hallstrom film, consider 'An Unfinished Life'.) On the plus side, the preparation and serving of chocolate is done beautifully; the skills of the director and cinematographer in this regard are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat","review":"My daughter loved receiving this movie for Christmas since she's a Johnny Depp fan.

It's such a beautiful movie with a great storyline and great acting. No wonder it was nominated for some Oscars. It's a terrific heart-warming movie that is fun to watch again and again. Well acted by Juliette Binoche (nominated for an Oscar for this performance) and other cast members, I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to see a beautiful story with no violence, sex, guns for a change.

I mean, come on, it's a mystical/mystery/romance/ensemble/cookbook! But the portrayal of small town French life soon won me over, and I set aside my reservations to just enjoy what was offered (not unlike a Hershey's bar?) The performances are uniformly good -- Juliette Binoche is, as always, beautiful and earthy, while Johnny Depp does a convincing Irish vagabond. Hallstrom's direction is aesthetically pleasing, from the quaint town to the delicious-looking chocolate. So if you're not expecting too much, I think you'll enjoy the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie as rich as chocolate itself","review":"Oddly enough, the texture of this film actually reminds me of chocolate. Chocolate has a strong flavor, but is also full of more subtle tastes, all of which flow together into a single, rich experience. Similarly, \\"Chocolat\\" delivers a strong message, and also tells the stories of several individual lives, all artfully blended together. All of the elements of the movie are strong - acting, direction, cinematography. But what stands out is the writing: it's at turns touching, humorous, mysterious and exciting, and it's difficult to say when one leaves off and another picks up. Put this movie on your \\"don't miss\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful film","review":"Chocolat tell the story of a young woman and her daughter who come to a small French village to open a chocolate shop.

The lovely chocolatier challenges the accepted order and replaces rules with warmth, hospitality, and every kind of chocolate you can imagine. The two become enemies when the mayor tries to close down the business by gossiping about its owner. A band of gypsies come to town and the mayor is even more incensed when she befriends them.

So she's as evil as they come (as this is set in the 50's), according to most of the town's people. Needless to say she manages to keep her shop open and stay in town, even though all the town talks about her and her child.Eventually she makes friends with a few (also black sheeps of the town) and helps them out with a few situations. And in the long run they all come around and keeps her in town, as she decided it was time to move on.I recommend the movie, it's nice, it's family orientated.

I hated to see it end and plan to watch it again soon.Enough has already been said about the story, so I will not add more, except to say that the movie was very close to the book. With the exception of a few politically correct changes (the mayor, not the priest is the bad guy and Depp's character is never called a gypsy as he is in the book), it was very true to Harris's novel.The extras at the end of the DVD were better than any I have seen before.

It befuddles me. Then there is Chocolat with a woman's touch; she (Juliette Binoche) spins the wheel and asks, \\"What do you see?\\" Always guessing a person's favorite chocolate. I remember the song's lyric from the movie Hunchback of Notre Dame, \\"Who is the monster and who is the man?\\" When Serge an abusive husband boycotts the \\"river rats\\" as Rue (Johnny Depp)brings a child with an upset stomach in need of a drink to his bar.

If you're still reading, watch this movie. It has that 1940's look and pace, and the great classic acting earlier films often contained. It has a thoroughly modern sensibility, however, in the way the story is told and the depth you see in the characters. Reviewers often use the word \\"gentle\\" to describe this movie -- but the issues it deals with are nothing of the sort. You'll have to watch for yourself -- but I believe you'll feel better about the world when you've done so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and acceptance","review":"Our suburban Presbyterian church used the video CHOCOLAT together with Hillary Brand's book CHOCOLATE FOR LENT in church-wide small adult group classes for six weeks. It was a great study in love and acceptance as portrayed by the main character in the video. As a professed non-religious person, Vianne showed many of Jesus' values so clearly depicted by his actions and parables. Her non-critical acceptance of Armande and Josephine had much in common with Jesus' acceptance of Levi the tax collector (Luke 5:27-32) and the prostitute who washed his feet with her tears (Luke 7:36-50). CHOCOLAT is a complex, multiple-subplot story very well done. No wonder it won five Academy Award Nominations."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bitter & the sweet","review":"i stayed away from this movie all this time because i was scared off by the \\"chick flick\\" aura it had, but if this is a CF, bring on more like it! set in a small french village in 1959, still not quite caught up with the modern world, juliette binoche stars as a single mother who wanders from place to place imparting the magical spells of chocolate, altering peoples lives while sadly not managing to alter her own. the townsfolk include a repressed mayor (alfred molina) who is her main foe with his reliance upon traditional catholicism, and a slew of fine actors (lena olin, judi dench, john wood, leslie caron -- & isnt it grand to see HER?, &c) all of whom are eventually won over, as well as johnny depp, her counterpart as an irish rover who manages to settle her down, as she does him. the movie is charming, funny, and gripping from end to end. plus, how can you NOT like a movie that hails the merits of chocolate?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps my favorite movie of all time!","review":"This is an exceptionally wonderful, entertaining film; I've watched and enjoyed it many times, and my teen and 'tween daughters have also fallen in love with it. The other reviewers have more than adequately described the outstanding performances of Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, and Johnny Depp. One of my own favorites in the film, however, is Hugh O'Conor as the young parish priest, Pere Henri. His rendition of \\"Ain't Nothin but a Hound Dog\\" (while working in his garden) is priceless. Kudos also to Lena Olin in her role of Josephine, who evolves from battered wife to confident tavern owner. I can't imagine anyone not loving and enjoying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED!","review":"The first thing I would like to say is this is a \\"good\\" movie,not great not even the best you'll see this year just good.Ok so maybe I'm acting like Kenneth Turan saying I liked it but it dosent deserve even three stars at least but Miramax will have to balme themselves.This year Miramax ran the most tasteless oscar campaign since John Wayne did with The Alamo.Ok now for the film,its and ok movie.Good music,nice photograpy and Alfred Molina is great but thats about it.It didn't make me feel great or anything it was just a movie you go see and you soon forget it.I'm not saying don't go see it,but just because it was nominated for best picture dosent mean it deserves it,it stole that from Billy Elliot,Almost Famous,or Dancer in the Dark.

(I suspect a rather different attitude to food and the \\"witch complex\\" might have something to do with it).I happen to believe that \\"magical realism\\" has devolved to a nearly protoplasmic state since Borges: so I liked the movie too, as it reaffirmed my belief.People have mentioned several movies that did the same, but better: dare I add to the (long) list, and suggest \\"Breaking the Waves\\" (a good example of how \\"arty chick flicks\\" actually can have guts sometimes) or Kubrics \\"Clockwork Orange\\" (as it shows the consequences of \\"Chocolat\\"s attempt at philosophy)?.Or maybe there just wasnt enough topless scenes.

Johnny is wooden, Juliette is awkward and the dialog is stilted.And shame on this film for making a Protestant minister the story's ignorant villain. Protestants have been massacred, repressed and persecuted in France for centuries. Protestants account for less than 2% of the French population today. Villainizing the Huguenot church when this faith has already suffered so much prejudice in France is insensitive and irresponsible. Will the film's sequel feature an ignorant, villainous rabbi in 20th Century Germany? Nothing quite like kicking a people and their faith when they've already suffered from near-extinction..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"The movie is unfair to religious sensibilities. The United States Catholic Conference of Bishops says the move is\\"Unpalatable fable set during the late 1950s in which a single mother (Juliette Binoche) arrives at a provincial French village to open an enticing chocolate shop during Lent, causing bitterness and opposition from the townsfolk tempted by her rich confections during a season of penance. Director Lasse Hallstrom's film insults with its disingenuous rallying cry for tolerance while it mocks faith traditions, religious tenets and Catholic sacraments. Brief violence, a sexual encounter with shadowy nudity, an instance of profanity and fleeting crass language. The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is (O) -- morally offensive. (PG-13) -- parents are strongly cautioned.

This movie must have had backing by Ghirardelli chocolate, because it seems to be an obvious plug for selling more chocolate. They made it sound like chocolate is good for you. Well it is, the way the Mayans drank it. Nowadays it's loaded with sugar and butterfat, which we're all now finding out how serious the damage is from refined pollutants that sends your adrenals on a roller-coaster ride.Don't believe the sugar-coated acting of Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche, they're mainstream people who don't understand the messages they have the power to produce.

After leaving it in for an hour (to be sure), ALL the hideous orange is gone and my hair looks incredibly healthy and fabulous. I love, love, love this product. It's expensive but it's better than using toner, or repeatedly using a semi permanent dye every four weeks. Love the herbal scent, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for medium browns with enough red","review":"My hair is naturally a medium brown with both ash and coppery tones. Black Malva deepened the colour and depending on how frequently I use it and how long I leave it on, I can get anywhere from a deep cool brown to just a deeper richer colour than my own. The only catch for me was that the very ends of my hair were brutalized by a bad salon bleach job, so there wasn't really any red remaining in some straw like strands. Those strands soaked up all the blackest of the colour, and then the REALLY damaged bits (just a few wisps at the ends) grabbed only the greenish/bluish hues. If you have very porous or damaged hair, especially if it is light and lacking red pigments, I wouldn't recommend this. But for anyone with dark to medium brown hair, it's great for deepening your hair colour, giving it a nice rich look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Outstanding product for those who need incontinence protection.

I purchased this one, and watched it and it wasn't too bad. It had a good feel of the 70s in it. The people at the film studio had to have made money on this one.

The title card reads: \\"The Loves of Count Iorga:Vampire\\", which I believe may be the European cut of this film. It includes some extra scenes of gore(mostly in the kitten devouring sequence!!!)and overall is a fun movie to watch. Avoid the \\"sequel\\" The Return of Count Yorga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suave and sophisticated","review":"This is the sort of vampire movie that Hammer should have been making in the 70's. All the Hammer sequels failed to match the original because Christopher Lee was given less and less to do.In this updating of the vampire legend Robert Quarry is exactly what Christopher Lee should have been in the later Hammer sequels. Count Yorga is still a blood-sucking fiend at heart but he is quite happy to sit and discuss the supernatural with a Doctor during the film. He cuts quite a dash, and amongst the many vampire films I've seen, his portrayal is one of the very best.The tension is racked up quite nicely throughout the film, and the modern (early 1970's) setting in Los Angeles seems to work well. Also being only 93 minutes long it doesn't overstay its welcome. You can get this film and the sequel (which I have not seen yet) in a nice double bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTDATED AND TOOTHLESS","review":"When the two Yorga movies came on the scene in the early seventies, they were lauded for their novel take on a familiar theme. Made on shoestring budgets with hardly any special effects, the movies relied on pervasive moods and sinister lighting. We don't know much about Yorga's history, just that he's suddenly in Los Angeles, posing as a psychic to lure beautiful women into his lair. Robert Quarry is effectively sinister as the Count, but he comes nowhere near the finesse of Frank Langella or the pure evil of Christopher Lee. Michael Murphy (Tanner and Tanner) has the thankless role of one of the young men out to snare the vampire, and Roger Perry (Barbara Eden Show) is hopelessly tedious as the knowledgeable chain-smoking doctor. A voice over from veteran character actor George Macready (Peyton Place) is campy but ridiculous. There are lots of unintentional (?) laughs, and thirty five years later, the Yorga series of two seems outlandishly outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"STARTED AS A PORN MOVIE","review":"Supposedly, this movie started as porn, and somewhere along the line became a vampire movie----which is maybe why the film makers didn't know anything about making a horror movie.Lots and lots of talking, with one repulsive scene of a woman under the influence of the vampire killing a cat to eat.Nothing special about the music, acting, script, direction, or locales. Robert Quarry walking about his California mansion is creepy only in the way Rock Hudson had a secret double-life in his California mansion.For a drive-in movie aimed at teens looking for a good time, this is one boring, dreary movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"This is a coffee table book filled with photos of the authors in various poses with some of their musings as text. These two darlings of the New York Downtown crowd are Cooler Than Thou, and this book reeks of vanity, a quality I thought great yogis exorcised from their Selves. If you want a book to help you learn yoga, try Light On Yoga, Yoga the Iyengar Way, Donna Farhi's book, Schiffman's (Moving Into Stillness), etc. If you're a Gannon/Life fan and you like looking at them, this is your bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art of Yoga?

It starts out where the clowns land on earth in a giant circus tent then some farmer finds the tent and the clowns go on a human killing spree. It's rather interesting and if you ever have time to see this movie it's well worth it. A very innovative film and you won't be disappointing. It features all types of great clowns too short ones, fat ones, skinny ones, tall ones, male and female clowns everything. It's mad circus fun. Bottom line you can't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday present for my girlfriend","review":"It's one of her favorite movies so it was the perfect gift.

It's worth viewing for the music alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"This movie is awesome!!It brings back memories of my childhood in Chicago's north side near Wrigleyville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Accurate Documentary","review":"This is a documentary of the origins of the journey of my ancestors and how they came to Earth. Its not entirely accurate, and I could nitpick here and there with details, but the overall storyline is based on real events and is pretty close to what happened. If anyone is interested in how scary clowns came to be on this planet, and how many are among us, this is a good place to start. This is a great movie to show the youngins right before bedtime too!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KLOWNZILLA","review":"I Love this movie my favorite part is where the short klown punched off a bikers head I also like the part where one of the klowns drives a guy off the road in an invisible car and than the same klown swallows people up with a shadow puppet my favorite part was where Officer Dave Hansen fought KLOWNZILLA AWESOME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie and Better Soundtrack!","review":"I have't seen this movie in years but it is awesome!

With funny special effects and a bizarre sense of humour, the film tells the history of agroup of alien clowns, the crew of a circus tent shape spaceship,thatlands on Earth to spread terror using the most varied circustechniques.

Set in a non-specific small suburban town. Aliens that look like evil clowns set down and begin terrorizing the town's people, capturing some while killing others.

They're aliens who look like circus clowns, and they're here to kill. They dispatch their victims with imagination, style, and circus magic! An imaginative and offbeat black comedy -- Despite the ridiculous premise, or perhaps because of it, this is a very cool film, albeit with a savage sense of humor. The \\"stars\\" of the film are a bunch of unknowns, and the acting of the people in the film is rather poor. However, the clowns are very well done. It is clear that the Director chose to spend his budget on make-up and special effects. This is for the good, because it is the clowns that make this one of the best cult flicks of the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"many laughs abound as bozos from beyond take over suburbia","review":"I first saw this movie at the ripe old age for 5. I loved it and it became a classic in my heart. Not seeing it for many years, I always remembered it. Recently, it was shown on the Sci-Fi channel and the nostalgia was high.The movie is about a clown-like race of psycho-aliens who land in the outskirts of a town. They do all they can to capture humans... why? Just rent the movie and see...Although this movie can be described as a cheesy B-movie, you can tell that a lot of work went into its costumes and production. It will always be one of the best movies money can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Klowns Kick As-k Anyone","review":"Killer Klowns is Hysterical. Kampy, Klunky, and Kustard-filled.

Now I can get the creeps just by walking in my front door. Get the DVD. This movie is a kult klassic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Klowns Rules!!!!!!!","review":"I remember watching Killer Klowns From Outer Space when I was about 10 years old. I remember it literally scared me after watching it. Like when the Klown made shadow puppets the last thing he made was T-rex,acid pies,the puppet show,the Klowns going door to door killing people,when Debbie was inside of baloon and when the little Klown knocked the punks'head off.But now it's my favorite movie to watch I have it on Media original movie release out of print,MGM release,and I have it on DVD if you get this movie you will not regret it.

So that was a little disappointing.This was made in 1988 so I thought it would be better effects and the killing sequences were terribly done. As you know the people in it are dumb and instead of realizing before that they are bad they have to go up and shake hands and then get killed. And as you know with every movie there is the police station that beleives the kid's are lying about clowns or monsters killing people and then they get killed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Klowns is awesome.","review":"Killer Klowns from outer space is the greatest movie of all time.

This really doesn't matter. After the second viewing you will understand what the filmmakers were going for and how they succeded on every level. It could be remade, but it would probably lose much of its low budget charm and freshness. The cast is only marginally good but it's not a variable. The film plays like a nightmare and is a perfect addition to MGM's Midnite Movie collection because it is best viewed in the later kult hours. You might just walk away unsure about clowns and their motives. What a fresh concept.

Flavorful, healthy home cookin'.","review":"I have most of Mollie Katzen's cookbooks, but this is hands-down my favorite one from her. Anyone who's interested in her cookbooks may want to start (and end!) with this one. She moves away from the egg and cheese based cooking that appeared in her Moosewood Cookbook and has taken a fresher approach, using cooking techniques (such as carmelizing) and creative condiments (my favorite: balsamic syrup, which is simply balsamic vinegar boiled down for 30 minutes) to add wonderful flavor without adding much fat. And the recipes are easy -- many of them have shorter ingredient lists than she had in the past. Definitely try the Soft Lentils with Roasted Tomatoes and Carmelized Onions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every recipe a disappointment","review":"Every recipe I have tried from this book has been very labor-intensive and a complete disappointment.

(For a great everyday veggie cookbook, try Simple Vegetarian Pleasures instead!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing vegetarian","review":"I am very disappointed with this visually pretty but gastronomically empty book. I have made several recipes and have found there is just not much to them. So many of the recipes are just dressed up salads that are not very filling. I think Mollie Katzen must eat like a bird because these recipes are just not substantial fare for a family and my children are just not going to eat main dishes centered around mushrooms, etc. Some of the baked goods are okay but in a vegetarian book, I am really looking for great vegetable recipes. I heard that her original Moosewood book is great. Maybe I'll get that one. This one just sits on my shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Paintings & Not 1 Recipe Photo","review":"There is no 'Luminosity' (as mentioned in the book description) in any of the paintings, most of which are too dark, drab, and simplistic.

Mollie has changed her cooking format (I think it comes with age) since the days of \\"Enchanted Broccoli Forest\\" and \\"Moosewood Cook Book\\", she displays more of a purest cooking form today. It is certainly packed with receipes to test any vegetable's limited, and as always the flavours are exciting and suprising to the pallet. Mollie has made me receive many compliments from friends and family over the years using her receipes and I will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Mollie Katzen's earliest cookbooks - Moosewood and Enchanted Broccoli Forest. Dishes I make from those are relatively easy and very tasty. I have tried a lot of recipes in this cookbook and I have been very disappointed. They just...don't taste as good. I have served some dishes from this cookbook which have remained uneaten on the table. On the other hand, when I use the other two, people usually enjoy the food, and ask me for the recipes. I have learned my lesson, and I don't use it anymore. If you actually want to buy a cookbook which is a useful source of recipes, I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it! Order something by Deborah Madison instead!!","review":"I've never been as disgusted by a cookbook as I have been with \\"Vegetable Heaven\\". I am a fairly experienced with respect to vegetarian cookery, yet every recipe I tried from of this cookbook was an unmitigated disappointment. Usually I ended up with bland semi-liquid muck. The \\"Black Beans in Mango Sauce\\" recipe was appallingly bland and grainy. The butterscotch pudding had absolutely NO flavor. And the mashed pea guacamole substitute, or \\"Guaca-Mollie\\", was so pasty and nasty that eating it gave me the dry heaves.Get the original Moosewood. Or Moosewood Low Fat Favorites. Or ANYTHING by Deborah Madison. Or try the vegetarian recipies from any of Madhur Jaffrey's cook books. But I beseech you to save your money and save yourself from this cook book."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's running out of the ideas...","review":"I regret I bought this one.While her very first one (the moosewood cookbook) is full of very creative and very tasty dishes, in this book she is merely trying to scrounge any ideas from any sources (her childhood memories, very common dishes with little changes...).To make the recipes appealing and in a way deluding (b/c they are not really good or her own), and for her fun, she loaded the book with so many of her paintings--- which may be whimsically cute, but not artistic.And even some of the recipes I tried turned out to be very bland, many times not tasty at all.I don't try the recipes in the book any more.But I do still use her other book (the moosewood) quite often.--it is a very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beamtracer is not informed","review":"I have to disagree with beamtracer's comments. This book has some very basic info, and mr. beck seems to not cover as much as mr. ablan. I'll give you an example - the ablan books inform you not only what to do, but why you're doing it, and add to that the variations which are possible. This book just suggests to perform a function (such as create text) without telling you how to load text, text options, or mac users.The examples are extremely simplistic and like lw applied, it should not have a v.7 in the title as it's clearly not written for anything involoving lightwave 7. Why are these publishers saying it's for v.7? There is a ton of stuff not covered dealing with lw 7. If they're not going to cover it, then don't put it on the title.

Rather, it caused me grief. There were so many errors that I have to read over and over in order to grasp the faintest idea of what the author seemed to imply. An Advance user may not find the book useful since much of the stuff are geared towards beginners but the number of errors and inconsistencies makes the book a pain for a any beginner. Patrik may know the in and out of Lightwave 3D, but from this book, he failed to get that across. My advice to Patrick - next time you write a book, please spend more time going over it and save unsuspecting victims like me from wasting time and money. As a matter of fact, I'll give the book away for free to the first person who contacts me. This book should never have been sold in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Lightwaver","review":"This is an excellent book, and very applicable to version 7.5 as well. It consists of many small tutorials and has some excellent solutions to complex problems. The only complaint I can find with this book, and the only thing keeping it from 5 stars, is that the book gets you going on creating an effect, then kind of trails off with some suggestions for improving the effect.Some of the effect ideas in this book are well worth the price of the book. Mr. Beck's burning paper effect is awesome, and the time to work thru the tutorial and create the effect is very minimal (5-10 minutes). I've worked several of the tutorials in this book and found myself saying \\"Wow!\\" quite a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at best, many better choices...","review":"I purchased a number of books to get me updated on the latest Lightwave. I guess if I could I would give this one a star and a half, not 1 star, but I really found it to be lacking in a number of ways. The tutorials are clear in some areas, but gloss over other areas. The writing isn't really very good either in that it doesn't explain things in an order which is typical (and better) in other books. I was very disappointed with this book to sum it up. I found a number of others to be much better, especially Ablan's. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product...","review":"Is very bad product. Don't have good reception and sound, and lost easy the programation...I feel bad with the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack of (almost) all trades ... Master of None.","review":"This was a BIG disappointment. The FM radio receiver is a joke. On almost all channels, you need to fully extend the wire antenna in a specific direction (different for each channel), or your reception is full of static. I have a cheap Zenith clock radio that is far superior with no special actions, so you know it can be done; Sony just missed the boat. The Mega Bass is a Mega waste. While this unit does a lot of things, there are no 'nature sounds' or weather station type items, which I think would be better than TV sound. I rated it so low, since it does nothing exceptionally, and for the price, it should. Also, the Sony reputation rightfully warrants a premium on many product lines, but definitely not here. I suggest you keep looking ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite satisfied","review":"My search was for a CD player combined with a clock radio that would play not only retail CD's but also music burned onto a CD from the computer. I purchased a remanufactured Sony that had not only this ability but also the promise of good sound. Now close to a year later I am quite pleased with the quality of this unit and the features. It lacks a battery back up for the time function but overall I find it to be a well built stereo player and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Happy","review":"What can I say, Sony quality, small footprint because of the \\"vertical\\" design, and all of the features with discreet controls. Complaints about other systems not having \\"dimmable\\" display led me to investigate this system, and I am entirely pleased with it. The contols need to be learned by touch and the tactile keys help you home in on the location of the primary buttons. I love this system and could really care less about the loss of the analog TV reception. The sleep timer, CD, 10 programmable FM loccations and weather channels are all crystal clear and easily found with the digital tuning.If you can find one of these gems, get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable Controls","review":"Pros:- Good feature set- Decent sound- Auto adjusting back-lightCons:The controls on this alarm clock are simply absurd. I am in a technical profession and not afraid of feature-rich tools and toys. But this clock radio has such confusing and non-intuitive controls that it takes forever to set a new alarm time or adjust the display time or station. More importantly, to turn the alarm off in the morning you really need to turn the light on and squint to find the off button (which is small and located on the front next to a barrage of other buttons of identical size).This is just horribly poor design. In short, had I known how frustrating it was to operate this device I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the PERFECT alarm clock!!!","review":"I looked everywhere for the perfect alarm clock and finally found it with this Sony ICF-CD863V.This clock is EASY to use. You don't need to spend 1 hour reading the manual before getting it all set up. It's EASY!The buzzer is AWESOME!!! I LOVE the buzzer! It's SOFT, it doesn't startle you while you are deep asleep, yet it is loud enough that you can hear. I love it.The light on the display adjusts itself automatically depending on the darkness of the room. Sooo cool!I love using the CD feature and the sound is just AMAZING!This is just a VERY NEAT product for a great price compared to the competition. You will not go wrong when buying this alarm clock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated and wouldn't play some CDs","review":"I bought one of these new, because my old Sony Dream Machine was so reliable and simple. At first I was enchanted with all of the features, but setting them up is not intuitive. Eventually I forgot how to program the thing and it wasn't worth the trouble to look it up. Every time the power went out I had to get out the manual to figure out how to reset the time. Then when it started to not play some CDs (factory ones) that was it, and I sold it at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map lacks details","review":"This map was not helpful. The close-up detailed map of downtown Funchal does not show locations of key items such at the terminal for the cable car to Monte and the location of the toboggan run.

This album is even worst than their first album Soulfly (another bad album ). I hope they change in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 RANKS #1!","review":"... This album is a metal masterpiece, and probably the best metal album out this year. If you like Soulfly then you probably liked Sepultura with Max, well, this album sounds more like Sepultura than the last two albums, and it's about time Max brought that tightness in a band back to the table. \\"3\\" is also the first to not be produced by a major producer, Max himself appears to be the main guy at the soundboard according to the credits, however it was mixed by Terry Date (best known for producing every Pantera album so far). On top of that, the album comes off sounding even better than the last two with songs reaching boundless horizons and a maturity I never knew Max had in him. The band sounds so tight it's almost unbelieveable. One last thing, play this album very loud, there's no other way to listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulfly F&(^'s S&!% Up","review":"This album like the other self titled Soulfly album reaches out to you and Downstroy is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I recommend this album just to hear Downstroy. The first 4 songs make this cd worth buying because1. Downstroy has really sweet repeating riffs2. Seek n strike here we go!! has a good getting through everything feel3. enter faith is kinda repetative but stands up for SOUL power (religion)4. One is another good song by soulfly One God One faith One Life (shows that everybody has similar senses so they should be able to relate better)5.-9. a bunch of unrelated stuff to the cd but Brasil's lyrics translated is sorta soulfly -like and 9-11-01 is a good tribute.10.-14. more soulfly is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash rehash rehash","review":"This is the ultimate rehash album, half the songs actually contain riffs that are exactly like other songs Max has done in the past. Seriously, Max needs to get some creativity back or just retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the old days","review":"This is ok I guess kind of (not really) The stuff that is really worth buying though is Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastion, Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise and Chaos A.D. The Sacred Reich cover (One Nation) is cool. It can be found on the Sacred Reich e.p. Surf Nicaragua (now there is money well spent). All in all Soulfly 3 is ok, but don't spend any money on it there is a lot better cd's that you need to spend your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of good...... IF......... u own no Sepultura stuff!","review":"I used to be a Soulfly fan a while ago and even saw the band wen they toured in my area so i do know a bit about them and i'm not slagging them off but..... i checked out some of Max's earlier work with Sepultura and was shocked at how similiar the bands output was, except for the fact that Sepultura sounded fresher. Yup poor Max has spent the last three albums repeating the Roots formula with less and less effect. From awful guest appearences (Limp Bizkit) to ballads (Tree of Pain) and every Soulfly albums complimentary instrumental (always called bloody Soulfly 1,2 etc) this is watered down stuff from the metal god that made such classics like Chaos AD, Arise etc. That being said compared to Adema, Linkin Park etc this is essential stuff but only until you move onto greater things , ie Old Sepultura. Soulfly could be the start of your journey into good metal then....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected. To Unoriginal","review":"Well I am a Soulfly fan and an even bigger Sepultura fan new and old. Soulfly 3 was just primitive remade again with too many special guest except this time they didnt mention who everyone was. If you read the lyrics and listen to the music closely you can clearly see the unoriginality in many of the songs. For example the intro to the song brasil is the same intro to the Sepultura classic attitude except it was just speeded up. And in the song seek and strike you can see that many of the lyrics are similar to lyrics from attitude as well. Unlike Soulfly Sepultura had taken a new route in their music and both there albums were a great success with many new classics such as choke and sepulnation. Well Max your first album was good but you really need to change your ideas because the Roots day's are over and its time to find something new.

I have used it constantly since. It is the perfect camera for one like me - impatient, visually impaired and critically demanding. I purchased the camera for the display after seeing someone using one like it but smaller. My interests are taking great memory photos indoors and outdoors and this camera has been excellent. Although I have a movie camera, this one serves perfectly for short clips for our website."},{"rating":"2","title":"FX50, the good and the bad","review":"A good camera. Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, it is ready within 2 seconds to take a picture. Pluses: big viewscreen, bright and sharp. Good battery life. Uses SD card. Controls are easy and menus accessible. Pictures are good, but all cameras take good pictures these days.Bad: Optics are limited, no real wide angle, zoom is limited. Has optical image stabilization (as opposed to digital) so it only works with the optical zoom. When you really need stabilization, at extreme zooms, its not there. Has trouble focusing in relatively low light.At $250 it would be a bargain. At $350 it is just one of the crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"great style","review":"I have just replaced a string of Canon digitals with this camera - a G2, an SD500 and an SD600. I chose the Panasonic FX50 over the Canon SD800 as it has very similar features including optical image stabilization and 28mm wide angle. The Canon just seemed tired - in its styling and menus and I read some questionable reviews about its lens. As for the Panasonic, I love the super bright 3\\" screen. The styling is beautiful, especially in the black...and of course there is that Leica lens. I was particually concerned about the lag time between pushing the button and the shutter click as I am chasing around my 9 month old. This camera is quick and even has a \\"baby\\" scene set. The toggle control makes scrolling through the menus a breeze, and these menus are very intuitive. The body construction seems pretty solid. I have yet to assess battery life and video quality, and I would like to take some more time to compare the image quality of differnt shots, but so far I am impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade from the FX9","review":"Panasonic does it again! The FX50 has a weird \\"nub\\" for a joystick when navigating menus, but it is a definite upgrade to my FX9 and I love the 3\\" LCD...WOW!

It will always hang away from your face or sags too low.The second problem is that you need to yell to be heard. Since it hangs away from your face, everything you say is filtered out as background noise until you yell.Finally, it is not comfortable. It hangs loosely, sometimes slips off, and the earpiece does not feel comfortable since it is oval shaped.The standard headset in the 360 package is superior to this. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality set","review":"greay head set, it it were wireless and worked this good you would have this as an industry standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off good, but starts to stink","review":"I thought this headset was great when I first got it. It fit securely, and it did not pick up much outside noise in the microphone. I liked it much better than the original 360 headset, and another Plantronics Headset (that I broke).Anyway, like I said, the first month I had this headset, the earpiece sat comfortably and firmly in my ear. However, within the past 2-3 weeks, the rubber piece that keeps the headset attached to the side of your face has gotten REALLY loose. It constantly moves around on my face now, and I can't keep the microphone to stay near my mouth. It drops down all the way to my neck, and people can never hear me.I would defnititely recommend NOT buying this headset. It worked well in the beginning, but in the long run, I would go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headset ever","review":"I legitimately can't even get this thing to stay attached to my ear.

The other way it's sticking out to the side.The incredibly big issue though is the microphone is incredibly horrible. The Xbox can never pick up your voice unless your yelling and even then it's as if your whispering. I think quality control should have picked up on this issue.I tried plugging it into my cell phone and it was incredibly quiet. After a month of use, I finally twisted the mic a bit to much and that was the end of the mic. I found a cell headset for $10 that was much better than this.For all my troubles though I had Plantronics send me another one, just so it could sit in the package. At least I got two crappy headsets for the price of just one in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Headset...Period","review":"I bought this to replace my 360 headset and have used this for 4 years with no issues.

Second the mic arm is not flexible, it's rigid and thats all there is to it so if you wanna adjust too bad.I'm extremely dissatisfied with this headset and it broke the second day I had it. So ticked over it I never even sent it back for a refund just pitched the thing in the trash to be rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick up your voice unless you yell into it","review":"I wanted to like this headset because it fits very well under headphones unlike most of the other products available. However, it just isn't any good.The main problem is that it doesn't pick up your voice unless you talk so loudly that you are basically yelling. And even then it sometimes cuts out while you are still talking.Also the boom on the microphone is not long enough which exacerbates the first problem.Another problem is that it becomes really uncomfortable and starts to hurt your ear after about 20 minutes or so.And finally, the mute/volume control is halfway up the cord and inconvenient to use while playing.One thing I didn't have a problem with was the quality of incoming audio. That was very good, significantly better than the stock 360 headsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headset","review":"I forget that I'm wearing it. Very light and with good sound and mic.

Check the Customer's picture for commentary about the fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"I purchased this headset because it seemed to have a reasonable price, that was it. It is comfortable in my opinion, and doesn't feel like it could fall off at all. The sound comes in very clear, but my complaint is that it is EXTREMELY difficult to communicate to others. The mic is connected to a hard-plastic straw that doesn't bend toward the mouth, and the only way that I could get the mic to pick up my voice was to either yell or take one hand off my controller in order to push the mic closer to my mouth to talk. I've been using the headset that came with my Xbox 360 instead, and I think it is a very good headset, considering it came with my Xbox 360 for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY!","review":"The first night I got this headset it was broken, most players could not hear me, then it broke in half!

Over all a horrible product. don't buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good headset","review":"I purchased this headset after the one that came with the xbox broke...

My friends could not hear me at all unless I was almost shouting and sometimes not even then. I would not recommend this headset to anyone.

A lukewarm release (take a look at Rev 3: 15-16), supposedly God-inspired, FTSOTC does not deserve a second listening.

Buoyed by the euphoric title track, the album is a smartly produced collection of inspirational tunes performed with Chapman's usual perfection.FOR THE SAKE OF THE CALL uses an anthemic choral back-up to reinforce the lead vocal and the song's strong melody (given a lovely instrumental reprise that closes the album). Also noteworthy: BUSY MAN, WHEN YOU ARE A SOLDIER and SHOW YOURSELVES TO BE.Chapman may no longer be as dominant in today's expanding CCM market but he is a significant factor in its wider acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Sake of the Call-a prelude","review":"This was a necessary CD for Steven.

The sex scenes are bloody awful, though not as awful as the bionic sex scenes in Afterburn.

Did she enjoy writing this book, or did she take out her press for time and/or obligatory book release deadline on the characters in this book? The storyline is incredibly unbelievable and unrealistic. Why did I finish the book? I ask myself the same question. Perhaps because I kept hoping for some sense to arrive in the storyline.

May suffered the excrusiating pain with promise of reward, a husband who would love her. Instead the pain and violence only contintued as the fourth wife of her older abusive husband, she was constantly raped, sodomized and beaten. There was no reward.

On the left page you might have 5 places reviewed, on the facing page 4 photographs: Sometimes you can guess the correlation, many times not. Only a few very stylish hotels are reviewed. Most of the outdoor photographs are dullish as if taken on a cloudy day. The city is divided into sections and broken down with maps of the restaurants, bars, cafes, shops in that are.

The last sceen comes right out of Norman Rockwell. this is the 50's lest we forget. what is nice about this film is that your told why every thing is happening. this is a very enjoyable title, this is one of my collection, and is top shelf.

I build fine furniture and find that the Mirka paper holds up well on cherry and walnut. It cuts fast and seems to last a fairly long time (a few hours of sanding time). When it does wear out I typically keep a few sheets around to use as a \\"finer\\" grit or to do hand sanding. I have not had any sheets disintegrate. It also holds well to the hook and loop on my P-C."},{"rating":"1","title":"ow ow ow ow....it hurts!!!","review":"Wow, this movie is just plain horrible.

This bit of drivel however was actually physicaly draining! After you pick apart the duct tape and peeling spray paint on the martians \\"uniforms\\", and laugh at the incredibly fake spaceship, and after you realize that the actors couldn't even get jobs as extras in soap operas, you still have an hour of the film to go!!! I ended up watching most of this film on fast forward, just stopping when it appeared that some sort of plot point might of been developing.(no such luck in most cases)If you have the choice, go grab an Ed Wood film. They are \\"Citizen Kane\\" compared to this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to see Tommy Kirk","review":"It is good to see Tommy Kirk working in a film, but not exactly this film. Pretty sad movie and industry to use the likes of once great teenage actor, Disney's Tommy Kirk, in this type of film. Tommy Kirk is an actor who just got too old for his own image. That is sad. This movie is sad or should I just say bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"old yeller's owner and batgirl in a space age love story!!!","review":"This movie is so much fun. I didn't think I was going to be able to get through it, when I sat through 16 minutes of stock footage from the US airforce. I couldn't turn away! it just gets worse and worse! Men glare at hot young things and strippers twirl, but the fun is just beginning, cuz MARS NEEDS WOMEN!!!The only thing I didn't like about the dvd itself is that the transfer is pretty bad. Not up to par with the only midnight movies that have been released in the series. It is only in pan and scan which for once is fine with me, cuz I didn't need to see the ample body parts of the women all over the screen. There wasn't a trailer.

There are movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space that are so bad they're good. There are movies like Monster-a-Go-Go that are so bad they're simply torture. But Mars Needs Women is a whole new kind of bad: it's a movie which is so incredibly boring that you'll need some heavy stimulants to stay awake through it all. This film is only for the hardest of the hard-core bad movie buffs, and the only reason to watch it is to say that you did. If you're in this category, my advice is to watch it for 20 minutes, do something else more interesting (you won't have any trouble finding something -- even staring off into space would do it) and then watch another 20 minutes etc. until you're done with it. I give it one extra star because I actually liked what little plot there was -- properly edited, it would have made a decent half-hour movie.

The author admits that he is not a professional academic historian but he took on this massive work because he correctly realized how necessary it was. As large as this compilation is, it does not (indeed, could not) include all of the primary material on the Alamo. What it does do is successfully show the nature of the sources Alamo writers have been using and continue to use. The sources are not only contradictory in many cases, but often of limited reliability (even when they appear to be detailed \\"official\\" records). That is why students of the Alamo should read this book before they blindly accept judgements presented in any other format, be it a written history, documentary, historical novel, or film."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION","review":"The intensive, detailed research that Terri L. Fivash shares in her book, JOSEPH, makes the narrative vibrant with life, as well as, informitive about the life and culture of Egypt.Through all the intrigue and treacherous plots, I found myself living Joseph's trauma and emotions. So gripping is the narrative that I had to discipline myself to keep from reading all 463 pages in one sitting!Attitude played a big part in the way Joseph faced his tragedies and decisions in regard to his relationships with the indiviuals surrounding Potphar, who now owned him. Delibertly choosing to learn as much as possible about his new, strange invironment, created high respect in the minds of his new masters and possibly jealously, too.His relationship with God and the way God brought him through each challenging circumstance, demonstrates that with God all things are possible.This book is well worth the money!Betty L.

I am reading in several languages because sometimes the greatest treasures are really hard to find.Well that book gives you insights that you find nowhere. The author perceives the ghost realm with a clarity of a true master. At the same time she stays incredibly humble which only indicates her strength and greatness. She is definitely out of the world of the ordinary.I also had the chance to read other books by Wanda Pratnicka which at the moment are only available in Polish and German and I can only say that - if you find that subject interesting read that book and you will see the world from a completely different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I was disappointed in this book, thinking it would have more to do with traditional possession. What the author writes about has more to do with blaming ghosts for every ill that befalls man. It got to be a bit much for me when the author blames alcoholism on the ghosts of previous alcoholics. The book does have some interesting theories, and some I can see being reasonable, but there are so many over the top theories here that I just couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITTLE TOO SPOOKIE","review":"WE EAGERLY WAITED FOR THIS NEW OLIE, WHILE IT IS AWFULLY SHORT, IT IS RATHER INTENSE FOR KIDS 4 OR LESS...SPOOKIE OOKIE IS JUST THAT...REALLY SPOOKIE-LOOKING(FOR MY 2 AND A HALF YEAR OLD)...AT LEAST ZOWIE ISN'T AFRAID.

It uses no footnotes, but it does give a bibilography of the massive academic tomes on which it draws. Special mention is given to the use of chironomy (gestures of the hand, arm and fingers) to represent and to conduct music, to the role of music in every aspect of Egyptian life, and to the connection between the erotic and the spiritual in Egyptian thought. My only disappointment is that she ignores the musical scale (again, based on chironomy) reconstructed by one of her sources, the late Hans Hickmann.I had no idea Dr. Mannische had written so many other books as well, though I should've guessed this would be so.

They were very moved by the story, identifying with Emi and her sadness and fear. In the story, the bracelet assumes the importance of a link to Emi's past; its importance lessens as difficult losses are suffered by Emi and the rest of her family. If you need to begin to address the topic of prejudice with your children, this story might be a sad yet somehow gentle way to begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful and beautifully illustrated book.","review":"This is a wonderful story about friendship.

If you are planning to buy this book be aware that some of the themes in the book may not be appropriate for children under 6-7 years old. This book deals with a child being taken away from home, friends and family then losing a prized possesion. The book also includes talk about war and soldiers with guns. My class had difficulty understanding why Emi was being taken away. This book is more suited to children much older."},{"rating":"2","title":"As promised","review":"The book came in quickly and was handed out to a deserving young person in order to expand their universe.

We live in a rural area and at least a couple of times a year the power goes out. This coffee pot has a 'vacation' setting that you use when on vacation. If you unplug appliances when you travel you'll return to a counter full of water and an empty coffee maker. Unfortunately, if the power goes out, the coffee maker decides that it has been unplugged and dumps its contents all over the counter.Also, after years of ones that turn themselves off after a couple of hours, it is annoying to spend this much for one and have that basic feature missing. One instance of brain rot could easily burn down your house if you forget to turn off the pot before leaving the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST and ONLY coffeemaker I'll buy","review":"I got my second Bunn coffeemaker this past Christmas after our first one finally started wearing out. I have always loved how coffee tastes in restaurants and wished my coffee would come out that way at home. I typically saw Bunn coffeemakers in restaurants so I told my husband that I wish I could have one of those for home, but at the time, I knew I wouldn't have one as I thought they were just expensive and large commercial grade machines and not made for home use. Well, a few years ago, my husband surprised me with a home Bunn coffeemaker for Christmas and I was amazed at how great the coffee tasted - just like in a restaurant! I knew then that the Bunn coffeemaker would be the only coffeemaker we would ever buy from now on. So, again, I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased to open another Bunn coffeemaker for Christmas to replace our aged one. I HIGHLY recommend this coffeemaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool book","review":"Movies to Manage By uses film in the right way.

While looking for books to read for the school reading activity, I accidentally found Phase Line Green and got in touch with it. Just by looking at the short summary on the back of the book, I knew it would be a great book. Phase Line Green was very detailed on the date of the Vietnam War, landform, troops and other informations about Vietnam War. IT covers a lot information about the U.S. Marines during that time. Because of its very detailed story and well-expressed feelings and thoughts, sometimes you feel like it is you who was in the book and not Nicholas Warr. Overall, it's an excellent non-fiction story about Vietnam War and is the best english non-fiction book I had read. Therefore, I recommend this book to every one, no matter how old you are.

I am sure she is subject to much criticism, but which of the great haven't been...? I applaude her voice and her interpretation of the music. As an instrumentalist, her voice is one of the few that have made me stop and realize that a vocalist can also have tremendous technical ability while still respecting the authenticity of the score. She may not have the pianissimi as did Callas in her prime, but she definitely adds to the drama of the words, which we sometimes forget are the reason the aria was written. Do we support opera just for the reason its nice to our ears and we can let it pass before us, or do we support it because we are enthraled with the story and the dramatic value it possess which connect us to each character...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I understand how alluring it can be to sing some of the beautiful music in the Bel Canto repetoire, but there are some things people should not sing!

The Wind 'N Go flashlight is much brighter than the old LED flashlight, not quite as bright as a Maglite flashlight, but not having to replace batteries in the Wind 'N Go is a nice trade-off.The crank is easy to turn. It is a little noisy when being cranked.It has one button operation, which is simple but a little quirky. Each time it is turned on, it either lights one LED for power saving, or it lights three LEDs for more brightness. It alternates between the two modes, so if it turns on in the wrong mode, you have to turn it off and on again.

I promptly sent the other brands back because they just didn't compare. It's comfortable in the hand, the handle folds away securely (unlike some of the other brands where the handle keeps popping up), and it actually has pretty bright output for a long period of time. I usually give it a couple cranks before I turn it on every time I use it, so I don't quite know yet how long it will last on one charge, but I went as long as 40 minutes once without losing any brightness.
