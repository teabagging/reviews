I have always felt comfortable placing her in it because it is designed to keep her stable and to keep her head upright. It is wonderfully designed. the only drawback is that it is a little big, so storage is not easy. Definitely worth purchasing, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for infant - lots of room to grow!","review":"I registered for this tub after doing my research and reading reviews and have only had positive experiences with it. It's the first tub we've had, and I predict it will be the ONLY ONE we ever have. I have used it for my 3 month old since her first water bath and I have had NO problems. It IS a large tub to store, but I don't mind since it makes our bath times so fun and easy! My daughter just loves splashing around in it and it fits her little body so well that I don't worry about her slipping out or off of the infant rests while I bathe her. I actually put this tub into our bathroom tub for bathtime - fits perfectly. When her bath is finished, I simply dump her water into the large bathtub to drain and store this one away. There is a drainage hole and pipe for easy draining if you choose to use it somewhere other than a bathtub. There is a lot of room for her to grow also - we'll be using this tub for years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as well for us - read to know why !","review":"I had high hopes for this product after reading all the glowing reviews.This is why it does not work for us -1) Our tall (86 percentile) 7 month old fits rather uncomfortably on the side for babies 6 month and older. The protrusion to keep the baby slipping is real close to her body and she has to sit really upright and in no other position. A bit more recline is needed and the protrusion needs to be less wide.2) Our baby is always trying to stand up - and the shiny and highly slippery surface means she falls down hard. A well designed product would have a non-slip surface!3) The drain hole is tiny - takes a long time for water to drain out.Cheap - and highly over-rated. I'm looking for alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Euro Bath","review":"This bath is very roomy and appropriate for baby at all stages. As infants there's a sloped plain at one end and if they are just learning to sit; the other end is narrower and stradle bar to keep baby from tipping, and is still room enough to accomadate a toddler. This is the best baby bath I've ever seen and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Although rather large & cumbersome in my apartment, my newborn daughter was perfectly comfortable and secure in it. My favorite feature was being able to use both hands to wash her or lather soap in my hands since the tub supported her so well. This is the ONLY tub I would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Primo","review":"Great product, little bulky to store. I use a towel to lay down the baby. It is a little slippery when you are trying to wash the babies back. Buy some rubber stickies to put down at the bottom, that may help."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"I origianlly had the Fold Up Tub by Safety 1st and I HATED it! It was awful. It would slide across the tub and my son just looked so uncomfortable in it.Our son loves this tub. You can just tell the difference. He can now stretch out his legs and kick around. He is also secure between the three supports, we can add plenty of water to cover him just past his armpits, and there is plenty of growing room. Take our word and spend the extra money - you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Active Infants","review":"My 7 months gets too active during bathtime so I bought this to replace myFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub. It is bigger which is great but it is also very slippery for an active infant. My infant would crawl or tried to stand up causing her to slipped hitting her body and head into the safety supports which are hard plastic mounds. Bathing became difficult and painful for her so I stopped using it and got something with a flat even surface like aHoppop Bato Bath Tub, Limewhich worked out quite nicely. I would only used this if my infant just lay during bath like a newborn but she doesn't. I would also recommend getting some anti slip stickers if you're still going to get this. Will give it another try once she can stand on her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bathing made EASY!","review":"With our first child soon to arrive, I scoured the internet looking for the \\"best\\" baby products. When it came to baby tubs, there were so many choices, all with their own unique features. After sorting through pages and pages of reviews I decided on the Primo EuroBath. I could not be happier. When it arrived I was surprised at how large it was! My wife said that it would be way too big for a little baby to safely take a bath without being held by one of us. Ha! When our daughter arrived and had her first bath, my wife ate her words. This tub securely holds an infant (above water level) while leaving BOTH your hands free to wash the baby. Now that our daughter is older and able to sit up, the toddler side works equally well. She has plenty of room to splash and play with out having to fill up the \\"big people\\" tub. This is a definite good buy for anyone concerned about bathing a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good design, Baby loves it, but big","review":"Like other reviewers, I discovered how much my baby loved the water with this tub. It is cleverly designed because it can be used for small babies as well as older babies. I also like that it is all plastic--there are no foam or cloth parts that might get moldy or smelly in storage.I'm not sure it is useful beyond one year, because by then my toddler would stand up. She was more interested in sitting in the regular bathtub. The main disadvantage is its size--if you don't have a place to store a bathtub the size of an oversized laundry basket, then this might not be for you. It worked for us even though we didn't have much storage space in the bathroom, because we kept it in the tub, and just took it out and put it back everytime we needed to use the shower.Despite the size, I think it's the nicest baby tub out there. I'm keeping it for #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eurobath","review":"My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath! It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water. It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty. I love that it holds an older baby too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my TALL baby!","review":"My little boy is 3 months old and has already grown out of two other tubs. FINALLY, I think I've found one that will last more than 6 weeks! This tub is big enough for him to stretch out and kick his legs but the countouring doesn't leave me holding him with one hand while I'm bathing him with the other. He loves his new \\"spa tub\\" and will stay in it as long as I will let him -- my husband and I are a little jealous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bathtub!","review":"I love this bathtub. The only thing I would recommend is that you get some non-slip stick ons on the bottom of the tub to make sure that your baby doesnt slip when he/she tries to stand up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tub for infants and toddlers","review":"Before I gave birth I received a smaller blue infant tub that is generally pretty popular and widely available. I loved it for my newborn, it was small and compact and easy to place over the sink. However by months 3 it was clear the tub was far too small for my son, even though it claimed to be for toddlers as well. So we decided to get this one, it is far superior to the previous one. Though this one does not come with an newborn insert I find the tub itself is so much smoother, softer and more comfortable for the baby then the previous one. The laying down part is still being used at 7.5 months. I think it will probably be used for quite a while, since it is easier to lather him up in that position. The tub itself is large but the bottom is proportioned enough to fit over a nice size sink. I should have purchased it first. I am very happy with it and highly recommend it for your newborn, infant or toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Baby Bath!","review":"My daughter has been happy in this bath since her umbilical cord fell off. I do usually bathe her with one arm around her, but that's more for comfort than necessity. She is secure when I just have a hand on her stomach. The bath sits well on our kitchen counter and I love the soap/accessory dishes in two corners. As other reviewers have said, I usually dump it to get the water out, but when I'm alone needing to care for the baby, I don't really care if it takes longer to drain. This bath gives her room to splash and for toys to float around, but is small enough for me to easily move it. I love this tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son is 2 yrs and 9 mos (and is not a small boy) and we still use this tub!","review":"I recommend this bath tub to all my friends! My son is now 2 years and 9 months (not a small boy ... he wears size 4 - 5 clothes and is very tall) and he still fits comfortable (sitting position) in this tub! My husband and I absolutely love it! The best product ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!!!!","review":"This is the #1 product I recommend to all mothers-to-be! I love this tub. My daughter use this until she was 23 months old. The design is great! I used the one end for infants where they are reclined about 45 degrees until she could sit on her own, and the other end for the next year and a half! It was so convenient to be able to just put it on top of the kitchen sink and bathe her while standing. Great for bad backs! When I was done I would just pull the drain and walk away. The large size didn't bother me because when not in use, I just hung it in the doorway of the basement. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TUB! IT IS WORTH THE FEW EXTRA BUCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Tub Ever!!","review":"This tub is great! Its totally huge. My 3 month old loves to kick and splash in the bath. I started using it at 1 month and bath time has never been better. I used a smaller tub to begin with because this tub seemed alittle to big for a newborn. It has a contoured seat that keeps him from sliding down in the tub. My baby seems very comfortable in this tub, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why buy any other baby tub??","review":"This is the best tub for infant-larger baby. I needed to get a tub for my 2 month old and bought a cheaper one that we used just that one night because my baby was already too big for it. This tub takes up more space but is well worth the extra $10 or so and space... We kept it right in the shower. My baby loved each bath he took in the Eurotub and still loves his bath. The first tub we bought was given to my sister but I am sure she is only going to use it for the first few sponge baths and then want to use my Eurotub!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our twins like it!","review":"I puchased this bath after much research. We first bathed our twins (separately) in a small square tub and they hated it. They like the secure, supported feeling of the molded Eurobath. There's room to stick a large bath seat type sponge under them for more grip (as my husband likes to do) but I bathe our twins right on the plastic and they enjoy their baths both ways. We've been using this product for the last two months since our girls were about 6.5 # each (one month old) and they are now three months old and the tub is growing with them. Seems like a good product for small or large babies. The only downside is this tub is really long and wide. It would be good if you have a whirlpool or large oval shaped tub and like to sit on the edge of the tub facing in (with small children) instead of breaking your knees on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, bulky, and slippery...........","review":"I bought this tub for my daughter (now 1). She is a small, petite girl and I always felt like she was too small for this tub, even now. I stopped using it. It is very big and bulky and the hard plastic is slippery and there is no cushioning for her head. I did like the soap holder and the fact that the tub can be used with older babies as well. But it just did not work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Bath tub!","review":"This is a great little bath tub. We got this when our third child at 4 mos. old got to be too long for the other standard infant tubs. The infant side is great, he is held firmly in place but still has lots of room around his arms and legs to splash around, which he loves to do. This is the first baby I've had who seems to honestly enjoy bathing at such a young age, and I think the ability to splash around (which there isn't space to do in the other tubs) has a lot to do with it. The other side looks plenty room to use for him when he can sit up more securely. I think we'll use this for a couple of years, especially since we don't have a regular bathtub in the kids bathroom, only a big shower. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"Its huge. It doesnt fit on my bath. Its even a tight squeeze inside the tub. When I bathe my baby in the tub it kills my back so I have to put the tub on the floor which is a tight squeeze because my bathroom is so small.The bath does have 2 sides. One end is for smaller babies. They can lay down and cant slip down due to the mid section. The other side is a lttle small.I dont use this bath much because of the size of it. My daughter prefers to beable to swim in the main bathtub or shower with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST TUB","review":"I love this tub. We bought it for our first child back in 2002 and used it until he was [...]. Now I use it for my [...] (I put a padding cushion behind her). She Loves it - kicks, smiles, etc... I highly recommend this tub to every parent out there - yes it's big , SO I store it in the actual bathtub - not a big deal. Worth every penny. It will be used for years!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have tub!!!!!!!!!","review":"My daughter was a 32 week preemie and we tried 4 other bath tubs, but she was always way too floppy in them because they did not recline enough and not enough of her body would be underwater to keep her warm. Yes, this tub is big so we used it in our bathtub, BUT....it has a molded plastic body form that kept [her] in place, kept my hands free and kept her body under the warm water while keeping her head above water and flop-free! We would store the tub in our bathtub and just take it out in the morning for our showers and put the tub back in when we were done. I have wasted thousands on baby products so far and this is only my 1st! Performance wise, this is the best tub on the market....and it is a toddler tub as well - when they learn to sit on their own you just turn them around to the other side without the body form. PERFECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This tub is too big for infants","review":"I bought this tub because I felt my 8 month-old had outgrown his old tub (First Years Infant to Toddler Tub), but THE PRIMO TUB IS TOO BIG. My son moves around a lot in the tub, and everytime he moved he slipped, nearly going under each time. It was scary and I couldn't wait to get him out, and back into his slightly smaller, but much safer, First Year's tub.My son is now 10 mos, and I just tried the Primo tub again, this time with non-slip, suction cup circles that I bought specifically to use with this tub. He did fine as long as he just sat and didn't try to move....that lasted maybe 5 minutes! As soon as he tried to turn around or stand up, he slipped and went under. I was right there, and caught him immediately, but it was scary.I actually still think this could be a good tub, but it's just not for little ones. I'm going to guess and say maybe for 1 year-olds and up. Needless to say, I'm sticking to my trusty blue First Years tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a huge tub this is","review":"I didn't know any better - first time mom - I registered for this huge thing. It's slippery when you put a newborn in it & they don't fit in the seat properly, my son was very uncomfortable and cried. I used a smaller tub now, but will keep this for when he is older and can use the other side of it. For now, I have to figure out where to store the huge thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"I really wanted to love this bath, but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby wasn't really into this tub either.I'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby, I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use, clean and store. My baby liked it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this tub!","review":"We've used this tub since my son was a few weeks old. He's 6 months old now, and we couldn't be happier with it. He is still sitting on the newborn side, since he isn't completely sitting unsupported yet. It definitely keeps him in a safe position, which is a MUST with a wet, wiggly baby! Storage is the only downside to this tub. We keep ours upside down inside the regular bathtub. Upside down so that it dries after his bath, and cause our cat loves to climb in it for some reason. Luckily we have a second bathroom that we don't use for showering, otherwise I don't have a clue where I would keep it everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filty & Used","review":"I ordered this tub new and the tub has water marks and orange mildew on all the edges, under the edge and around the drain plug.

If a plastic tub can't endure shipping, how can it handle a growing toddler? I had a nightmarish experience returning through Marketplace, horrible experience for a cheap overpriced tub. I ended up ordering the hoppop bath, which I love. The PRI tub certainly wasn't worth the $50 I spent. Go to Bed,Bath,& Beyond to see it in person and pay $24.99 if you really want it. I still prefer the hoppop that I purchased through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"After reading such great reviews I registered for this tub. It never worked for my daughter. Everytime I put her in it, she wiggled right out of the holding seat. She was a big baby, so it's not like she was too small for it. I just used the safer bather mat in the regular tub and she loved it. When she was old enough to sit up I tried again, but by this time she preferred splashing in the big tub so I gave mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty useless","review":"A lot of people recommended this to us, and we coughtit, but next time we definitely won't. when your baby isn't sitting yet, you are better off with a smaller tub that has a better surface for the baby to lie on.

Unfortunately we weren't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o. The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub. Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper, not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great.

Now that we are moving to a different town we will have to return the tub so I purchased our own. This tub allows her to be relaxed while fully supported and have FUN during bath time!!! I love that she is able to have a place big enough for her to be reclined in and yet a whole different side when she finally (and hopefully) can sit up! This tub truly is a wonderful product and inexpensive ESPECIALLY for how long you will be able to use it. I would recommend it to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tub for the first two years","review":"I finally purchased the primo tub after buying an infant tub, and infant recliner for the tub, and bath tub seat. This by far is the best product, and will truly get you through the first two years.

Not to mention the savings you get from not having to use so much water. The bath is large, but I put on of those plastic hooks on the wall and that way it as out of my way when I had to shower.

I also found the discussion on wiring dissimilar modules to be misleading and incomplete. My impression of the book is that is was a compilation of notes from several different instructors and probably makes a good textbook/workbook but definitely falls short of being a good stand-alone installation manual.

Probably the worst book I have ever read. So much so, I feel compelled to write about it. The end game was laughable. The characters were not developed beyond descriptions of their physical appearances. The plot was one-dimensional and contained a few pointless asides that led to frustrating dead-ends. That was bad enough, but the worst thing of all was Forsyth's narrative style - akin to a lecture on everything, treating the reader like a complete numpty. Condescending codswallop that left me more angry than disappointed. Imagine a dinner party where a loud know-it-all demands your attention for a few hours without taking a breath.

Unfortunately since \\"The Fist of God\\" his writing skills seem to have diminished. His books are shorter and show considerably less skill in plot development. \\"The Afghan\\" spends and unreaasonable amount of time re-acquainting the reader with Major Martin, wholly wasted. The ending is not one that I would expect from an author of Mr. Forsyth's reputation.Alas, Mr Forsyth is not alone in showing diminishing talents. W.E.B. Griffin's latest book,\\"The Saboteurs\\" was similarly flawed. Maybe the authors are just getting older, and their older readership, myself included, is not as forgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsyth's poorest effort.","review":"Frederick Forsyth has been one of my favorite authors and expected this book to be an update to The Fist Of God. I found the plot to be very scattered and that events that took place to be so far out without contributing to the book. Very little of the book centered on who I thought was the central character, but based on the jumping around, there was no real central character. After so many excellent books, one dud can be forgiven."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feeble Excuse for a Novel","review":"It appears that Mr. Forsyth's renowned skills as a novelist are a thing of the distant past. In this lamentably inadequate effort, a muddled history of recent events in the Middle East is offered as the sole compensation for a thin plot, no character development and no action. Childish prose and sloppy grammar complete this offense against good writing. Mr. Forsyth should be ashamed as should his publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsyth on the Slide","review":"John Forsyth has been one of my favorite fiction writers.

No one discovers he speaks no native Afghan language!Next installment: Black CIA agent who speaks no Russian tricks Russian FSB by impersonating a defected Russian spy. With this author all is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big letdown for Forsyth fans...very average book by Forsyth Standards","review":"Being a great fan of Frederick Forsyth, I was eagerly waiting for the next installment of intrigue and drama from the great one.The Afghan was big disappointment for me. The book falls short on a number of accounts when compared to his previous offerings. Detailed information and complex plot are Forsyth hallmarks. This novel fails in both aspects. Also the story lacks the drive and engrossing quality of his other novels. If you add an ending which peters out rather than reaching the climax then you have a very oridinary novel by Forsyth standards.But then again, the novel is ordinary only by his own standards. If you have not read a Forsyth novel before then it can be a good read. Also the media hype surrounding Al-qaeda and taliban and easy availibility of information about them may have taken out some intrigue from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Below par for Forsyth bur Still Better than the rest,","review":"I am one of the many readers who have avidly gone through every offering of FF. In brief, the Afghan ranks along with the Avenger in terms of intrigue. The final plot revelation is a great letdown. The book overall seems like a rush job. Here's hoping that the master has a few tricks up his sleeve yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Afghan gets to all your senses!","review":"By the time you have finished the first disc of this audio book, which I might add is beautifully narrated by Robert Powell, you can't wait to get through the following eight unabridged CDs. The characters pull you in!Fredrick Forsyth, as usual, has so well researched the facts and background to his story that when you are finished you feel you have completed a short but intensive course in geography, history, language, weapons use, spy technology, maritime lore and the best types of WMD. Don't feel ashamed to take out your National Geographic maps to follow the ever twisting plot. You will have all your senses involved!Other reviewers have explained the story line....so all I can add is that if you like reading (listening) to a story that has a major dose of in-your-face current affairs with a nail-biting edge,the Afgan wins hands down. Now I can only wish somebody buys the rights to make the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Forsyth Great","review":"Excellent reading and highly informative. Ranks with Forsyth's best. It was hard to put this book down. It also gives heightened insight to what lies ahead for the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another exhausted source","review":"This book is clearly \\"made to sell\\" and this is its major flaw. The plot is interesting, albeit not new (planting a mole behind the enemy lines is spycraft standard business). But the way the idea has been taken into words is definitely disappointing. A relevant part of the book seems to be written just to satisfy the publisher, buy forcing the reader through hundred of pages of boring memoirs. The research (one of Mr. Forsyth strongest merit) is definitely not meeting the usual standard. To put it short: this book could have been written in less than a half of its actual page numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid book","review":"Plot is entirely built on preposterous coincidences: the lazy way to write a novel.

I thought that I was purchasing a thriller on a par with Forsyth's other works. No way. What a dud! What I got was more of a history and geography book. Very boring. I was skeptical of his facts regarding the speeds of the QM2 and US nuclear fast attack subs. A quick check on the web showed me that he got this wrong! Can we believe any other facts in this one? Well, at least he got the ragheads right!And then there is the writing style. Some of the sentence structure was clumsy and difficult. What little dialog existed in this one was at a 6'th grade level."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Afgan","review":"This book was a disappointment. If one had read The Fist of God as I have done then half of the book is a repeat of that book and to be quite frank some of it isn't an exact copy of what had previously occurred.

For a writer that produces many and well read best sellers this is simply not up to the mark.The Afghan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short","review":"Excrutiatingly boring: badly written, just facts piled on one another, no protagonist to carry the story and care about. I stopped when it became clear the books was not going to improve. I have better things to do with my time and far better books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Generally, I like Forsyth's work a lot: The Day of the Jackal and The Odessa File are among the greatest thrillers of all time. But I'm afraid I didn't care much for this one. The story isn't very tightly plotted, and so with the lack of character development that has always been a weakness of Forsyth's, the narrative drags along intolerably at times. There is too much coincidence for the plot to be credible, and the wealth of technical details overwhelms rather the educates the reader. Even with all of these weaknesses, this novel is serviceable enough as beach or airplane reading. Still, The Afghan is disappointing when you realize what brilliant books Forsyth turned out in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrator not clear","review":"I would have liked listening to this new Frederick Forsyth novel, however the narrator seems to just whisper the last words of the sentence. He would start out good narrating the sentence and then at the end would 'murmur' his last words. I would have to actually turn up and down the volume just to listen to him.I thought I could listen to the whole CD and probably then get used to him, but I gave up after the first CD and decided to just read the book instead of listening to the audio CD.I wish there would be a more distinct narrator that would be fun to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Forsyth ever.","review":"This book, for me, a major FF fan was a big letdown. Sure the heavy duty tech. stuff is all there but I thought the pace was too leasurely.There is also a sequence of events in the latter part which brings the words ludicrous and ridiculous to mind, almost as if he were being paid by the word.Still, he has written some great stories and one clunker does not a career break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have always been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth and have enjoyed his previous books immensely. He must have lost his writing ability or his mind because this book is unreadable. It does appear to reflect some amount of research but reads more like a report than a novel. It has no plot that you can get involved in and the character development is minimal. It reads like the first book written by a recent college graduate who failed all of his writing classes. It is downright awful. Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story with great detail but a number of errors","review":"I have lived in Pakistan and Afghanistan and hence found Forsyth's description of these countries very accurate. However, two errors were found:a) Malaysian Airlines is NOT a dry airlineb) BA no longer flies direct London to Kuala Lumpur due to some disputes (since The Afghan is based on a timeline somewhere in Sept 06, this point is relevant)Otherwise, I found the book enjoyable, though the ending was a disappointment and the secret service would never allow the US president to host the G8 summit on a cruise ship - too many variables that can go wrong with uncontrollable consequences.Otherwise, great story, frightening plot (hopefully AQ is not that well organised globally), definitely plausible (especially with the sleepers who are amongst us and not the wild eyed extremists who are easy to spot and not that intellectually smart anyway).I think this will be a Hollywood blockbuster...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding prior fame to write a steaming pile","review":"I have enjoyed many of Forsyth's prior books, but this one was terrible. The finale is worse than I could have imagined, making me wonder why I wasted time reading the book at all. It's not even really clear what the finale is, except that it's over in a flash. If fact it becomes entirely clear that the author must have envisioned a type of terrorist attack and then scrambled to come up with an explanation how that attact might be thwarted and why his hero was there at the right place and the right time; although there is no explanation why the terrorists themselves actually need the hero (in disguise) on their team at all, except that Bin Laden wants him on the team. Um okay, for what? He add NOTHING to the cadre of criminals leading this attack. C'mon, Forsyth, are you kidding me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsythe Drops the ball","review":"\\"Col Mike Martin\\" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic.........The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much.

Neither is the case here. The sections on how NSA and GCHQ do their jobs are laughable and could have been improved with a little checking on Google. As mentioned in other reviews there's probably a 100 pages or so of filler. I'm two-thirds of the way through and doubt I'll even bother finishing. And as is the case with many books today, the editing is slipshod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read from the master of the thriller","review":"There is no doubt, Forsythe is a master of the thriller, with his \\"Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"The Odessa File,\\" some of my favorites of all times. In \\"The Afghan,\\" he deftly blends fiction with real facts and real people but the characters could be more memorable. I recently read a credible international suspense, \\"Facing Justice, by new comers Diane and David Munson, and found the characters genuine and believable by camparism. Still, Forsyth's newest is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has lost it completely","review":"Unbelievably bad. I mean, I was stunned. The Day of the Jackal and the Odessa File are two of the greatest, most expertly plotted suspense thrillers EVER. I hadn't read the guy for 25 years and thought I'd try his latest. I almost didn't even finish it. Thin characters, a ridiculous plot - the whole book is very short and lazy-feeling. He used to be known for the density of his prose.But the worst part was the use of bad tough-guy cliches that sound like a freakin' Ford Truck commercial (\\"7500 foot-pounds of titanium-jacketed unpleasantness\\"...that sort of thing). Cliched, lazy, awful - I wanted that 4 hours of my life back (his books used to take a lot longer).Time to retire, Fred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and topical thriller","review":"Forsyth weaves actual events and people throughout this novel, placing his two main characters throughout various conflicts in recent history. It comes dangerously close to a \\"Forrest Gump\\" sequence but in the end, most of these chance meetings do play a significant role as the plot unfolds.The characters are developed mainly by their actions with little, if any, exploration into their thoughts or motives. Consequently, the book moves along at a good clip and the action is intriguing enough that it doesn't really matter. The idealogies of the players in the \\"War on Terror\\" are published enough elsewhere and fresh enough in the headlines that the reader may just follow the action.If I were to nitpick, there are some worn plot devices used: experts brought in to brief us on history, a \\"deus ex machina\\" moment for one of the main characters, but really, I ate it all up. It was a gripping, intriguing thriller and I'm likely to read more from Frederick Forsyth as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I love political thrillers. But this one is unbelievably badly written. The intro is long and boring - or the subject is interesting, but it's just factual notes without anything to carry it.

It is a history book, devoid of interesting characters and there is very little dialogue..If I had wanted non fiction that would be one thing, but as a novel, I am so disappointed. Boring.... Please Mr.Forsyth, go back to your old dynamic style. I am sorry I bought it and would not have wasted my time taking it out of a library. Tut Tut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A taut thriller","review":"Frederick Forsyth, master of the cold war novel, now turns his talents to terrorism and Al-Qaeda. Forsyth has done his research and is familiar with the operations and strategies of terrorists as uncovered by Western intelligence networks. In this book he also turns to an old English historic and literary tradition of Englishmen passing themselves of as Easterners. At first glance it may seem improbable that an English colonel could pass for an Afghan, yet the true life exploits of T. E. Lawrence (of Arabia) and before him Richard Burton seem unlikely also. Then too consider such classic books as Beau Geste and its sequels. The plot revolves around an ambitious Al-Qaeda plan to stage a sequel to 9/11. A joint British-American operation is mounted to infiltrate the organization and disrupt the plot. The Afghan is a gripping read, probably the best of the post-9/11 novels. It provides a fascinating window into the operations of Middle Eastern terrorist organizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"Wow.

Tom Selleck has this character nailed down perfectly, and the writing is top notch, with great characters that you really care about, and plot twists that will knock you out!The cinematography effectively captures the dark mood and the seaside location is perfect. The producers have a HUGE winner here, far and away the best cop shows available on DVD, right up there with the phenomenally successful BBC detective series \\"A Touch of Frost\\", which I consider to be the best drama collection of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death in Paradise","review":"The story has a cold but strong feeling to Jesse.

I don't think I'll be hanging onto this for too long because of it. Also, it doesn't actually bring you directly to your address... if you want to go to 59 Main St, it will bring you to a range of addresses, like 1-400 Main St. It also doesn't seem to be all that accurate, almost like the map takes a little while to update itself to where you are. I'm considering getting rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Ready for Prime Time","review":"I purchased this GPS because I use other Uniden products and at the time the price was attractive. 2-stars for a decent screen, but I've found more cons than pros.Pros - Bright, large, easy to read screen.Cons - Directions only guide you to a block (rather than specific address).Can zoom out only to 8 miles (you can't get a look at your progress on longer trips).Poor speaker which is hard to hear in some cars.Takes much longer to lock on satellites than Garmins we use at work.If Uniden wants to continue in the GPS market, they have some work to do. For a similar price, you can find much better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I couldn't find any of the places of interests that I need such as parks and schools. This unit took longer to get a lock on the satellites than my previous GPS unit, the ViaMichelin X-930. The turn signal lights are VERY DIM--virtually invisible during the day time. The design is very ugly like a brick. The antenna must be opened in order to have any signal. If you have a PDA, use your PDA with a BlueTooth receiver and get Mapopolis-BEST navigator I've ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Don't Buy","review":"Please save your money. Not only is this unit innacurate, it announces your arrival as much a block away, but their maps and data bases are so out of date that it shows restaurants in our area that have been closed longer than we have lived here.

Don't be fooled by the owners manual, it states that Map updates are available, for a cost on their website. Total lie. Their are no links or info concerning updates.

If it ever locks up, which reading many GPS unit reviews seems some what common, how would you reset this unit? I believe this case is made by Samsung, I don't think Samsung includes reset ability.

I consider her songwriting to be second to none. Her album Porcelain is one of the most sublime pop albums ever crafted IMHO. Unfortunately, this live recording does not hold up. The most disappointing aspect of all unfortunately is Julia's voice. There are serious pitch problems on almost every song on this album. If it were simply an occasional slip up it would not bother me. I found this to be very distracting from the overall enjoyment of the music. The performances are also not very inspiring. I probably will not be listening to this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Age of Gaming Begins Anew!","review":"I have been in this hobby for over a decade. I began with AD&D; and played it for most of my time gaming. I always liked how the older rules were so friendly to what the players wanted.Unfortunately current editions of certain games are not that way anymore and I thought the older style would slip away. I'm glad I was wrong.Castles and Crusades uses the best parts of the OGL stripping the D&D; SRD to it's core and rebuilding it to be like a RPG should be. Fast, exciting and above all fun.At 128 pages it may not seem like much but I had the rules down in one evening. I also taught my nephew the game in 20 minutes. It is of note that he has limited gaming experience.Above all else C&C; is easily compatable with older AD&D; editions as well as the new editions making it the most versitle game in existance.This is the best $20 you'll ever spend on a gaming product!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable mind candy","review":"I was thoroughly delighted and entertained by this novel. I've only read one other Bradley romance and don't remember much, other than that I was impressed that her heroine was more than just a brainless ninny.I found the character of Willa to be so utterly enchanting. I laughed out loud many, many times while reading this novel. It was the perfect companion while stuck at home, ill in bed...even if the laughing out loud did sometimes bring on a coughing fit. While the novel's most basic plot (wounded man healed by love of a good woman) is pretty common, I find that some type of barebones plot is shared by almost all romances (perhaps one of the reasons i don't read them so much). However, i thought Bradley's dialogue was thoroughly engaging, and her characters were very amusing. Highly enjoyable mind candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was determined not to like this book.....................","review":"because it seemed like a run of the mill regency. You know, the undercover patriot trying to protect the king, etc...and the ditzy miss. Well, the story isn't unique BUT the dialogue is the best I've read in a long time. It is very witty!! Willa, our orphaned miss, is really quick on the uptake. Not so usual in the 18th century. It compensated for any story flaws I contemplated. For a fun read, likeable characters, and many smiles, take a read. It's a keeper just for the writing.

So without that, I have to give this book 4 & 1/2 - 5 stars. I have long waited for Lord Reardon's story, and I was not disappointed -- a fact for which I am exceedingly glad after the low point of The Charmer.Reardon (Nathaniel) and Willa are terrific individually and awesome together. The way their relationship started had me wondering, but Bradley pulled it out beautifully. Wit, plenty of emotion, exquisite romance, very sensual love scenes, and thrilling intrigue combine to make this book a splendid way to continue the characters and world begun with the Liars Club series and to initiate the Royal Four series. I am thrilled that Ethan Damont (the best character from The Charmer) is up in the next book.So glad I bought this book. Happy reader, here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gallantry at its best","review":"This novel is one in a series entitled \\"The Liar's Club\\", which highlights a group of renegades protecting the Crown. Celeste Bradley's TO WED A SCANDALOUS SPY is writing at its best. With this non-conventional setting, Ms. Bradley takes us back to a time when chivalry was standard.

I could not put the book down until I read it completely. I felt like I was there again smelling the jungle, hearing the sounds of war. This is the best book on the real accounts of the war in VietNam as fought by the Mobile guerilla force of the US Army Special Forces. It makes a man proud to know that he was also part of this elite unit. Keep up the good work, Donahue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I read this book, although under a different title, the one that I read was called 'No Greater Love' but it is the same story. This book is very exciting and riveting, and it also tells of the unquestionable heroic actions of the men who foght for this force, both U.S. and foreign. One reviewer made the mistake of saying that this was the only force to use guerilla tactics in Vietnam, this is not true. The LRRPs (long range recon patrols) used gurilla tactics and went out with only usually a six man team. Although their main goal was recon, they very often ended up ambushing the enemy, and usually came out on top. I think though that anyone who reads this book will agree that these men deserve our highest respect and that we thank them for their brave service. If you havent read this book, I wouls suggest buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forbidden Zone has been penetrated.","review":"This is one of the most exciting books that I've read about the war in Vietnam.

This book is going into my permanent collection along with Blackjack-33 and Blackjack-34.

Some have lived on a farm all their lives, others have left jobs in the cities to take on the rigours of farming. These women are not wimps. They are hard working, self-reliant, single minded and full of passion for the farms they work....endless work.The author's style is both interesting and comelling. This is a non-fiction page turner.

The book tries to center on Illinois (home of the world's busiest airport for 70 years), but it does go into broader regions (Octave Chanute in Indiana, Lindbergh, the Wrights, etc.)This is a scholarly work and many will not find it an easy read. However, the book is very well organized and has a number of photo sections that help illustrate this fascinating topic.I recommend this book for serious history fans, and I recommend Chicago's Midway Airport, The First 75 Years by Christopher Lynch for the nostalgic reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note that it's not long enough for many uses","review":"Traditional hard disks have 3 screw holes on each side.

I could only screw in 2 of the 4 screws--the 2 closest to the HDD connectors, not the far ones because they don't line up!

I tried to read this book for amusement but found that the silliness of the content was upstaged by the jaw-droppingly bad writing. Lindsey and/or Carlson use quoted material to uphold their arguments but don't bother to tell the reader where the quote originated. Conversely, they occasionally attribute quotes to obscure names as though they were introduced somewhere in the paragraph or chapter when they are in fact no more than just names. Needless to say there are no footnotes. The writing has a typical tone of know-it-all authority allowing the writers to conveniently state their personal opinions as if they were truth.If Satan really was \\"Alive and Well on Planet Earth\\" he'd get someone to write a better book about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satan rules,Hal...","review":"Having finished my daily Black Mass I'm now turning over to review this very important book:indeed one must agree with the author,the'occult'is very,very dangerous for 'Christians'-by 'occult'here I mean reason,intelligence,knowledge.Those who thought that Satan might be extinct can find strong evidence to the contrary here.All in all,this must be one of the funniest books of the century!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What I find so amusing...","review":"... is the fact that this book is often listed under the \\"occult\\" section.

I purchased this (and paid a premium) to have the Stokke-brand accessory with the expectation it would complement my existing Stokke crib and mattress set. I can't imagine why, but the bumper didn't fit the Stokke mattress. The bumper has straps that must go under the mattress, but they're too short to allow the bumper to sit on top of the mattress. As a result, the bumper has to squeeze between the mattress and crib sides making it bunch up. In addition, the bumper is too short to tie on the top of the rails and it's a very soft material, so it slides down and bags on top of the mattress, providing no buffer for the crib rails. The color and fabric are both classic and lovely, but this bumper just doesn't function as well as others I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my grandson","review":"I bought this as a present for my Grandson.

I hope that they give Quinn and Robin more of a part in the series - I love the way they were in Crazy Hot. I also hope that Superman and Kat have a part in the stories too.

It's something of a thriller but is a pale, pale shadow of a Suzanne Brockman. A romance? Well, everybody falls in love (and in bed) at first sight, with pages and pages of not terribly romantic but quite graphic sexual content. Literature? Only if you think the complete sentence should be banned from books. A mystery? Supposedly, but it is only accomplished by using a character's nickname up until the denouement.This book is crazy all right, a crazy hodge-podge of styles and genres. Only read it because someone in a book club suggested it. I'll never take a suggestion from that person again. This book is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of this series..","review":"partly because the 2 main characters have a history to build on. Janzen's books seem to be mostly about spying and action without alot of romance. There is a short relationship and sex but mostly it's on the fly while they try to survive and figure out what's going on. Not my favorite story line. Christian is a great hero and while the heroine Kat has made some mistakes she comes on strong at the end. She and Christian are smart caring people who have to deal with her powerfull bully of a mother and bad guys who are out to get them both over events that happened 13 years ago.

I came back to my office after a weekend only to find out the router had lost my internet connection three hours after I left on Friday night, and that was the last straw.

I'd complain about that problem a little more if I hadn't bought it dirt cheap (with rebate).There doesn't seem to be any commonality to the lock-ups -- they just happen from time to time. The built-in router utility reports that there is not a newer firmware update available.The hard reset requires unplugging the power cord or depressing a tiny recessed button at the back of the unit, so you'll need to keep the router in an easy access location (assuming you have the same problem)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin F5D5231-4 4-Port Cable/DSL Router","review":"This product was faulty from the box.

It has built in DCHP or you can manually address it.

For those of you who have PPPoE networks, this router works indeed very well (INSTALL INCLUDED). Get as fast as you can to the web interface and drive things from there--security, firmware updates, monitoring, etc. And now, a word of caution: do not trust 100% the built-in firewall. There have indeed been 5 or 6 attacks, over 9 months of use, detected by the software firewall I kept. So, to address this issue, keep all firewalls running and up to date.

After only a month, the lip had worn so much that I couldn't even put it back on. I had to empty this thing every 2 to 3 days.

Diaper pails have to be changed very regularly. The drawback for me was buying the special bags (which can be pricey) and emptying the contraption. Each time you put in a diaper, you twist the top and the diaper becomes a link in the plastic bag (like sausages in a link). When it is full, you open the bottom and remove the chain of diapers. The bag often becomes unraveled and you see how much more bag space you could have used if you just used a regular diaper pail. This was trendy in the 90's but impractical now.

You are forced to buy their refills. The thing that sold me on this product was the odorless advertising. Not true. With lysol, stick ups, and all, this thing still stunk.

While I was breastfeeding it worked great because the diapers were not smelly. Once my baby was on food, the diapers were smelly and I found my Diaper Genie not holding in the odors. I would walk in my baby's room and think he had a dirty diaper, when in fact it was the Diaper Genie. I don't have a problem with the refills and emptying - JUST THE ODOR! I would not recommend this to anyone and now have to find an alternative. Several co-workers told me they had the same problem and got rid of theirs, too. I tried baking soda and Lysol, but the odor will not go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The PITS!","review":"I registered for one of these and got it as a shower gift. While it provides a place to place soiled pampers, it doesn't do much more. Changing the bags can be quite an event. Furthermore, and most importantly, IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT CONTAIN ODOR!! No amount of bleach will take the odor away, and I cleaned it every week. My daughter's bedroom consistently wreaked, especially on warmer days. It is just awful. I had to leave it on the porch and take the pampers out as I changed her...what's the point in having it? I am going to try the Diaper Champ and hope I have better luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a shot!!!","review":"I tried this product based on the convincing positive reviews. I am very disappointed. This thing is so hard to operate one-handed. I don't like to leave the baby on the changing table for even a second, and with this device you have to have both hands to push diaper in, and then twist. I just set the diaper half way in now & hope that I remember to push it through, and twist it when I have a spare minute, but it's a pain. I know a bunch of other mothers who also have used the genie, and were not impressed. I wish I would have taken their advice in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I had this diaper genie and after the first use i got rid of it,What a pain it was to dispose of the dirty diapers. I found it much easier to just take dirty diapers and wrap them in plastic grocery bags and dispose of them in my outside trash. I am now expecting my 2nd child and have never thought about buying another diaper genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"From good to awful!!!","review":"We really liked the diaper genie at first. It did a great job of sealing odors out . . . until the baby started eating solid foods. Now I have to open the windows every day to air out his room. The odor is so strong that it makes us gag - and we're USED to the smell!! No, we definitely would have gone with another brand if we had known this. Don't be fooled by the fact that the genie is such a popular product. They sell extra thick and scented bags for the stronger-smelling toddler's diapers, but it DOES NOT WORK and is more expensive. Once the baby starts eating solids, it's not much better than the old-fashioned open diaper pail. The genie is also too short to be convenient, unless you put it on a box. You cannot empty with one hand (while holding baby in the other)."},{"rating":"1","title":"We barely even use it","review":"I got the diaper genie at my baby shower. I thought it was a great idea. But after the few refills that we got at the shower we never bought anymore, I just think its kinda silly to have go buy somthing to throw a dirty diaper away. So we just use our regualar trash can and we have no odor problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work","review":"I received this as a shower gift but when the time came to use it, it didn't work like they say is does. It doesn't start to twist the diapers until there is enough diapers in it to reach the bottom. Everytime you put another diaper in, the one before it untwists and they fall together. So your \\"sausage\\" has one huge link and several small links. I went to another type of diaper pail and gave mine to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste of Time and Money","review":"We thought this would be a great item to have. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Our biggest problem was that we couldn't get the bags installed correctly. Everytime we put in a dirty diaper, closed the lid, and turned the knob, it didn't work. It would cut through the bag instead of twisting it. My husband got so frustrated with it, he refused to use it. Plus, when you calculate how many dirty diapers a baby has in a day (especially a newborn), a 25 count refill really isn't economical for people who are on a tight budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother buying this!","review":"I absolutely hated the Diaper Genie. Not only was it expensive, but it was difficult to put those refill bags in, and every time I went to put a diaper in it I had to twist and turn it. Not to mention how awful it was to empty the thing. The smell nearly knocked me over. I don't recommend anyone to buy this. Its easier to just put the diaper in a bag and throw it outside in the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is sitting out on our backyard deck!","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews - works until you introduce food. Diaper Genie does not seal out the odors! And once this thing gets a dirty diaper placed in it - watch out everytime you open it - what a stink!! I have sprayed it with Lysol, used Clorox wipes, Febreeze, etc. nothing makes this thing smell better. My husband even left it outside to air out for several days. Didn't help at all. I can't understand why everyone is so crazy about Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Day Care Teacher","review":"I was a day care teacher for well over two years in the infant room.

Use one of the other disposal systems on the market. The capacity is small (esp. when diapers are bigger with your childs age). The wide mouth d.g. is too complicated to change refills and even the basic \\"twistaway\\" concept when disposing of diapers is too complicated for babysitters (the d.g. usually ends up in shambles). The razor to cut away the liner when emptying dulls over time too, so you end up getting out the scissors to cut out the liner. Smell is a problem too, even w/ the new (expensive) toddler liners. Thumbs down on the DG."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I love my diaper genie. I have two of them in my house one in each of my girls bedrooms. I have a 2 year and a 6 month old in the house and no diaper oder. I am now using the toddler refills for my oldest and it works great. It is thicker to hold in the really bad smelling toddler diapers. Just a tip to cut down on the oder when you change the refill is to spray it with a deoderizer everytime you change it. I found it really makes a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello?!?!","review":"I got the Diaper Genie at my shower and I only got online (to see if there were any sales) so I could get another one. We have two floors to our home and it would be more convenient for us to have one on both. ANYWAY, reading the bad reviews made me laugh. In my opinion, it seems obvious that they were using it incorrectly. The only draw back I had with it is that the hooks (to cut the bag when you need to empty it) did not work. We have to use scissors. Other than that I love it! There is no smell and I only have to change it once every 5 or 6 days. I'd like to ask Sam Tuckers Mom and Dad how often they changed Sam's diaper. I find it impossible to be dissapointed with it. Sure there is a limit, but come on and get real. It isn't a hole that goes to China. You do have to empty it. If you use this product the correct way (how could you not?!?!) it does not smell and is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diaper Genie Rocks!","review":"I LOVE my diaper genie! I heard a lot of bad things about it when I was pregnant and it made me sceptical, but I still wanted one anyway. I have been using it for over 6 months and still love it. It's very convenient and easy to use. You just need to read the instructions carefully and you're all set. It only needs to be emptied once or twice a week and it masks any stinky odors!Don't listen to negative words about the Diaper Genie, it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for infant diapers","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. I have heard all the bad reviews but thought maybe it was the people using it, well I guess I am one of the people using it because I think it stinks. It may be okay for the larger diapers but for the infant diapers it does not hold them right you have to push it down and then everytime I twist the cap it rips and I have to start all over. At first I thought maybe my husband didn't put it together correctly but after taking it out and putting it back together 3 times I figure if it is that hard to change each refill it is not worth my time. With a 3 week old I can't be bothered with anything that takes that much effort to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work!!!","review":"Being a first time mom I got exited and registered for alot of things. Diaper Genie shouldn't have been on my list!!!It really doesn't make it easy, I rather use a regular trash can!!! Overall I wouldn't spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can' t live without this!","review":"This is great! I read great reviews and decided to register for this despite the cost, and the need for \\"diaper genie refills\\". It's actually not that expensive. One refill holds about 2-3 kitchen trashbags full, so it's really not that expensive. It's great to have each diaper wrapped individually too, it really holds the smell. I bought a second one to keep one downstairs. I couldn't live without them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So annoying","review":"This thing is sooo annoying, it took us forever to figure it out and it fills up in a second, and our baby is only 5 weeks old. I can't even begin to imagine how quickly it will fill up when the diapers start getting bigger. I'd go with something simpler and we will probably end up getting something different soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this....","review":"We got this for our shower and we didn't like how it worked. The first couple of dipers would \\"un wrap\\" because there is nothing to keep the \\"spin\\" wrapped. It would unwind itself and it caused too many problems. It still had the smell at the end of the day. We returned it and went with the Diaper Champ. So much better and no \\"refills\\" to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product","review":"I can't believe anyone can have a bad review about this product. It is sooooooo simple to use. Just lift lid, put diper in until it reaches the plastics thingis and twist a few times. It takes all of 5 seconds. The liners are sented and I've never had any smell from it. Even when we empty it. Our son is 10 weeks old and we're still on the first refil. It's actually kind of cute when you empty it and all the sausage links fall out. Serously, this is a great product and I think if your having a problem with it you might just not know how to use it. Find someone who does, because you won't know what you did without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total 'waste' of money","review":"Busy moms think of the time used to assemble this product, empty it and refill it.

What would we have done without it? There is absolutely no smell -- and isn't that the purpose of a product such as this. Don't look elsewhere - get this product, it will make your life much easier!

Like others have experienced, it contained the smell until my little one started to eat solids. It takes 2 hands to use, which can be a problem when you are changing your child and they have a really messy diaper that you need to dispose of immediately. I also got tired of spending $5 on the refills, this is definitely where Playtex is making their money, it is a racket!I purchased the Diaper Champ and have been very happy with it, the smell has been 100% contained. It is easy to use, especially one handed. If you are considering buying The Diaper Genie please read the rest of the reviews, as I am not the only one who feels this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not work for me either!!","review":"Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle! Has to be emptied almost daily!","review":"This is one of the worst things that I have ever bought. This diaper pail holds VERY few diapers. I find that I have to empty it out every two days. This is VERY ANNOYING as it is a bit of an ordeal to change the bag. Enough so that I end up just throwing the diapers in the normal trash becuase I am so sick of changing the diaper genie that is always full.As far as problems operating it, if you read the instructions, then it is not hard to figure out, but the bottom line is that this thing is more trouble than it is worth. If they made one 4 times the size, then maybe I would be interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for another!","review":"I registered for the diaper Genie when my daughter was born. I did not know of any other product out there. It is now been 6 mos and I am ready for a new product!! The diaper Genie is very stinky esp when the baby starts solids. You can never get rid of the odor. The darn thing broke the first time we tried to use it!! It has these clamps that hold the diaper in place so one can twist it. Well now I've got 2 missing (I think they fell out when it was being emptied). Needless to say mine doesn't make a poopie sausage anymore. Also, it really doesn't hold as many as I thought it would. I definately think there are better products out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for under 12 months","review":"I thought that the diaper genie was the greatest to begin with. Poopie sausages, great. Now that my daughter is 16 months old the diaper genie is going to be replaced with something, anything would be better. I change the bag about every other day and let it sit outside opened for about 4 hours every week and wash /lysol every time I change take a \\"poopie sausage\\" out and yep, it still smells every time I open the lid. I spray lysol on top of the closed bags!!! Believe me, I have tried everything to make this work. For the first 12 months it wonderful, now it just stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!!","review":"My husband and I LOVE the Diaper Genie! My son is 7 months old and has been on solids for 4 months now. The Stage 2 refills really work! I keep the Diaper Genie in his bedroom and there is NO SMELL! It is also really simple to use. If you can read and follow directions, you will have no problem. Also, washing it once a month or so really helps. The other disposal systems out there only work until a baby eats solids....the Diaper Genie is the only one that continues to work. I love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Practical for busy family","review":"I bought the diaper genie for my first child and with a second on the way, I am not going back to it. You have to open up the bottom of the pail to get the trail of individually wrapped diapers out of the pail. We ended up putting one of our own garbage bags in the diaper genie along with the special diaper genie bags (that are not cheap on their own) so that we could carry the fifteen or so diapers out to the trash can.The order was minimized from the regular trash can that we were using before, but it was definatly not worth the hassle or price of the special bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"[BAD]Big Time","review":"Waste of money, cause you gotta keep buying the refills for it, and there's still some smell.

From the moment we got it home, it was a pain! The refills are difficult and expensive.

I have now moved on to better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the Diaper Champ Instead.......trust me!!","review":"This product is a big waste of money and time! It is so messy and hard to handle. You practically have to put your whole arm inside the thing to get the diaper in far enough. When your ready to empty it you can never get the stupid cutter to work right. Not to mention the constant odor! I learned the hard way about the Diaper Genie. We eventually started just throwing the diapers in the trash. I would definitely recommend the Diaper Champ now that I am about to have my second child. There are no expensive refills to buy and it only takes one hand to operate. Definitely a much better product than the Diaper Genie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no more smell.......","review":"I have used this product for my past 2 children and it is great...... there is no smell \\"leakage\\" into the room and the genie is really easy to use..... i find that when your the kids get about 2 it doesnt work so well anymore because the diapers are a bit large for it.... but i have tried all the other products like this and this one works the best....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky winky","review":"I bought this diaper genie about 18 months ago for my home daycare. It took me about a month to figure out how to totally use the thing( using and empting and refilling). I hate buying those darn refills all the time the money adds up quick. But, it still stunk! I would have to empty it about every other day. It is a pain to hold the full diaper genie up over the garbage bag and try to ring the opening with 20 soiled heavy diapers falling out of the bottom. Also I noticed that there was also maget flies in some of the closed off diaper. I have had the thing outside airing out more than I have been able to use it. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype!","review":"Take heed of all the negative reviews here. I wish I had! This poorly engineered product is difficult to assemble and use. The resulting plastic \\"snake\\" when the cartridge is full is unwieldy and hard to dispose of. It took me a long time to figure out how to use the Diaper Genie, and even longer to figure out how to change the special cartridge. The final straw was when the cartridge ran out without warning (I wish the last couple feet of plastic were another color or something), leaving me with a mess to clean up.Skip the Genie, and buy the Diaper Champ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed","review":"I'm surprised this product is still so popular! All of my friends have one so my husband and I were going to get one for home. But after reading reviews on the diaper champ we went with that one instead, and are we glad! My mother bought the diaper genie so we use it when visiting and hate it. It does control the smell but figuring out how to use it, especially in the middle of the night, takes a degree in engineering. Using the refills and emptying the pail is difficult. Plus, why would you want the added expense of buying refill bags. The diaper champ at our house is far superior. Just use any bag you have, it holds twice as many diapers, and there is no smell at all. The next time we visit my mom we're bringing her a diaper champ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Stinks!","review":"We used the Diaper Genie with my daughter and her room constantly smelled like a Port-o-let. It was awful! When I found out I was pregnant again and would have two babies in diapers, we purchased the Diaper Genie II system. I love it! With more than twice the diapers, it contains the odors better, guests can figure it out, and since there is no twisting, the cartridge refill lasts much, much longer! The extra $10 you spend on the Diaper Genie II will be saved in cartridge refills in no time! I highly recommend the Diaper Genie II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well if you follow directions","review":"This product has done well for me. I have a two-month-old daughter. The refills are expensive but they last a long time. I empty this two or three times a week. Sometimes I notice an odor. That's because my husband won't use it properly. If you use this, you have to do a few things to prevent odor:- Always twist after you put a diaper in, don't leave it sitting in top- Empty it promptly as soon as you have to push to get a diaper in- For the first few diapers, position them carefully and give them some extra twists- Always give enough twists, one little turn won't be enough- Keep the lid closedIf you (or your spouse) can't use the thing properly all the time you may want to consider something a little more forgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie","review":"At first the diaper genie was great, but after about a month it started to stink when anyone would open it up, even with cleaning once a week or every time I emptied it. And just getting it started was a pain because you would have to wait to get 4 or 5 diapers in it before it would start twisting right. Also the bottom wouldn't stay closed, everytime I moved it or picked it up it would open and all the diapers would tumble out. Overall I wouldn't recomend it to anyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is great!","review":"My daughter is 3 & 1/2, now, and obviously doesn't use the diaper genie right now, but I put it away, and now I have a baby on the way to use it. I was reading the reviews for the diaper champ and I didn't understand all the bad things that were said about the diaper genie. I loved my genie. No smell, was easy to change, and I NEVER had poop or pee leak out when I put a diaper in it. The Genie is a great product. I never had any bad smells coming out of it. As long as you twisted it after you put a diaper in, there was no smell. Changing the refills is a breeze, and they last a long time. Not that expensive for as long as they lasted me. I do agree with one thing said, I did have to change it frequently, probably every 5-7 days depending, but why would you want poopie diapers sitting in there for any longer anyways?

What a waste of money! It took a while to figure our how to put it together, (as my husband is wrapped in the plastic) and the instructions were not clear. Within the week we had the boys, the diaper genie went out the door. We bought the biggest lifesaver for any new mom...The Dekor Plus. It holds a ton of diapers,(especially for twins) and you can also use it later as a trash can. The liners are a little pricy, but they last forever! I have only gone through one box refill since the birth of my sons. (they are almost 5 months)We only have to empty the pail 2-3 times a week. Not bad for double the diaper duty. And the smell? What smell? This pail is the way to go! New moms: don't even bother with the Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just plain stinky","review":"At first I insisted we buy one of these to do the obvious.. eliminate diaper stink! But after putting it together, putting in a refill and dealing with nasty juices and MAGGOTS I wished I would have listened to my husband. I don't recommend anyone waste their time OR money on this thing. Instead go to your local Wal-Mart and buy the diaper pail they have made by Cosco it's only $8.95. It has a foot pedal (excellent for when your holding baby) and you can use regular grocery or small garbage bags in it. Best of all... IT DOESN'T SMELL. We clean ours out 2 times a week (when the bag gets full). Our son's diapers aren't small either, he wears a size 5 and LOVES spicy food (hint).

After about 3 months, the pail began to stink around the clock, even though I cleaned and disinfected it. As the diapers got bigger, changing the liner became a constant chore. I replaced the Genie with a plain old-fashioned diaper pail. Sure, I have to take out the diapers daily, but there is no stench, no two-handed twisting, and no expensive liners to buy. The use of this product was so short-lived that it simply was not worth the money. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Smells","review":"Confused on why this product is so highly recommended.

It started to work fine for about a week or so. When I tried to put the diaper in the Genie it was very tight and when I tried to turn the top it would be hard. Everything would go good until, I was probably at the 10th or so diaper, then it just wouldn't work right after that. On several occasions my husband would say he fixed it, but the same problem would happen again. Now maybe we just had it all wrong, but I really don't think so. I don't recommend the Diaper Genie.

Well, I've been using it for 10 months now and I wish I would have gotten a regular diaper pale. The Genie stinks- literally!! No matter how many times I clean it, it still stinks and my son's nursery always has the faint odor of dirty diapers, and it gets especially strong when his bedroom door is closed for awhile. And, when I open the lid to put another diaper in it- the smell just comes right out.Also, changing the refill and emptying it are a pain- not difficult, just another chore to do. I would just prefer to pull out a garbage bag and tie it off than go through the hassel of the Genie. Plus, the refills don't last as long as I thought the would, and the price adds up after awhile (at $5.00 each)- I think garbage bags are much cheaper.

The diaper genie was great once I figured out how to reload it and until my son started on solids. Now, when I open the door to my son's room after his nap, I can't tell if it's the diaper pail or my son that needs changing. I'm giving up on buying the expensive refills and going back to my old method of wrapping the stinky ones in a plastic bag and immediately taking them outside to the trash.

It is such a waste of money! It is such a hassle to empty as well. Sometimes the bags inside don't even twist right then it smells more. The whole unit becomes really heavy too. I regret ever buying it! Would not recommend to other parents!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist and Twist This is Crap","review":"I for one hate this thing.

I recieved one from My husbands grandmother. It was virtually impossable to put in the refills, and get it working. As far as capacity goes, It would not hold very much, Expecially since I had 3 in diapers filling this thing up!It was very easy to dispose of.. I liked that they were individually wrapped, but honestly, It did not help the smell. I used an old fashioned diaper pail, and when I emptied that out, the smell was HORRID. Changing out the diaper genie.. the smell was the exact same. The only thing it cut down on, as far as smell, is you cannot smell it if it is closed. But the second you open it...

For the last year and a half... it has been sitting in our hallway, collecting dust, and we still have 2 in diapers..I would not recommend this pr"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy days are here!","review":"We bought a diaper Genie before my son was born.

It is also my husband's favorite baby care invention. We have had absolutely no problems \\"operating\\" the genie - it is very simple and reliable to use. I can even manage with one hand (the other holding the baby). We have also had up to 18 diapers in the genie with no odor problems (even after starting solids). As for the cost, the refills to go on sale regularly at Target, Walmart, etc. We stock up then.

What a big waste of money. Do yourself a favor buy a cheap trash can and put a bunch of grocery bags near it. When you have a poopy diaper take it to the outside trash & save yourself the hassle. How gross is this sausage link of poop diapers anyway? Its nasty to not empty the cans at least once a day anyways. Wish I knew some of these people who rave about this waste of money, because like an idiot I registered for 5 refills & all 5 are stacked right next to this useless genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face It, This Product is Designed to Sell Bag Inserts","review":"It's the age-old \\"sell the razor cheap and the blades at a premium\\" strategy. Moreover, it's ridiculously over-designed.

I've found...that the first diaper does not wrap up like it's supposed to and the smell knocks you back every time you open the lid.

I emptied mine every couple days and the rotting diaper smell was awful. THE BAGS DO NOT TRAP THE ODOR. I also had a difficult time getting each diaper to seal individually. I followed the directions exactly, yet all the diapers just sank into one pile, instead of twisting individually like the \\"sausage\\" design pictured in the directions. Buy a small $5 trash can and recycle your plastic grocery bags - you will be so much better off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I loved it for the first 5 months.

They both broke. One whith-in the first week. We thought it must be a mistake, exchanged it for another. This one lasted a little while longer, but smelled awful when you changed the bags and my husband hated using it. Then that one broke. All in all it didn't smell, but if I have to replace it every couple of months....Who needs it! I was very disapointed with the product and have since heard the same type reviews from other moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED THIS NUSANCE","review":"The Diaper Genie is one of the most inconvenient and unsanitary inventions.I was expecting my first child and someone bought me a trash can with a flip up lid that was especially designed to hold in smells. With their approval I returned and got the money and bought a Diaper Genie. I got it home and it was a pain to put the refill in to start with. I was determined to use it though. I used it all of two days. It became such a pain. Even if I changed it it still smelled. It is difficult to change. It was a hassle to use. To me leaving all those diapers in there til it is full is so unsanitary. It is more hassle than it is worth. Go buy Ziploc baggies and throw dirty diapers in those and throw them in the trash. It is less expensive, less hassle, and so much cleaner. I would never reccomend this product to any one. Needless to say I should have just kept the cheap trash can that hold odors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"My husband and I were very disappointed with this product.

I would not recommend the Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Thing Stinks!","review":"I bought the Diaper Genie for my son, and ended up throwing the whole thing away. My son has colic and had difficulty with his digestion for the first 4 months. Point being: If your baby doesn't have atleast 4 or 5 messy diapers a day, this thing is going to reek before it needs to be emptied.Go for the Diaper Champ, it uses regular kitchen garbage bags, keeps odor out, and is over-all a better product. I use it now, and can't believe the difference. No smell, no expensive refills, and it's sooooo easy to use! No stinky poop-sausages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I received this diaper genie for my shower. Could not figure it out.

First, the plastic ring that fits in the opening easily dents on the edge that fits into the refill opening. Once this happens, the refill bags easily snag and you literally have to take the thing apart to fix it. Our first genie's ring was so dented (from trying to fit it into the refill container) that the bags would no longer slide out.We replaced the first with a second genie. Still have some problems fitting the ring to the refill container. Even worse, though, is the lack of stink controll! As a baby, the poops are too bad. Watch out when they are eating solids! Holy cow. . .talk about stink. The genie does little to hold that stink in and only adds its own perfume sent to it. Change a stinky diaper at night, and the next morning, the nursery smells of perfumed poop.Generally, we now use the genie for pee'd in diapers. Poops go in a ziplock and in the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIGHTMARE","review":"I got this as a baby shower gift from a friend and we used it for a couple weeks.then I went to buy refills for it and they were expensive I would much rather do the sented bags you can get 100 of them at any dollar store."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too many!!!!","review":"Stinky - The baby's room always smelled of dirty diapers.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"diaper genie review","review":"It was great in the beginning but after awhile i realized how much of a pain it was. First of all no one but you knows how to use it, when you change the bags and start new, the first few all fall in together. its hard to separate the diapers, when you twist the top it never seals until the 3rd or 4th diaper. Plus ive yet to see it hold odor. Its really more trouble than its worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive refills!","review":"This product works ok. However, the refills are EXPENSIVE!!! I finally gave up using the thing because of the money I was spending on the refills. It's much cheaper just to throw the diaper away tied up in a supermarket bag. We're now expecting our second child, and I'm considering the diaper champ, because it uses regular bags. If I had to do it again, I never would have gotten this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"Before purchasing the diaper genie, my husband and I had heard both, good and bad reviews about it. We decided to get it and be one of those parents who absolutely loved THE GENIE. Well, it didn't work out. Every time we turned to twist, the bag ripped, got stuck or simple didn't twist. We asked multiple people to take a look at it to make sure it wasn't USER ERROR and 5 grown adults couldn't get it to work. Took it back, thinking that it was defective and the second one was the same. In short, not once did we use the infamous diaper genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"For the price of the Diaper Genie, we would have been better off getting a regular trash can! The only good thing I can say is that it is compact enough to fit in a smaller space. The bags are outrageously priced and difficult to change. There is NO odor control whatsoever. We bought separate diaper pail deodorizers and they did little to nothing to help. We dreaded changing the bags. It was very time consuming and when you took out the old ones, they start coming unwound and stinking to high heaven! Also, as the baby (and diapers) got bigger, it became increasingly difficult to fit them into the opening. We are expecting our third child and already have a Diaper Genie but we WILL NOT be using it. I would never recommend this product to ANYONE! I worked at a day care center where we had a plain, inexpensive diaper pail. It was much easier to use and locked in the smell. In one day we would FILL this diaper pail and it did not stink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie","review":"I had registered for a different disposal system and received the Diaper Genie at my shower. It worked very well for the first few months. I was later disappointed to find that the Diaper Genie did not prevent odors from coming out into the room when my child began eating rice cereal. Despite scented bags and daily removal, the smell still exists. I do not recommend purchasing or registering for the Diaper Genie. The other problem, when we have family or friends dispose of the diaper, they end up cutting the bag every single time --unless provided with directions ahead of time. I want something simple that keeps odors from containing my room! Now we simply throw the diapers in a scented bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!!","review":"While this product was a little tricky at first to set up and change refill packs, I feel that it was WELL worth the purchase and don't mind at all buying the refills.

What a life saver Playtex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for 6 months...then forget it!","review":"I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months. Then I discovered what a waste of money it was. Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench. I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler. Still didn't do the trick. I even put air fresheners in and near it.... Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers. Still a hassle to remove the \\"diaper weenie\\" so now I just use a normal trash can. Much less hassle and same results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Diaper Champ instead!","review":"We have the Diaper Champ (for over 3 mths). It is the best. This past Christmas, we traveled to my folks and we purchased the Genie for us to use at their house! It sucked! It doesn't even compare to the Champ. The dial to turn and seal the diapers in the bags worked once. The rest of the time we had to lift the lid and turn it from the inside. It also is smaller and doesn't hold as many diapers as the Champ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic in Diaper Genie","review":"I've been using the Genie for 9 months now, and feel that after giving it a fair try, I must write to steer other new parents away. We received the Genie and the Diaper Champ as baby shower gifts, and the Champ wins hands down. Sooo much easier to use, you can use your own trash bags, and it holds the smell as well as (if not better than) the Genie.I found the Genie to be difficult from the very beginning - just trying to put it together was a struggle. The cutting mechanism has never worked right, you have to get the diaper at just the right position to twist and seal it, and it's a pain in the neck to empty - you have to dump it upside down after struggling with the cutting mechanism. Another reviewer commented that you need two hands to operate, which is true - also challenging when holding a squirming 9-month-old.We're moving in 2 weeks - the Champ is going with us, the Genie is being recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT CUTS DOWN ON THE SMELL BUT THAT'S IT","review":"We got this as a shower gift... we did register for it because we heard good things about it. But i have to say to operate it is a pain in the neck. You have buy special liners for it and then when it's full take out the sausage linked diapers and put it in ANOTHER garbage bag - so your double bagging. The manual wheel you had to turn to seal each bag didnt work properly half the time and wouldn't seal the diaper correctly. Eventually it got to be too much of a hassle to use so we have stopped using it and are going to to get a Diaper champ instead. It may not seal each diaper but at least we won't have to buy special liners for it and can use a regular garbage bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Disappointment","review":"This product is difficult to use becuase you really need both to open and dispose of the diaper and when the baby is on the changing table, it is impossible to throw away the diaper since you need one hand on the baby. The diaper therefore sits around until you can later throw it away. The refills are also very costly and the bag needs to be changed often. The pail itseld holds no more than 20 diapers and the refills only contain enough for about 60 diapers. I have returned the product abd replaced it with the Diaper Champ by Baby Trend.I actually want to give it no stars, but the system can not read no stars so I gave it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT","review":"This thing is horrible.

So we got one. It was such a pain to use. In the middle of the night or with a baby who doesn't like to lay around it is not practical. Also it fills up in about a days time with a newborn and when you are barely getting sleep and all you do is feed and change the baby for the first few weeks you don't have time to take this apart and empty it and set it back up again. It might work for some people, but for us it was essentially a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change the diapers more frequently for minimal odor!","review":"Glad we received the DG. Big tip: don't wait until the DG is \\"stuffed\\" to change it - reduces alot of odor build up. Only frustrating part is the 1st diaper insert (keeps unraveling after the 2nd diaper is twisted in). Other than that a fantastic product. We tried tossing the diapers in our trash can and quickly found out just how well the DG reduces odor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars is the Truth - Not Dreamin' of this Genie","review":"This is the worst product we received. Requires 2 hands to get one diaper in so too bad for always keeping one hand on the baby. The \\"genie\\" inside smells horrid (even sans the soiled diapers) and makes the entire room smell horrid. The opening is WAY too small to push the diaper through without splitting your cuticles and the holding capacity is practically nill. The \\"twister action\\" to sausage link the diapers just wastes the cartridge plastic and does not help the odor. Don't even get me started on all the replacements you will need to buy or the whole emptying/changing refills process! I say skip it and use a leaky garbage bag for better results. Get a foot-pedal garbage pail says my husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant live without it!!","review":"What can i say about this product besidesI LOVE IT!!

I read in one reviwthat it has a cutter to cut the bags? that sounds kind of dangerous to me and am thank ful mine does not include that.Some reviews make it seem like you needto be a rocketscientist to use this thing, but im an everyday mom who has no problemswith it at all.

I would rather make the extra trips to the garbage instead of fighting with the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing going","review":"I got the original diaper genie as a shower gift 6 years ago and I have been using it with each child. My child's room is odor free. When emptying the canister, I just open up the bottom and put all the diapers in a plastic bag and take it out. No problems! I can't understand what kind of problems people are having with this. It's so easy to use. It takes only one hand so your other hand is free to hold the baby. It holds a lot of diapers and the refills last about a month or so. For those who are tearing the plastic when they twist it, try twisting the correct part. It couldn't be easier. It's a must have for any nursery. I was told that I wouldn't use it but here it is 6 years later and I wouldn't be without it.

I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her!Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"My youngest daughter got this as a gift, and it was too difficult to use and we finally threw it away. My oldest daughter bought the Diaper Champ and it was wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks Literally","review":"It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good diaper pail.","review":"I am pretty happy with my daiper genie. I haven't tried other diaper pails for comparison, but this one does the trick, and helps control odor. Its roomy enough that I only need to empty it every two or three days with size 3 diapers. To help with odor control I spray with lysol each time I empty it. It is easy to change the refills, but there is one ring inside that is difficult to fit in place when changing the refill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother....","review":"This is by far the WORST product I've ever used! I was so excited to get it b/c I heard that you had to have a diaper genie when you have a baby, but give me a break. When you twist the top, first of all, it never catches the plastic so I have to open it up and loosen the plastic myself. Then when you twist it a few times, once you open it up again to put another diaper in, the top either gets caught on the plastic or it cuts it when it's not supposed to. Three of my girlfriends threw there's out and got some of the other diaper disposals. I was very disappointed in this product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a garbage can","review":"I received the Diaper Genie as a gift, but it was not all that it was cracked up to be. First of all when you load the first three or four diapers they all slip through the suggested twist and are piled together at the bottom of the pail. I often have to fight with it to open it and found out that the edges of the lid right below the button are VERY sharp. I got a pretty nasty cut on my finger. And it doesn't help on the smell either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie FAILURE","review":"Horrible horrible stench--I think that anyone who is using one has not been using it for long...I have a 4 month old and an 18month old, and this thing reeks after half a day.

I feel obligated to give it one star since I gave it 18 months to show me it could work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted with the Genie not Diapers!!!","review":"I just bought this item because I need to eliminate odor and thought it would be practical. I originally wanted the Diaper Champ but went with the Genie because it was a little less expensive. BOY DO I REGRET IT!!! A lot of people have poor reviews after getting started and seeing that the product is ineffective. I CAN'T EVEN GET STARTED!! I know it's not me; I read the directions over and over but can't seem to get this thing right. I have yet to get the sausage and have already began to see some wear and tear after a few manipulations. Back to the store it goes and HELLO DIAPER CHAMP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"A friend recommended the diaper genie to us. We liked it until our child's started using bigger diapers. The pail fills to quickly. The smell was still strong. We gave up on the diaper genie and started to use a garbage pail. Why put up with the cost of refills and the hassle of emptying the diaper genie if it does not cut down the smell. We are going to try the diaper champ. I will write a review about that one once we have used it for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for eaters!","review":"I thought this would be a great thing to have but after my baby started eating solids the stink escapes. I switched to toddler liners but that did not help much either. Not many diapers fit in the pail. You can never get just one diaper in the first section. No matter how many times you turn it the hanging diaper twists into the new diaper. The only thing I can say good about it, is that it is better than a plain trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you have a garbage can in your house, you do not need a diaper genie. I received it as a gift, so I stuck with it for a few months....having to buy the refills. Basically, my son was breast fed with multiple stools a day. Breast fed baby's stool does not smell bad enough that it has to be isolated. And even if my baby was formula fed...though their stools have a more potent smell, they don't have nearly as many per day. I haven't used it for months and he's 9months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted!!","review":"I used to LOVE this thing, but don't expect it to last the whole diaper stage of your child, let alone go one to the next child. My daughter is now two and it has completely fallen apart. The lid holder for the cutting blade broke off after six months, the cover does not stay on, and when you try to load the new refil, the insert no longer fits without a struggle. Don't expect it to last long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely must have","review":"Like everyone else, I'd heard all the stories of how it didn't eliminate any of the odors, but when I got this as a shower gift I figured I may as well try it first hand. I discovered it's very easy to use, change your baby, put the dirty diaper in the Genie, give it a couple of twists and it's out of site, out of mind until the next diaper change. As for the bad odors, I have yet to experience them. If you have a healthy baby, your child is dirting enough diapers in the span of a day that you're emptying out the Genie every couple of days anyway, so there shouldn't be a problem with any odors. I liked it so much I went ahead and bought another one for my son's nanny to have at her house when I went back to work. This is one of those items every household with a baby must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad smell over time","review":"There are over 400 reviews here, so what can I bring to the party? Experience. Over time, the plastic in the diaper genie gradually absorbs the foul smells of its contents, so it begins to stink, empty or full. I'd say it has 2-3 months before you start noticing it, and maybe a few more before you have to decide to do something about it.Hey, this is fun: do a Google search on \\"diaper genie bad\\" and notice the astro-turf. The same message appears over and over in all the baby-review forums. Your friends at Playtex really want you to buy this!A brand new diaper genie, when you can figure out how to use it and to load it (both steps are really NON-intuitive), performs pretty much as advertised. The diapers are sealed in a chain of plastic bags like sausages. Emptying the thing when it is full? Catastrophe lurks at every step. Working this thing is nothing you want to do when you're tired or groggy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer model not nearly as good as original.","review":"We had an older model Diaper Genie (1994) that was WONDERFUL. We have since had two more children and decided to buy a newer model since the refills for the orginal were being discontinued. The new model has been significantly \\"cheapened up.\\" We threw it in the trash within a matter of a few months and continued to use the old model until we could no longer find the original refills. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"We loved our Diaper Genie so much we bought another one for a second changing station. We haven't had any problem with odor and it is VERY easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that it does need emptied frequently (especially as the diapers get bigger). This has been one of the best baby items we bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and spend it on another unit..","review":"We received the genie as a gift, and are really disappointed with it. First of all the smell is horrendous (even when aired out, cleaned and sprayed with lysol), it is awkward to open (who has two free hands when changing a baby?), and the sausaging system is a pain to unload from the genie (they unwind). I think the best bet would be a diaper pail, where you can put a scented garbage bag in it, and change it every two days..... save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw mine across the room one night","review":"This thing is HORRIBLE. It doesn't work and frankly I can't believe the people that actually like this thing. I wasted an hour one night just trying to get it to twist the diaper without tearing the bag and finally after an hour got it to work once. The next time I used it, I did exactly as I had done before and the stupid bag ripped and fell to the bottom of the container. I took it back and bought the DIAPER DEKOR. It is a FABULOUS invention and very easy to use. It works, doesn't smell up your house, and is a lot better looking anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"We had so much trouble with this diaper pail. We could never properly install the bag refills correctly. The top part wouldn't twist to close. Not to mention when you would pick it up to change it the bottom flies open. I have had at least three girlfriends that bought this for their babies and hated it to. I recommend saving all your plastic grocery bags and tying the dirty diapers up in them. Double wrap the bad ones. Throw them in your regular trash. They get taken out more often that way anyway. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Frustrating Baby Product We Bought!!!","review":"This diaper genie is not only a waste of money, but extremely frustrating. You NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE HAND FREE, ideally, two hands to operate this product - try that with a squirming baby on the changing table. This product should be hands free! You also need to change the expensive bags at least once a week (we changed them weekly with a preemie) and changing the bags are a nightmare. The instructions are absolutely \\"No\\" help. We have had this product for 3 weeks and no longer use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly designed!","review":"I registered for the Diaper Genie by Playtex because I always see lots of them in almost all the baby stores. Now I know why they are everywhere - they are left behinds by smart consumers! 2 months into the diaper genie, the plastic tab securing the bag cutter already broke off. The bottom of the plastic topper for securing and twisting the bags was already so out of shape that it could no longer fit into new refils. It caused us lots of stress when we had to change the baby and fix the diaper pail at the same time. In my opinion, this product wass terribly designed and should go back to it's drawing board!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second baby and still going strong!","review":"I recieved the Diaper Genie as a a shower gift three years ago and it is hands down, the best gift I got. Keeps the odor in and takes me 30 seconds to empty, 35 seconds to change.I must admit, if I don't empty it twice a week, I do notice an odor. But I just had my second baby and am still using the same Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recomment this product","review":"We bought the Diaper Genie for our daughter because we had heard so much about it.In my opinion, it's a total waste of money and also environmentally problematic. If you empty your trash every day, you don't need the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"If a baby stayed in newborn diapers forever than this would be a great product. As your child grows so do the size of the diapers. I was buying more and more refills because the diaper genie filled up really quick. Save your money and throw them in your regular garbage pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift with my son and we liked it. However the cost of refills adds up, and it still has a smell. With the cost of diapers and then having to buy the refills adds up. So what I decided to do is to take a trash bag and put it in the Diaper Genie instead of buy the refills and it works. It keeps the cost down and the smell is still there. We have to make sure it gets empty twice a week. My suggestion would be not to buy the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diaper Genie is not worth the hassle.","review":"This contraption is more hassle than it's worth. If you've never used one before, more than likely you'll need someone who has used it to show you how to put in the refill and get it to work right. Even then, I found that the smell when you empty it is just gross. Save your money and buy the scented diaper disposal bags that you can find in any grocery store in the baby section. You get 100 bags for [$$$]. I just put the stinky diaper in, tie the top and put it in the trash where it belongs. You're going to wind up putting that stinky sausage in the trash anyway. Why go through the hassle of having to empty the Diaper Genie? Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated product in baby care","review":"The Diaper Genie does contain bad smells, as promised. But it was clearly designed by someone who has never had a baby. Hint: You need two hands to operate it (indeed, to even OPEN it), and when you're changing an infant's diaper, you NEVER have two hands free. So you are left with an [unappealing] alternative: Leave the filthy diaper sitting on the changing table (stinking up the room) and come back a few hours later (after feeding, burping, and otherwise managing said infant) to a room that smells like Baltimore at low tide--then put the diaper in the \\"Genie\\" and toss your worries away! I could go on (it doesn't have enough capacity, the entire system is awkward and tedious...) but I won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim","review":"I don't know why people can't use this product properly. I certainly think the diaper genie is the best product on the market. I think people who don't like this product must be mechanically impaired... People love to complain about a product unless they don't have do do anything. It's a sad state in America when people expect not to ever get their hands dirty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I think this product is a complete waste of time and money. The refills are expensive, it is really hard to empty and it doesn't even keep the smell out. I recieved this as a gift and my husband threw the box away as soon as it was unpacked, so I didn't get a chance to return it. My advice to you, is to do what I do, buy a box of ziploc baggies and a nice trash can with a lid. I works wonderfully and everyone knows how to use a ziploc baggie. My diaper genie sits in the attic."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Worth it!!!","review":"SAVE your Money!!!! It's a good idea but truly not worth it. You are better off just buying a small-medium size garbage pail with a lid.Pro: It does keep the odor from escaping and has a clean appearance.Con: Doesn't hold too many diapers, hard to assemble and hard to change the refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"As a 1st time Mom, I registered for a diaper genie because I thought it sounded wonderful. Well, it's not. Now that my son is 6 months old, it stinks. I have spent a fortune on refill bags. No more, I bought a Diaper Champ this past weekend. It is so much easier to use. You just flip the handle and the diaper drops into a regular trash bag. I do not have to bend over and twist anything. When the bag is full, you just take it out. No more cutting, pulling, twisting, or knotting bags. I have decided to trash my Diaper Genie. At least this way, I am only using a trash bag instead of a refill and a trash bag. My suggestion-Don't waste your money on a Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but is more complicated to use than Diaper Champ","review":"I have a diaper genie (gift) and the bottom line is that it works for us. However, if I had to make a purchase I would've bought a diaper champ for 3 reasons. First it would be cheaper - you have to buy special refills for the diaper genie as versus regular garbage bags in the diaper champ and 2nd the diaper genie involves 7 steps (lift pink lid, lift round lid, insert diaper, replace round lid, twist round lid, close pink lid) to get the diaper inside the diaper genie. Third, changing the refills in the diaper genie is complicated and aggravating. Heck, based on my first reason, I might just go out and buy a diaper champ as it will probably save us money in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"We heard so much about the \\"wonderful Diaper Genie,\\" and didn't realize other options existed. It works great in that it does lock in the odors (you just have to make sure to empty it regularly instead of letting it get over full). However, we're seriously considering giving it away and purchasing one of the other brands, for several reasons. It's inconvenient to use in that it's short and needs two hands to operate. You also have to twist it five times clockwise, as opposed to just throwing the diaper in and being done with it. The refills are getting expensive; the idea of using a simple garbage bag is quite appealing at this point. Whoever advertises this product is doing a good job; I wish the other brands would step their efforts up so people like us wouldn't waste our money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy diaper genie user","review":"The concept to the diaper genie is a good one but, I am ready to throw mine out of the window. I have a preemie baby and his diapers are very small and fall right through the prongs. When I go to turn the dial, there isn't a diaper there. When I open the bottom to empty the diapers, they are all in one heap at the bottom. I twist and twist the refill over and over again and this still occurs. I have to disagree when the directions state that it is odor controlled..No it isn't...my brand new baby room smells awful. I hear so many people say it is a wonderful neccesity to have. I on the other hand am looking for something else. I won't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all I hoped for","review":"I have two major complaints about the Diaper Genie. First, it does not keep the stink out. Actually, that's not true. It does keep the stink out as long as you don't open the lid to put a diaper in, but once you open the lid you need to run out of the room. And what good is a diaper pail if you can't stand to open it to put diapers in? (Of course, you get a double-dose of the smell when you open the bottom to empty it!) The other complaint is the special liners. I knew when I got it that it needed the separate liners, but I had no idea how quickly they would need to be refilled. I am looking for a new diaper pail now and will certainly get one that uses normal trash bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam Tuckers Mom and Dad","review":"We tried the genie for a week and were dissapointed in the small number of diapers you could put in before you had to change the bag (which are specially made for the Genie.)

As a first time mom it sounded like a great idea. After using it for two months I have thrown it out. It smells horrible. Having to buy the refills is a pain! Like diapers aren't expensive enough let's buy them special bags to throw them away in! I would never buy this product again. It's not worth the time or money. If you buy one I suggest a lot of air freshener too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and difficult to use","review":"After 5 months... I give up. This product is a waste of money. It requires (a) a users manual to explain how to change the liner, (b) a special \\"technique\\" to get the diaper segments to seal, (c) emptying every 2-3 days because it is too small (especially annoying as the diapers get bigger), and (c) expensive replacement liners. I respect the fact that many of the reviewers have found ways to manage with these flaws by perfecting usage techniques and using the Genie only for poopie diapers (while throwing wet diapers in a regular pail)to save on liner cost. However, special techniques are useless when the Mother in Law is trying to use it! I recommend paying a little extra up-front for Diaper Champ. It is MUCH easier to use, contains the odors very well, and uses regular garbage bags. You will save money in the long-run by not having to buy special replacement liners. But don't take my word for it... go read some of the reviews for the Diaper Champ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sleep deprived new mom :)","review":"HATED THIS PRODUCT!!!! The instructions say it is sooo easy to use, but both my husband and I couldn't figure out how to get it to work properly. In order to get this product to work, you have to push the diaper way down past the catch point in the pail, but if you have a yucky poop diaper, that can get messy! Also, the top wouldn't turn to twist the bag to keep out odors. We ended up buying the Diaper Champ ...to replace this one and LOVE IT!!!! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"We bought this just before our 13 month old was born. It has been a frustration from the very start.

I thought it was great at first, too. After a period of months, however, it started to STINK! It wasn't the diapers that were so foul, it was the Genie itself. No amount of disinfecting, bleaching or deodorizing came close to touching that stink. I would strongly encourage new parents to forget this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I bought this because I thought \\"I have to have one.\\" It has been the most aggravating thing I have ever used! You twist and sometimes it twists and sometimes it doesn't and it doesn't take away odor, etc....

I have a whole stack of refills that are sitting on the closet shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I received the diaper genie as a baby shower gift. I used it a few times and said forget it. It's to hard to install the liners and once the genie was full I had a hard time figuring out how to cut the plastic.

The diaper genie doesn't really help with oders."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am returning it","review":"I started out with the Diaper Champ - to a fault of my own I needed a new diaper pail so i decided to try the Diaper Genie. I had the old style Diaper Genie at my mothers and I liked it so I thought I would try the new and improved one. I hate it Im returning it today - u have to shove a full diaper in it until the clips catch it and then twist it - if u go to far - oh well and if u dont go far enough - shove that full dirty diaper down some more. I also think it is to short. The one star I will give it is that it did keep the odor out. The other star is for emptying it. Very easy. Overall - I'll never buy one for anyone I know. When it goes back a new Diaper Champ will replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It!!!","review":"I received the Diaper Genie for my shower. When my son was first born I thought it was great, until I had to start buying the refills every other week for the outrageous price [per] refill. Its not even worth it, it doesn't eliminate odor, as soon as you open the top to put the diaper in you can smell it, its like something died in there, and no matter how much Lysol you spray or how many time you wash it out it still smells, the refills are a pain, my husband won't even change it. We are looking at the Diaper Champ, the reviews are good and you can use regular garbage bags, and I hear it holds a lot more diapers than the Genie which only holds approximately 15 diapers and needs to be emptied every other day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dump the Genie","review":"I reiceived two Genies from a baby shower and wound up returning them both. I did not notice how HUGE they are and they take up valuable space. I also noticed that you need to refill it often and let me tell you something. Babies go through diapers quick. Plus you have to make sure you buy the refill that pertains to the genie you have i.e. wide ring. ... I can place many diapers in one 13 gallon trash bag then silly special refills.I found the genie hard to operate and the \\"wide\\" openning was not very wide at all for those HUGE diapers later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... no","review":"Simply put: do yourself a favor and look for a Diaper Champ. It costs the same (or less) and does not demand you buy special bags. In fact, Target's shopping bags are the PERFECT size for a Diaper Champ. A Diaper Champ also holds any size diapers and seals out odor just as well if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"We have read many negative reviews here about Diaper Genie being difficult to use, but after talking to some people who had it, we still decided to buy it, and we love it.

I was expecting it to be a challenge after seeing what others had to say about it, but really, just read the instructions.

First of all, the bag inside is heavily perfumed, and I'm not a big fan of the smell. No, the nursery doesn't smell like poopy diapers, but I think that smelling like a Diaper Genie insert isn't exactly the greatest either. Then, I had problems when I tried to cut off the \\"diaper sausage\\" and broke the ring. I followed the instructions and everything, but it just didn't work, I had to use regular scissors to cut the bag off.I've decided that this really is a gimmicky piece of crap.

When I first looked at it, it seem a bit confusing but once I read the directions and did a couple of practice runs it was fine. Then we had Brianna. It just seem to be a double duty. First to put it in and do all that twisting and a few days later to empty the container. It was just more simple to just throw it in the trash. We usually just throw out our trash everyday anyway. This is also easier for me since I do most of her changing on a changing kit I have for my pack n play downstairs. Maybe if I changed her in her room more often it would be put to better use.

All that twisting the diapers up, and ripping plastic, and running out of the refills. Wasn't worth the money. We now keep a trash can outside our back door to throw dirty diapers in, it takes just as long to toss them outside and costs no extra. Or we've found that tying them in a plastic shopping bag works just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy!!!","review":"I had registered for this prouduct when it first came out for my first child thinking how neat it was to have a garbage pail just for diapers. Once I got it home it was so hard to assemble and figuring out how to use it was a task. You have to turn it one way to hold the diapers in what I called sausage links, but if you dont turn it enough, when it comes time to empty it the little sausage links have untwisted.

I'm thinking about using a garbage can with a lid instead of the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"In theory, the diaper genie souds wonderful, however, it's awful. It does not function properly. It's pretty good at keeing the ordors contained, however, it's very difficult to add solied dispers to the pail and cut the film using the specially desinged cutter. After a few weeks of use, the top came off and would not go back on tightly. Unfortuantely, several of my friends also had this item on their baby registry. It's useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"We used a diaper pail with our son & decided to try the diaper genie with our daugher. What a better alternative! It's a little tricky at first but after the first week I was a pro! Just twist & close. My daughter's nursery never smells like diapers and her older brother appreciates the fact that the bag of diapers doesn't smell, even when full, when he takes them to the trash. I fill the refills are worth the money and I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I received this diaper pail as a shower gift, I did not register for it however I figured I'd give it a try...what a MISTAKE!!!! Not only do the diapers jam in the top when trying to place them inside, the bags that are suppose to contain the diapers completely rip to shreds. My husband had a very hard time emptying the diaper pail because the diapers where so jammed. We gave up on this item after the first two weeks of use. I know a few other expecting mothers and I plan on telling them not to bother putting this product on their registry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I gave this product to my sister a lil over a year ago when she was pregnant with my niece. She loved it sooo much that when I got pregnant it was the first thing I put on my registry. I was even lucky enough to find a decorative cover (on an internet auction site), that matches my nursery, to go over it so it blends in with the nursery very well. Keeps odors out well. Refills easily. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Don't get this unless you are an engineer. I found it difficult to change the liners. I threw mine away and bought a Diaper Champ. I did not like buying the specific refills. On a good note, it never smelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must!","review":"Put an extremely stinky diaper in here, and you won't smell it again. A friend who bought a different brand complained that she should have bought the Diaper Genie because her child's old diapers permeate the room. My child's pediatrian said plastic bags work just as well. That might be true, but this is so much easier and quicker! They're cheap--buy one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want this! I'm glad I have it.","review":"My husband begged me to get this! I said 'no way'. I had heard horror stories about how difficult it is to use, and that it doesn't really work. I also thought it was pretty gross to leave dirty, soiled diapers sitting in a room, even if the smell is masked. But he got it anyway. He ran out and got one when the baby was one week old.Now I am glad we have it. It really does work. It is a little tricky to figure out (I kept twisting the wrong part and cutting off each bag), but it is worth it. You can empty it as often as you wish, and you don't have to use it for the really nasty diapers. You can always run those out to the trash outside. It is pretty inexpensive for what it does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are probably better products...","review":"Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it! After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with. Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO. It doesn't lock out odors either. It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD. I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier. What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly. No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked. The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the Hype!","review":"This is definetly overarted. It's only good feature is that it keeps the smell out...that is if you get it right. It's difficult to use, expensive refills, really a Pain.

Who likes to smell dirty diapers? Yuck. But I found it has a big design flaw. It is very hard to operate with one hand (the other holding the baby on the changing table) and after the first few diapers are inside, it is harder to turn.I now just keep ziplock baggies and grocery bags in the top drawer and wrap them after every use and put them in the main garbage. It's easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"This was a highly recommended product by many websites so I included it on my registry only to find out it's not worth the trouble. It smells almost as bad as any other diaper pail and with the amount of trouble you must go through to change the lining and push the diapers in it (another fun task, I might add), it's not worth it. Also, the 'ring of smelly diapers' that this thing creates that you must then discard in some orderly fashion is disgusting. Don't waste your money! They are going to smell anyway....buy another diaper pail and replace the trash bags (tall kitchen are usually better) more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"We received a Diaper Genie for our baby shower and put it in our sons room. There are no odors at all (my husband has a VERY sensitive nose and he thinks it's odorless too). We like this so much we bought one for the family room too since this is where we spend alot of our time. It's small enough to keep hidden and does not smell so no one knows its there. I would reccommend this to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bu not for Cloth Diapers","review":"I got our diaper genie from a nieghbor and it still works great. Except when it is Very full or my mom doesnt completely twist the bag shut. But I decided to start useing cloth diapers for my son....sooooooooo much cheaper and you know what they are made of.....and the genie DOES NOT work at all with cloth diapers. So if you are going to use cloth diapers choose something else. Looks like we are going to try the Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not prevent odor.","review":"I received the genie as a shower gift two years ago for my first child. My biggest complaint is the odor, of course babies diapers do not really smell that bad until the solid food starts. After my son started having stinky diaper I found the diaper genie awful. It contains the odor until you need to open it up to put another dirty diaper in. Then the whole room smells for a really long time. And, after empting it I would have to clean the whole thing out and air it out outside! I now find it intolerable to use and just tie dirty diapers up in plastic shopping bags and throw straight into the garbage can outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work!","review":"I used the Diaper Genie with my first child, and absolutely WILL NOT use it with my second. It's too much of a hassle, and not worth all the effort. Emptying it is a big process, and you end up with a big, long (sausage-like) chain of wrapped dirty diapers. I used to take all of that and put it into a regular trash bag, before I could throw it all away. It does seem to hold in the odor, but that odor escapes each time the diaper genie is emptied. The razor to cut the bag never seemed to work like it was supposed to. I ended up having to just rip it with my hands many times. I would not recommend this product to anyone. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"Yes, I have to admit it takes the smell away, but the thing was so hard to put the refills in. The twist ring wouldnt go back in, my cutter wouldnt really cut the bag. It was horrible, so i finally bought the diaper champ, yes it smells a little worse but hey, its a lot easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"It STINKS!","review":"No matter what you do - IT STINKS!

When it came to using it... forget it. It just wasn't worth it.First of all, you usually destroy the first refill trying to figure the thing out. Secondly, they realllly start to reek after a while. (even with scrubbing, bleach, etc.) My sister had one, and it was just impossible to keep it from smelling. She ended up throwing it out in the end.I didn't think this was worth the money, or the cost of refills. It's easier to just throw the diaper in the garbage. If you get a particularly stinky diaper, just throw it in a grocery bag and tie it off. *shrug*"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!","review":"I would have never invested in this product if I would have asked around first.

Wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This was a gift, and according to EVERYBODY, a must. However, after four months of use, it became a hassle, and a major pain. I had to empty it every other day, and it still smells. If I messed up on emptying it, I ended up throwing away the whole refill. At four dollars a refill, every other week, not worth it. I would rather smell it. I empty trash every day anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS!!!","review":"We received our Diaper Genie as a shower gift and at first we were delighted to have it. Until we actually started to use it. It only holds about a day's worth of diapers so you end up changing it all the time. Also, it is designed to wrap each diaper individually, (kind of like a sausage link) but it doesn't really work. Our lid broke within the first month of using it. It is also really short and not convienent to use since you have to bend way over while trying to make sure your baby doesn't roll off the changing table.We ended up buying ourselves the Diaper Champ. It is so much easier to use and holds a lot more diapers. It's design is so much easier and simple. Do yourself a favor and get the Diaper Champ... you wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I finally threw this out!!","review":"This Diaper Genie was great at first. But, as time went on, it smelled baaaaad! Everytime I opened it I got blasted with \\"diaper stink\\" even when there were no diapers in it!I threw it out and went to tossing the diaper's into those plastic (and free) grocery store bags and tying up the handles. I didn't have \\"diaper stink\\" problems ever again!Also, the twisting action didn't always work. When it came time to cut the bag, it would fail most of the time.I will NEVER buy the Diaper Genie or recommend it to anyone ever again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redesign needed","review":"I've had the diaper genie for a year now and all I can say is that it is in need of a redesign. I would like to know how to keep the first few diapers from unraveling. Once the diapers reach the bottom of the pail, the unit works fine. But those first few diapers unspin themselves the moment they go beyond the grabbing claws and the only way I've found to prevent this is to use tape. I've searched Playtex's web site for ways to prevent this and have found nothing on this obvious design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle.","review":"We bought a diaper genie when our first son was born in 1999. We heard other parents talk about how nice they were. Well, we didn't like it. The refills are a pain to put in. The lid didn't twist like it was supposed to. I usually had to get my husband to help me. When you empty the genie, the smell is awful and the diapers just \\"untwisted\\" in their wrap. I would advise against buying this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I have heard so much hype regarding the Diaper Genie as a must have item. We have it and we don't even use ours. A waste of money as far as I am concerned. The top never turned correctly and getting the diapers out was so disgusting. We just throw the diapers with the rest of the trash. It works just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie is a Diaper Disaster","review":"I registered for this product when I was pregnant, because it was the only brand name I knew at the time. It's awful! The instructions aren't clear, you have to buy a new refill every month, your hands get dirty b/c you have to stuff the diaper all the way down the plastic bag, the turn knob on the top doesn't work, etc., etc., etc. I'm going to buy a Diaper Champ. My friend was smart and registered for that one and it works like a charm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There Must Be A Better Product Out There!","review":"I purchased the Diaper Genie in the hopes that I would have an easy means of disposing of the diapers. Not so! First, whenever I turn the top knob, instead of twisting the plastic in to neat little budles, the plastic tears 9 times out of 10. I, then, have to pull out more plastic and try again (often several times). Maybe this is what Playtex intended: for the consumer to have to keep replenishing the plastic. Second, it is not odorless! Third, because the plastic has been continuously tearing, imagine emptying the pail. I would never purchase this product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought it would be","review":"Found it difficult to put first refill in. Bag tends to tear. I thought it would be easier to use. You have to push a button to open the top and push the dirty diaper way down and then twist. I would prefer a product where you can just throw the diaper in and not have to be bothered handling the dirty diaper as much as you have to with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"a loving mother with a stinky diaper genie","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. It has to be changed at LEAST twice a week and when you do change it the smell is terrible!! Not to mention that when you get a new refill it takes forever to get the plastic to stay twisted--(I know I've twisted it at least 20 times before to get it to stay.) I do admit that it keeps the baby's room from smelling until you open it up, but other than that I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I am currently looking for another brand myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I thought that this would be the greatest addition to my nursery. I was completely wrong. If you don't put the diaper into the unit correctly, you can forget it working properly. Sticking your hand half way down and trying to get it to seal was completely fustrating. After three months, I threw it in the trash. I found the Diaper Champ to be a great addition and an end to my fustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product broke 4 weeks after we started","review":"After 4 weeks of using this defective product, one of the 4 clips that holds diapers in place while you twist just broke off. Needless to say, this renders the product worthless - now when I twist it doesn't \\"seal\\" so the diapers just fall through and smell.... This is cheap plastic and not designed well. I'm going to try the Diaper Champ now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"A diaper pail shouldn't be difficult or have to come with instructions. I never got this thing to work correctly. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"after one year, it's going!","review":"I have suffered for one year with my Diaper Genie. I took all recommendations when I registered for it before my baby's birth. I now can't believe I have waited this long before throwing the thing out the window. It smells terrible, especially after it's half full. I even know how to do the ole \\"tightly wrapped ball of diapers\\". The regular liners smell and the \\"toddler\\" inserts (green ones) seemed to help with the smell, however the plastic is so thick that it doesn't cut at all with the little cutter tool in the lid. Speaking of the tool, one of the little teeth that holds it in broke off right away and now I have to keep the tool in a drawer (which makes the drawer smell cause the smell from within the Genie permeates everything, even after bleaching it). I would return it if I could, but now unfortunately it's garage sale material. I'll be trying one of the other brands that uses garbage bags rather than the pricey refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A PRODUCT I CAN LIVE WITH OUT!!","review":"Every baby magazine in the world boasts that this is one of those products no parents should be without... they are mistaken. I will admit the concept is good, but the Diaper Gene seriously lacks what it promises! The ultimate worst is how many times you have to empty this pail! When my son was in newborn and size one diapers it was great... then when he got into bigger sizes, forget it! AND IT DOESN'T KEEP ODORS AWAY! Which it claims it's the best for! The Diaper Gene is supposed to make a chain of diapers, after time went on mine would contain two to three diapers in one link! Finally I got tired of messing with it and tossed it away. I went straight to Babies R Us and bought the Diaper Champ! Which I am totally satisfied with! The Diaper Champ KO's the Gene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, but MUST read instructions to operate","review":"This did well at keeping odors at bay, in our nursery. You do need to fully read the instructions though, don't be in a hurry. Once you understand how unit works, it is easy to empty, and put refills in. Needs complete emptying every 2-3 days, and this is with a 5 month old baby, who poopies more than newborns. It controls odor on the outside, however, the inside of the Genie needs to be wiped out with anibacterial cleaner wipes, as stentch of dirty diapers is absorbed by the inside plastic. The refills for the Genie are scented, which helps to control the odor, too. My only complaint with it, is that it needs to be emptied so frequently, it only holds 12-15 size 3 diapers. But obviously, no one wants a diaper disposal unit to sit in nursery for a week! That would be unsanitary! lol! Overall a good unit, for a good price. Refills are expensive though, around $.. to $.., but we only go through about 1 refill a month, which isn't too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product would not recommend even if you got it for free","review":"Is not easy to use at first although we figured it out after a while of course but why should we waste time playing with a diaper genie when we could be spending time doing other things.wastes a ton of bag space in our opinion to eliminate smells you have to turn the bag around each diaper, when you take the bag out and all the turns unfold all the diapers will fall to the bottom and leave an excessive amount of extra bag space.The bag refills are not cheap by the way around [$$] for a refill.Also the lid pops off easily and it takes 2 hands to throw something away. Usually one hand is holding a baby so....it creates another inconvenience from an item whose job is to create more convenience.we hate our diaper genie and would not recommend it to any of our friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"A diaper DUD","review":"The diaper genie is much more hassel than it's really worth.

Within 5-6 months this also started to smell and nothing would remove the scent from the plastic. This holds 12-15 size 4 diapers so it needs to be changed every 2-3 days or so. The refills are expensive considering other diaper pails use 13 gallon kitchen bags or grocery bags. If this was truly odor free I wouldn't mind paying so much for refills and emptying it out but it does smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky!","review":"This pail worked well when my son was breastfeeding only and in newborn or size 1 diapers. After about 3 months, the pail began to stink around the clock, even though I cleaned and disinfected it. As the diapers got bigger, changing the liner became a constant chore. I replaced the Genie with a plain old-fashioned diaper pail. Sure, I have to take out the diapers daily, but there is no stench, no two-handed twisting, and no expensive liners to buy. The use of this product was so short-lived that it simply was not worth the money.

And in the beginning when my son's diapers really weren't that bad it was great. However, once he started eating more real food and the diapers were pretty stinky it did not work. Poor guy's whole room would sometimes smell because of the Genie. I've tried cleaning it with bleach, pine sol, and Murphy's Oil (which is what Playtex recommends) but NOTHING gets rid of that smell.

Not only do you have to buy the special liners (annoying and expensive) it's confusing to operate. I finally just used a small trash can in my laundry room and empied it out every few days.

I do have an older model where the cutter was not a part of the unit itself but had to be twisted out of the top cap. Not a very safe idea as my two year old quickly discovered how to take it out herself. I am glad to see that feature has changed. However, the pail itself stinks to no end. It has been cleaned with bleach each time it was emptied and still the smell does not go away. In addition, it seems like the refill always runs out at a bad time, since there is no warning that you are getting to the end. It also seems to be designed for little people as it is so low to the floor. Mine is also broken and has been for some time, though it is still usable.

I was very disappointed. I thought you could just wrap the diaper up and throw it in to be disposed of. Little did I know you had to stick your arm half way down the thing to a certain point, close the lid and the manually turn the rings until you think it's tight enough.

Also it keeps my son's room smelling ok when it is closed but when I empty it his room fills with the smell of urine. It also has to be emptied very often and I'm thinking by the time he is in a large toddler size diaper I will be able to fit two in it. I won't even start on the price of the refills. I'm going to find another thing to put his diapers in that takes basic 13 gallon bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I knew I was in trouble when I had to search the Internet for directions on how to use the Diaper Genie...it came with none! I've been using it for two months now and not a day goes by that I don't curse the stupid thing. It hasn't worked well since day one...every time I put a diaper in it (when using according to directions), the bag rips. I've resorted to using it as a standard bin (instead of \\"sausaging\\" the diapers), which defeats the whole purpose of the design. Odor control is fair, but I attribute that to the fact that it holds relatively few diapers - I have to empty it every night with my 2 month old (and those are little diapers!). Also, the opening is not very wide and gets really nasty (no matter how careful you are). I'm not sure I understand this, since this is the \\"wide opening\\" model....I think I'll spring for the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see the attraction....","review":"Refills are expensive, and the average newborn goes through more than one a month.

Now that he's on solid food and his diapers are more stinky, it is NOT completely odor free like the box claims to be. I can definately smell baby powder scent over poop if I am near the genie.

We bought this item with our first child and it let us down in every possible way! First off the bag refills are to costly, secondly you have to wash this product out on a nightly basis with hot and soapy water to prevent it from smelling up your home which takes out the convience factor of this product! The lid is very fragile as well as the clips that hold the ripper in place. We had a clip break within 2 weeks.I will never use this product agian, you can save money and buy a flip top garbage can just for diapers, it will do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Diaper Genie","review":"I got my Diaper Genie as a shower gift before my son was born in October. Now that he is almost six months old I still like using it. He is now into a size 3 diaper, eating solids, and I have no problem with smell. If it does start to smell (only when emptying diapers), all I do is turn it over and deoderize with a thorough spraying of Lysol. The twist ring has not warped, and I have no problem with changing out the refills as long as I remember to remove the twist ring first. I don't know what other parents are doing to have such problems, but I haven't heard of any of them from anyone here in my town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Have you ever noticed that all first time parents have this, but seldom do you see it used with the second or third child? It is for a good reason, it is a pain! I found it very cumbersome to get the diaper in the container and make sure it was closed back up, while I had a crying, squirming baby in my arms. The the worst part is when you have to open up the bottom, and take out the sausage like package of petrified diapers. They still end up stinking up the baby's room! I have found it is much cheaper, and more sanitary to simply put a diaper pail (or wastebasket with lid) right outside of my sliding glass door. That way I can throw the diapers out, with no nasty smell in the house. And then just take that bag out to the trash along with my kitchen trash. No more carrying poopy diaper links out to the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work","review":"I hate the diaper genie. I like the idea though. If you want to bend over, pop the top off, push a yucky stinky diaper into the pail, and then twist the top in the middle of the night, this product is for you. Someone should improve the idea. You should just be about to step on a pedal that opens the top and drop the diaper in. None of this bend over, push diaper all the way down, and twist top. My Diaper Genie is only about 2mts old and it no longer allows you to push the diapers down unless you take the inner top out, and it no longer cuts the plastic bags. I cut the bags with my sisscers.The diaper genie only holds about a weeks diaper for a 2mt baby. You have to empty the diaper genie from the buttom. It sucks. The refils are about 5 bucks and they only last for about 3wks, depending on your baby. Buy it if you want to waste $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I received this as a shower gift when I was expecting my first child. We used it and it was ok. The plastic clip broke on the lid and the plastic holder for the cutting tool broke soon after we got it, with normal use. It is a pain to twist the bag to get the diapers to seal in the bag. I HATED buying the refill bags for this thing! It doesn't hold very many diapers so you have to change it all the time, and my husband never figured out how to change the bag. A friend of mine had a Diaper Champ and I am getting one of those this time around. With the champ, you can use one hand only and it takes regular kitchen sized garbage bags instead of a particular refill. Don't get the genie, it's a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Anyone who says that this is too difficult to use is either too lazy to read the instructions or not too bright. This thing is awesome. We have used it for over 2 years and it has worked perfectly. You never smell anything, and the refills last a long time. I highly recommend this item. The diapers come out in a hot dog-type fashion, so they all stay together when you emptying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hassle . . . go with Diaper Champ!","review":"I purchased the Diaper Genie and the concept sounded good, but it was much more hassle than worth. First, the cost of buying the refill bags vs. the Diaper Champ (where you use regular plastic bags you get free with groceries)is enough to get me to switch to the Diaper Champ. Those bags can get quite costly.Second, I never did totally figure out how to use the darn thing. You need two hands to dispose the diapers, and can be difficult if you are changing a little one. The Diaper Champ you can use only one hand. Much more convenient. Definitely recommend the Diaper Champ over the Genie:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money!","review":"Just go to the outside trash and put the yucky ones in there. The D.G. is a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job nicely","review":"Given all the different choices of diaper disposal products on the market today (Dekor, etc.), I feel that the Diaper Genie is the best choice. It's easy to use (I don't understand why so many people writing reviews had trouble with it) and holds in odors far better than a regular trash can. Yes, there is still a little bit of smell, but only when I open it, not while it's closed. And, yes, the plastic does unravel for the first few diapers, which is mildly annoying but certainly not a big problem. I use the Diaper Genie for poopy diapers and a large kitchen trash can with a deodorant block inside for pee diapers. That way I save money on the Diaper Genie refills. My son is now 19 1/2 months old, and this has worked wonderfully since he was a newborn. (Actually, I didn't really start using the Diaper Genie until his diapers started to get smellier, like when he started taking more formula.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloth or Disposable Diapers - it's great!","review":"I have used the diaper genie for 15 months now. When my son was first born, we used cloth diapers and used the diaper genie and just gave the diapers to the diaper service in the diaper genie bags. After 8 months when we switched to disposables, we continued to use the diaper genie. We've never had any problems with odor. When he started eating regular table food, and the diapers really started to get unpleasant, we simply switched to the toddler refills (the plastic is a little thicker) and we still love it - no odors! We're expecting our second and have every intention of using the diaper genie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been using my genie for 3 years!","review":"This is a must have for every new parent. We have used out wide mouthed genie for both of our kids now. Our babies rooms have been odor free as long as we empty the genie at least once a week. We stock up when a local store offers the refills buy 3 get one free. The cutter is easy to use... just make sure you twist the bag tight before cutting. I'm not sure why there have been negative comments about this product. If you follow the directions, it's a piece of cake to use. It is also childproof, so you don't have to worry about your kids opening it and smelling up the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this!","review":"No matter what I do, this thing still stinks.

HORRIBLE SMELL WHEN YOU TAKE THE BAG OF DIAPERS OUT7. not scented at all8. not worth the money9. would rather throw diapers in my trash can than in this10. not scented but of dirty diapersAll I have to say is don't make the mistake of buying this item it is not worth it.

We ended up throwing ours away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Product Holder","review":"I got the diaper genie for my baby shower cause I selected it for my registration. I have had it for 14 months and it is completely broken. First, the cutter stopped working in the first month, so I had to use scissors to cut the refill bags when it was needing emptying. Next, the top fell off and won't stay on now. Last the diapers didn't twist how they are suppose to. Overall this is a poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"just threw my genie out!","review":"Using the Diaper Genie is a major hassle. The refills are expensive, and changing them is difficult--I can never get the plastic ring to snap on correctly. Emptying the thing is a major pain, too, as the cutter does not always work properly. And I hate pushing the dirty diaper through the opening. I just tossed my Genie in the garbage. Now I'm using very thin scented bags from the dollar store and just taking out the diapers in a small trash bag at the end of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend Your $$$ On Something Else","review":"Don't waste your money on a Diaper Genie. I had great expectations. I guess I should have had no expectations because we use it no more. It got stinky. And it's just a hassle to use.

YUCK...seemed to never work right during those middle of the night changings...Sent this item BACK wher it came from..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It, Get the Neat Instead!","review":"I got the diaper genie before my daughter was born. We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always \\"escaped\\". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinking about buying a Diaper Genie-Don't bother......","review":"I will make this short and bitter....Everyone said to make sure I get a Diaper Genie so I did. Well, needless to say it was the worst thing I ever bought. It NEVER worked! It would rip the liner bags EVERYTIME. TRhen once the liner is ripped it is a pain fishing the dirty diaper from the bottom of the container and fixing the liner again and again. I even returned the one I bought thinking it was broken....the second one was exactly the same! I even went to the Playtex website to make sure I was installing and using the Diaper Genie correctly....which I was. I started asking every mom what they thought of the Diaper Genie......They all thought the same thing!I strongly suggest to pass on the Diaper Genie and just go with a good garbage can. The Diaper Genie is not worth the money or your time!Kristen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I got the diaper genie when my daughter was born, and since then I have warned all of my expecting friends not to buy it. What a waste of money!! At first, it really did seem to trap the diaper odors, but in emptying the diaper genie, all the trapped odors filled the room quite quickly. Emptying it was quite a process too. The blade that cuts the bag was not sharp at all, and I ended up having to use scissors every time. Also, you end up with a big long chain(kind of like sausages)of wrapped dirty diapers, which I would then have to put into a regular trash bag. It became a smelly, unpleasant task. With the price of this, plus the price of refills, I don't see why anyone would buy it. I am having my second baby next month, and have registered for the Odor-less Diaper Pail. -No dull razors, no smelly diaper chains, no refills, no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to complicated","review":"Maybe I am just goofy....I can not figure this thing out. I even had a girlfriend who had one show me how to use it and I still can't use it. It is the most complicated thing I have ever tried to use.

At first it seemed to work ok. About every third diaper would work fine, now all it does is slice the bag open. It's been more trouble than anything, and if it doesn't work after we use up the refills, I'm giving up. Simply putting the diapers in a plastic bag and throwing it in the dumpster is easier than dealing with [diaper container]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pice of trash","review":"I use this for less than 1 month: The quality of the material (plasitc) is bad and cheap, it doesnt control de odor ( the room really stinks) and it broked after a month of use, and the refills cost too much money! I definetly go with the diaper champ, better odor control, no refill bags ( use conventional kitchen trash bags)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work","review":"I found this product too hard to use. to much time consuming trying to dispose a diaper. by the time this is full and ready to dispose diapers, dirty diapers stayed in baby's room. found this unhealthy.

We live in a townhouse, so there is not much room. Whenever we have had anyone over, they all have the same question: why can't we smell diapers? The answer-the Diaper Genie! Some people I have noticed have complained about it being \\"complicated\\", but if you READ the directions, it is quite simple. I would highly recommend this to anyone having a baby-and if you are having multiples, get multiple Genie's. It is probably one of the most practical things we got for our daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy one? It is a stupid product","review":"I am a new mom and I was told by a friend of mine who has two babies to buy Diaper Genie. I didn't know by purchasing one of these trash cans, I was commiting to $../month worth of refills. I am serious, you can simply use a trash can if you close the dirty diapers completely (if it is a big messy one wrap it inside another bag before trashing it.) I use grocery bags. It works perfectly. No smell in our bathroom and I don't spend any money on refills. I returned my Genie after three months. Playtex was really good for returning it. From an experience mom: don't waste your money on buying something you don't need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Poo Container","review":"When I was given this contraption for my first daughter 3 years ago I thought Wowsers so much better than those little diaper buckets! But for a single mom when the refills were out, you were doomed. 6 to 7 dollars at the time just for a refill! I hated to take the Poop Snake out too, and Heavens forbid if the plastic snagged! The smell was icky, the snake was sometimes sticky, and the price for just the refills was tricky! I would buy a pail that used common Dollar General 1 dollar scented trash bags!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We are on our 2nd Genie and both have broken due to a bad hinge.

I wish I had thought of it! My only complaint is that the first few diapers don't tend to stay separated, I have gotten it to work a few times but it's tricky. As long as there isn't a poopy in the first 3-5 you put in, odor isn't a problem. If I have a poopy after I've just changed it I just take it straight out to the dumpster. No problem! It also is easy to carry for travel when you go on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"This product is a pain!

The genie drove me crazy! The day it broke was a very happy day for us. Everytime I tried to change the bags I had to spend about 30 minutes going through the manual. It took my husband several attempts to get it all put together the 1st time and the 1st time we tried to put in the liners we wasted/ruined a whole container. And there's nothing worse than running out of refills and having to dash to the store. I don't even bother with a diaper pail now, I just toss diapers into plastic grocery bags, tie it off and toss it in the regular trash- or the garage trash. All in all, the genie is complicated, poorly built, and a pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with diaper genie","review":"I do not like the diaper genie at all.

I have since purchased the Diaper Champ which is much easier to use and does not have the awful smell of the diaper genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once the smell gets in it never gets out","review":"We used this product with our first child for over a year. While it is relatively simple to use, it is a pain to replace the bag and also expensive. Our biggest problem though is that after a year of continuous use the thing reeked and no amount of cleaning could get rid of the smell which seemed to become one with the plastic itself. It reminded me of Jerry's car on that Seinfeld episode. For this reason alone, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"more (technology) is NOT better","review":"I was reccommended this product by someone who had one when I was registering so I didn't even look at the other options. If I had I would have realized that this is way more complicated to use and doesn't hold very many soiled diapers compared to other choices. It's also a hassle and needless expenss to have to buy special cartridges for it, esspecially when you still get the smell...and I'm just starting solids now so I can only imagine! I'm going to trust the other reviews and get a diaper champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this product with a PASSION","review":"I used the diaper genie for 2 weeks but had to throw it out. It DOES smell, especially when you're taking out a few days worth to throw away. Oh, the stench is awful. Plus you have to touch the wet smelly plastic to put into another garbage bag to throw out. I might as well have put it in a supermarket plastic bag to begin with. Just put it in, tie it up and toss away. A big waste of money!!! I can't say enough bad stuff about this nasty product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and Smelly!!","review":"I used the diaper genie with my first child and it worked okay for about a month but then it began to smell very bad even though our son's diapers didn't smell bad because he was nursed!!! It was also hard to get the diapers to twist down once it was near full capacity. It didn't store many diapers in the first place. The diaper refills were also pretty expensive. I would not recommend this product. My husband and I are expecting our second child soon and we are going to give the Diaper Champ a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"When I got this as a shower gift I thought it was a great idea, but after I had to change the bag a few times I quickly changed my mind. It's not completely smell-proof and it fills up extremely fast. Having to buy special bags is obviously a pain, especially when they're not exactly easy to locate. The top mechanism is difficult to put back together when changing the refill. I think I've only gotten it right once and I've used this thing for over a year. Changing the bag takes too long so it usually goes undone and I end up using a standard pail anyway. The diaper genie prevents smells better than a standard waste pail would, but if I hadn't gotten it as a gift, I would have trashed it long ago and replaced it with a diaper disposal system that, at the very least, uses standard trash bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing STINKS!","review":"I agree with many of the reviews here. I thought I *had* to have this as a first time mother. What a waste of money! You can only use the special bags and it takes an engineering degree to put it back together when you need to replace the \\"bag cartridge\\". It also SMELLS! It is definately NOT odor free. I would change it every day and I could not get the smell to go away.....even after hot soapy water and bleach! Blech! I ended up taking the diapers to the kitchen trash can and if they are the poopy variety I stick it in a plastic grocery bag, tie it off before putting it in the kitchen trash...I don't have an odor problem now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, buy a diaper pail.","review":"The diaper genie does not keep smells from coming out like they advertise. It smells just as much as any other diaper pail. Refills are over priced, and for the first 3 or 4 times you add a diaper to a newly emptied Diaper Genie, it doesnt twist right. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed!","review":"We received the Wide Opening Genie as a gift. It was a pain in the neck right from the start. The refills were a pain to figure out and we ended up wasting a large amount of the refill trying to get it working properly.(Now that we know how to use it, it is easy to work.) The refills are expensive and you end up paying a fortune to keep the Genie in \\"working\\" condition. My son is two months old and fills the diaper Genie up in a day or two. I can't imagine how quickly it will fill up when his diapers are bigger. In my opinion it would be nice if it were a bit bigger. I think a diaper pail that uses regular bags would be much easier to take to the trash than the stupid sausage. THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS A PAIN!! The smell is ok and hasn't been a problem, but then again his diapers don't smell yet! I would definitely check into other diaper pail options before wasting your money on this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"I recommend this to everyone!

I used the Diaper Genie for my son for over a year and everytime I emptied it, you had to run for the hills from the odor OR you had to wear a gas mask and have a can of Lysol ready to spray. I agree with most reviewers - unless you have the diaper just right between the clips, it falls to the bottom and then the bag is open. If you do get it just right, it is easy to operate. Next time around, I am just getting a plain garbage can, a Stick Up to reduce odors, and will empty the bag more often. Not worth the money for the pail and the refills. And don't get me started on getting the first notch of plastic out of the refill..."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY PLEASED","review":"I think this is an awsome product to keep the smell out. I have had no problems with the smell and my husband empties it out and refills it in less than 5 minutes so it's not very time consuming. The only problem I have to agree with is when I put in the first few diapers, it is true that they are all together and not made into seperate \\"capsuls.\\" Besides that though, I love it and that doesn't make it smell bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product is overrated - Get the Diaper Champ instead!","review":"The Diaper Genie is overrated! It is difficult and clumsy to use, from initial set-up to tying off the bag and preparing it for future use. It fills up very fast, and the refills are expensive. My cousin has the diaper champ, which is much easier, bigger, and can use regular kitchen trash bags. The only reason the Diaper Genie is more popular is because it is more heavily advertised than the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't need this type of hassle with a baby!","review":"EVERYONE told me how I HAD to get the diaper genie when I was pregnant with my son. It is an interesting concept, however, changing the refill is no easy task (the plastic ring warps, making it hard to put back in and the refills are expensive). When my son was a \\"newborn\\", it worked \\"ok\\" in the odor control department since he was only breastfed and his \\"messy\\" diapers weren't that smelly, however, now that he's 7 months old and on solid foods, you can smell the pail from the hallway when it is in his room. I tried everything under the sun to deoderze the pail, but it has an old dirty diaper smell to it constantly, even when empty. I even tried the toddler refills. Also, when we first brought him home, we went through a lot of wet diapers with him, and the genie only held so many newborn diapers, so I was emptying it every other day. Now, with size 3 diapers, I find I have to empty it every day...."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I tried it, and couldn't hate it more!! Who wants to put their hand down into a diaper pail, then turn the thing to seal smell in, and later have to empty a long line of sausage-links? I had a mess every time I emptied the dumb thing.I bought the Diaper Champ instead, the best thing I ever did. It's SO easy, and no paying for special refill bags- you use your own trash bags. I HIGHLY recommend this instead!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to start, expensive refills","review":"Need I say more? Starting the \\"sausages\\" was really hard and they ended up just getting into a big lump. With a newborn you go through so many diapers you end up using about 1-2 refills a week and I couldn't afford that with everything else a newborn needs. When it did start ok it did keep the smell minimal. Oh, there also wasn't anywhere to put wipes after you closed the diaper up and put it in the thing so you end up putting it in the trash where it smells...If you have the time and energy to change the refills at 2am then go for it. My experience is you either love it or hate it. I hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a worthwhile investment","review":"The Diaper Genie is definitely a worthwhile investment. It's quick and easy to use, and definitely cuts down on dirty diaper smell big time. Yes, when it gets full, there is an odor when you open it to empty it, but after all it IS a diaper pail and I guarantee you that if you kept the same amount of diapers in a regular garbage can, the smell would be unbearable. I was a bit skeptical getting it after reading a few of these reviews, but I've been using it for 3 1/2 months with my 4 month old daughter and I don't know why anyone would use a regular wastebasket when you can use this disposal system. As far as the liners are concerned...they're not expensive, last a decent amount of time and are nicely scented. I will definitely continue to use this with my daughter and all future children."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options...","review":"I was given a Genie as a gift as well as a Diaper Champ. The Genie was sort of difficult to reload, took special refills, was not always a one-handed motion (didn't always twist over the used diaper properly), was sort of low to the ground to deal with if I had baby in my arms, and needed to be emptied too soon. The Diaper Champ on the other hand takes my regular kitchen trash bags (cheaper than a genie refill), was super easy to reload, always used a one handed motion, was a bit higher off the ground and just all around easier to use. Even if you think the Genie is an easy product to use, you'll find the Champ makes the Genie suddenly appear complicated. Needless to say after 3 months of using both products we gave the Genie away to let someone else figure out if they like it. It's better than nothing at all after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nursery must-have","review":"While this system first seemed a little tricky, after reading the instructions and using it a time or two, I found it was really quite easy.

So we decieded to get the diaper champ instead. The great thing is it actually works and you do not need to buy any specific refill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Genie","review":"This item certainly does its job. It keeps the foul smells trapped. You just need to keep up with the refills. With a fourteen month old, we are still using this product. If our baby only has urine in her diaper, we throw it in the trash; all other diapers go into the Diaper Genie. We do that to save on cost of the refills. The only other thing I would point out is that sometimes when you install the refills, the initial twisting is not that smooth and needs to be fiddled with, but otherwise works well. All in all, it is a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money","review":"This is the worst item i have. It requires too much work and is a pain to operate. We have come to the conclusion that we need something that will keep the smell out and any one with do. The twisting just waste paper. It is hard to use and a waste of money.

I was told by several people that it is a waste of money. buyer be ware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!","review":"I heard lots of stories and read lots of reviews about the diaper genie. I put it on my baby registry and just had to have it. So, after receiving it as a shower gift, I couldn't wait to use it. I enjoyed it the first few times, but found that it was becoming more of a pain and inconvenience than I needed. It filled up quickly in the first couple of days and I couldn't imagine going through the emptying process or replacing of the film all the time. I have realized that it's a lot easier and a lot less expensive to use plastic ziploc sandwich baggies or freezer storage bags, which can hold up to 6 dirty diapers, while also locking in the smell. If I had the box for the diaper genie system, I would gladly return it to the store, as I have only used it a handful of times and don't plan on using it again. The money would have been better spent on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best alternative","review":"Since there's nothing nice about the smell of dirty diapers, I recommend the Diaper Genie, which significantly decreases odors. After the first few refill loadings and diaper emptyings, I didn't find it hard to use at all.

After being in friends' nurseries with ordinary diaper pails, I am happy to spend the money on refills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!!","review":"In my opinion, this product is a huge waste of money. Sure, it's odor free until you go to empty it. If you don't empty the container outside, then your whole house will smell for hours. The refills are expensive.

Spend the extra $5 on one of the competitors, I'm going to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"It took us about 10 diaper changes to realize we were turning the part that cuts the plastic, not twists it. I have at least 5 friends who did the same thing. I think it's a pain to change the refill too. When we ran out of refills I stopped using it. I does keep the smell down with the lid closed. I think it's just as easy to throw #1 diapers in the trash and tie poopy diapers in a plastic shopping bag and throw them in the trash outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should rename this the Diaper Gip!","review":"This thing is a waste of money. It fills up too fast and the refills are expensive. I recommend the Diaper Champ. You don't have to use any special bags, just regular trash bags, and it holds a lot more diapers. Stay away from the Diaper Genie. It sounds neat but it's not. It's annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it as a gift....and then returned it for the $$$","review":"It's a neat idea...the problem is...the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience. Honestly, my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in. They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers. At the end of the day, we toss them out into the garage...end of story. If you really need this kind of doodad, there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag...that's much better than this deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Genie... go back in your box","review":"Everyone I know who is a new parent has one of these things. They also have given up on it after a while. I don't know anyone that actually bought it for themselves... it's always a registry gift, or a hand-me-down. It's a nice concept, but it doesn't use regular bags, and you have to shove your hand along with the poopy diaper into it. That alone was enough for me to switch to the Champ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return IT!","review":"Does not keep odors out! While nursing the diapers do not smell bad and the Diaper Genie was great. When my baby got on solids, the Diaper Genie was SMELLY! I would walk into my baby's room thinking he had a dirty diaper when in fact it was the Diaper Genie! I didn't have problems with changing the refills, just with the BAD ODOR. I tried using Baking Soda and Lysol, but the odor will not go away! A few co-workers told me they had the same problem and had to get rid of theirs. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This thing was horrible and while I got it as a gift and didn't have to buy it myself, I wish I had known it was so useless and I would've returned it for something else. It's so hard to start and the directions don't help at all. My husband and I asked 6 other people to help and see if they could do it, but no one could!! We have ended up just using a regular trash barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will get a [diffrent kind]next time.","review":"This was a nightmare to assemble. I don't like buying the refills and it fills up FAST.I broke the hinges trying to refill it the first time.I will try the ...next time - you can use your own bags. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can breathe!","review":"We registered for a diaper genie and got one. I needed to empty the genie about every 2-3 days and a refill seemed to last a reasonable amount of time (a month?).For our second son we thought we'd try a more economical approach and bought a diaper pail that didn't require refills. It had a blue lid (I think the manufacturer is Safety 1st). Boy was that a bad move! After 1 day of dirty diapers from 2 boys, you couldn't enter the bathroom without needing to hold your breath. A covered trash can could probably do the same job. We went back to the diaper genie and are REALLY glad. No odor whatsoever.Although the refills bill isn't fun, it is worth it to not have the smell around or take out the \\"pail\\" daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"After switching diaper pails twice I decided to try the Diaper Genie. I found that it was a little hard to get started and it doesn't come with any directions that are helpful, but I found that once you learned how to use it, it wasn't that hard. It keeps out smells very well. The only downfall is that you have to keep turning the cutting system and your hand gets real tired after a while. Other than that it is really worth getting if your trying to get rid of smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"To expensive","review":"I bought this because I was told how wonderful it was, but when I started looking at costs of refills etc... I returned it. I am breastfeeding and BF soiled diapers don't really smell very strong so I saw no added value in this gadget. PLus we use both cloth and disposables and this just simply wouldn't work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Diaper Genie!","review":"I got my first Diaper Genie for my son, who is now 7 years old. I am still using the same Genie for my daughter who is turning 2 and I am planning on using it for baby #3 who is on the way. The Genie has certainly lasted through daily use. It is very easy to empty and put the refills back in the unit. I have never ever had a problem with odors with my Diaper Genie. It's a great product and certainly worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for households with two or more children in diapers","review":"I think this product is a waste of time and money. All the twisting and cutting and emptying and adding refills. It's easier to use a regular trashcan with an air freshner. As for the smell factor, the diaper genie does mask the smell of newborn diapers but toddler diapers are a different story, those need to go outside or to the garage trash immediately. It may be a great product for the one baby household but for anyone with two or more children in diapers (I had twin newborns and a toddler), it's not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great product. A lot of people seem to complain about all the \\"set up\\" work to the diaper genie, but really there is nothing to it. The only down side is it doesn't hold a lot of diapers"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important thing to have","review":"This is by far the best baby item around. You will use it every day, it is easy to use, easy to refill, easy to clean and stays fresh. Make sure you have it on your registry. It is cheap and so are the refills. Add a few of those to your registry too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is great","review":"Once it is set up properly, and I have to admit , it took a while to figure it out right, it works great. I have no problem keeping this in my bedroom because there is no bad smell and it is extremely convenient. In fact the liner smells like it is scented so when you open the top to put a diaper in, it actually smells pleasant. The only difficulty is when it fills up and you have to empty it before the refill empties. We just end up cutting off the used diapers and tying a new knot. My husband loves it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I fell for all the hype too. Thought it would be a great idea. My husband and I sat down and messed with this thing over and over trying to get the twisting mechanism to work without squishing a diaper in our hand. Nasty. Not sure about the smell thing, we just tried it with plain diapers first to see if it worked ok. I returned it 2 days after I bought it. We went back to the store and bought a covered garbage can and keep it in the bathroom. Between the mechanism not twisting properly and the bags never sealing or cutting it was more time consuming than helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about disappointment","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child, everyone insisted that I must have a diaper genie and talked about how wonderful it was. I found the product did not live up to the hype. First of all, it never hid the odor of the diaper. You could still smell a strong odor of dirty diaper in my daughter's room. Second, the mechanism to cut the plastic bags when you are ready to dispose of the diapers never worked properly. Finally, the top of the diaper genie broke off after only a few months and would constantly fall off. I was not at all happy with this product and will buy a different brand to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed product","review":"Out of the box, literally nothing on this product has worked. The product documentation was missing, the product had to be forced to open (and clearly had been forced together during manufacturing), the trash insert deally was not installed properly ... Playtex could have only missed the mark further by failing to put the product in the box at all. On second thought, that may have been an improvement.What's truly frustrating, however, is the design of the product. While the idea is somewhat clever, it simply doesn't work that well. My main complaint: I can't easily manage it with my hands full -- which they always are when I'm changing diapers. Ultimately, I'm not willing to give up ease of use for a moderate delay in handling smelly trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"We purchased this for our newborn just 3 weeks ago and threw it out within the first week, it is terrible, very confusing, we even tried to use it with a new refill pack and it did not turn! I bought the Dekor pail and it is awesome highly recommed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't new parents have enough to learn?","review":"I've read the good and bad reviews, and I have to agree with everything bad. This product is a waste. Oh, I figured out how to use it, and I did realize that I had to clean it. (I am not a moron just because I had a bad experience with the diaper genie.) But it does smell, and it does unravel for the first few diapers. And when you are trying to keep your cold crying child on the changing table in between diapers, do you really need to try to figure out how to throw the old one away? Why should it be difficult? You have one goal to accomplish, and that is putting on a fresh diaper and snuggling your baby. Don't waste your time with this product. Who needs that frustration at 3:00 am?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The negative reviews were right!!! :o(","review":"I agree with the other negative reviews on this item.....it stinks, literally & figuratively!!!!!!! It's just not worth the hassle!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissatisfied.","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child over 7 years ago, I thought this was a necessity. I learned very quickly how inconvenient the item really was. First of all you have to use specific disposable bags with it unlike similar products that you can just use any small trash bag (which is much more convenient and economical). After attempting to stuff diapers into this unit and becomming tired of the fight in the middle of the night, I purchased a safety first model that could be used with a regular small size trash bag. I liked the safety 1st model SO much better. However, now that I am on baby number 3, I have learned that my upright step open aluminum trash can (which is sleek and stylish as well) works better than anything to hold the diapers and keeps the baby's room from the unwanted odors. It locks in any odor there may be and it is SO convenient. Hope you all learn something from this. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatable with Windows media player","review":"I was disappointed that when installed Windows media would not reconize the CD burner. I could still burn using the enclosed Nero suite but found it a real pain. If the unit does not work with the media player it should be stated upfront."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, Variable Music","review":"This cd is a just as it says, a guide. It has several different types of music for different kinds of belly dance (sword, tribal, cabaret, etc). I love the order of them too, you could put the CD in and do an entire show to it since it alternates between fast and slow songs. #9 is a beautiful, sensual, slow piece, #4 is a great song too, starts out slow -perfect for floor work - and builds up faster into almost a drum solo. The entire CD is instramental, so if you like vocals, its not for you. Its also fairly traditional and \\"cabaret\\" sounding, not very \\"night clubby\\" or \\"pop music\\". I think everyone could find a few songs they like on it. Good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gulag gets it right!","review":"I can't believe the reviewer from East Asia. Somehow he/she missed the point. The point was to depict what was going on in the Soviet Union at a time Soviet revisionists in the West were writing that the Soviet system was strong, viable, and was transforming into some sort of Euro-style socialist democracy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even the CIA missed the boat on what really was going on (read Walter Laquer's book on the fall of the Soviet Union). Without the character played by the American, there would have been no story. The movie was contrasting the spirit of American \\"can do\\" with Russian fatalism. I suspect the reviewer from East Asia has some affinity for either socialism or communism and this is his real objection to the moview. Great movie!

I think he'd have done quite well at it. The movie is kinda predictable, but most of the performances aren't bad. I've been watching the local pawnshops for a copy for several years now, just glad I could finally get it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this cable","review":"Bought the cable thinking it was a good, inexpensive product.

You pay more but you won't get ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken out of the box","review":"The cables produced static and hissing in the audio and actually made the picture worse then the cables that came with the Wii (everything has a green hue).

I think the only improvment i can see is the controller response may be just a little quicker. But i guess all in all a wii just isn't capable of hd graphics, but really 480p isnt really hd. Main reason for purchase was to free up my standard cable input on tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a great improvement in the quality of the video of the Nintendo Wii, got to admit I was a bit skeptical at first but the moment I started using i saw the difference between cables, 100% recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Link.","review":"I highly recommend this if you want a better quality picture from your wii on your HDTV. however - it reduces the size of the picture to a fraction of the size of the tv screen - I don't love that. but the picture quality is much better and I don't have any problem with the well constructed cables at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plug & play with a Noticeable difference","review":"A great value & a definite upgrade.

All I can say is that the images using these cables are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cable for WII","review":"I got this cable for COD Black Ops.

Its a great addition to any wii owner to make his games look that much sharper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good cable at a good price","review":"If you own a TV that has component video jacks and supports progressive scan, you need this cable. While the Wii's output will never be HD quality, the 480p picture made possible by this cable is a significant improvement over what the pack-in composite video cable puts out.An added bonus is that this Nyko cable costs a lot less than Nintendo's component video cable. Plus it's sturdily built and it's easy to distinguish the audio plugs from the video plugs (the audio plugs have gray cords instead of white). What's not to like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashing Dots","review":"This Cable Worked Fine For a Few Days, And Then red green and blue dots started flashing constantly all over the screen during games.

We only play with the Wii occasionally, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints, great quality","review":"It's a crime that the Wii doesn't come standard with a component video cable in this day and age, but thanks to companies like Nyko, there are decent product solutions on the market for a decent price. The composite cables that come packaged with the Wii limit the resolution to 480i (a \\"decades-old\\" technology). Although it's not true HD, component video cables such as the \\"HD Link\\" from Nyko improve the output to 480p which is equivalent to DVD-quality.On a standard TV, you may not notice much difference. On an HD display, the difference is significant though far from excellent. Until Nintendo releases an HD version of the Wii, it's the best you can do for now. The HD Link from Nyko is a durable set of gold-plated cables. Buy them with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy.","review":"I have a standard definition CRT. I can only get 480i. I purchased the cable because I didn't want my baby girl pulling on the composite cable that was plugged in the front of the tv before. I also reasoned that if we ever do purchase an HDTV this cable would allow the 480p resolution that the Wii provides. One unforseen benefit to using this cable is that it passes a digital signal which makes it possible to set the tv display to either full screen or widescreen. If I'm not exactly right about that one feel free to correct me. The cable works as expected so far, and for a good price. The only issue that I may have to deal with in the future is that the audio cables can not be split any further from the video. If I end up getting a separate sound system I'll just pick up extension cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price","review":"Needed to connect Wii to new plasma TV. Purchased this to connect to 1 of the multiple component jacks. Works great, good picture and sound.

The right channel audio did not function and buzzed. The video colors were also screwed up as well. I used the input same inputs on my TV that I use for my DVR and had no problems so it was definitely the cable. I was kind of annoyed since I had just taken apart my entertainment center setup to run the cables and it was so messed up.

My only question to myself is if I really needed it.If you have a home theatre reciever that upconverts video you will, more than likely, see no difference in quality with these cables. The audio hookups are no different than the ones suplied wit the Wii so the value is where?If you don't have an upconvert option, I guess you'll see a little improvement but not much since the Wii doesn't go full high def.In short, you'll be paying an above average premium for very average to below average improvement of video quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions well, poorly designed.","review":"First off, Amazon, this isn't a game. You asked me how fun it was? It's a cord to plug the Wii into the TV. Stupid.Beside that, this cord was pretty mediocre actually. It performs the function it was designed to do, but at the same time it damaged my TV. The red plug for HD video was not made at the right diameter for the input on the TV, and when I eventually got it in, it damaged the vsync function on my television.But, it does work great for \\"HD\\" on the Wii. I can actually read text now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know if I like this","review":"Purchased this item for my wii hoping that it would strengthen the graphics on my 50 inch tv and minimize any system lag. The link did its job in taking away the blurry lines at the end of images. However, in its place it left very boxy pixelations. I feel like I am playing super nintendo again. I think I would prefer the blurriness because at least I couldn't notice how poor the game resolution was. I'm going to keep using this product, however it didn't quite meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Hd Cables","review":"Ecellent product, love the picture, real Hd quality even though it is not 1080p its pretty close.thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I bought these because my receiver is ONLY connected to the HDTV via component cables. Although it has 3 composite video inputs, it cannot switch a composite video source and output video through the component cables to the HDTV. The other alternative was to connect the video directly to the TV, but then I'd have to switch source on the TV and sound on the receiver... not very elegant. I have a logitech unified remote that I could program to do this but still... not very elegant :)Anyway, the cables give a slight improvement in color, but barely perceptible. 480p, after all, is S-VIDEO so basically late 80s technology. Anyone with a Wii knows not to expect 1080p resolution with complex shaders and effects, so I don't think you'll be let down with this product, especially if your receiver is like mine and can't switch composite video to a component signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not neccessarily needed but works great","review":"This product does exactly what it says gives you a 480p connection which is great for those of us that play on hdtvs instead of widening the screens via the tv. But really it doesn't do much the graphics do come out a little sharper and obviously less stretched out. So in my opinion it was well worth the money I spent and works just as good as the 1st paty would and saves money so I would recommend to those who play on hdtvs but don't expect much out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video quality improvement","review":"The cable provides a slight video improvement.

Since I do not use my Wii very frequently, these cables probably were used about four times. I turned on my Wii today to play, and the cables had stopped working.

If you need another cable anyway, go for it, but the \\"HD\\" part of the name is obviously a sham, since the Wii does not have HD output."},{"rating":"2","title":"These cables did exactly what they're supposed to do","review":"Someone on one of the Wii forums I frequent suggested getting component cables if you had an HDTV. We have a large screen LCD display and I thought the games already looked pretty good, and after all the Wii can only put out up to 480p anyway. What I didn't realize is that unless you use component cables you're getting 480i or 240 lines as opposed to 480p or 480 lines. So I decided to try these cables.It took only a couple minutes to disconnect the cable that came with the Wii and connect this one. I then went into the Wii options setting menu and changed the screen and TV resolution. There was a good improvement in the graphics of the games. The first game I tried it on was Endless Ocean and it was noticeably clearer. The Shaun White Snowboarding game looked great too.I'd highly recommend these cables to anyone who wants a clearer, crisper picture on their Wii games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal on component cables for the WII!","review":"I bought this primarily to have the WII output via component to our AV receiver...our AV receiver then takes the signal and up converts it to 1080p to our TV.Simple product, works as it should, and it is a great value when purchased via Amazon.You dont need this cable if you are going direct from the WII to your TV....I dont think moving from regular analog video to component video will add any value to the WII experience.This only makes sense if:1. YOu dont have any analog jacks left and need to use component jacks.2.

The two best songs on the album are \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Kiss\\". \\"Evolution\\" is supposed to be the headlining song for the album, but is just okay. The album just feels rushed. Don't know how true that is, but even if it wasn't, it sounds that way. The only song on the album that sounds like KoRn is \\"Hold On\\". That is a very strong song and about the only one play from this album. Needless to say, this gets skipped a lot on my iPod. I'd say the worst album by the band, but luckily they got better with the next album.

Even Jonathan said they are going for an old schoolsound that people can bang their heads to and go wild. Come on..have some faith, this next album should winus Solid Korn fans over again. This might be their last chance ,pleeease dont f*** it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution of Korn...","review":"Korn's new album, Untitled, is very experimental. In many ways a lot of the See You On the Other Side is carried over, yet there is a softer side to, an example being I Will Protect You. It is not the heaviest most hardcore, yet it is more sweet and many of the songs more memorable than any Korn song ever. The composing of each song was done well, and the lyrics are a lot more intelligent this time around. It is more mainstream, but real fans of Korn should not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's experimental. It's weird. And it's GREAT!","review":"I've always favored KoRn's more experimental music over their aggressive, but in the right combination, like on UNTOUCHABLES and TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR, it works quite well. Now I can add this untitled release (really, is it OFFICIALLY called \\"untitled?\\") to the above sentence.Otherworldly effects, strange beats and melodies, more singing and less gibberish - yet underlying it all, a sound that is undeniably KoRn. Much like the warped creatures and beings which haunt the artwork accompanying this album (take THAT, downloaders!), this album is still recognizeable as the KoRn that we \\"later stuff\\" lovers have always worshipped.Fans of \\"their old stuff\\" might not like this, but then such people are probably too close-minded to see the doughnut surrounding the hole. This is KoRn at their most experimental to date, and it is a fine release indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"less heavy but more meaningful","review":"True its not the heavier korn album but somehow it seems like Jonathan Davis has put more heart into this album.

As with any other online music purchase, take advantage of the previews and listen to part of all the songs before you decide to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"This is easily the best album since Untouchables. Korn is always at their best when they don't try to sound like themselves and that is pretty much why Take A Look In The Mirror falls short. See You On The Other Side was a major improvement over that but this was much better than even that. If you're a fan of their more mainstream works such as Follow The Leader you may not find what you're looking for here look somewhere else because thats not what Korn is about anymore. If you want something new and interesting then this is where its at. It's almost a direct descendent of Untouchables and SYOTOS but it has a crazy energetic undercurrent kind of like Life Is Peachy. This album sounds less like Korn than Untouchables (which up until now was their most out there sounding album) but its an expansion of their sound. It might not hit you right away. It goes down sort of like Jager but when it hits its all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It I Like it...","review":"Hints of the past and going into the future. Have always liked Korn from the start.Always taking risks and going in differnet directions. That is cool with me.Hope it is cool with you. Many real cool songs here,that will not bore. Starting Over,Bitch We Got a Problem,Evolution,Hold On,Ever Be,Innocent Bystander and Killing are the standouts.Patented rockers and slower gloom songs from the guys. \\"Ever Be\\" could be the real sleeper here.Slow and mysterious. Some songs were penned by Terry Bozzio before he left. If you have been a fan of Korn from the beggining and didn't give up on them,I recommend this highly.Even for those who gave up after a particular album or so.I give it a strong 4.Haven't listened enough to go higher,but am sure in time will raise the stars..No \\"Head\\" or David Silveria for this one,but real good and they stay true to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album to date.","review":"This is their best effort to date.

Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A year of Change and trying new things.","review":"Looking at numerous cds that have come out this year thus far, you can find one big thing, change (in varying degrees). A lot of artists have been trying new sounds and styles to see if it will work out and to find a new page in the history of their careers in music.This album is another one of those albums. Korn has definitely walked away from a lot of its grungy heavy metal and stepped into a world of more \\"delicate\\" style of rock. The essence of Korn is still there, the lyrics are still very raw and powerful. Though, if you largely purchased Korn cds in the past for their heavy on the bass and craziness, you might want to sample the music first. Overall if you are a fan, don't be afraid to buy the cd, accept the change and grow with the artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"head, where are you?","review":"Since the departure of Head, Korn was never quite the same...

If you're a KoRn fan and you like this album then you should be ashamed of yourself. By the Way...that was a quote from my mom and she said she listens to ELO songs that rock harder...and I am not joking. Listen, I'm fine with bands trying to expand and experiment with their music (ie. Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Duran Duran) but experiment with a few songs, not the entire album. Very few bands are talented enough to pull it off. I love all kinds of music, but at the end of the day I'm a rocker through-N-through and I expect my \\"heavy\\" bands to do what they do best...and thats RAAAAWK!

This was the first time I can honestly say that I wasted money on music. I never thought it could be this terrible. The SYOTOS album took a bit of getting used to, but still it was tollerable once you listened to it a few times.

Still, he writes effectively about some of the Pathet Lao depredations of the family business and disruption of education.The fantasy of the Laotian American is puerile in the worst sense and the attempt to do a Southeast Asian _Like Water for Chocolate_ fails.Writing about a wimp doesn't have to be wimpy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moosie","review":"My dog bandit goes just nuts for stuffed mooses.

Truly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saylor Strikes Again","review":"Yet another fine novel from Steven Saylor. Despite an awkward beginning (a contrived explanation by Gordianus to his daughter about the Roman government), Murder on the Appian Way quickly throws the reader into the turmoil that marked Rome in the 50s B.C. Much better written than McCullough's Masters of Rome series, it also provides a point of view of major events from someone other than the major players, while still showing us the human side of such figures as Cicero and Marc Antony. As others have commented, this one is less mystery than some of its predecessors, but it is historical fiction at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much history not enough mystery","review":"I have been reading the Sub Rosa series this summer. The first novel Roman Blood was a superior mystery.The author put the reader in Rome. The mystery was beautifully plotted; the characters came alive. I was happy. the other books were not as good, but I stayed with them. This one is the low point, so far. I had trouble sustaining interest in reading this. I finished finally to a no surprise ending. the mystery was especially transparent. I usually keep he mysteries that I red, but this one I threw away at the hotel. I hope these stories get better. If the next one is not better, I will skip reading any others."},{"rating":"1","title":"very factual","review":"This book is dry as dust. I kept feeling like I was getting good factual information about Roman culture of the period, but I couldn't stay interested because the characters aren't developed well. I couldn't make myself care.

After this, I'll stick with Lindsey Davis's series - any of those books is sure to be \\"a good read\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This could have been a blockbuster novel. The characters are far more lively than the cardboard cutouts found in most works. Yet something is missing. That something is plausibility.

This is not realistic and so a most promising novel falls short of making the grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very inviting and warm book","review":"I had to read this book for a clciv class. I didn't really expect much from this book at first, but after a few chapters I realized how good this book really is. The author did an excellent job in developing the characters. The story moves along very smoothy. The dialouge between characters is very intelligent and thoughtful.Do not believe the reviews that trash this book. Most likely these are college students forced to read this book which they had no interest in otherwise. You have to have an idea and opinion of Roman civilization before you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revising my opinion upward","review":"I reviewed this book in 1997 and gave it a negative review.

I thought that, like the prequel \\"Catalina's Riddle\\", Saylor's book was fun and unpredictable. The story keeps you guessing at who was where, when and why! The story kept me wanting to read because I truely felt like I connected in some way to the book. Every time Bethesda, the mother of Eco, Meto and Diana and wife of Gordianus, is brought up in the story, she always reminds me of my own mother. - caring and occasionally worrisome. Saylor not only provided a great mystery story, he also developed the characters to a point where you, the reader, can almost feel like they know the person. I would definately reccomend this book and any of Steven Saylor's book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteries aside for a moment","review":"\\"A Murder on the Appian Way\\" is less of a mystery novel than Saylor's previous books in this series. There is still a mystery but the resolution is based on accidental encounters more than investigation. However, we get to see Rome as a confused, dangerous, and determined to remain civilized city as the clock counts down on the Republic. We briefly meet some of the big names you've heard of in Roman history courses but only briefly as would make sense for a mere \\"finder\\". No, this book is best read as an exploration of Roman society and of Gordianus' family as it grows up and increases in number, complications, and love. Gordianus would be considered a poor Roman father and husband in his day but for us, he is understandable and expressive. This novel made me more interested in him than any of the previous novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plot in need of an editor","review":"While the book has good historical info, it is a rather droll read. Saylor drifts woodenly around historical events, more like driftwood caught in a whirlpool, than a Roman war trireme circling in for a kill.I really wanted to like this book, but it takes effort to finish it.If you want to read good Roman adventure, I suggest reading Julius Caesar's \\"Conquest of Gaul\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to Saylor's ancient Rome detective series","review":"Steven Saylor's fifth detective novel, set in 52 B.C.Rome, continues the gripping series of exploits of oneGordianus the Finder.

This book allows the the history and life of Rome to literally come to life. I found that by reading this book our society today compares directly to that of the entire Roman Empire.

It plays almost anything you throw at it: Divx, Xvid, AVI, MPG, MP3. The component output looks great. The HDMI upconversion looks even better. HDMI results in a brighter picture with much more detail. Set up is a bit time consuming, because everything is adjustable. Read the owner's manual first. This deck even upconverts CD Audio to a user selected bitrate. The only downside to HD upconversion DVD players is that sound is not carried on the HDMI cable. This has to do with MPAA and copywrite infringement - they want you to buy HD-DVD/BluRay version of movies you already own.

A copper contact shaped like a tiny rivet in the DPDT switch fell off its armature. A bit of solder should hold it in place indefinitely.

Not really an option when listening for your baby, which is why you have it in the first place! I do like that it has a regargable battery but it is not worth buying for that alone!

Often there's a fuzzy buzzing in between the beeps. It's loud enough to wake me up and loud enough to obscure baby sounds.

I could hear my son's breathing and little sighs easily with the monitor on 4.The negatives: There was static from the thing--always. Also, on random nights we would hear odd little blips about 2 seconds apart. Did I try turning off appliances, etc.? Yes. Did I move the monitor to different locations? Yep. In addition to being curious about what was causing these sounds, I never could figure out the reason why the blip happened on some nights and not on others.Also, I recently discovered that if I changed the channel my husband and I were treated to the goings-on of little \\"Jackie\\" and his parents, who apparently live somewhere in our neighborhood. I really do hope that they weren't able to listen in to us. The final straw was the loud interference the monitor would emit when I turned on a fan in my son's room.

So far, so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"May keep you awake!","review":"While this does what a monitor is basically supposed to do, I would frequently be startled awake by \\"cracking\\" and \\"popping\\" noises throughout the night.

Better yet, I rather throw it out into the street and run it over with my SUV. Plus they call it \\"crisp and clear\\"?? They got to be kidding me. The thing was a static machine. After researching, I am not the only one who had this problem with the 2 second beeping from the base. I got [a different brand monitor] and I absoultely love it!!

Since then, I keep it on setting one and can hear wonderfully. It's great to be able to hear him breathing.The only problem I've run into is when I have my cordless phone in use next to the carrier unit.

But this one was terrible. Our house is compact, but even in the next room (10-15 feet), it would go out of range and get such severe static that the baby was inaudible. Then it developed this bizarre habit of period static that got longer and more frequent as time went on, until it was nearly driving us mad. We thought it was just our house or was because we have cordless phones and live close to our neighbors. But then we tried the Fisher Price Sound N Lights monitor and our problems were 100% solved - plus, it's cheaper. I would not recommend this First Years monitor - or their other electronic products - to other parents (we also have their crib white noise machine and it gobbles batteries like no tomorrow)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor range","review":"I bought this monitor because of the good review that it got in the Baby Bargains book but am now in the market for a new monitor.

We called the 1st years 800 number to explain the problem only to find out that if we placed batteries in the base unit (we did just in case there was a power failure) only to find out that it damages the unit and voids the warranty!

We have tried moving it around the room, making sure that our cordless isn't in the room, turning off lights, etc., and the thing won't shut up. It (not my child) has woken me up with the static so many times in the middle of the night that it has driven me to tears and to sleeping in the adjoining room next to my child so I can hear her and turn off the monitor so at least my husband can sleep.The only good feature about this monitor is the light display, but I certainly wouldn't buy this monitor again. I'm shopping for another one right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very Well!!!","review":"We purchased this moniter since a friend reccomended it to us.

I can't even use it and have had to sleep on the couch for the first 3 weeks so that I can hear the baby crying. We either get loud noises every 5-10 seconds (even when moving it to several different places in the room) or get interference from cell/cordless phones.

It is impossible to think of not owning a monitor, let alone one that does not offer clear sound. We have the monitor placed in the nursery on a wall opposite the crib, and can still hear him breathing. In fact, the monitor is so clear, I haven't been able to use it next to my bed because I hear every move he makes. The only thing negative about this monitor is that it will pick up neighbor feedback.

Overall, we have enjoyed this monitor a great deal and bring it with us everywhere we go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree!","review":"I also had static problems. I'm wondering if it is due to the fact that this monitor has just two channels. Is this standard for others? It's my first monitor, and we selected it because it seemed simple and uncomplicated.

Based on our experience, it was not a good product at all. There was so much interference which we (at first) blamed on different legitimate things (airplanes, phones, appliances plugged in nearby). The reception was so bad when you were talking at a loud voice in the nursery, you could only hear mumbling and not understand a word being said. We finally decided there was no legitimate excuse for all the probolems when my husband had it on and was sitting in the porch swing. The interference flared up as he was swinging back and forth! That was riduculous so we returned it and got the Fisher Price Vibrating Monitor instead - same price, and boy is it so much better. Absolutely no interference or static and you can hear and understand every single word whispered in the nursery. With all the problems it would be smart to not bother buying this monitor at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're pretty happy with it","review":"No, it's not perfect, but we don't know of a monitor that is.

I like the rechargeable batteries, the light display and that the base and receiver can both run on batteries. However, it has not been very useful for me because of the static and feedback that occur often enough to be annoying (and loud when you have the volume turned up). It does pick up well if you are only a room or two away, but then why use a monitor? I really need it for outside, but it looses its signal two feet from the door. I am looking for a new monitor tomorrow and feel this one was a waste of money. I'm a little confused how one product can get such opposing reviews, so maybe it has something to do with where you live.???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy Monitor","review":"This monitor has so much interference and static it isn't worth having a monitor!

They're easy to remove and throw is the wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"When I was a brand-new mom, eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery, I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available. Good thing I bought so many, because each time baby oozed, leaked, squirted, spit up, fountained, or otherwise made a baby mess, I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes, then remove the pad cover, toss it in the wash, and put a new cover on. Doesn't sound like much work, but considering how many messes babies can make, changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore. On top of that, the terrycloth just doesn't clean well, even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout! It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser. Don't waste your money buying pad covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Unfortunately I didn't listen to the reviews... sigh. This changing pad cover is truly awful -- it shrinks, just as described by the other reviewers, and it also kept catching on my ring. I used it only a couple of weeks before finally throwing it away. Don't think you have to buy this cover to fit over a contoured changing pad. I bought Wendy Bellisimo's from BabysRUs and they fit great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Necessary","review":"I used mine for the first week. Now I just lay down cloth diapers or burp clothes.

We bought two to go with the changing pad, and they shrunk so badly that they really don't fit the pad anymore. It scrunches up the corners, and the pad is now mis-shapen--after 3 weeks. Look for something else! They are overpriced and will only fit till you wash them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this cover","review":"As a shower gift I received this cover as well as one by Tykes that is no longer available through Babies r us. Well, I was shocked to find that a product by Simmons - the same manufacturer of my changing pad does not fit the pad. I can only assume they did not preshrink the fabric. The Tykes ones fit beautifully. My advice - don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great.","review":"These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings. In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides. Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top. This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"The covers do not fit the changing pads!","review":"I purchased the Simmons 16X32 changing pad and a couple of the Simmons 16X32 pad covers. To my disapointment after washing the covers they do not even come close to fiting over the changing pad. They are about 3 inches short.

It adds a nice girl touch to her room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really like this one","review":"I registered for both the Simmons changing pad and two covers for my shower. I received the pad but no covers. We purchased a cover from USA Baby (where we bought furniture) first. That cover works well, and has the slots for the safety straps. I only had the one at first, and it has been washed a lot with no shrinkage or fading (I have yellow). My mom purchased a Simmons cover from my registry (you really do need two covers!) two months ago. The color is a nicer shade of yellow (we have the Suzy's Zoo decor from Babie's R' Us), but that is the only thing I like. I washed it once before use in cold water and it was very difficult to put on the pad. I had to bend the pad to get the cover to fit. Now I have bent corners on my pad! I also hate that theree are no slots for the safety straps. One would think that since Simmons made the pad, they would make the cover to fit correctly! I have since bought another cover from USA Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover is not very good","review":"After the first wash the chaning pad cover shrunk a little to small to fit the contoured changing pad (and still be able to lay flat) and there were a few pulls in the terrycloth.

They are mediocre. I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use. I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places. I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap...one is not present. Finally, I used it with the changing pad by \\"Especially for Baby\\" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers. They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff!), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I wish that the cover had holes cut out for the safety straps on the pad.

We haven't even had our baby yet, we've just washed the covers once so they're clean before we use them for the first time. They both look like they've been used for years, after only one washing.

I wouldn't recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!","review":"I am a first time mom, and I registered for the Simmons changing pad & 1 cover. I received both as gifts and imagine my shock and disbelief when I found out that the Simmons cover doesn't fit the Simmons changing pad!! Even before washing, the cover was too tight and after wash it got even worse. I bought 2 more colors thinking maybe they would fit better. I completely wasted my money!! Simmons better do the math and figure out the correct measurements for their own pad.Anyway, I called my friend that also just had a baby and she told me she had the same problem. Then she told me about a stretch terry cover that's made by Especially for Baby which fit perfect!! Buy that product instead and you'll actually have a changing pad cover that fits your changing pad!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This cover is a must have for the changing pad.

However, this cover was too small for my changing table pad. I did wash it before I tried to use it. So, I'm not sure if it just shrunk, or if it was too small from the beginning. However, my changing table pad is now scrunched into a oval shape due to how small this cover is. I guess, I'll be on the lookout for an \\"extra large\\" changing table pad cover.In additon, I was not impressed with the quality of this cover, it became very \\"fuzz balled\\" after just the one washing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Changing Pad Soft & Warm","review":"This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them many times. All of the stains came out and they stayed soft and didn't shrink much. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change and wash the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip these and buy yourself some nice bath towels with the $","review":"This is one of those products you can certainly live without. Right before the baby (now 6 months) was born, we bought ourselves a new set of bath towels. We saved the old ones, and now we just put the old ones on the changing table pad. They don't need to \\"tuck in\\"---in fact, it's better that they don't. If a spot gets soiled during the changing, we just fold clean parts of the towel over the soiled spot (remember, it's not tucked in!) and finish with the diaper change. Then we just throw the towels in the wash. There are some things you need for a baby, but this isn't it. Happy parenting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Just one more thing to wash. It seemed like a good idea so we bought two since we have twins and so we'd always have one on hand. When our girls were younger they frequently had 'accidents' on the changing pad. It's easier and quicker to wash and sterilize the vinyl changing pad than to launder the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Pad More Comfy","review":"When I got my Simmons Changing Pad, this came with it free. I'm afraid that this is going to get a poopy stain and gross me out to the point that I have to throw it away. It fits the pad great and feels much better to the skin than the plastic cover of the pad. The terry cloth is so soft and makes the pad so comfy.I was shopping the other day and found that a division of Carter's also makes changing pad covers that will fit the Simmons pad. They are a little cheaper, but only come in 4 or 5 colors.I read in a review for the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad that the plastic had ripped, so she had to throw it away. I think that would be a good reason to buy one of these, because you could keep using the pad and just cover up the tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - don't buy!","review":"The first time I washed this cover, there was lint on everything.

I can't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad! It doesn't fit well. It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through. I cut small holes to pull the straps through, and they were all frayed after just one washing. In fact, the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use!

I believe some of the best TV soundtracks were made in the the 1960's. The only complaint I have is the fact that the albums featured on this CDare to short in duration.

My first impression is that they took the format they used in the first Relics and Rituals(which I loved, especially the Vigilant prestige class) and repeated much of it with new material. Among the great new features includes Astrology as part of the game mechanics for play and a Prestige Class that is basically an old kit from the Shair's Handbook of the old Al-Qadim campaign setting for 2nd Edition(based primarily on 1001 Arabian Nights, good campaign setting to run that kind of campaign) revamped and made a little more divorced from that setting. Spells are nice, I like a few of the enchanted stuff and the rituals are always nice. Tattoo magic was interesting concept and they expanded it in this edition slightly but not at the expense of other sections.

Although the pace is relentless, the characterisation is predictable and insulting. While the Americans are all heroic action figures and the Poles plucky fighters, the Russians are brutal sexual perverts and the Germans untrustworthy plotters. That the author has chosen to make the sadistic Russian leader an epileptic as well is distasteful, to say the least.

For director Joe Dante, he penned the delightful PIRANHA (1978), THE HOWLING (1981)- still the best werewolf movie ever made in my opinion, and 1980's ALLIGATOR, for director Lewis Teague.Giant 'gator movies come and go, but this is the best one ever made. It has suspense, humor and delightful characters, finely acted by Robert Forster, Robin Riker, Henry Silva and even Dean Jagger, amongst others. Director Lewis Teague helmed two other fine horror movies that come to mind - Stephen King's CUJO (1983) and CAT'S EYE (1985)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creature Feature - Modern","review":"This movie has been shown often on television, but it's one I like.

He starts killing sewer workers and breaks out of the ground and wreacks havoc.This is a very good film. It's special effects are great for 1980. It's acting, dialogue, directing and music (by Craig Husley) are superb. The main character, police officer David Madison (played by Robert Forster), is an excellent lead role. Robin Riker, playing herpitologist Marisa Kendall, is a nice second main character. If you like movies like Jaws, Crocodile, Piranha, Blood Surf and other nature-on-the-loose films, you'll like this film. Rated R for gory alligator attacks and profanity. Followed by Alligator 2: The Mutation (1990)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately Needs Updated Revision","review":"I'm sure this was a brilliant book in 1998-2000. Even by 2012 standards, it is extremely well researched and written. The biggest problem I see with it is that it is about 90% irrelevant today. If you read even a few pages into it, you will see what I mean. Many of the links are no longer active. Additionally, the primary money-saving technique mentioned, the air courier ticket, seems to no longer be a valid technique. It appears that almost airlines have eliminated this opportunity or have redefined it to levels that make it no longer applicable. With all that said, I would very much like to see a modern post 9/11 revision. Any book like this needs constant updating and revision to keep up with the rapidly evolving internet customer base.

Thanks, Tina"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better conversation starter than function","review":"I am skeptical about all these gadgets shown on TV, but this one was priced where it just seemed worth trying out. I do think it creates more conversation than cooling.The weakness of this unit? The unit has to be pointed directly at the sun. I figured if the sun was within about 45 degrees from either side of direct sunlight, the unit would power up the fan, but it does not.What I found works better for me is leaving the windows down just a quarter inch and having a side window vent on the vehicle. Side Window vents are perfect for protecting the vehicle from an unexpected shower while parked and also conceal that your windows are slightly opened. They also reduce road noise when the windows are closed, but you can also vent your car while driving when it is raining out too.Lastly, it doesn't slice and dice. Okay, not all TV gadgets slice and dice.Pretty neat idea, just needs more solar panels that are directed in more directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertisement","review":"I am one of the idiots that believed the hype so I ordered one of these vents. First of all the fan housing will not stay shut and on top of that, the fan itself slides on it's spindle until it makes contact with the housing then stops (little tape on the spindle fixed this problem). I have a ext. cab truck so I figured that I had less interior to cool down so this vent should work fine. Boy was I wrong! You can get the same effect by leaving your windows cracked. Just a fair warning that you will fill silly buying this piece of junk but if you must, make sure it faces direct sunlight or you won't get to see the little novelty fan (that doesn't move air) turn.Bottom line, save your money or I will sell you mine for $.25 if you pay S&H...;."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth hoot","review":"I bought 2 of these (a fool and his money are soon parted). I looked through all of the different vendors, thinking that there are real differences in the fan sold by each. There really is none. (Not even the \\"original\\" auto vent). The solar panel needs to be in direct sunlight - won't do much good in a partly cloudy sky or in the morning sunlight. When there is enough light to make the fan spin, the fan doesn't really generate enough power to move air. I held a strand of hair directly in front of the exhaust side of the vent - the hair hardly moved though the fan was moving. Do not waste your money. I wonder whether the favorable reviews are written by people who have a vested interest in sales of this useless product, or by people who are fooled by a \\"placebo effect.\\" Sounds like a class action suit in the making.

Sometimes the static stops but it is random. I have moved it to other places in the house and it is the same problem :s.I had a different brand first but then we moved houses and I lost one piece of the monitor and I had to buy this \\"Safety 1st\\" one ..

I got it and set it up, and it didn't even work! I spent hours on the phone with the Safety 1st costumer service, who told me it was probably my Wi-Fi that was interfering with it. Really?!? Don't you think it would be a problem to sell a monitor that doesn't work if you have Wi-Fi? Also, there was no static or anything. I shut down the Wi-Fi and tried again, still no luck. It was just defective. I contacted the seller through Amazon and they did give me a refund. If you get a defective one like I did, don't try to work with their customer service!

The low battery light (new 9 volt battery) is already on only days later. I can barely hear my son because of how much static there is. One channel is worse that the other. We live right downtown, so maybe there are other devices interfering? Whatever the reason, I will be returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery backup for Baby Unit","review":"I can't comment on how clear the monitor might be or any level of interference. When I saw that it wasn't as advertised I packed it up to return without even plugging it in. I bought directly from Amazon, but received a different model from what is pictured (not sure if it is an older or newer model, the instructions were printed in 2009 and the packaging was different than what is pictured on Amazon and other websites).Here is where Amazon's description differs from the product I received. The online description (as of 8/1/2011) mentions \\"can also be used with TWO 9-volt batteries\\" and \\"low battery indicators LIGHTS\\". I took this to mean that both the baby monitor and the parent handset were capable of being plugged in with battery backup. They are not, only the parent handset is capable of battery backup. If the power goes out, the monitor just stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible buzzing sound","review":"We bought this for our toddler, hoping to have a simple monitor that we could use to know when she was awake after nap and in the morning. Unfortunately, the parents' unit buzzes so loudly that it was almost impossible to hear anything that was going on in the room. The monitor has two channels, and the buzzing was the same on both channels. To keep the buzzing at a reasonable level, I had to turn the volume down so much that I couldn't hear anything happening in her room, even with the monitor at my ear. We returned this and are going to be looking for a better quality monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not crystal clear","review":"This monitor is loud!

We didn't want to spend much because it's for an older child who won't need it for long. When we tested it, I could hear my husband in the other room, but only static over the monitor. It was the worst quality sound possible. We even tried every outlet in the room, in case something was interfering with it. We also unplugged our other monitor (5 years old and still goin strong!), but nothing made the static any better. We are returning this worthless product. The rooms are close enough that we can hear my child better without the terrible static!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was hopeful that we would have lucked out with this product, given the number of positive reviews. However, we found this monitor to be terrible after such a short use. There is a lot of background noise.

I HATE it though, it eats through batteries like crazy. I have to change it every three to four days, and we really don't use the battery option much. It stays plugged in all night long. It's full of static and the volume control is difficult to manipulate. I like to have it turned down really low so I can only hear my two month old wake up, I don't want to hear his snoring or breathing all night long. But there is no in between setting, it's either turned up all the way, or down too low to hear crying. It is flimsy and difficult to get the receiver to stand alone (it tends to fall over).I want to spend the money and purchase a better unit, that's why I'm browsing the internet for monitors right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying radio signals!","review":"This monitor is super sensitive and does pick up even the smallest sounds in our daughter's room, but the receiver also picks up a radio station.

It does have some occasional interference, but you just move it a little or switch the channel & it is fine. It also has some \\"white noise\\" in the background much of the time, but it's minimal.

It did NOT work at all. I thought that originally it was because the first monitor we had [also a Safety 1st brand] was interfering with the wavelengths and causing the static. Definitely NOT the case, I've tried it without the first monitor on and it's still filled with a ton of static. Yes, I've tried switching channels and checking to make sure they were on the same channel, and all that fancy stuff. [Our family is big a tech stuff, so BELIEVE ME, I've tried everything.] Nothing works, this monitor is pure trash. Try it if you want, you may be one of the lucky ones, but I prefer our more expensive one [in the $50 range], and plan on finding one similar to it [it's now considered an \\"older\\" model]. It really is CRYSTAL CLEAR, and works like a charm. [Plus the more expensive one has a nightlight option, controlled by touch, and it has two receivers. It's worth the money, THIS ONE IS NOT.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY NICE","review":"FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB.

I thought it would be just a cheap monitor since it was free and inexpensive to purchase. I have a wireless phone system...still no problems. I keep this thing on constantly, and I haven't had to change a battery.For my baby shower I received as a gift, the safety 1st video monitor and I've had nothing but problems with that monitor which costs aprox. $149.00.

A+ on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"We thought this monitor was great at first. A month later we were having trouble with the receiver. It would get so much static that you couldn't stand it. You would have to literally squeeze the receiver to keep it from giving you static, and nothing else. Then, finally, the cord to the receiver stopped working. We were going through basically a battery every two nights. We still haven't found anything to replace it. Luckily our son's room is directly across from ours, so we just leave his door open now. We bought a replacement of the same type when it first started acting up, thinking that it was just the one we had. The replacement didn't work at all. So, we'll be searching for a new one in a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I got this monitor for free, and I'm sure glad I didn't pay for it. It frequently starts putting out white noise even when the receiver isn't moving. Our phones interfere with it as does my breast pump, and you have to make sure you're a good distance away from the transmitting unit or you get loud feedback. We've even gotten small feedback if the receiver is in the kitchen directly below the transmitter in the bedroom above. The Fisher-Price monitor that flashes lights is much, much better and doesn't seem to get interference from anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"high on static, low on durability","review":"Save your money and don't buy this monitor. When we lived in our apartment, the static drove us crazy! Now that we are in our house, the static is much better but the monitor only functions when it feels like it. We've owned it for 9 months and it simply doesn't work well anymore. You have to jiggle the plug part on the transmitter just right for it to transmit. You have to play with the volume control on the receiver to get it to pick up anything at all. Although, until we had these problems, I was happy with its sensitivity (I could hear my son breathing) and its range (I could be out in the yard with it). I'm very disappointed and am online looking for a new monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The STATIC Nursery Monitor","review":"You can barely hear your baby with all the static, I've tried various areas for a \\"clearer\\" sound and it has never been clear, as a matter of fact it seems to be getting worse.

It was a good thing that we got it as a gift. After using it, we thought of keeping our Fisher Price monitor in the registry.Some of the problems with this monitor are:- generally flimsy construction.- lack of a clip or a flat base on both receiver and monitor. Makes it really difficult to place it somewhere.- because of the level of white noise you have to keep the volume up quite high- since there is no visual indicator of the noise level, you have no option but to listen to the hissing and strain hard to hear if it was your baby crying.I think the Fisher Price models are a much better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad interferiance","review":"I got this product as a baby shower gift because it had the \\"extended range of 400 feet\\" so I could easily walk my dog while the baby was sleeping in the apartment.

Only one of the channels on it seems to work and I pick up more static than anything else.

This is the third monitor in three months by Safety First that I've had to return. (The other two were different models.)

It may not be the greatest or the most expensive out there but it does the job... lets us know when she is up.

I initially had another monitor on my baby registry but I took it off when I read the reviews on monitors in general. Since this one came with the purchase I took it but didn't expect much. What a nice surprise. It comes in crystal clear as the name says. Sometimes it picks up the tv sound, even when the tv is on low and away from the monitor, but I can still hear the baby stirring over any other sound. I've never gotten any static even when I've taken it upstairs, or outside the door.

If you want something to use when you as a parent are awake and don't care about the constant hum/static going on the whole time this is a good cheap monitor that lets you hear baby.

I was wrong. The monitors are very cheaply made. I tried both channels and various locations in my 2-story house, and all I got was a lot of static. To be able to hear my baby I had to have the volume way up, and by then the static almost drowned out the baby noises, not to mention was really annoying to try to sleep next to. Even the on/off switch was difficult to turn off in the dark, it kept slipping too far and just going to the other channel instead of stopping in the off position.The only good thing about this purchase was dealing with the seller, who was very generous and gave me a full refund.

I have them both plugged in in the kitchen but have them across the room from each other because of interference. The sounds still bleeds into each other so if one kid is making noise in one room, I can hear it in both monitors. Drives me crazy, making it hard to know which kid is awake.

I will be splurging on higher quality monitors from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It, Even At This Price","review":"We needed a second monitor for occasional use and I was hoping to get away with buying something inexpensive. This monitor does have a great price and I wasn't looking for a lot of bells and whistles. Unfortunately when the base unit was two rooms away I still got feedback on the parent unit. The two units were at least 30 feet apart and had three walls between them. This unit does not offer sound activation; you only get only continuous broadcasting. I would have also liked to see a built-in battery in the parent unit that can be charged instead of needing a 9 volt battery to operate (even AA or AAA would have been more convenient).On the plus side, it picks up sounds like anything: my other child who was talking pretty quietly even farther away from the base unit could easily be heard on the parent unit.Pros: great price, picks up sound amazingly wellCons: feedback even at great distance, only continuous broadcasting, no built-in battery on parent unit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"My wife and I received two monitors from our baby shower, this one and a much more expensive one.

You would think that the battery power would kick in but it doesn't it goes completely dead.So if you want to buy a 9volt battery every day so you doh't have to worry about the electricity failing, then this monitor is ok. However I am going to look for another monitor with back up battery power.Any suggestions????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Static/Power Adapter Broke","review":"Not too happy with this monitor. We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static. My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried. We used it for 7 months, every day during naps and night, and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out. So, in summary: it will work but it's not a very good product and doesn't seem to have quality components to make it last. Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monitor","review":"This is a great monitor and the price is even better.

We got this model with number 3 because the twin ones are still in play throughout the house. I have since returned this model. It uses 9v battery whereas the Sony is rechargable- all you do is plug it in to recharge. That cord comes off so Sony is complately portable without a power source, but holds the charge for days. The Sony unit beeps when the charge is low.This unit (Safety 1st) is NOT rechargeable and wastes battery power. It does not stay charged.

Then the return process was too long and complicated. They wanted to send me a letter to sign and return to them along with the defective monitor. Then they would send me a new one. After waiting a week before receiving the letter I changed my mind and just went out and bought a different monitor at Target. I needed a monitor and got the feeling like it was going to be another couple weeks before I'd ever get the replacement one.

There is a reason I have the other appliances in my home. If my refrigerator is causing the interference, I'm going to keep my refrigerator and not the monitor. When I called Safety First's customer service, I was treated rather rudely and they were unable to solve the problem.

Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex. I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it. I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static.

All of the sudden it seems like you must be a part of the ku klux klan to get anywhere in the city.

This book is easy to read but difficult to understand, because it skips from one story to another. It was confusing but don't take my advice for it. You are your own person and you choose if you want to read it or not. In this book, the only thing I really understood was when Leonna was telling about her life.

It really gave you a good idea of how they lived back in the past in really life situations. There were 11 main characters who all told their perspective and point of view. This book took place in Vermont in 1924 when the Ku Klux Klan came in. When the Ku Klux Klan came in everyone started fighting for safety. Ester Hirsh (age 6, Jewish) and Leanora Sutter (age 12, African-American) who were the youngest were especially not safe, being victims of the Klan. Now the town is turning against each other and putting a lot of people in danger. The author's intentions were to show how people lived in the past and the things people did to those who were not white. This shows the racism, hate groups and prejudice people back in the past.

Leanora copes, but hates the mean white kids at school.

She developed the characters so well it was great for this book. It is about 12 year old Leonora Sutter who is with her father in Vermont. They are the only African Americans in town. Also, the Klu Klux Klan is after not only them but also 6 year old Esther Hirsh and her father. When something horrible happens to a Jewish man there is a lot of commotion in the air. This is such a good book so read it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Witness","review":"The book Witness, a Newbary award winner, is about a nice town in Vermont, 1924. The town is peaceful until the klu klux klan bribes the people into letting them in their town. Actually the klan is only a bunch of racists looking to take over the town. Two families, the Sutters who are African american and the Hirshes who are Jewish are being hunted by the klan. Two examples of them being chased was that lit a cross on the hill symbolising that they weren't welcome and they tried to shoot Esther hish a six year old but hit her father. Later in the book, the town realizes that the klan wasn't what they said they were. Now part of the town wanted the klan to leave. The other part of the town acompanied by Johnny Reeves the Preacher and Harvey Pettibone are against what the other people think. In the beginning of the book it starts a little slow but then it gets really exiting and you want to know what happens next. I think you should really considre reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WITNESS","review":"The witness is irresistible it is packed with action. It is about a little black girl and a jewish girl that are in this little town in Vermont when the KKK come to town. As the bystanders of the town watch as their town crumbles. But in the end the bystanders become the heroes. The witness is a great book to do a book report on. Karen Hesse won the New berry Award for her book \\"Out of the dust.\\" The witness was written for Jean Feiwel . I recommend this book to students in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade because it is perfect for a book report. This book is historical fiction. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Witness Review","review":"Karen Hesse did a prodigious job writing Witness. She does not come right out and say something, she makes you think. Witness takes place in a small town in Vermont in the 1920's. When the Klu Klux Klan moves in nobody is safe. Especially twelve year old Leonora Sutter, an African American, and Esther a six year old Jewish girl. Esther is a girl who thinks every thing has a bright side. Take my advice read Witness by: Karen Hesse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner","review":"I usually find novels in verse pretentious at best and unreadable at worst. They never seem to work. I'm glad to say that Karen Hesse's WITNESS is an exception.The voices are distinct and interesting -- I especially like those of Esther Hirsch and the Pettibones.

It is very suspenseful and it is like an adventure a little comedy too. The book has irony and is a little spooky. Overall my opinion is that this book has a little bit of everything. I gave this book four stars because the ending was kind of slow and not very good and I wish there were more pages. The things I think the author should work on are the swearing and lower it down. Everyone over 9 would love the book Witness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness Review by AW","review":"The year is nineteen-twenty four when the Ku Klux Klan moves into a small, peaceful town in Vermont.

It's a well-crafted, piece of historical fiction that makes the reader a \\"Witness\\" to what's happening in the town. The reader becomes judge and jury as they hear multiple sides of what's happening in the town.This book requires some critical and abstract thought. Not every reader gets it. People don't speak literally. Every character has good and bad in them. As in real life, the adults don't always speak plainly.It's one of my favorite books to teach. Because it's written in free verse, there is a lot of white space on the page--thank you to Ms. Hesse's editors. This makes it much easier for students with Dyslexia and other reading disorders. It's also available in Audio version for those with vision and dexterity issues.Read this book with your child. Discuss it. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I bought this book at my school bookfair after reading the summary on the back. I was really excited to read it. When I got home I read it in an hour or two, due to the simple writing format.When I was finished reading, I was extremely disapointed.I didn't find any of the events tragic, powerful, or remarkable. Although I understand that the events were terrible for the characters, I didn't find them interesting at all. The only events I found tragic/powerful were when Leanora saw the flaming cross at night, and when Esther's father was shot. I expected the characters to talk about the things the Ku Klux Klan did that were even more harsh and cruel.Overall the book was okay, but I was dispointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helpful, and entertaining too","review":"I bought this book at the same time I ordered \\"Rule the Freakin' Markets\\" last week, and they're both very useful in understanding this crazy beast called The Street. I found this one a little more helpful for someone like me--a journalist who has to write about the markets periodically but really isn't a very savvy investment type. This book is also quite funny and I found myself reading parts of it aloud to my wife. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marx Brothers Do Casablanca for a Different Effect!","review":"A Night in Casablanca is a funny Marx Brothers film. It may not be a great film but better than many of their latter comedies. It seems that MGM decided to put a little more money in this picture than they had their other films. It has some great gags and fun spots. Much better than The Big Store and some other pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marx magic at its best.","review":"Confusion is a must as the zany trio do their best. Even a sort of who's on first.

As the last movie made by them, it is a good example of the talent these fellows had, and particularly Harpo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well put your hat on your neck and get out!!","review":"How great it is to see the Marx Brothers prove this late in their careers that they still had the great inspiration for zanieness that they started with. This flick is filled with classic Marx-style bits and plenty of laugh out louds. The only thing that REALLY bothered me was that Harpo did not wear his trade-marx top hat the entire movie. Who's decision was that?!?! Very disturbing. But really, don't hesitate buying this one even if you haven't seen it. Just beware of the light blue cover version released by Goodtimes. It is recorded in LP mode and the sound is very distracting. I also recommend Go West as their other late classic. Skip 'At the Circus' altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"An architect friend of mine recommended this and it has be a valuable resource and learning tool.

I don't know how they got it all in there, but it's a fun, fascinating, & nostalgic look at American domestic architecture - the styles, the names, the details, packed with b/w photos, drawings, & diagrams.If you're an architect, a draftsman, a craftsman, a contractor, a carpenter, a writer, a homeowner, an armchair historian, an antiques dealer, a builder, a remodeler - then you gotta have one of these! It makes any stroll down a shady old street a lesson in architectural history. Maybe if we all paid a little more attention to just how those old-time builders and architects got so much charm and character into a simple home, we wouldn't be so quick to bulldoze and replace with steel and glass or generic tract housing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I first read this book as a graduate student in an urban planning course almost 20 years ago.

I cannot recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Architectural Historian's Bible","review":"I am a professional architectural historian and this is the guide that all my colleagues and I use on a daily basis.

I am obsessive about architectural style terminology and though I have been known to ask \\"If McAlester jumped off a bridge, would you?\\" (to colleagues who think this book is the end-all be-all of terminology), I do think it is a highly comprehensive and accurate book. My only complaint is that it has such a nation-wide focus, and tends to favor the East Coast. It overlooks many regional and temporal differences of the West Coast (where I work) and so I am sometimes forced to do a little interpretation. (Also, I wish the McAlesters would write a guide to commercial styles.) All in all though, this is one of the best guides out there.

The numerous illustrations and photographs allow the reader to visualize the single or multiple influences used in the construction of a vintage home. A must for those interested in walking tours of homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Read","review":"I enjoy reading this book because the author delves into each era of architecture and draws out the defining characteristics using illustrations and pictures of specific buildings.

Instead we find a pot-luck compilation of 75 articles dating from 2000 through 2002... oh yeah, 3 are from 2003.Information is often repeated between articles. There is no Index - so good luck trying to find specifics without reading or skimming through the whole article. Plus, for $89.00 the spiral-binding really takes the cake, I'd have settled for a soft cover backing.The good..? Page layouts are comfortable, the print is easy to read, and the cover is \\"pretty\\". The book includes a CD, which contains the articles plus 14 extra items.

This is the same remix on \\"Collectables\\". Ashanti mixed her lyrics with \\"Rock with You\\" by Michael Jackson together. While sampling the sheet music to M.J.'s song makes a great instrumental (As my video shows), in my opinion, lyrically mixing her song and M.J.'s does not. Also, When she made the hook towards the end with MJ's lyrics, it would have been a little bit more tolerable if she had kept the lyrics exactly the same as MJ's. Changing \\"Just Take it slow\\" To \\"Just take control\\" and \\"Fell That Heat\\" to \\"Beat\\" really threw me off.

This is truly bottom of the range stuff. The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire. None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully. I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).

In a relatively short amount of time, we get to know a woman who's gotten in with two very bad guys, a man she used to know back home in Arkansas who is now a police officer, and several others that are involved in their lives at the same time. Everything comes to a head in Arkansas after the criminals leave Los Angeles. Good performances from Paxton, Thornton, and Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"This a great movie. Carl Franklin's One False Move is riveting.

I still recommend it, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Complicated But Very Good!","review":"While The White Road has many characters to keep track of, which at times makes the story a bit hard to follow without a scorecard (so to speak), Connolly again proves himself to be among the best of the contemporary suspense writers. Connolly is a not only a master in providing compelling plots featuring his dark, somewhat tormented hero, Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker, his even stronger abilities are in developing vivid and very credible characters and in providing very graphic,compelling and emotionally-charged narratives and images. The basic plot of The White Road involves Parker going to South Carolina to help an old friend and attorney defend a young black man facing the death penalty. It's a case that nobody wants to be involved in and one deeply rooted in old evil. If you're interested in a very good, well-written story and one that will keep you glued to your seat, I'd highly recommend The White Road to you (as well as each of Connolley's other books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"\\"The White Road\\" is another Charlie \\"Byrd\\" Parker novel. The first three in this series were great, with plot lines that grab you from the first page and keep you reading well into the night. This one just doesn't have the same level of excitement, although it is a good read for Parker fans. It seemed a bit confusing at times and delved into the metaphysical a bit too much. Parker's two comrades in arms, Angel and Louis, were not as much a part of the action as in the previous novels. The author seemed to be sending a message instead of the mile a minute action we are accustomed to in the Parker series. I hope the next story gets back to the same style as the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"I gave this guy one last try after liking the 1st 2 books in the series, & got just what I deserved after trying to read the dreck that is \\"The Killing Kind\\".More Yeccccch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"This fourth in the Charlie Parker series has all the evil characters we've come to expect from a Parker outing, as well as an enormous amount of historical (both real and fictional) background on racial abuses in the south. While the writing is lyrical and the characters are fully fleshed, The White Road doesn't have quite the power of the previous books. The plot hinges on a motive (which I will not give away) that didn't ring true or believable to me for bringing Parker into the case of Atys Jones's forthcoming murder trial. There's plenty of activity in swampy settings; Louis and Angel come to the forefront this time out. And there's enough torture, gore, murder and mayhem to satisfy readers who've come to expect a thoroughly disturbing adventure from Connolly. The glue that is intended to hold the plot together is a little thin, leaving cracks and gaps in the whole. Entertaining but not quite up to the very high standard the author has set with his previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicious and Sensitive- A Sea of White Impatiens","review":"There is a profound depth to this book which runs counter to the banality of growing up a in a rich New York suburb.

Entertaining and informative as far as showing life as a coach of Lakers, especially Kobe and Shaq, the two dominant players, and biggest \\"problem children\\" on the team.

Unfortunately Jackson's book does not weave a single cohesive theme. It is presented as a series of disjointed diary entries which spend far too much time focusing on recapping the most recent basketball game. Although there are some interesting noted in the book, some of which are highlighted in other reviews (and some of which made the news), they are few and far between, and usually buried in piles of game analysis and box score review.

He rather reminded me of Senator Joseph McCarthy at this point. Mr. Martin also denigrated the concept of the Church as the \\"people of God\\" which came out of Vatican II as if any idea of democracy within the Church was evil incarnate.I prefer writers with more open minds that can see an issue from all sides.

Yet by 1979 the US Government itself, in its HSCA hearings, questioned the main conclusions of the Warren Commission: (1) that there were only three shots; and (2) that there was only one shooter. So, this book by Bugliosi amounts to a Don Quixote adventure since nobody else in the Government defends these points anymore. Using more than 1,500 pages and droning repetition, Bugliosi tries to defend the argument of a 'lone nut' assassin which depends upon a 'single bullet theory,' i.e. that a single bullet caused seven wounds in JFK and Governor Connally and emerged without losing any fragments on a Parkland Hospital stretcher. Bugliosi's conclusion is we must dogmatically call this the 'single bullet fact.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugliosi grinds an old ax...","review":"Years ago on one of the premium cable channels Bugliosi and Gerry Spence faced off in a very entertaining \\"trial of Lee Harvey Oswald.\\" Spence showed his usual brilliance in arguing that Oswald could not have done it, let alone kill Kennedy by himself. Bugliosi argued for the prosecution. And although Bugliosi \\"won\\" and and the jury voted against Oswald, Spence ate him up and spit him out. It was Spence, with his trademark humor and buck skin coat, both taught and entertained the audience.My opinion is, this book is a long-winded attempt to silent some inner demon--perhaps the one Spence created--and proving once and for all that he IS right. So what. All this book does is get Bugliosi entrance into the \\"club\\" of flat-earthers like Gerald Posner who continue to hold on to the absurd opinion that \\"Oswald acted alone.\\" It's not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless-even as a doorstop","review":"Do yourself a favor and read 'Head Shot' by G.

Bugliosi fails to question the credibility or motives of his \\"witnesses\\", while ignoring the most credible sources from day one.Like Posner, he is NOT a trained historian, as such, this book is written from a lawyer's perspective and is not an honest analysis of the evidence - it's a prosecution of Oswald.For all of the overwhelming evidence pointing to conspiracy, Bugliosi is unable to answer the most obvious: How does a bullet (CE 399) lose more grains of metal than it had when it was new? More grains of metal were removed from Connolly's wrist wound alone than were missing from 399.Answer that question, and i may consider Oswald as lone-nut. Otherwise, don't waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Bugliosi was smarter than this","review":"There is not really anything I can add within the confines of an Amazon review that has not already been covered in other reviews I read. I would love to go to trial against Mr. Bugliosi with the evidence, but I don't think he would risk it, knowing that the evidence argues so strongly against his conclusions. It is one thing for him to write a book which he will only have to defend in interviews where the interviewer's understanding of the evidence is extremely weak, it would be an entirely different experience for him to try his case in front of a judge or jury. Clearly, this book is not an attempt to look at the evidence objectively, and many of the author's conclusions are based on \\"straw man\\" arguments and superficial analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Politics have slanted his view","review":"This book is a distortion of the facts.

He gives a detailed account of four days after the assassination. Also, he gives a very thorough biography of Lee Harvey Oswald; and by that I mean a biography that could be a book in and on itself. If I tried to detail everything in the book it would take me more space than I have available. Needless to say, anything that you can think of, even the more obscure of conspiracy theories, is debunked in the book. If like me, you are a single shooter believer, you will love this book and it will become one of your primary sources of reference about the case.

One one side you have the lone-nut theorists and other side has the conspiracy theorists that have everyone and their brother involved. If one looks at the evidence one sees a conspiracy but nothing as large as everyone portrays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"If this author thinks that Oswald was involved in killing JFK then he is living in a dream world. Just ask the Mafia. Oswald was their \\"pasty\\" Oswald even said it himself. Jack Rudy was working with the Mafia and they hired him to take out Oswald because they were afraid he would talk about how the Mafia was working with the CIA in Cuba to take out Castro. Mafia leaders hired killers to take out JFK to get back at his brother because Bobby was harassing the mob. The Mafia knew if they killed JFK, Bobby would lose his power in trying to jail some of the Mafia leaders. Wake up world, Oswald was in the wrong place at the right time.

There just didn't seem to be much to choose from in the local area. After visiting several jewelry stores and finding nothing that I liked that was under $300, I went online and B-I-N-G-O, there it was on Amazon. I ordered the ring and received it within a week.

The ring didn't fit, I measured it before I bought with the ring I've been wearing for years, however, because of the comfort fit feature it was too small. I contacted the company and they said to send it back and just pay shipping and they would send me another size, UPS called to tell me I had to pay a 48.00 tax fee on it because it was Canada, so I had to pay 12.00 just to get it sent back to me. After paying everything I've put 211.00 in a ring that is worthless to me, because it doesn't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book about creativity and problem solving.","review":"Colin has new paints and wants to paint a masterpiece.

Sadly, if these songs had just been a Blues Traveler album, I would have enjoyed most of them much more than I do, but they are still solid, and a good listen. I have seen these guys live, and the CD doesn't quite capture that energy...however, it's still got some good hooks to it (no pun intended). If Blues Traveler had recorded this album, instead of Bastardos!, the world would be a much better place.The main problem here is that there's limited instrumentation, so a lot of the songs sound quite empty. The best thing about it is that they are still great songs...if they were filled out by a full band, they would rock really hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Application Study Bible, New Living Translation","review":"This by far is the best Bible that I have ever worked with.

I have given this Bible as gifts to friends who have said they never have time to read the Bible and now they find the time on a daily basis. I am purchasing this Bible today for a cousin who is currently serving time in prison and he has been trying to understand a Bible that he found there, it must be a King James version, he is very hungry for the Word and wants to better understand it so we just know that this Bible will be a God send for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Application Bible from Amazon","review":"The print on this bible is so light you can hardly read it.

The translation is not bad and easy to read, but other versions like NIV is more accurate. I am an international student too, but don't really like this version that much because the translation is not deep enough.

I am new to the bible and have never had a complete understanding of it until now.

Before, I had no idea when things happened...why they happened or the signifigance of it all...now I do. I have to recommend this to all newcomers to religion. I am buying one for everyone in my family for Christmas and the Large print for my Grandma who has read the KJV inside out a couple of times...I hope she will have a better understanding of what she has read in relation to today's living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Translation and notes...spiritual growth just ahead...","review":"After i bought this study bible i found that it was hard to put it down, the combination of this translation and notes truly speak to my heart.

You won't be bored listening to this. If you have more than a passing interest in Baroque music, and want to hear something more than the usual Bach and Vivaldi, then you should get this.I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, only because I wish this CD had been recorded by the Cappella Istropolitana. The first 3 tracks are also available on Italian Baroque Favorites (highly recommended) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000148Uwhich is recorded by the Cappella Istropolitana, and to me those tracks are more lively and crisp than on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointed","review":"This book sits unused on my bookshelf.

Moloko's 'best of' - Catalogue - also contains the full length song, so this is the only place to get the short version.That same video is included here. The track Take My Hand is worth having (and I'm not a die-hard fan) while the remix track I could live without.Also included on the disc's enhanced section are the lyrics which are high lighted line by line as the song plays, audio clips of other Moloko songs and wallpaper of the cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A B-side worth having","review":"The song is awesome on the album. The edited version obviously was done to fit the radio format. It does butcher it a bit, but remains enjoyable. The remix is quite different from actual song, seems more inspired by, yet could be fun to dance to at a club or party. The B-Side, Take My Hand, is a rather good song. Wonder why it didn't make the album, but for die hard Moloko fans, it's worth having. Something deep in you touches something so deep in me...lovely song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Interactive DVD","review":"I liked the music, but I really enjoyed the interactive part of the CD.

Very few words are used, and the viewer is left to enjoy the images and let the art speak for its self.If you are a student of art or a working artist this and other books in the '500 series' are a must for ideas, inspiration, and just plain enjoyment.Those with just a casual interest in different medias and crafts will also enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Too many conceptual bracelets, If you want to see metal been use, this is not your choice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional is the Word","review":"Functional is the Word in my opinion. I did not think the selection of bracelets in this book equals the other 500 items books. The book publishing, the physical part and the photographs are fabulous. The editors selections leave some doubt in my mind as to their abilities in selecting items. I think a bracelet is to be worn as an accessory or an adornment not to be a dangerous object such as a bracelet of lighted birthday candles- A big paper wheel you can stick your arm through also stretches the boundaries. I cannot stretch my imagination enough to consider some of the selections in this book as a bracelet."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and light","review":"Nice sleeping bag, lite and take low space when packed tight.

The music is haunting and delicious. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nashville ROCKS ! ! ! !","review":"I am very, very happy with these discs. The tempi tend to be on the slow side for my taste, but only slightly. On the other hand, having lived with this set for a month or so now, and listened to it several times through, I feel like I know (and love) these pieces better than I ever have before, and understand how they relate to each other. My only experience with the Bachianas previously was the 1950's French version conducted by Villa-Lobos, and I don't think they were available as a complete set. Compared to those versions, the modern recording technique used here lets you hear all the different parts MUCH more clearly; there were entire parts, especially in the low strings and woodwinds, that I simply couldn't hear before. There were also several gems I hadn't heard before. I recommend this set wholeheartedly; for the price it is a huge value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and pleased","review":"I received the book in a very quick fashion and was pleased with this transaction.

White appearance isn't good, if compared with chrome plating one (chrome looks like more sophisticated)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music speaks","review":"The greatest quality of this production and Blu-Ray disc is the music. Kudos to Martone and Lopez Cobos for letting the music do its work. Singers and orchestra perform beautifully. Anyone listening to this production will enjoy every single minute and the many arias Verdi gave us. The \\"conventional\\" staging helps the sense of the plot without distracting from the most important component, the music. The plot is awkward to start with. Verdi had to change it many times to satisfy the censors of his time. The initial plot was based on the assassination of Gustav III of Sweden, but ended being set in Boston prior to independence. In addition, Martone decided to move it to the 19 century so there is an American flag and the Count of Warwick on the same time-frame. A little bet of an anachronism, but it doesn't disturb the overall production, which is not about history but human passions, intrigue and unfulfilled love. Highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The place to get ripped off on returns!!","review":"I admit, I ordered the wrong size. I paid $126.00 for my hood and they refunded me $83.00!!! They charge a 20% restocking fee, then said the difference was the shipping costs, which they insisted on sending me their label. I should have asked what the shipping charge would be, I could have sent it Priority Mail cheaper. Just please be very aware, if you have to send it back, you are going to get \\"tapped\\".

Overall, I am not dissatisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but large for a table","review":"As other reviewers have commented, these are rather large. The description indicates 3\\", which is height, but they don't tell you that the width is 2.5\\" which makes for a pretty sizeable s/p shakers. More importantly the holes are pretty large. So these are good for young kids as they'll over-season very easily. I use these by my stove top for seasoning main dishes, roasts, soups, etc. I find them perfect for that as they won't need to be refilled too often due to their size. It's too bad they don't make a size smaller with smaller holes which would be more appropriate for the dinner table.Even though they aren't made out of the corelle glassware, they resemble it quite a bit, have a nice look and are easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factory rejects?","review":"The salt and pepper shakers were OK, but the holes at the top were \\"Drilled Off Center\\", so I am thinking they were factory rejects and then sold cheap to...me.

I am also a fan of Steven Goldman; his Pinstriped Bible is a much visited feature on my Bookmarks list. I purchased Forging Genius expecting a much closer look at the time of Stengel's managerial career in which he helmed such weak entries as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Braves. The book indeed focuses on those years, and some new facts emerge that do not appear in other bigraphies. Nonetheless, those who buy the book with expectations similar to mine should be warned that extensive coverage is given to Stengel's first year with the Yankees, little of which has not been mined in other treatments. This is a book for hardcore baseball fans; those with an eye toward the history of the game will enjoy this book enormously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooo","review":"it doesn't matter how fresh the batteries are it still runs slow. useless unless you like your cassettes to sound like they are playing in syrup."},{"rating":"1","title":"COBY CX49 PERSONAL AM/FM STEREO CASSETTE PLAYER","review":"I ordered 3 of this item twice, and both times I have to return them, because after using the tape player a few weeks, the player start to drag.

But, the only cassette recorder I could find when I went to replace it was this Coby CX-49. Halfway through a book and desperate to keep going, I bought it. The radio never gets in my favorite station without static (the old half-dead Sony is about a billion times clearer) and after owning the Coby for six days, I was sitting still in a chair when suddenly the tape starts distorting - turns out that, despite fresh batteries, one of the spindles has stopped turning.

I'll have to FF into the tape for it to connect. That could be the cassette itself, since it doesn't do that on all tapes.

I should've listened to fellow reviewers who wrote of this problem. I guess you get what you pay for. I will definitely not repurchase.

Its no surprise now (as other reviewers have commented) that I got \\"bit.\\" Yes the product contains bitterant, but not to a degree that I could detect from smell, though others may be more sensitive to its smell than myself. Aside from that it does do the job it is supposed to do, initially. The air pressure drops after a few sprays and it becomes all but ineffective. I ordered two packs (4 cans) and the result was always the same.

It did seem that the velocity increased for a short time after \\"taking a break\\", but the trigger also seems to be fairly flimsy and I was nervous to press it down really hard cuz I thought it might break. I also noticed I got better results by keeping the canister level (per the instructions).The other non-prime options were more pricey incl shipping, next time I'd probably go over to a close by staples or radio shack (assuming they carry something like this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap compressed air","review":"Compressed air cans are probably almost all created equal..

I had a lot of dust stuck in my keyboard, fans, etc when disassembling my laptop, i used this as instructed to blow air to clean it. It didn't really do a good job. I found the air spraying out isn't any faster than I can blow with my own breath anyways. And a much better way to clean is use rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab. And carefully use tweezers to get any hairs stuck between the keys. So, I am not sure what else people use this for. By the way, the can will get really cold so wear gloves when you use it... if you chose to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can o Air","review":"I have used alot of these compressed air cans over the years. I would have to say this one is by far the worst one I have ever used. You push down the trigger and hardly anything comes out. You should not have to push so hard on it to get it to work. No thanks... will not be ordering again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lunchbox with disappointing insulation","review":"I share the general happiness with this lunch box. It fits a lot of stuff and it's good to have separated compartments. That said, I think the insulation in even the lower portion is worthless... It's not much better than no insulation at all. Put a cold bottled water in it and it's room temperature in 3 hours. If you want something to stay cold, you're going to have to use ice. The thermos 9 cube ice packets are a perfect fit in the bottom. We use two in the bottom, one on the bottom and one atop cold stuff and it works pretty well. After 4-5 hours using the cubes, water is cold... I doubt it'd be much more than room temp after 8-10 hours.Other than the poor insulation, the only other complaint is what some have noted... the zipper on the top tends to get stuck. It's an annoying design flaw, but not enough to take away from what is otherwise a really nice, unobtrusive yet roomy lunch box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"This item is small and by no means can it hold a 12 hour day worth of food and supplies that I feel that i must keep with me..the item is well built yet very small lower half that will carry 2-3 normal bottles of water and a sandwich..the side pocket are pointless...yet the upper part is nice and large..i guess I expect a much larger bottom portion to hold more cold items"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PRODUCT--EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS","review":"This lunch box is really larger than i imagined and more than held what i needed it to hold.

I put freezer packs to help keep items that needs to be cold a proper temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Really Picnic Set","review":"I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good. When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people. I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.

Humorously and cleverly you will be guided through some of the most important lessons this successful entrepeneur has learned. Read this book today and beat the business sharks at their own game. -- Highly recommended for any salesman or entrepeneur or anyone else who wants to know what really goes on in the minds of the rich and powerful"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEGINNING ADVENTURES OF THE \\"TORTOISE\\"...","review":"WTI, (Which ironically was the 2nd to last book that I read out of his collection of 5) points to Ringer's beginnings in the \\"Jungle\\". The book is packed with street-smart tips, yet I'm sure that looking back in hindsight- the author would agree that his first literary outing had an overwhelming tone of bravado to it (His later books reflect a modest and stronger Ringer... stemming from yet more refinded experience). Initial \\"bravado attitude\\" aside, WTI should be required reading in all business college graduate programs- to balance out the \\"academic candyland\\" information that seems to plague so many classrooms"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Finished Mr. Ringer's classic this morning. After \\"hearing\\" of the book for years, about six months ago I purchased a used hardback and put it in the queue. As many others have pointed out, this book isn't so much about intimidation as it is about \\"NOT\\" being intimidated by others. He provides real-world counsel when he advises that closing the deal is not the goal; getting paid is the goal---and apparently in his industry (real estate) this can be a role of the dice. I enjoyed the book in the beginning, but after a while his details of real estate successes and failures became tedious. He wraps up nicely with some penetrating questions for the reader. I would recommend this to anyone trying to build their confidence. I'll keep on the shelves as a reference and will recommend to colleagues and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book if you want to succeed in business!","review":"This book is picked up all the time by people who want to succeed in business. The people that I've seen, that have really lasted in business tend to be built of strong values. Now, I'm sure there are exceptions to that rule, but being a bully is not the way to maintain customers, clients or other business relations. This book tries to make people into what they are not, when they should instead focus on who they are. This is just a mass-market-appeal book, with a catchy title."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about hockey & horses","review":"The adventures of the psuedonymous author are wholly fictional.

It was mostly about Liz driving back and forth to the garden and obsessing about whether to make it with Paul Drake. (Maybe in the first book his silly name was explained - Paul Drake as in the old Perry Mason series, I presume.) I found this boring and preachy. I don't think I'll read another in this series -- I enjoyed \\"Murder in the Marketplace\\" -- but I'm tired of Liz's poor-but-happy-I-can-shop at-the-thrifts personality.

If you gave it 4 stars then you once saw a horror movie in the 70s.(3.)

The little \\"glimpses\\" into the thoughts of all the other characters are often pointless and always distracting. The premise of this novel, a woman changing her entire personality, wardrobe, and life, just to get a man to stick around, is not the worst idea in the world, but the author did not handle it in a believable or even readable fashion. Two thumbs down, way down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, enjoyable, and a short read.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book mainly because it was short, light, and didn't involve a lot of lawyer talk. I hear it's supposed to be made into a movie. I'd go see it! I enjoyed the remake into a Doris Day type character. The only thing tht bothered me is that some of the quotes used did not come from the movie. Two quotes supposedly from Pillow Talk(Chapters 30,34) were never in any version of Pillow Talk that I ever saw, and I just watched it again yesterday to make sure before writing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, Atypical Romance Novel","review":"Chick lit, where the heroine is not immediately likable--gruff, pro-military, masculine, totally clueless. In an effort to win over men, she adopts Doris Day's mannerisms and discovers that they work to her advantage. The writer's voice makes the book funny and easy to read. But I found myself gagging a lot over the Doris Day references--it felt incredibly antiquated and old-fashioned. In general, though, characters break out of the typical romance novel archetypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"\\"The thing about Jane Spring\\" is one of the best books I read this summer. True, the plot about Jane Spring dressing up as Doris Day, because according to her, that's what it takes to get what she wants, is kind of unrealistic. Especially her showing up as this character in court and transforming her apartment to look like a movie set is way beyond reality.Despite this surreality this book gives a good message about doing whatever you have to do in order to pursue your dream, and thus it was not only a fun and enjoyable book but it also had this motivational and inspiring touch to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"I love this book! Jane Spring is wonderful, and I adored her transformation from completely unfeminine to Doris Day's clone. It almost makes me wonder if a makeover like that would work...This book is funny, sweet, light, and cheerful in tone, without a hint of the cynicism so prevalent in most \\"chick-lit\\". Highly recommended as an easy vacation read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb!","review":"This book was so unbelievable and therfore, horrible! Woman decides to adopt the image of an old fashioned movie star ... down to painting her walls and redecorating her apartment? Does she even want to do this or does she think she has to in order to make friends and meet guys? People only like people who act like Doris Day? I hardly think so. I like my novels to be believable. This one is sending the wrong message to women and the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Mystery","review":"Good mystery set in a fascinating ear.

Book was in great shape and arrived fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"By Far on the Lower End of The Spectrum for African American Quote Books","review":"African American Quotation books are great tools-- mostly for their inspiration and for the broad range of subject matter and wisdom. This one is at the lower end of the spectrum for a number of reasons. There is more than a fair amount of hate in these quotes, particularly due to the mind-numbing over-abundance of quotes by Louis Farankaht. (Why?) Many of the quotes aren't by African Americans at all (Naomi Campbell, for example, is a favorite here). And the choice of Campbell's quotes are strange, particularly where they include a quote of her saying how she wants to be remembered not as a model but for the good she's done as a person (poor choice, considering that she's mostly known as a person for breaking the law and beating up underlings). The book is also poorly structured, and generally lacking. There are only a small amount of subjects covered, lacking in subjects outside of specifically racial issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found More Success in another book","review":"8 Minute Meditation was an interesting topic read, just not that practical.

Eight minutes a day means a whole new level of relaxation. I'm not sure why meditation works and author doesn't try to hype it with a lot of explaining, just lets you do it and see the results for yourself. Focus is on working through distractions to get into the meditative state. I meditate during my lunch hour at work where there is noise as well as my own internal distractions and the book tells how to deal with these and get past them. In the afternoon, I'm refreshed and productive and accepting of whatever comes. First time I've tried meditation and easy to learn and follow in this book. Well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent no-frills guide","review":"This book delivers exactly what it promises. Davich provides a clear, no-frills, user-friendly guide for novices and those who've tried meditating once or twice and been spooked, one that will get them over the bumps and ease them into an effective daily meditative practice. I like his unpretentiousness: he doesn't want to be your guru or claim to be anything but a grateful long-time student who's enjoyed the benefits of meditation and wants to share them with others. Davich doesn't try to dish up deep philosophy or elegant prose (he writes in self-help style: bullet points and short paragraphs, breezy tone, repetition of key points, tireless encouragement). He's generous in acknowledging his own teachers and pointing the reader to more advanced resources after completing this program.

This was his first big break into the spotlight as a solo artist, and he hasn't let go since then.The album serves up one happy hook after another. It gives you some great music to drive to, or to listen to while at the beach in Luquillo (that's an excellent beach in P.R.).It was hard for me to pick a few of the songs I liked from this album.

It's quite readable which is surprising in a book with almost 50 pages of documentation. (But it's reassuring to have that documentation since some of the anti-abortion violence would be otherwise unbelievable.)The organization, chronological beginning in l962 and coming up to 200l, makes it easy to dip into without gettng \\"lost\\" if you don't want to read it straight through.

Mostly it consists of a laundry list of the alleged activities by the 'anti's' whom she blames for all her troubles, although others may say that her career 'choice' was the cause of her grief. She specifically blames Operation Rescue's IMPACT school graduates for her decline in health and finances, but brushes aside the stigma of an \\"image of providers as less than noble\\" (her own words) and the visual carnage that must be the daily reproductive health scene as contributing factors. Although the subtitle of this book is 'Antiabortion Terrorism' she details many antiabortion activites which are harmless and legal. Could these actions have significantly lowered the daily \\"take\\" and thus be the real reason why Mrs. Windle cried Uncle?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unborn children, the real targets of hatred","review":"This book's main purpose is to demonize the entire mainstream non-violent pro-life movement by dwelling on the violent acts of a tiny misguided group who think they can be pro-life and at the same time lie in wait and ambush people. The legitimate pro-life movement condemns all acts of premediated violence by individuals including the violent tearing apart of innocent human beings that occurs over 4,000 times a day in abortion clinics across America.Most of the incidents described in this book are not violent at all, but they obviously had a tremendous effect on the abortion industry.

Having seen both the VHS version more than once, the picture quality of this DVD is as good as you're going to get on a film that was originally shot in 1977. Unfortunately, the filmographies are not as extensive as they could be. But, it's the actual feature film that's important here, and this DVD only adds to the unique elements that make this another of Bava's great productions.

And this all had to be done because the poor lonely soldier were so desperate for sex that they were raping local women. I cannot understand how this deplorable plot can be considered as funny.

No individual is evident in any of the photographs, yet we understand that man had his hand in all the photographer is capturing.

The software included works perfectly with my computer, as long as I followed the instructions to do it. I even used this player in friend parties where CD or mp3 were not allowed to play, and made a huge success - most of the people wanted to take a pic with it and with the records playing. Pitch control works fine, but to make it sound right I set it between -3 and -4, in my player, no buzz, no kind of rum noise. I think I got lucky. Now it's my travel company wherever I go.

I have to admit, Woot did warn me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The concept here is great(record records to your computer), but the quality is terrible. The unit is cheap plastic, and feels like a child's toy. The electronics produce a background buzz, no matter how its hooked up, even if the only connection to it is a pair of headphones (sometimes a bad ground does this, but not the case here). The spindle is too small, so that it doesn't fill the hole in the record, meaning you have to manually center the record on the turntable, or it wobbles. There's no auto return, or even a little handle on the head with which to smoothly lift the needle off the record, making it easy to scratch your record. The needle simply bounces off the end of the record.If you can get one that doesn't buzz, you could use it to record your records to your hard drive. Just be careful to line up the record perfectly on the platter, since the spindle isn't a good guide, and be ready at the end of the record to smoothly lift the needle before it hits the center label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piece of cake!!!","review":"This item could not be easier to use!

That would be thousands in todays dollars.This record player does all it is designed to do. I did not hear any hum. The turntable was flat. The arm has the acceptable amount of looseness needed for record play. The record spindle was the proper size. There is no wobble or flutter.Of course,with only 1 small speaker, it will not give concert hall sound, but a cheap set of external portable speakers will take care of that.I put on headphones and got very good quality sound from bass to treble.It is what it is!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"produces poor fidelity","review":"Ordered this unit to convert vinyl to CDs.

I was surprised to see the BBS eggs hatch within seventeen hours and willingly swim out of their protective hatchery into the mouths of my greedy betta warriors. However, I am having an issue with the hatchery. You really have to make sure that the water is actually at the water level labeled on the hatchery. It's making changing the water a bit more challenging, because if the water level drops or rises too much, salt water flows out of the hatchery. Ah well.

The only thing I dislike is how the shrimp swim out. My fish constantly wait at the fish guard gobbling them up. I wish they would have a more constant escape, but it's like in bursts. It should feed them several times a day like it says, but I wish they came out constantly in like a streamline of small quantities instead of just a few large bursts. Also, a lot of dead shells end up in the collection chamber. You also have to leave the air on at all times because if you don't, the shrimp won't get put into the right area to get out, they will try to swim up at the top near the light where they can't get out. So overall, it works as advertised, just with a few little problems. If I had to do it over though, I would just get a cup and do it that way. But it does come with a dropper which is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm doing something wrong but...","review":"I followed the directions, filled it with salt water that I have already mixed, turned on the air pump, which is the smallest one I could find (up to 25 gallons) and thought: that's way too strong an air flow, it'll kill any brine shrimp, plus the sound is irritating. So I turned off the pump for a moment and noticed that the salt water is coming into my fresh water tank. Then the suction cup let loose and the whole thing tipped over. So much for that.

I only finished the book out of loyalty to the series. The author takes the approach of little to no action, and goes way in depth at describing the characters feelings during different situations. This wouldn't of been that bad except for the fact I felt he got the characters all wrong. The way he described the characters is not how I remember them from watching the TV show. Again, not only was the book not accurate in portraying the characters, it was boring, and I literally had to force myself to finish reading it. One final warning for this book, it is by far the darkest and most adult Dr. Who book I have read to date. The ending is also not happy, in the fact that Dodo does something so insanely stupid & out of character that it kind of just ruins the story. In fact Dodo was nothing like she was in the TV series.

I may not have big ears, but they're not small either. I've been through several earphones, and none have been as uncomfortable as these.3) The cord going to each ear is the same length.

It was just one earbud that fit in the ear canal. Although comfortable, the wire quickly came loose, which made it unusable. These Sony earbuds are not meant to fit in the ear canal and are not as comfortable to me, but everybody's ears are shaped differently, so I don't fault them for that.They more than make up for falling out of my ears at times by great sound! The sound is so much better than my Gateway laptop puts out from its speakers that I now listen to my laptop with these earbuds even when I am alone. OK, it wouldn't take much to beat the crummy speakers on a Gateway laptop, but these clarify words I could not distinguish before and I can really hear that bass booming.The winding case is helpful for keeping everything neat and safe.

The sound is great, very immersive for a cheap earbud. The only problem I experienced was the insulation cracked after a few months. It held together with electrical tape for a while until snagged. But for $7, I'll just buy two pairs this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"best phones for the price","review":"i came across these earphones when i was shpoping for some full size headphones (studio/DJ scale) with cups. a few reviewers claimed these phones are have better sound than upper scale sony earbuds...and i have to agree. i think these are a must buy for anyone. you cant wear full size headphones or sound cancelling phones everywhere you go, and the MDR E828 suit are versatile to say the least.the wind up case is an added bonus...as well as the pads that come with it. the phones are a bit more comfortable with the pads on, but they are perfectly fine without them. they might even fit better without the pads depending on the size of your ears.i got these earphones for 10 bucks, but as you can see on this site you can fine them for much cheaper. its COMPLETELY worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the best!!","review":"I've used many headphones as I am addicted to my MP3 player. But none of them even come close to the sound clarity and comfort of these Sony Ear-Buds. And the best part is, for under $10 it really is a steal!!!I use these to do nearly everything from yard work to biking to running and I have no problems keeping them in my ears. I do knock them out on occasion, but that is always my fault and not the ear-buds.If you are getting ear-buds, get these. There is nothing else out there that compares to these and it is going for an unbeatable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound, electrical shocks","review":"I had the same problem a previous reviewer had -- I kept receiving little electrical shocks in my ears from the earphones! plus, the foam pads kept falling off and the earbuds were too large to securely stay in my ears during my commute. more importantly, the sound is not great. I'm no audiophile but it was impossible for me to find the right EQ setting on my ipod when using these headphones. anytime I found a setting with a moderate amount of bass, the treble would be so piercing that my ears would hurt. this is the third pair of headphones I've used with my ipod and the first time I've had any of these particular problems. they are going back if amazon will let me return them ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value - nice case","review":"The case is a key buying point for me.

The problem for me is that the earpiece is too big.

As they are uncomfortable and really hard to hear. The sad thing is that I switch the ear that they are supposed to be in they actually are more comfortable. The issue with that is that you can't hear the sound as well. Granted you can't hear the sound well in the first place if they are put in the correct ear. I have to set my volume to max on my MP3 player AND max on the cord just to hear anything. With my favorite low end headphones (Koss KEP20) I normally have to set the volume to about 25% to hear things perfectly. Bass on these headphones is also nonexistent.There are a few positives. The cord feels exceptionally rugged for the price (although the connections look like they'll break easily). The on cord volume control is a great feature for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value Earbuds - Recommended","review":"The \\"Sony MDR-E828LP Earbuds\\"\\" are very high quality for the price.These great little earbuds provide crisp and clear sound, fit very comfortably and securely in my ears, and can be stored in the nice little included wind-up case.For the low price these are a really good deal!Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"sony earbuds","review":"I sent this back the very same day, I thought it was a retractable cord earbud.

They fit great in my ears either with or without the cover pads, and the sound is as good as I need it to be. I prefer to use these for my iPod - they feel and sound better than the earbuds Apple provides.The quality is excellent, especially for the price. The first pair that I bought three years ago finally broke after heavy daily use (the sound in the right earbud stopped working, I assume I stressed the cord out a little too much), and I immediately bought it again. You're not going to go wrong for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Considering the price, these are fantastic!","review":"When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on 2nd day of use","review":"They sounded fine for a day, but one ear just stopped working on the 2nd day.

It doesn't quite reach from my iPod in the pocket of my gym-shorts to my ears. I'm tall (6'5\\") but this could still be a problem for anyone over 6 feet.Also, the buds are wider around than iPod earbuds, and they don't quite stay put in my ears like iPod ones do."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKINGLY bad","review":"Bought these earphones today and already hate them. Every 10 seconds or so the earpieces give me tiny little electric shocks to my ears. Not necessarily painful, but very uncomfortable and *NOT* what you want in a pair of headphones. I was surprised to see another reviewer had the same experience with this product.Note: I've used many other sets of headphones with my iPod and never had this problem. I'm taking these back to the shop tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Earphones","review":"I have several pairs of the Sony MDR-E828LP earphones - that's how much I love them! They are a good fit, comfortable to wear, and most of all they sound really, really good.The frequency response of 12 Hz - 22,000 Hz is excellent for producing deep bass sounds while capturing all the nuances of higher treble sounds.- Winding Storage CaseThe case comes in real handy for storing your earphones when you need to bring them with you. It's easy to operate and allows you to quickly reel in the cord for the earphones. Its clear plastic top has a circular depression that acts as a \\"crank.\\"The MDR-E828LP may be cheap, but the sound production from these are superb. This is a case in point where the adage \\"You get what you pay for\\" doesn't always hold true. If you're leery about getting these because of the low price, rest assured that these are very high quality earphones that are a real bang for your buck. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST headphones period.","review":"I got these headphones about a decade ago, and these had amazing bass. Not too much bass, not too little bass. Just the perfect amount of bass and crispness where I can close my eyes and immerse myself in the music with. Since then, I have spent roughly $400 and have gone through 8 additional headphones that have not even come close to these (5 of them from Sony, some of professional grade). These being the cheapest ones for about $10! I'm never going to try to find something better. As perfection was always $10 away, and paying more always seemed like you got a lot less.I lost these 8 years ago, but I just picked up new ones yesterday, and I can say that I can come to loving music at a much higher level once again.

I forced myself to endure the discomfort and try them out with my mp3 player, and aside from the physical pain, they actually sounded pretty decent. Not an incredible amount of bass, but they're pretty loud and accentuate the mid trebles a bunch. Sony used to make a similar all-black model to these that sounded great and weren't so physically oppressive to the ear. Unfortunately, my old ones stopped working so I tried these - what a mistake.

A pair of dangerous earbuds !","review":"I know it might sound a little weird, but I just have to state my experience and opinon about this pair of earbuds. A very strange thing happened after three days of use. The left earbud kept electrically shocking me from time to time, though not very serious, it really annoyed me. I am not sure how this weird thing happened, but it might be due to the earphones' inability to handle the power of my mp3 player, so it sort of burned itself from the inside. Never had I expericed this kind of problem before with any type of earphones, cause I always maintain the volume at medium level and it is almost impossible for my mp3 player to create such an immense power that earphones cannot even handle. It is just probably SONY earphones' poor quality that has caused the problem and annoyance.

Drinking, womanising, and violence dominate Arthurs life away from his lathe. We follow him on the breathless ride that is his life in the first part of the novel Saturday Night, and then on his reajustment to a calmer more sustainable life in Sunday Morning. The perspective the reader is given is Arthurs if only he could articulate it. This allows the reader to experience the working class perspective without the limits that somone lacking the education to express themselves as effectively would have. This is the key to the novel as the reader can utterly empathise with Arthur. A working class novel that does not focus on poverty but how class frustrations are expressed makes a welcome change."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've Ever Read","review":"I say without hesitation: this is one of the best books I ever read and has now become one of my favorites. By the same author as \\"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\\" and is sort of an expansion of that same main character. It's written in a mixed 1st/3rd person style, and it's highly entertaining, as well as a great statement on life in general.

A disc full of political allusions and full of the pain of loss (his mother had recently passed away). Standouts on this disc are: Apagon (Blackout), which criticizes both the American invasion of Panama but also the corrupt Panamanian society that accepted it; Cilindro (Cylinder), which chronicles the true story of an energy company that dumps nuclear waste in the Chilean countryside; and Adan Garcia, the bitter-sweet story of a desparate poor man trying to get out of his poverty; and West Indian Man, which talks about his own English/Caribbean roots--his grandfather was English (contrary to what many Spanish speakers insist Ruben's last name is pronounced in English, not \\"BLAH-des; this fact comes from Ruben himself in an interview on National Public Radio)Blades's music, though based in salsa and Afro-Latin rhythms, is not for dancing, but steadfast contemplation and social action.Que sigas la lucha, Ruben!"},{"rating":"2","title":"un disco solo para conocedores y amantes de la buena musica","review":"Capaz es uno de los discos mas personales de Ruben..

His thoughtful but still danceable pieces of music paint pictures of revolution and history, love and loss, and the underlying hope for all to reach out of themselves and make a better world. The first track, El Apagon, sets the stage almost cinematically. The songs about the loss of his mother are extraordinary - just thinking of them can bring a tear to the eye.

The Slappy songs are both keepers; Sarah's sexy, melodic singing leaves me yearning for an entire CD of wall-to-wall Slappy. Her voice is reminiscent of Juliana Hatfield (\\"Spin the bottle\\"). All the radio snippets are laugh-out-loud funny particularly the ones with Hooman getting arrested and Sarah's story of peeing herself in Freshman year. At the color guard competition finals. While competing. This conslusively proves Sarah is the grossest.

A few of the songs toward the end lose a little steam (\\"Prom Night\\" and \\"The Sound of Coming Down,\\" to name a couple), but overall, the record is thoughtfully arranged, with variety in tempo, style and sound.

As both an author as well as a committed activist, Chasin is able to innovatively and deftly examine and deconstruct issues concerning the commodification and niche marketing of the LGBT activist movement and to courageously question, among other issues, whether or not visiblity alone for the LGBT community is an effective means of gaining equal rights. Through its combination of exhaustive research and eloquent, intelligent writing, Selling Out becomes an indispensable resource not only for scholars, but for any reader with an interest in gaining an amazingly thorough and fresh analysis of important issues concerning the queer community.

It made me think twice about celebrating the arrival of gay couples on the pages of the magazines. This book made me realize how much the struggle for liberation is about more than simple acceptace but is about understanding and appreciating the particular situations of people who suffer discrimination.

They uniformly do NOT erase.

I literally spend more time erasing than I do writing.(I think Bic has found a way to dispose of its hazardous waste: fill pens with it, and then sell them to consumers for a few bucks each!)Get with it, Bic. These pens are terrible. Did you folks fire your entire product testing department?If you or your employers are dead set against using a chalk board, get the Expo markers instead.

That being said, I bought these for her because she's a really good person and she needed something to listen to on her job while she works. Between shipping, I found some very old computer speakers that I picked up when I used to do IT work in a school in Louisville called JCC. These were very old like late 1990s speakers. But I figured I would lend them to her until the newer speakers arrived. When the new speaker arrived, I gave them to her and in 3 days she told me that they were terrible and just bad. She told me that the late 90s speakers sounded alot better than the new ones. Once more, she told me that these have an interference problem, causing her to have a bad reception on her radio at work.Bottom line, is that you might want to avoid these speakers especially if you're giving them to someone as a present.

The rest of the book is black and white, even when it looks as if some of the art inside could have been painted in color. Some of the pieces featured in this book are little more than photo mish-mashes to make a scene, and some of those didn't really turn out well.

Although the case was about the death of a seemingly lovely person, the author seems to want to talk about himself as well as his colleagues, family, career (hx of law school, GI bill, etc). Such extra verbage was not necessary and did not add to the story - it mainly seemed to add to the interest of the author. Also, the editor was obviously a close friend and chose to let these errors go by without clearly using their power to keep the author in his place - the background. I was bored by the writing, excessive storytelling and lack of coherence. This author should stay in fiction and stay away from true victims and their families.

I'm halfway through and I give up. I kept thinking it would get better, but that never happened. This book is more about the author and the details of his life and career.

As a Tennessean, I grieve for the thousands affected by the racism of those days. This gives a different side of Andrew Jackson and the white southern politicians of those times.

By telling us stories of different wine growers and wine makers in France during World War II, the Kladstrups give us a balanced picture of war, and what it does to all human beings and their various enterprises.

The extraordinary efforts of these French patriots and their willingess to risk life, limb and often family, in order to deny some of France's treasure to the German war machine and Hitler's fanatical inner circle is a previously unknown story which bears witness to the power of the human spirit to survive, persevere and overcome obstacles which few people, fortunately, will ever confront."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This anecdotal account of vintners in France during World War II explores a little-known corner of the effects of the occupation on one of France's primary industries.

Some of the subterfuges used by the winegrowers to hide their precious wines from the Germans were ingenious and sometimes desperate. The authors tell us about certain events during the war that we have either forgotten or never realized. This book is for you if you love wine and are curious about the war period. Again, don't expect great writing style, but it is still compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs some follow-up.","review":"I took this book to my favorite wine bar, ordered a bottle and sat at a cafe table reading and drinking along with the story. I found it very interesting the significance wine played in the war. The French could often tell where battles were being staged by the amount of wine that was sent to certain areas. The French did not hesitate to pass this information along to their allies.I would have liked to have seen some follow-up regarding the men who were held captive with their full name, unit, dates of service and death dates if known. It was interesting to live through 5 years of their lives but would have liked to have known how they recovered physically as well as how they recovered their vineyards.It was enjoyable, but I also would have liked to have seen more information about the grapes themselves. Such as, what distinguishes first growth from second growth, grand cru, etc. It was more a history lesson with wine as a side note. It was still a good read and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Well written page turner. This book was a great read and appears to be quite factual. It inspires a respect for those who went to extraordinary lengths in their love of wine. I recommend this to all my wine buddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"thin analysis clouded by romanticism","review":"Despite a long bibliography at the back of the book, the book suffers from a lack insightful analysis and sharp writing. Although it is fun to hear about the wine (I actually have a greater interest in French wine as a result of reading the book) the book glosses over the historical complexities. As far as a history book goes, it provides very little. Everyone comes out a winner. The Kladstrups seem hesitant to criticize anyone whom they actually name, covering potential sins of collaboration or weakness with elaborate descriptions of wine, dinners, and romantic portrayals of life in the vinyard. They seem as reluctant to delve into things as the French did after the war. The chapter on the collaborator who made millions in wine deals with the Germans, \\"Uncle Louis,\\" remains uncritical of such profiteering. It is as though most of the writing took place after a long meal with several glasses of wine. A disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but Disorganized and Lightweight","review":"There are certainly a number of interesting story lines in this book but it is written in a breezy lightweight style and follows no discernable pattern or outline. Really this is a collection of short stories around a vague central theme of the efforts of \\"most\\" Frenchmen to protect their famous wine collections from the Germans. While certainly the stories from Alsace, Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux are decidedly different, there are many connected themes, such as the conflict between passive resistance and active collaboration, that remain unexplored. Further, the actual brutality at the doorsteps of many of these people is glossed over in favor of repeated stories about doctored wines with grand cru labels. This could have been a much better, richer book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are the authors trying to say?","review":"The book lacked writing style and content. The book is written in a very primitive boring language. Short simple sentences made me think that the book is written for teenagers. Part of it could be due to the translation of the stories from French to English. Now, content... I'm still trying to understand what point the authors were trying to make. This is a convoluted compellation of stories loosely woven in a WWII timeline. Authors have taken stories of 20 rich wine families and applied them to the entire nation, which made for a very rosy account of one of the most tragic wars in the 20th century..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book!","review":"Got wine?If you do or don't, you'll love Wine and War.

Judith McNaught writes the absolute best books. The character developmant in this book was above and beyond and I loved the fact that she gave us a little insight as to what Sheridan's childhood was like.

All of the other titles are reworks and variations of these three.

The story line is so simple and predictable, and not realistic. I did not think that McNaught did a fair job with this book compared to her other historical romance novels. I try really hard to finish reading this book because I really like Stephen but I could not see the connection between and Sheridan.

The trick of bringing together everyone in her previous novels is also lame beyond words. If this is what her works have degenerated into- and after reading \\"Until You,\\" \\"Remember When,\\" and \\"Night Whispers,\\" it's no wonder I am beginning to have serious doubts about her works- maybe it's time I stopped buying her books without first checking them out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book made me wonder if there isn't a conspiracy to brainwash fans of the genre into loving even the basest and down-right ridiculous romance stories.

Sheridan is my second favorite female character, after Whitney, and she is the perfect match for Stephen. Their story is very sweet and extremely romantic.

Now, to spend time reading emergencies situation on board and how the big cruise lines plans everything to take advantage over passengers and ports, just in order to make the cruise industry to look bad!?

The Hellers did a brilliant job of bringing cutting edge trauma symptom resolution to what has been very mysterious and elusive in the past. This book breaks new ground. If you've ever been in a serious auto accident, please read this book, make it a gift to yourself. It can reduce suffering and be a facinating read at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Course: A Self-Healing Guide to Auto Accident Trauma a","review":"This book provides practical and powerful information about the process of healing trauma. Dr. Diane Heller's focus is auto accident recovery, but the exercises explained in the book could be used to recover from trauma of any kind. The use of analogy and the author's clear writing make this book easy to understand and to use. Though debilitating, the symptoms of trauma can sometimes be subtle and hard to recognize as being related to the traumatic experience. It is good there is a book available that can help people recognize their symptoms and help heal them in a gentle, compassionate and effective way. Dr. Heller's methodology is unlike psychotherapy which requires the patient to re-experience the trauma by repeatedly re-telling the story. She has developed a profoundly effective method which heals without retraumatizing. I highly recommend this book - it can ONLY help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low calibre battery","review":"This battery doesnt have much stamina at all.

I am writing a review for the WHOLE series. Outlaw Star tells the tale of Gene Starwind and Jim Hawking. Who inevitably end up leaving there home planet and getting caught up in a race for the Galactic Layline. On there way they will meet lots of friends and enemies such as Melfina, the McDougal Bros., Aisha Clan Clan of the Ctarl Ctarl, Sazukie Twilight and a whole bunch more in this action series from bandai that keeps you laughing while it delivers great action. What is the Galactic Layline? Well people say that at the Galatic Layline can be found a great treasure. But if you wanna know more you'll have to get the dvd's (or the tapes). Outlaw Star can also be seen on the Cartoon Networks Toonami (although they cut a bit). Anyway I hope this review was helpful. Be sure to check out my review of the Outlaw Star spinoff, Angel Links."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conclusion of the series, but predictable ending.","review":"We see the end of the series, the fates of the McDougall Brothers, the Pirates and the crew of the Outlaw Star, and an explaination of the Galatic Leyline.

But as other reviewers have said, this set is prone to cracks in the handles near the rivets and mine were no exceptions.

When I bought them the reason was the color and the price reduction at Christmas, I like red. But when I started using them I found them to be sharp and able to keep an edge. The only drawback is that you cannot leave them in the sink damp they will stain and tarnish. This is the way with any good carbon steel knife. All in all I would buy another set when the price gets to the one that I bought at just for spares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have lucked out","review":"I bought these knives without reading the reviews. I became concerned after reading them, second guessing myself for ordering what I expected to be rusty, defective knives.What a great surprise when they came. They are the best knives I've owned and no problem with rust (my daughter even left a used knife in the sink overnight and it was as good as new - no rust)With a name like Cuisanart, I figured it was worth the chance at $39.99 - glad I ordered them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality. Terrible handles.","review":"I was so excited to find these knives on sale for $49.99, but that excitement was short-lived. When I unwrapped the knives I thought the plastic of the handles looked a little strange, and on closer inspection I found there were small cracks at the rivets on many of the knives. I knew these tiny cracks would only get bigger with use, so I returned the set to amazon for a replacement. But when I received the replacement set, I found that one of the knives had a big crack all the way through the handle; back again to amazon for a replacement. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong! More like three strikes, you're out! Once again, one of the knives had a big crack in the handle. So, I gave up and just sent the knives back to amazon for a refund. Obviously, these are just some really poorly made knives. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine were cracked too.","review":"I guess one of these days I'll learn to believe the reviews. My set came with multiple cracked handles. One was cracked completely across. I was also missing knives. The large chef and small santoku were nowhere to be found while there were two of the large santoku. As others have mentioned, no reply from Cuisinart so I am returning the set. There needs to be better quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality for the price","review":"There are several reasons for the low rating. First of all, when I first ordered this beautifully looking (on the picture) set I was surprised to see quite different color of the handles when the knifes were unpacked. It not as bright red as pictured, but very dull color. Secondly, some of the knives were defective - curving blades, deep scratches and minor cracks on the handles. The set was exchanged by Amazon quick and without any hassle. The replacement set was slightly better, but still not perfect. The main complaint right now is rusting. You basically have to wash and dry the knives immediately after use, otherwise they will get covered with rust spots really quick - this is what happened to one of my knives after I left on the table for a few hours after slicing a tomato. It's a huge hassle to do, especially if you are cooking a big dinner and use a lot of knives. Unfortunately, I have to strongly recommend staying away from this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall Poor quality","review":"I was very disappointed in these knives. While quite sharp, the steel was *very* thin. They don't have enough weight to be a good chopper, plus chopping anything makes me nervous that the blade will shatter. Every single one of them rusted after being run through the dishwasher. It did come right off with a couple swipes of an abrasive pad, but had I left the dishwasher full while on vacation I'd have had to use a lot more elbow grease. I would definitely not buy these knives a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracks & Rust","review":"I just bought this set on sale and you definite get what you pay for. All the larger knives have small cracks in the plastic handles. But more importantly, they develop rust spots no matter how careful you are. The 8\\" Chefs knife rusted after my first use. I removed the rust, lightly oiled the knife and was made sure to complete dry each knife after washing only to find the rust came back. The metal is very poor quality and after 2.5 weeks of regular use the blades are starting to dull. I am returning these knives. I highly recommend that you do not buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted & Cracked","review":"After just one was in the dishwasher (Top Shelf)All of the knives started to rust.The main chopping knife's handle also cracked in the dishwasher as well.I'm very unhappy with this product.Knives are sharp though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handles crack, blades rust.

On the phone I was lost twice in the transfer, or could not reach (M-F 8-5)(please note that the phone number on the warranty card is not for knives).

I called cuisinart and instead of just returning the two broken knives to them (they would charge me shipping both ways even defective) they said it was best to send back to amazon. It seems like a great set for the price assuming nothing is cracked out of the box so I will be getting a replacement set and we'll see how it goes. Based on other reviews it seems like a roll of the dice as to if your set will come in one piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING!","review":"Yep, I bought these on black Friday special for $35 without reading the reviews. Couple hours later, still stoked from my great deal, I read the reviews. Not wanting to miss out on a great price, I saw the Pinzon knives also on sale and bought those. Glad I did...My Cuisinart knives are cracked as well. SUCH a disappointment.I already have a 5 inch Cuisinart santoku knife (purchased from BB&B;) that I LOVE. I haven't had any issues with that one. I compared mine with the one that came with the set, and you can CLEARLY see the difference in quality. I suspect that the Amazon set was made by another manufacturer with little quality control. The Amazon set has cracks, black dings and there was even a sliver of the plastic in one of the baggies.I still like the Cuisinart brand, but will be more cautious next time.One other note: DO NOT put good knives in the dishwasher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!","review":"I purchased this knife set as a gift for Christmas. When I got the knives, I opened them up and checked them out. Out of the 20 knives, 18 of them were cracked on the handle. One was cracked completely through. Cuisinart refused to help me and replace them. Definitely a poor product. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't risk it","review":"I purchased this set when it was under $40.00 and thought it was worth the risk. It is not. My knives were also cracked and the blades are very thin and some were knicked. For the Cuisinart brand these are subpar. There is something to be said for a set of knives that can range in price to over $150.00 to under $40.00 in less two days. Buy another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this set!","review":"My wife and I received this set as a wedding gift a couple years ago. In that time, nine of the handles have cracked, all in the same place: along the uppermost rivet. We tested one of these knives in the dishwasher, and since the color immediately faded, we have taken care to always wash these knives by hand. No matter. I'm not sure if it's exposure to water, or some other factor which causes them to crack, but these knives are absolutely awful and not worth a purchase.There really should have been a recall on these knives, as any knife with a propensity for indiscriminately cracking is a danger to the user."},{"rating":"1","title":"handles crack","review":"I bought these on sale at Macy's a while ago.

Cuisinart Cutlery is the pits...Literally!","review":"This is the worst Knife set I have ever purchased. Every single piece started rusting and pitting after the FIRST use. Extremely poor quality and no answere from Cuisinart. I am very disappointed because I own several Cuisinart appliances and am very pleased with them so I assumed the quality would carry over.WRONG!!!! If ever a knifeset should be recalled and all customers reimbursed...this is it.I implore AMAZON and every other retailer that offers these items for sale to discontinue. Cuisinart needs to stick to the appliance business and whoever manufacrutes that knives in China should be sued.Sincerely,Stephen Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry I did not check out the reviews before I purchased.","review":"I am afraid to start to use the knife set. It said it was 18/8 stainless steel. 18/8 stainless is the highest quality stainless and will not rust. So if there is a rusting issue it is not 18/8 stainless as advertised. I also noticed a few hairline cracks radiating about 1/4 inch off the rivets on the larger knives. I also saw where people had purchased the sets on Amazon for less than $50. I paid $150, Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good idea this time!","review":"This product came cracked and badly broken. Still waiting for refund or replacement.

Most online stores are selling this thing for under $200. The cheapest I've found (from musiciansbuy.com) was $195.95 including free shipping, Yamaha PA3C power adaptor, Stereo headphones and Two-year extended warranty.

This film is the second kind.I've admired Rob Lowe as a comic talent since Illegally Yours, and there are signs here that he might have done better with a better script, better direction with more pace, and less self-conscious rattling away at the 'ha-ha' kind of funny; but he's not helped by a lack-lustre cast and jokes that just don't cross the Atlantic successfully.

This book may be fascinating and interesting, but it is too scary for parents. As an educator, I read with great interest. As a parent, it left me in tears, as I contemplated what adulthood would be like for my son with autism.Our knowledge and understanding of autism has changed drastically since the sixties and seventies. It is heartbreaking to realize how the individuals in this book could have benefitted from some of the therapies and teaching strategies that our kids today are receiving.I fail to see how this book can do anything for parents, but scare them. There is little correlation between autistic children raised and educated in the 60's and 70's and autistic children being raised and educated today.

There's a lot of variety on this CD, and I love the performances by other artists, such as Zoe Girl and Out of Eden.

But other than that, I love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best I have heard from Avalon","review":"I love Avalon's music, but I felt this CD is vastly overrated. For starters, the only song on this album worth listening to is Testify to Love. The other songs that are re-mixed sound loud and full of so much background music and beats, you cannot hear what Avalon is even singing! If you like music where its rock/pop and you can't hear the words of your favorite christian group, then this album is for you. If not, I would not recommend it. I will say that all of their other albums are MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shockingly horrible","review":"don't get me wrong, I long Avalon, they're one of my favorite groups, and I love a great beat but the sounds coming from this cd didn't go well with Avalon. It's all techno which isn't bad, I like techno, but all the songs sound the same. And the same sound doesn't sound good for every song they've decided to remix. About all the songs are over 6 minutes and in most of them they hardly sing at all. It sounds like thery're just playing around with the intraments in the recording studio. When I heard that this cd came out I just went and bought it because I've loved all of Avalon's stuff so far but next year I think I'll have to preview the cd before i buy it. This cd is only for those who love a monotonous techno sound. There's a warning label on this cd and rightfully so. Note: Make it last forever- is a shocker. It's all rap. Be sure you preiview this cd before you buy. On christianbook.com you can preview all the songs which is what I should've done before I got this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did this come from Avalon?","review":"I am the biggest Avalon fan on earth. I've always been impressed with their music quality, creativity, and message. This disc is the complete opposite.

I can't stand to listen to them, and I can listen to anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avalon Remixed.","review":"This is a remix of some of Avalons great songs.

This book is much slower without all the action.

He was a very negative individual who found fault in everyone else -- especially the Baptists (who the author, apparently doing very little research, confuses with Pentecostals). It was ironic how critical and judgmental he was toward Baptists because he believes they are critical and judgmental. Outside of this acidic bile, this was a fair book. I might read more just to see who the bad guys are in the next novel. Girl scouts maybe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very humorous, with a very believable setting.","review":"Despite the seemingly dark plot (the murder of an ultra religious lady in a small town's library), this is in fact a very humorous, very funny story.

So after 10 it is 20, 30, 40.. 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are far better counting bks for kids","review":"I ordered this book based on the cover since it looked like a good children's counting book. As an educator I would not recommend this book. The pictures often have random drawings (ex. 70 bees drawn next to 70 hot-air balloons, with the whole page stressing some random radio news).I also found the page for the number 10 very odd. Why does a children's counting book need to have a girl in a shower, half-clothed?? Furthermore, the drawing for the number zero is a totally unclothed child sitting on what looks like clouds forming zero. Artistic expression or not, as a parent I do not find these 2 mentioned drawings appropriate for children's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"About This Book","review":"This book is a chidrens book that teaches them to count.

It also got me hooked to Jerry and his music. You can feel his passion as he sings and you can definitely tell that this Salsero is for real. He does not dissapoint with this album. Being his sophmore release, \\"Cuenta Conmigo\\" was the album that made Jerry Rivera a salsa-loving family, a household name. The hit track, \\"Casi un Hechizo,\\" is the song that most are familiar with because of the great lyrics and the arrangement of the music. Also, it was the first salsa song I dedicated to my baby! Point is, Jerry jams on this album and he set the mark with this album for me and for a lot of other salsa fans to look out for him because he CAN deliver great salsa music. The three songs that are most notable to me are \\"Casi un Hechizo,\\" \\"Cuenta Conmigo,\\" and \\"Me Estoy Enamorando\\" But like every other Jerry project, all the songs jam and sure enough this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music you've never heard","review":"This is one of those cases where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. WOW! I bought this cd, only knowing 1 of the 10 artists, but I was immediately struck by the stunning voices all these ladies have (all the artists are female).

He not only addresses specific issues, he also teaches the reader how to do apologetics by covering apologetic theory: theological basis; points of contact; the nature of faith and commitment; etc. Also, while he addresses philosophical issues, he writes as a theologian and so goes beyond arguments for God's existence and historical evidences to defend doctrinal beliefs as well.

She also mentioned in Lady President the scramble for power in central Asia and she brought up some great points about our future with hostile countries, once we have a woman president.

This one is still my favorite because its more mature but the others also deserve 5 stars. People say this album is pretty un-donna like buy hey they grow up too so this is what they made. The album is less punk but its more rock and a bit slower also because of Torrys tedonitis. Anyway... I love everysong off the album. The only song which was good but not as great in my opinion was \\"Is That All You Got For Me\\".

All these girls like Ashlee Simpson and Avril Lavigne, who for some reason think they're rebellious and cool could learn a lot from this.

Previous releases showed their mastery of the three chord punk and classic rock. Gold Medal finds them starting to step beyond these trappings, learning some tricks from hazy californian psychedelic artists, while keeping the power and energy from their older albums. This is no longer The Donnas telling us to \\"get skintight\\" now that their baby fat is gone the songs find room for acoustic guitars, mellow vocals and even piano lines replacing guitar solos. While the album does offer a few heavy jams overall the songs are more laid-back and that shouldn't be taken to mean weak and slow, most of the songs have as much energy if not more than their noisy brothers. All of this leads the listener to believe that with Gold Medal they're not just asking us to \\"spend the night\\" they're asking us to move in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold Medal","review":"I heard \\"Fall Behind Me\\" and had to know who the band was.

Somebody convinced the band to change their style from 'tough-chick AC/DC' to 'lame-rock with distorted guitars'. What was fun about the Donna's was their aggressiveness and attitude, both of which seem to be sorely lacking on this one. On the previous albums you didn't mind that the singer really can't sing, but the songs on this one really make it somewhat painfully obvious. Not their best, but good luck to 'em anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BAND AROUND - THEIR BEST RECORD YET!","review":"Once again, the Donnas prove that they are the best band around with 11 great new songs. The music is filled with great hooks and melodies and breaks, and the lyrics are better than ever! Alison's guitars (even the acoustic ones!) have a razor sharp edge, Torry's drums are full-on-in-your-face, Maya keeps laying down sexy sexy basslines, and Brett's voice has never sounded this good! The single, \\"Fall Behind Me\\", is blistering Rock 'n' Roll at it's best. \\"Revolver\\" is another kick-ass track, as is the spaghetti-westernesque \\"The Gold Medal\\". We're treated to a much more \\"live\\" and raw sound this time around, and it shines! There's a new depth to the songwriting, but it in no way takes away from the edge, humor and sense of fun these ladies have.Give yourself a present - buy this record! And when the Donnas come to your town, check out the show - it's gonna be good!Accept the truth - YOU LOVE THE DONNAS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up!","review":"As others have written, this album is a big departure from the typical Donnas' sound. In my opinion, this is a really BAD departure. There's no emotion to the songs; it's like the girls are just going through the motions. There's also no volume to the songs - they're almost ballads (Gold Medal might be a true ballad).If you liked the other Donnas' albums, get all of them before you get this - then DON'T get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No so hot","review":"I have to agree with the others who said this album sounds like the record company talked them into softening their sound to be more commerical. The guitar parts and more subdued, although perhaps more techincally proficient, and the vocals have lost their edge. And the lyrical content is \\"safer\\" and more parent-friendly. What's up with that? Someone mentioned Avril Lavigne, which I thought was funny because there was one track on their that reminded me of her as well. I like Avril, but I didn't want to her the Donnas doing Avril.This album doesn't compare at all with the power, edgy-ness or attitude of \\"get Skintight\\". I'd rather listen to any of their previous albums, and I think I have them all. O.K., so maybe it's better than the Electrocutes album, but lord it's not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"sorry ladies. i liked some of your previous work but this release will not do. it seems over-produced. spending too much time on your hair and trying to look pretty than on your music.i liked you before because you reminded me of the runaways.but now you are just another pop rock band.it's bad enough that liz went this route but now you too? oh well.theres really nothing to savor here, no memorable tunes.and that video,good god.anyway...a big disappointment as i was expecting more rocking tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent title track keeps Gold Metal a winner","review":"Being a novice to the music of The Donnas, I saw the video for \\"Fall Behind Me\\" on that music channel that rarely plays music anymore and enjoyed the hell out of it. Sort of a female version of Jet, a retro throwback to seventies rock sensibilities during a time when throwbacks are currently reserved for an eighties feel. I picked it up on a whim a couple of days ago and the album surprised me. As it is with most albums, few songs are keepers, the others you skip past. That isn't the case for this one. Clocking in at a little over thirty minutes, it is comprised of tightly wound songs that blow past and leave a sweet, memorable aftertaste. The highlight, to me, is the track Gold Medal, a sure candidate for their next single. This is a great record and I was pleased to have heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! Not what you expected. Even better!","review":"The first time I popped this cd into my player and listened to it, I must admit, I didn't know what to think. It wasn't at all what I had imagined it would be, a newer version of Spend The Night. I decided to concentrate on listening to the first four songs to get a better feel for the cd. It didn't take long for me to realize, this cd not only isn't supposed to be STN, it's even better. There is a good variety of styles of songs but also the familiar rock-n-roll sound that we have come to love from guitar-goddess Allison Robertson.Buckle up and get ready for this one. This is one of the most imaginative cd's you will find anywhere these days. You will find yourself singing the songs with a smile on your face and not even realize it. That is the sign of a great song. This cd is full of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too much imagination at work here!","review":"Being an MP3 and playlist-obsessive person, I gave this book a perusal at the bookstore. There wasn't a whole lot of thought put into many of these lists. Just because a batch of songs has the word \\"martini\\" in the title, for example, doesn't make them hold together as a playlist. When you're thinking about making a playlist for the open road, the songs you pick don't need to necessarily describe the road, but should make you feel alive and free. One of the downsides to itunes is that anyone can drag and drop songs and think they've made a worthy playlist. Real playlist making takes eons of internal debate (like John Cusack's character in \\"High Fidelity\\"). There is an art to making mixes that this book generally misses out on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stocking stuffer or gag gift","review":"by Clif ColbyThis review is short, because this book is short. The one redeeming quality of this book is there is no doubts what it is about: a book of playlists. No iPod tips or tricks, no troubleshooting guides, not even history about the songs.

This is simply a cute book of sample playlists for different events such as \\"Songs for Crying in your Beer\\" or \\"Martini Time.\\"This is one of those fun little gifts you see at a checkout...like the mini book that has 6 pages and is 2 inches tall that has different ways to say I love you.

Sex, religion and death are his main themes and he doesn't seem to stray too far from them. This is the Martin we have known and loved for the last 20 years or so. He hasn't changed a bit on this album. Appropriately titled Counterfeit2, it seems to take off where the last one ended, this time with a wider selection of songs and a bit more diverse musical instrumentation. The arrangements are familiar, signature sparse electronic sounds and textures you can find on any Depeche Mode album. Highlights include \\"Stardust\\",\\"Loverman\\", and the piano-driven \\"Lost in the Stars\\" Of course, all in all, Martin is best just being himself. This collection is a nice afterthought, but not nearly as interesting as his original work in Depeche Mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"OK, perhaps I'm a little too nostalgic, but at the mention of the words Depeche Mode, Martin Gore, Dave Gahan, or anything having to do with Depeche Mode, I immediately recall their dark late 80s/early 90s signature sound. I simply can't shake it out of my system. With enough said, I expected this CD to sound similar to Martin's Counterfeit 1 album from 1990. Turns out I had set myself up for quite a disappointment. Counterfeit 2 to me is too mellow, flat, and simply depressing. His voice isn't even the same.So maybe that was 15 years ago, and artists are supposed to grow and all, but that still doesn't keep me from wishing that the members of DM would stop putting out that lame stuff and got back to making music the way they used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio flyer...","review":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible. Why? Martin's music is more like a religion than an interest, so everthing should be 5 stars, right? Well, these aren't his songs, but they are really good. The two best are on the UK import of Loverman (Loverman and the German ditty), alas, they're probably not the album versions. Five stars would be all the songs being as good as these. Four stars would be different production. People seem to really like blips and squeaks atop sub-sonics, but I think this is just the Depeche Mode version of being on the bandwagon (instead of building the wagon like they did in the beginning)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs Get Great Treatment","review":"While Martin Gore's first solo release was very short and rather demo-like in sound quality, \\"Counterfeit2\\" is a full fledged album. I haven't heard of either of the two producers listed on the album but, they do a great job. The mood is very much like Depeche Mode's last album, Exciter. After the last ten years of Martin favoring his guitar over his synths, the lack of guitars is quite a surprise. Though Martin didn't write these songs he has chosen songs that flow together very well. This isn't your typical remake album; a fan can sit and listen to this cd and hear how these songs influenced Martin Gore and, for that reason I love them, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"track list","review":"Track Listing1.

What a waste of $$$!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin is Amazing!!","review":"This album is by far the best album of covers I have ever heard. Martin Gore lets us see not only his vocal talent on this album, but he also shows us his excellent taste in music. Martin himself is an amazing songwriter, but it's nice to hear him add his touch to other people's songs. This album proves to me what a musical genius Mr. Gore truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Its no good\\"","review":"I had to at least give it one star because after all its Martin Gore and he deserves something.However I was really let down by what I heard .The songs lacked emotion and were pretty much monotone.They sounded like a train wreck .Worse yet he had that same tone deaf sound of someone who had one too many at the local Karaoke lounge.Im sorry Martin we all know you are capable of so much more than this.If this is what your career would be without Depeche Mode please stay the course with D.M.After \\"Counterfeit-I\\" it should have ended.We all know that sequels usually bomb and this was no exception.To quote one of D.M.s songs \\"Its no good\\".Now I think I will \\"Enjoy the Silence\\".This was not \\"Music for the masses.\\"Okay I'll stop now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of Sweet Briar College","review":"The book -The Story of Sweet Briar College came quickly and in the shape that I expected it to be in."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good, her class was amazing, I was never so fit when i did her workout!!","review":"you cant be half committed with this workout, get down low every step and punch and kick hard and strong, I watched the fat melt off my stomach.

If he published the book in 1977, and he was getting older at that time, then Corey reflects the sadly outdated attitudes of his day toward cats.The book only marginally deals with the title, \\"Do Cats Think?\\", but when he does address the title, he does so admirably. In addition, he does well when puncturing the myth of infallibility and objectivity in the sciences. Yet, the book is mostly stories of his relationships with his many cats. Had he limited himself to his stories, the book would have been a treasure.However, the heartwarming stories mostly end with the violent deaths of the cats. This book is, albeit unintentionally, a prime argument against free-ranging companion animals, even in so-called \\"safe\\" rural areas. Corey never seems to connect cause and effect.I'd recommend this book only if you know a lot about the subject, and can separate the wheat from the chaff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Don't buy this book...such a waste of money!!

I was expecting a boring book about hiking, but was surprised with an incredible journey. I only wish the book was longer!One reason i think this book is good is the length of the hike. While the author had to cover a decent amount of mileage a day he did not need to speed as much as PCT hikers do. This allows the author to linger a bit, interact with people and things, and really relay his thoughts onto paper.The book really does cover as many topics as the different landscapes across Oregon. I've been blessed to travel around a lot of Oregon and know how much the animals, people, and plants change from one part of the state to another.

It just doesn't read like Cornwell at all; the action is nothing like what we are used to, the characters lack conviction, and Sharpe and Harper simply don't act, sound or respond like the two men we know.My guess is that an editor was responsible for most of the work. You can write an addition to a series, use all the same characters, but that's not enough. Examples are to be seen in LeBeau's splendid Buckskin novels and those after the first 12 - check these out, you won't be sorry - Ruth Plumly Thompson's Oz works; and at least one of the Travis McGee books, which just doesn't ring true. Anyone feel the same way?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great introductory text!","review":"Sara Trenholm is a gifted writer.

To add to it, the soundtrack is horribly out of place, fraught with woodwinds that would have been more applicable to a series with a more organic feel, or sci-fi of the 70's.On the whole, this is a series that is better skipped. There's much more promising titles out there that should have your hard earned money put towards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good functional teapot","review":"I bought this pot for my mother for Mother's Day and it went over quite well.

Also, not being to control the camera angle was aggravating on many levels. I often found myself wanting to blast Ron and Hermione for being constantly in the way and contributing nothing.

In any case, I had tons of fun with games 1, 2, and 3. The combination of exploration with mini-challenges/quests was engaging and fun. I loved exploring and hunting for the bonuses and messing around with the prefects during night missions, but this game disappointed me. I was happy to have the exploration back after game 4, but there was no challenge whatsoever. The whole thing was insultingly easy and required no strategy. Everything could be beaten/completed on essentially the first try, which was a bit of a let down, honestly. Maybe it's because I was younger when I played the earlier games, but I like them much better because they actually had parts that required some thought/planning/stealth and retries. There's no triumph when you get past any given part of this game because a two year old could do it.Alas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"If you enjoyed the documentary, you'll love this book. Not only does it transcribe the entire movie, but it provides facts upon facts on where it was gathered. It's hard to read these one-star reviews which state it's full of lies & heresy when here, published in black & white, are the proven facts. And to say it's all about the money for Michael Moore is riduculous. He's trying his hardest to inform the people what this past administration has done to our nation. He's as frustrated as the rest of us; and just wants to know the truth & reasoning behind this war. And just to add, all profits from his recently published/released \\"Will They Ever Trust Us Again?\\" are going to the families of the servicemen & women whom the government has abandoned. So, if you get the chance, pick up a copy of that compilation of soldiers' letters...it's truly a magnificent read.

Instead of just whining about it, why don't they actually get informed? And informed does not mean turning on Fox. Or even CNN for that matter.

There are so many well-researched facts in Moore's movie that I want to remember, it's handy to have them in book form.Michael Moore is one of the greatest Americans.

There is a difference between exercising your freedom of speech and spouting treason. Moore's movie was a collection of manipulative slander, and this book simply offers more of the same. I saw the movie and it stank. It was skillfully done, but it stank. This book reeks also. It's is a fictitious book about a fictitious film cooked up by a fictitious filmmaker.

The bottom-heavy light stands up reliably to light up ceiling or under-desk jobs (installing CPU holders), and would also light up a night-time tire change (if you happened to have your toolbox in the car).All in all, it does what it's supposed to do, but feels like it should cost half what it does.

Christie's Poirot was extremely vain about his appearance and even dyed his hair! Ustinov takes away all the character's suave, quiet dignity and turns him into a bloated clown.

Maggie Smith as the dowdy resort proprietor . . . James Mason. The list goes on. Not exactly the best movie ever made, but then it wasn't aimed at that.

The unique feature is that it has two velcro straps which make it easy to apply and allows the wearer to tighten the wrap to their specific needs.

I am an avid socce player and track is starting up and I wanted to be able to heal quicker. This brace does not stay up when you put it on top of leggings, jeans, or spandex so if your plan in to wear any of that, this isn't the brace. When put tightl on your actual skin/leg it seems to stay up pretty good. When they say one size fits all, it pretty much does with the adjustable strap. My thigh is about 20 inches and it fits me. The brace can fit a lot bigger of a leg also. In my opinion it gives a lot of support. It is worth the price If you are serious about getting your leg healed. The only bad thing is that i ordered the one day shipping and it came in two days. Otherwise it was decent.

Esmeralda Santiago is a brilliant writer and has beat the odds after all she's been through. I mean I'm not going to lie about anything in this review.

It reminds me of the little neighbor hood my families grow up in, and how rough those times were. Her book is moving and vivid. She speaks of growing up in the little barrio of Macun and how her mother picked up her eleven children and dreamed of a better life in Brooklyn New York. She speaks of how strong and determined her mother was. Ms. Santiago speaks of how her life was and the changes she went through as a girl and the many things she saw her mother and other women in her barrio go through with there husbands and with there own families. This memoir is a great testimony to many young adolescents and to the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Life","review":"For anyone who appreciates excellent literature, I highly recommend this book. You are immediately drawn into the world of a young Puerto Rican girl and the joys and challenges of her daily life.

Esmeralda is definetly talented and deserves all the compliments in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I strongly recommend it.","review":"This is a great book to learn about Puerto Rican culture.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommended it to anyone interested in reading a good story from an ethnic perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little material for book club discussions","review":"I expect the prime reason this autobiography was published is because it's unique. However, it's only half a story - assume this is contrived in the hope of selling the other half at a later date. The author's reconstruction of dialogue is to be admired, as well as the descriptions of her life of poverty and deprivation. More to be admired is the character of her mother who managed to produce and provide for eleven children in an unmarried state, while coping with an irresponsible father. Can only recommend if you're looking for a holiday read. Very little material for book club discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very considerate amount of trash!","review":"For all of you trash lovers, this is an exquisite treasure of idiocy. Esmeralda Santiago is one of the recent idiots that have succeded in contemporary publishing due to being a \\"minority.\\" I had to read this novel for a class; otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it. It starts OK. The narrator speaks of her childhood in childish, but cute tones. The first three chapters are not that bad, if you like anthropological literature, inside of which one sees the customs of an \\"exotic\\", or \\"minor\\", land. But after chapter four, one starts to get attacked by the most horrible cliches in fashion. The stupid narrator discovers her sexuality; discovers the hate for her father; discovers life; discovers Harvard. If you like Latin American lit, and are tired of Garcia Marquez, try Reverend Borges, Cabrera Infante or Onetti. If you're into women lit, try Poniatowska. If you like the Kinky Kincaid sort of lit, well, read more of Santiago, and good luck in your dumb readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I was Puerto Rican","review":"In my English class we have read this book that is called \\"When I was Puerto Rican.\\" I think this book is not interesting. But that would be my opinion. What I think this book is about is how they move from a little pueblo called \\"Macon\\" into New York City. They didn't like where they move. And there dad was a little player and the mother of course you know how some women are they take their men back cause they feel that they can't find anyone else, so she kept taking him back. The mother had 7 kids with this guy, but there was no prblem about how many kids they had.But if you enjoy a book that has something to to with someone's life style you may be the person t enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"...this is boring...this is stupid...this is boring...this is stupid...buy another thing...buy at amazon...but don't buy this...this is stupid...this is boring..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant story of the Puerto Rican experience","review":"I read this memoir a year ago but didn't have access to the Internet til this year. Although I was born in the 60's, this book reminded me of the \\"cuentos\\" my mom used to tell me about her childhood in P.R. My mother passed along the expressions, cooked the foods, talked the talk, walked the walk to make life better for her children. Santiago's triumph in the face of adversity is something Latinos should admire and emulate. The only negative aspect was Santiago's mother \\"falling in love\\" and having so many children--but then loving & children are our weaknesses. And to all those negative reviewers, maybe you should try writing your own memoir if you think you can do better. I think if publishers are willing to publish material from minorities, we should go for it. After reading Anglo books/memoirs all my life, I needed this.

Thank you Esmeralda Santiago."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could give it 0 stars I would","review":"This book was horrible! Santiago exoticizes Puerto Rican culture. The proper way to eat a guayaba? Gimme a break! And the ending of the book is pathetic: she gets into Harvard and therefore is successful. Nothing else needs to be said. Oh please. As a Puerto Rican who went to an Ivy League school there is more to life that getting a diploma from a prestigious school and it certainly is no guarantee of success. Santiago is clearly capitalizing on the current thirst for 'ethnic' books in this country (just look at the title). For EXCELLENT writing and a more realistic view of life on the island I recommend Ana Lydia Vega, Magali Garcia Ramis, Rosario Ferre, Edgardo Rodriguez-Julia, Luis Rafael Sanchez."},{"rating":"2","title":"i guess my teacher liked it","review":"i had to read this for a college class (urban development). this book really gives you the opportunity to reflect on how hard it is to get by in other cultures. the author of this book overcomes a lot of hardship and eventually obtains her phd in the u.s. it is powerful. i wouldnt have read it unless it was for class though. thats minus 1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please...","review":"I had to read this book for a class in college back when it was still fairly \\"new\\".

It was honest. Esmeralda talks of her childhood, and unlike some memoirs does not portray herself to be anything but what she was. There were times she was a spoiled brat, times she embarassed herself, times she was scared. She lays it all out there. The memoir covers her childhood from I'm guessing 5 or so till age 14 or 15. I was not clear on what age she was when or what year it was at the time. That would be my only complaint. I felt as tho I was really getting to know her throughout the book, feeling her frustration at being the oldest of eleven children (must not have manufactured condoms yet), the difficulties of being poor, and her embarassment at going to the welfare office with her mother. Truly, not an easy childhood at all, especially being uprooted and moved every year or few months. Esmeralda definetly overcame all obstacles and became an amazing writer, injecting humor into truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN I WAS PUERTO RICAN","review":"Esmeralda Santiago goes in depth of how she has live in Puerto Rico with her siblings and her parents (that are not married). She is a country child. when she goes to a school in the city she gets stereotyped by all of the kids and teachers there. She goes through a lot. Her parents fought a lot and then got back together. Her dad was pretty much never home. She doesn't escape the stereotyping when her family moves and leaves their dad to go to live in New York. She gets into a high school that wants to put her a grade lower since she didn't speak English so well. She proves them wrong and learns English in a few months. She auditions for a performing school and graduates as well proving everyone wrong that thought that she would never make it. This has inspired me to go forward in life and try to block all of those people that don't believe in me. I love this book so much I've read it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I was Puerto Rican","review":"I found this book to be a reflection of what so many Puerto Ricans have felt.

I was left breathless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!Esmeralda holds NOTHING back!You wont put it down!","review":"This book is like a sneak peak into the hearts and lives of Puerto Rican migrants. Esmeralda Santiago writes in a way that makes you feel what she feels. She puts you in her shoes and takes you through her journey from Puerto Rico to the United States, as well as from her childhood to adolesence. Many people migrate to the United States searching for a better life without poverty. Unfortunately, in many cases these people are greeted with low paying jobs and discrimination. The effects of migration are different for everybody. The increasing number of immigrants coming to this country makes it necessary to educate yourself about different cultures. This seems to be the only way to break down the walls of misconception between people of different backrounds. Read this book and LEARN about the migration experience of a poor, Puerto Rican family in search of a better future. Beautifully written! Colofully detailed! Shockingly honest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Caesar III worthy of playing","review":"Truth be told, Caesar III is really the only good game in this collection.

The combat system is good, but it is hard to keep your houses from de-moting.It takes a week or so, but Caesar III is easily to pick up.Pharaoh is the same with the exemption of flood plains, roadblocks, and archers, chariots, and inpenterey instead of leagens, spearman, and mounted spearman; also you could build things like pyramids.Cleopatra is the same as Pharaoh, but there are zoos, some new industries and pyramids building speed-up.S.S.M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good story telling","review":"Another one of Mr. Skelton's excellent works about the thing he most of loved very much.

Yes, we all need God, and especially when faced with life's hardships, but her longing for her father isn't going to be satisfied with that knowledge alone. If a girl has never had a father in her life, it's certainly difficult for her to envision a heavenly Father in the same concept that I do because I was blessed with a wonderful earthly father.

I've finished the book.Schulz does contain a lot of information, and you can go along way with it. But it's not very pedagogical, and even with a teacher to explain things, I did not find it satisfying. Haywood & Nahmad, even tough it is much older, is easier to read and does explain the arabic language in a way Schulz does not. I have the feeling Schulz states facts to be memorized rather than explain the working of the language.I dare say I have a good understanding of grammar in general, but despite this some parts in Schulz where very hard to understand, even though the subjects weren't difficult.And the key to the exercises is ridiculously bad.I don't know the other books out there, but if you're going to use Schulz, I suggest you get an additional grammar-book. It'll make things much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"A headache of a book...","review":"\\"A noun cannot only be defined more closely by an attributive adjective, but also by a subsequent noun in the genitive. The relation of both nouns to each other is that of a governing noun (nomen regens) to an attributive adjunct(nomen rectum) in the function...\\"If that makes sense to you, and you can use instructions like that to construct sentences, this book will be very helpful to you. It is fairly comprehensive and moves quickly. However, for the rest of us, the dense grammar terminology and the otherwise bewildering presentation of concepts require too much time deciphering the authors' English- much less utilizing it for learning Arabic! Not recommended for teaching yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try, Try Again","review":"This author shows promise. Some of her scenes were well-written and the relationship between the two main characters was thoroughly explored. However, the conversations were absolutely wooden as written, the characters behaved in anachronistic fashion, and the title character's name is *consistently misused* which distracted and frustrated me so much that I couldn't enjoy what there was of the storyline. Whatever happened to copyeditors, anyway? Ms. Solomon, I beg of you, do a little fundamental research! As written, the hero's family name was Sinclair, but his title was something else entirely. Therefore, the title of this book should be, \\"Seducing Lord Something-Else-Entirely.\\" If you are looking for good traditional Regency romance, I recommend Emma Lange, Marion Chesney, or the always stellar Patricia Veryan, but I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, an enjoyable read from Hayley Ann Solomon","review":"Miss Marianne Spencer-Pultney is a lively heroine who rather enterprisingly dangles her legs out of a first story window preparatory to jumping. She has, of course, first thrown her bandbox out of that same window narrowly missing our hero... Alistair Raoul Griffin Sinclair is the heir to the nasty, miserly earl she is pledged to wed. Since his name is legally the same as the earl's, a cunning scheme is hatched.... This is a mischievous tale with definite villains and three couples who find love. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I didn't like this book much at all; it is divided into three on-going romances at the same time, which is fine in itself, however I found the secondary characters were much more interestng than the primary characters.The premise of the story was good, which is that Lord Sinclair marries his wife in order for her to avoid a miserable marriage to his skinflint, elderly cousin, which also saves Lord Sinclair's inheritance. In the meantime, Lord Sinclair's best friend and his sister are falling in love, and Lord Sinclair's mother is holding off on a second marriage, wanting first to see her children happily married. The parts of the book in which the Sinclair family thwart Marianne's family (the new Lady Sinclair) in their machinations ruin her were interesting and amusing.Other than that, I didn't see a lot of redeeming qualities in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for a Gibson guitar","review":"I bought this guitar brand new and I have to say i was quite impressed. I have been playing for a long time and have played many guitars (I now own 8...). The flying v played great when I got it. The factory setup was pretty darn good. It is quite easy to get a variety of tones from the 3way pickup selector and the one tone knob. I was particulary impressed by the tone from the neck humbucker when played clean. It has a definite rock sound to it, but if you cut back on the tone knob a litttle bit, it mellows out into a nice bluesy kind of tone that sounds great. The finish on the guitar was flawless (I am always looking at rough fret edges and poor finish jobs when I check out a guitar). For the money- you cant beat this for a real Gibson. You can't even buy a decent import guitar for the money. I am very happy- rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not just another review","review":"(its clear from reading some of the other reviews of this book, that the authors of those reviews either did a sloppy job of reading the book or know less than than they imply about option trading)any experienced option trader knows that ultimately you either exit a trade with a profit, OR with a loss BUT there are times when a trade is going against you and you can adjust the trade d-e-p-e-n-d-i-n-g on the conditions, salvage a potential loss and turn it aroundwhat makes this book different is that it actually has a section on adjusting trades. the chapters on rolling from one trade to another are where this topic is covered(its not labeled 'adjusting\\" but that's what it is). it is by no means an exhaustive \\"tome\\" on adjustments yet its not bad and FEW other books written about options cover this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I found this book lacked substance and will quickly fade into the dusty shelves of bookstores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This just does not work.

This stuff does not paint on smooth. It dries lumpy-smooth. It takes about 12 coats of paint to make it the right type of surface. Don't bother using painters tape to get nice edges. This stuff dries to thick and hard that your tape will pull off some of the paint which in turn will pull off the paper layer over the dryway. If I could, I'd force Rust-Oleum to come repair the wall that this paint utterly destroyed. Stay away. Far away.

We could not erase any of the colors completely after one application, and some of it hardly came off at all.

I could understand the directions, which were as clear as could be. I stirred the two parts then mixed them and applied as directed with a foam roller. This stuff has the consistency of skim milk. It drips, runs and sags like old school polyurethane. It needs to be stated that I have painted houses, and worked in a spraybooth environment for years, so it's not too hard for me to use. It has to be used up so, I bought plenty for the task and went to it. It really has been inconsistent, some whiteboards look great and some stink. I use the same technique every time, so product quality or age must be the variable. I wish I could recommend this product but really can't do so. As the old saying goes, your mileage may vary.

The paint I got looked decent and the paint results looked OK until three days later when I tried to use the dry erase marker on it. It is completely a failure. I tried all sorts of dry erase markers and none of them can be erased after dried for 10 seconds. I bought special cleaner to no avail.This is a cheaper imitation of the real stuff from ideapaint.com but unfortunately didn't work at all.

We sanded down the table top and primed its surface. I left it alone for several days before applying the Rustoleum whiteboard paint.

I let my kids doodle on the table and then we attempted to erase it.It didn't come off. A wet paper towel worked but not well. We tried cleaners too and they'd remove the markers for awhile but eventually they too quit working. Now I have this ugly cracked and yellowed table that we keep a table cloth over while we attempt to sand it down.

The age of the product or the type of primer used might have something to do with it. I used ordinary primer, followed the directions, and it works for me. The surface is not quite as smooth as I would like, but that's probably my fault. It does erase, although a paper towel works better than an actual dry eraser.

Adults will enjoy these books -- they're not kiddie novels -- but they have the same Heinleinian themes of competence and moral responsibility. My only caveat: this is two previously published books under one cover. (Prince of the North and Werenight). That's a good deal if you haven't read them, but be sure. I've been burned so many times by repackaged SF stuff that I feel such a warning is in order!"},{"rating":"2","title":"turtledove sword and sorcery","review":"not a bad story if a little too talky with the use of similar and even identical comments by the characters. character developement is not all that great either, it is hard to really care about what happens to them. other than that, if you are a turtledove fan you will probably like these stories just fine, if not, read his World War series or his How Few Remain series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent!","review":"This is a great book for all ages,it hummor is fine and makes the readersback to own childhood.Very recomendable!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rate this higher except for two important factors:","review":"1. First, the book is less than 130 pages, and none of it is in color.2. More important...all the comics inside this book (including the first ones about how Calvin met Hobbes) are included verbatum in the later, longer, more colorful book \\"The Essential Calvin and Hobbes (A Calvin & Hobbes Treasury)\\".

A spirited and hilarious collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!","review":"I love this book!When my friend got a Calvin and Hobbes book, I did'nt really like it because it was not in color. But once I got this book I loved it! I colored in the ilistrations so now I don't have ANY problems with this book! I want to collect all of the Calvin and Hobbes books, but right now I only have 4. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes funny books. They are so good my dad reads them! Other good Calvin and Hobbes books are Revenge of the Baby-Sat,Scientific Progress Goes Boink, and Attack of the Deranged Muntant Killer Monster Snow Goons. Well, I guess that's it. BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Bought this for my 8 yo who loves Calvin and Hobbes. He'll sit and read for an hour.

I'll read this book until the day I die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!","review":"All of the Calvin & Hobbes books are great. They give us a view into the mind of a slightly strange but endering six year old, his hungry and philospher like tiger, along with his parents, his next door neigbor Susie, and Moe the school bully along with anyone else they happen to come across. The drawings are very strange if you compare them to the latest ones but that doesn't make them any less funny. Calvin & Hobbes is and always will be one of my favorite strips and I am very sad that Bill Watterson has stopped creating them. Bill, if you're reading this, please let Calvin & Hobbes have more adventures. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST COMICS!!!!","review":"This is a comic that you can read over and over and over and over and over and over again.

I would love to read more of these!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! The best!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best Cal and Hobbes I've ever read. The comics are funny and fun as well. Calvin and Hobbes aren't always fighting like they do in YUKON HO!. That one is good, too. Calvin And Hobbes is a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calvin and Hobbes","review":"Calvin and Hobbes is the most idealistic comic ever published. It shows us a lonely, never-ending world within the eyes of a young boy and his sarcastic tiger. As we read through Calvin's life through printed text, we begin to notice the significance of our lives and how the world can affect who you are. Calvin shows us what childhood is actually like. He makes the comic it's unwanted humor to take place inside his discoveries about his life. Hobbes leads us in to the real adult perspectives about doing the right thing, while he Hobbes is only seen as a stuffed tiger by Calvin's parents, or in other words not conscious. The parents and the other few cfharacters oin the comic show the world in their way. They have their own personal love/hate relationships with Calvin and his long-lasting mind. So in short, Calvin and Hobbes shows us the significance of life, and how it can be through the eyes of a kid totally unaware of the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that started it all...","review":"When I was a teenager my family and I were on a summer vacation to Washington D.C. and were visiting a local area book store when I happened upon this book. I'd always liked comic collections (had a pretty good collection of Far Side & Bloom County books at home), so I started flipping through it. Soon I was laughing out loud and reading them to my Mom & Dad, and we bought the book. After that I was hooked, and waited anxiously for each new collection to hit the bookstore.This first collection is fun because you can definitely see how Calvin & Hobbes are a bit more raw & simply drawn, but the ideas and writing are uniformly excellent. A great start to the greatest comic strip to ever hit the funny papers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Comic","review":"Meet Calvin, a wild 6-year old boy who does hilarious things like pound nails into coffee tables and lock baby-sitters outside. His tiger Hobbes, who is conceited about being a tiger (although very kind and outgoing), thinks everyone should worship the ground he walks on, but is also a very funny guy who uses his smart yet sarcastic ways to get on your good side.This is a definite must-read with great comic strips. It is the first book of this strip that Bill Waterson published. It is really too bad that he retired because the newspapers wouldn't give him enough space.I'm grateful that Bill Waterson denied the rights to merchandise his characters. It would have ruined my image of Calvin.I now have the entire collection of Calvin and Hobbes comic books. They all have great situations for the characters to weasel out of. All of them are fabulous. Read them and you will see why I'm a Calvin and Hobbes lunatic!BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You should be made to read this book!!","review":"An excellent collection of the earliest Calvin and Hobbes strips, containing the first strip published, Uncle Max(a defunct character who appeared for only a few strips), and pads on Hobbes' forepaws.

He can't write a bad strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not deep blue showed in the picture. returned it, having not received refund after 40 days","review":"it's my first return, but it went bad.

A Pentium III 750 MHZ 256MB RAM 32 MB ATI RADEOM Graphic's PCI O/S Windows Me. I really enjoy Nascar 4 , it is loaded with options ,the instant replay is great. Watching your race from differant veiws , inside the car , spectator veiw, pit stop veiw etc. You can chose numerous racing tracks . Your pit stop talks to you and you can also have the text of what they are telling you displayed ! There is a garage for customizing your car !

When you replay your wrecks, you can put it in slow-motion and actually watch the metal on your car bend in. This is the real deal, folks. It's almost like you are watching an actually race on tv. If you spin out, you have to go back to the pits otherwise in about two laps or less your tire is gonna blow. Flipping is highly realistic in most cases, nothing like such games as NASCAR 2000 or NASCAR '99. When you go into the pits, your pit sign is bouncing up and down waiting for you and when you pull in, the crew actually runs out around the car. If you're to far over, you have to move your car otherwise you are not getting all four tires. I cannot describe to you how incredibly realistic this game is. It blows away any other racing game ever made. I highly encourage you to buy this game. If you love NASCAR or just all around racing, I'm sure you'll enjoy this challenging game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Monsters","review":"I was very happy to receive the book quickly, and it was exactly as I expected, very good quality book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great talc.","review":"This stuff smells and feels great.

They are very cheaply made and only last a short time, before #1 just stopped working and #2: cheap plastic switch broke off (it will not reattach back on to the unit) making it useless. Only 1 year warranty & they break shortly after that. I only used them once or twice a month, handled them very gently, never dropped them."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Junk...first it wouldnt go on after sitting awhile.

The Remington model trims nothing. After reaming your nostril for a couple minutes, you might be lucky enough for one or two hairs to get stuck in the blades, causing you to wince as you rip them out. You probably won't notice the pain though as you are trying to recover from the intense urge to sneeze from the trimmer's vibration, and the unpleasant machine-shop smell that sticks in your nose for hours.Oh wait, 1 star because it has good battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"After I tried my husband's trimmer, I was impressed and went to buy my own. The Remington was the only brand at the store. I figured how much difference could there be between this and my husband's Wahl?Well, the head is too short, the blade does not trim hair close, and the top comes off wayyy too easy. Plus you can't pull the pieces apart to clean it; you're supposed to \\"brush or blow hair from the cutting unit\\" or you can \\"hold the unit's head under the faucet\\". Seems pretty unsanitary to me. With the Wahl you can pull the plastic piece with the blades out and make sure it's actually clean and then dry it (a good thing if you agree the combo of moisture and nose/ear residue is an icky recipe for bacteria). I can't comment on the other head that's included since I didn't use it.Sorry, I don't know for sure the model # of the Wahl; but in looking on Amazon, it closely resembles the Wahl 5545-400 3 in 1 which is only a dollar more. I'd be willing to bet it's a dollar well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't turn on","review":"This nose hair trimmer worked fine for a few months, but now I put a fresh battery in and it will not even turn on.

I've had no problem with it trimming nose hair sufficiently, but it is a little difficult to cut those just inside the base of the nose without doing some simple contortionist feats. This is the only trimmer of this sort I've ever used. I only use it for trimming nose hair, so I can't compare it against other brands or rate it for any uses other than that purpose. I've never been nicked while using the trimmer and it works well with fresh or recharged batteries. It uses a single AA cell battery. The trimmer has a single switch that slides on/off with only one speed. It's easy to clean, just remove and rinse off the cutter head under hot running water and you're done.

The problem is that the shield is TOO far from the cutter, so I end up with neatly trimmed hair sticking out of my nose. I wore my old trimmer out and it was great...so I know there are better products out there. Trust me, the word \\"Titanium\\" does not mean this thing is good.

The sideburn trimmer on my very old electric razor does a MUCH better job, sad to say.

He seems to believe that science should operate like religion. They are not the same thing at all. Science is changeable and flexible.

Try others concerning Galileo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the reviews make it out to be","review":"So I recommended this book to the friends based on a review I had read of it. Now that I've actually read the book, I have to say that it was not very thought-provoking, only annoying.As a historical account of Galileo's trial before the Inquisition, as well as of his life and work, it was interesting. But Rowland puts entirely too much of his own spin on the events, and he attacks science by setting up a straw man in the character Berkowitz, thereby devaluing whatever legitimate points he might have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galileo's Mistake?","review":"In his book \\"Galileo's Mistake\\" Wade Rowland takes the reader on a philosophical adventure through the murky waters of faith and reason. Attempting to reconstruct the emotional and metaphysical setting of the trial of Galileo (and not just the legal/historical), Rowland reveals a tale not often told in the annals of science... Galileo, the ardent realist, was also a good Catholic.In addition to this admission, Rowland weaves in his own intellectual journey while researching Galileo's life and trial to arrive at some very anti-scientistic conclusions concerning the nature of reality. In all, this history of science tome is both enlightening and fun to read. It also challenges our modern view of science as salvation and forces even the most ardent of realists to consider the possibility of a reality beyond the reach of mathematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onward to the past","review":"I should wait till I have more time to do it properly but here it is: I found the book terribly argued. When he writes about subjects that I know about he's got his facts wrong. The writing is disingenuous and falsely profound, and in conclusion is a celebration of irrationalism in what to me is a frightening way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Series!!!","review":"I love this series so much!

Today I watched the last disc and I'm grieving knowing that there won't be a conclusion. What kind of cruelty is that? What kind of management at ABC Family is allowed to do that? It's not o.k.

Kyle XY is one of the best TV shows I ever had the pleasure of watching and I wish I could purchase a DVD with an ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This was truly a great season - what was dissapointing was finding out that this show was cut from production. They had so much more to offer in the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair","review":"This series had so much promise but, when the third season rolled around and they knew it was going to be canceled, they left the audience hanging. They had a place they could have cut it off but did not. The writers, producers, etc. were entirely unfair to their audience and deserve to be booed and boycotted, but alas, only the station it was broadcast on got the boycott in my home because there were too many people involved to avoid all shows involving said people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off.

So, i didnt find out about this till it was in the dvd player.And the so called never seen before features are exactly the same as my copy of season 2, (which is a US copy). Even the front cover is the same. Just a different colour. Boooooo. Now they've realized they were on a good thing with the show, now they will milk it for all its worth.Corporate Losers. Just an out-rage i tell you"},{"rating":"1","title":"KYLE XY","review":"i for one will wait for this to come down it isn't worth paying 25 dollars and tax and shipping handling for 10 eps. on it and because it leaves you hanging with no finishing to the show. the family is taken,kyle is told that the guy he was working for is his brother and there is to much unfinished business on this show to pay 25 dollars for them to rip us off like that. so if you intend to buy it wait till someone sells theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows ever!","review":"This is the incredibly amazing and ultimately last season of Kyle XY which is total bulls***. This is one of the best TV shows ABC Family has ever developed with one of the most believable and beautiful casts of all time. If you have any interest in adventure, mystery, action, suspense, or science-fiction, this show is for you! I typically don't even like science fiction yet Kyle XY had me HOOKED!

I was surpirised that the show turned out to be so intense, as I found it slow in the start. I am surprissed that they have not continued the series as it touches many issues that young people and families go through. It left you wanting more, but I guess thats how showbiz is. Reel them in and drop them hard......they should have at least closed the story out. All three seasons were great to watch, just remember you have no end. I own all three seasons and enjoy sharing them with my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down ! ! !","review":"The story began kind of slow, but if you stick with it,it makes up for the slow parts.

I found it very funny and surprisingly well written. Scott \\"Carrot Top\\" Thompson was totally charming as well as a pretty good actor in his part as the unique inventor - Edison.

So What The Fuss, the first track from his upcoming album A Time To Love, is very upbeat, and truly blends in the feel of urban Hip Hop and the strngth of Stevie's classic soul. It is just a great song to get up and dance to from a legend that has stood the test of time for so long.

I did think that the child actress playing the girl was good though, not only was she an adorable moppet who looked the picture of goodness but she handled very well the creepy moments when it was obvious that there was just something not right about her character.

There was one review on this shoe and I should have listened more carefully. Out of the five or six pairs of Clarks I own, this is the most uncomfortable of all. The instep is too low and cuts into the top of each foot. You will notice it has an elastic band on one side but that does not help. Also the leather is not flexible on the sides of the shoe, futhermore, cutting into the sides of my feet as well. To make things worse, the shoes are a half size bigger than my regular Clark size, 9 M. I decided to keep these though I don't know why. I have patched them with soft moleskin all over the place inside the shoe so they can at least be wearable. I will have to wear knee socks with them because as I stated above, they are at least a half size bigger than my size 9's.

Their sugar-pop sound, assembled on their well-oiled assembly line was detested by critics, but loved by music fans, who couldn't resist S-A-W's penchant for making catchy, albeit empty, songs. From Dead or Alive's \\"You Spin Me Round\\" to Kylie's \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" to Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", nobody made catchier pop than S-A-W. Those hits, plus many others are featured on this 3-disc set, which captures a memorable era (roughly 1985-1990) of pop music.

The authors do make some intriguing arguments to defend their sensible (if conservative) view of libraries of the future, though their style of writing makes them seem more reactionary than they actually are.

We are talking about the 1960's. At the height of the civil rights movement. Zeke's story reflects pretty much the norm for a Harlem dwelling African-american family of the time. Neglectful parents, no schooling (whether because of a disability or because the kids spent their time on the streets), unemployment, and a general lack of concern for others and their problems (the neighbors' \\"I have enough problems of my own\\" attitude, which reflects society, again, at the time). The story is excellent for exposing all these issues and still managing to come back from the dark and making it all as if it were a bad dream, except for the jazz music that permeated that time as well. Also, the illustrations deserve a praise of its own. Beautifully written, beautifully illustrated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak for a Newbery","review":"First of all, the boy's disability was hardly worth mentioning. I have known three people (one of them my father) who had one leg shorter than the other since childhood and walked with distinct limps.

It seems highly unlikely that this boy would have been permitted to stay out of school.Second, the descriptions of the music didn't make me feel anything; they were just words. I've read writing that sounded like music, but this wasn't it.Third, there was no explanation for the parents' behavior, why they left, or why they returned. In real life, the boy would likely blame himself for their leaving.It has occurred to me that the last page and a half may be meant to take place in heaven after the boy has died of starvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens Error - on a 2 month old camera ---already had to be returned.","review":"I have a 2 month old Nikon, and it keeps saying Lens Error on the screen.

Finally, he tackles the long-twarted love of two well-known characters but he seems unable or unwilling to treat this narrative with the attention it deserves. Instead, he constructs a convoluted \\"good v. evil,\\" \\"humanity hangs in the balance\\" battle out of nothing -- a great deal of noise and nonsense to add drama to what should already be drama enough.

If \\"...Godot\\" is not the best play ever written, then it is certainly one of the top ten. A recently viewed video production (from Netflix) showed that the play can be produced to yield a range between its comic and tragic tendencies, when compared to the Roundabout version. This is not surprising, but it created a need to read the text, which is a translation from the original French. For me, the Roundabout production was the most illuminating, but the text of the play yielded insights that can come only from seeing words arranged on a page.

The perfect inability on the part of people who should know better to say the \\"Emperor has no clothes\\" is the only tragicomedy associated with this tiresome nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest \\"classic\\" in 20th century literature","review":"I first read this work as part of my Humanities class in high school. I reread again after college to see if several years of \\"higher education\\" would make my mind more receptive so great works of literature. Both times, I thoroughly hated this play and consider one of the dumbest pieces of literature commonly taught in schools. The plot is overly simple; two hobos (probably European) await someone (probably male) named Godot. Several others pass them by during their wait. Godot never comes, and the play ends right where it began. No introduction and no conclusion. However, there are supposed to be many meanings that can be had in this story. A common one is that Godot is God, and the hobos represent humans. This reviewer's opinion is that the plot is so simple, that one could draw whatever conclusions or meanings they wanted out of it. All in all, I did not gain anything from this work. Fortunately, it is short enough to get through quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Meaningless Existence of Humanity","review":"Some may argue that Waiting for Godot is about the hopes and dreams of the human race. I beg to differ. It is readily apparent that Beckett mocks our society. The characters of Estragon and Vladmir are content to do nothing at all; except to wait for Godot. Man is known for keeness of mind and action. It seems that Beckett is creating a civilization in which the humans subsist on a vague idea; they can not think or do for themselves. This is an absurb view of humanity. It is innate that man wishes to live his life to the fullest. Beckett's view is in direct contrast to this. He descries that men are clowns, and that their behavior is innane. I have yet to read a literary work with a darker, more hopeless and tragic view than the one created by Samuel Beckett in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to be frustrated...","review":"Waiting For Godot is a classic. I know it's really shaped how modern plays. But wow... this play is frustrating. It has it's moments, but for a majority the play you just want to bang Didi and Gogo's heads against one another. When I was reading this I couldn't help but wonder what people saw in it. I really had to struggle to get through it. If I hadn't been required to read it for my drama class, I would have tossed it out my 3rd-floor apartment window. Do read it if like me, you're interested in writing plays. But if you're just reading it because a friend was raving how good it was, give it a miss. They're probably just \\"being\\" pretentious drama majors who couldn't tell art from a scribble done by a two-year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashed books are not fun to read.

If you are looking for a book with any plot or deeper meaning, look elsewhere. If you choose to read this, a word of warning: though it is a short book, it is the opposite of a page-turner. You can barely finish a page before you have to put the book down and think about something else. Also, it will most likely depress you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdity","review":"I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence. This work, however, is pure tripe. Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas. The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play. In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense. Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the \\"extremely difficult themes\\" and \\"brilliant artistry\\" of the play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good play","review":"Waiting for Godot was not a good play at all. I read it for school, but would never read this sort of play. It was about two guys and their relationship over the years and the people they meet along the way. They always have to be doing something to occupy their time. If they don't find anything to do they alway end up saying they want to kill themselves. It was the worst play I ever read. I will not give away the ending but it was about nothing! Don't bother reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of Existentialist Literature","review":"An existentialist tragicomedy in two acts. I loved this play-- definitely the epitome of a tragicomedy. I laughed out loud at many of the lines from Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, as well as Pozzo, a man that happens by as they wait for Godot. The deeper themes of the play got me thinking too.Who is Godot and why are these two men waiting for him? Good question. It's not important though-- not as important as their waiting to be saved by Godot at least. The way the characters passed away the time of their waiting made the pages fly by for me-- it seemed I had scarcely started when I was at the end!Highly recommended. Waiting for Godot is a great, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it! Live it! Love it!","review":"Existentialist playwright, Samuel Beckett, has a true knack for relevance. Captivating one of the most basic questions that has plagued man since the beginning of time, Beckett's tragicomedy, Waiting for Godot, epitomizes the reality which defines our existence. The simplistic play presents themes provoking deep insight. Does God exist? What are we doing here? What does it mean to be human? Comprised of two acts that essentially contain nothing, Beckett's minimalist drama has ironically been acclaimed as one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.I personally recommend this as a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"stuff","review":"trying to read through those other reviews was giving me a headache, and this is coming from a person who reads at least 3 books a week. so i'll make this short... to those that think this play is simply a picture of the nihilism and absurdity of life... you're missing the point. beckett draws a picture of the human condition that not only displays our most base and vilely normal and seemingly pointless actions but suffuses them with a hope and deep love for humans... a wonderful play, a journey of beauty and silence and pain.oh, and to that one person who wrote about how this was stupid and pointless... damn, how lonely do you have to be to get to that point of cynicism where you can't even recognize humanity and the beautiful when it's at your door?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes.

All I can say is the Theater of the Absurd is well named. It a boring, trite play. Doesn't represent any aspect of Humanity I am aware of unless sheer Boredom is one of our principal traits.I suppose all the raving critics (and others) who think THIS is the PLAY of all time have some reasons for their belief. Unfortunately, I think that they, as those who LOVE J.J.s' Ulysses, are merely esthete beings who rave at anything they cannot fathom. I would challenge any critic to sit in front of me and give me a word by word understanding of the play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting For Boredom(Godot)","review":"To be frankly honest I have now read this book 4 times, I don't know exactly why I did so but I did and I am still confused. If you feel that you should get the book that a lot of critics call \\"the most important play of the 20th century\\" then while you're at it pick up a coles notes style book for it. But don't pay much for the interpretation book since the one I bought summed up the entire play in one paragraph that took up half a page.

Often times, I'd have to go to a computer at work to extract files off a CD, then load them onto a flash drive and use the flash drive to download files onto my computer, thanks to the Targus' failure to read CD's.

I agree that it is the woman's highest calling to serve her husband, but I also believe that the Lord calls us to many other things (this is not mentioned).

This is often called the Larry Goldings Trio, and could just as well be called The Bill Stewart Trio. Each player is outstanding and has a uniquely identifiable voice on his instrument. These guys often remind me of Wes Montgomery's or Bill Evans' Trios, or Jack McDuff's/Jimmy Smith's groups. The tunes and arrangements are superb, the audio is fine. I don't believe there's any lack of bass in the organ. The stage and lighting at Smoke are very plain, so don't expect fancy visuals. Just be thankful there are still some places like this club where such master jazz musicians can play. If you like any of the classic organ-guitar jazz groups I think you'll love this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor Drummers...","review":"It's fun to watch Bill Stewart's approach and to have it on DVD, but the kick drum mic must have been turned off. Perhaps Peter Bernstein stepped on the wire, and the sound engineer failed to notice. You can't hear the brother's kick AT ALL, except for when he solos, and even then faintly.And I played this through a surround sound system with a sub woofer, and tried to \\"mix\\" with the sub/center/surround countrols. Cranking the sub woofer just gave more organ bass, and Stewart's kick, although tuned high, is below 1k hertz or so that would be considered mid range, so there was no way to affect that either.-SeanSeattle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoppers beware: this is NOT FOR LAPTOPS","review":"On May 22, 2005 I wrote:UPDATE: After contacting Simpletech they updated Amazon's descriptions of some of their memory items.

It is a true story that occurres in 1900. I liked the research of the authors. It took you back and realized the loneliness of the pioneer women and the conditions under what they had to do on a day to day basis, of having a family, helpmate to their husbands,gardening, milking cows, cooking, laundry, most of all the total parenting seemed to be their responsibilities.

So far, I don't regret the purchase. It's well-designed for home use--the small footprint, closable paper trays (keeps the office looking less cluttered when the printer's not being used), decent print speed and crisp print quality are impressive.

No response from Minolta.The printer driver under Win 2000 is slow to start. There is a definate hesitation before the print out (not like my Xerox) and the system literally freezes for a couple of seconds.Update: The driver can literally freeze and fail...it often suggests that the 'cover is open' when it is not. You must turn off the printer and restart it.There are better inexpensive laser printers, such as the Samsung. This unit is an example of good hardware made bad by terrible drivers and support. And no, I never did receive my rebate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivers for Win 2000 don't work!","review":"I've tried to use the printer with a win 2000 system.

At least, they still rply you....... If you want to keep using Windows 9x, well, it is a good buy. Otherwise, you will get a lot of troubles on it....This is good product in such a price.

One of the technicians there told me that these machines are known for the problem they have in not being able to communicate via the parallel port. He recommended that I return it, as there are a percentage of these machines that are DEFECTIVE. I would not recommend this printer to anybody, as the saying goes, \\"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!\\" If I would have spent an extra $100.00 for a Brother model 1240, I would have been much better off, and would have saved a lot of grief!

One installed and works fine, but I couldn't get the installation software to run at all on the other machine (a relatively new Dell). Apparently there is a problem with the GDI Interface and if you have other printer drivers installed, the software is very picky about the order these drivers are loaded. The Minolta tech support people said that deleting my other printer drivers and reloading them after I install the Minolta driver might work, but they would investigate the problem and call me back. Ten days later- they haven't. Tells you something about their customer support I guess. Rather than delete and reinstall four other printers (which may not have solved the problem), I chose to send this one back.My advice is that this printer is just not worth the trouble, unless you are using it as you only, stand alone printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer might be good but....","review":"The printer might be good but I will never know. I tried to install the driver on my laptop, the same laptop on which I have installed tens of other software titles and other printer drivers without a single problem. The Minolta driver installation program stalled out and left no way to un-install. I tried to re-install but that led to a spiral of ugly messages from the install program saying \\"I can't uninstall the previous installation\\". Phone support from Minolta gets a C- because the first person I talked to actually knew nothing or just enough to be really dangerous. The second person was knowledgeable, tried hard, and was willing to think beyond the check list and he is the only reason that this product did not get a negative 5 star rating. In the end though even this valient fellow had to give me the old \\"reload windows\\" fix. I sent the printer back. I don't have time to reload windows and really screw things up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Single User Excellent results","review":"I've been using this printer for about 16 months. I got it because it was a great price for a laser and I print lots of documents for graduate school. I had no problem with the installation (I'm running Windows ME) and the printer has been nearly flawless in its function (maybe jammed 3 times in 16 months). I don't use it on a network, virtually never print graphics or pics of any kinds. I read a comment about the power going out, but for a period of 6 months, I actually had to keep the printer unplugged all the time unless printing. I would then simply plug it into my computer, and into the power supply, and it worked fine, no need to re-install anything.I think for a small office this is a good value any way you slice it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Laser","review":"Had medium to low expectations of this printer because of the price, but gave it a shot anyway. WOW! Ubelievable quality and speed for such a small price and a small footprint to boot! FYI I Don't know what problems the other user was having, but I couldn't print at all with one old cable I had around here at first, but once I plugged in a different cable all was up and running fine.Only slight negative is noticeable banding on photos but this may differ from one unit to the next - plus depending on what you use it for this could be overlooked, again because this printer is SO INEXPENSIVE! Also, text and line work is super, super sharp. The speed and convenience is so far superior to inkjet it isn't even funny (plus no smearing!), and at this price you can afford to have it for all your B&W work, and have a decent ink jet with its messy, pricey inks and special papers for when you want/need to do color."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy if running Windows 2000 or XP","review":"This is a good, cheap printer for Windows 95/98/ME users but Windows 2000 and XP users need to use a beta Win2K driver (v0.22) that is not very reliable.

It seems to be more of a 7 1/2\\". Granted, it still does what it needs and covers what it needs but not too much. I was hoping for a beanie like the one I was issued in the Marines.

But if you're like every other average individual, this watch cap is so big it's pointless to even wear. The Rothco brand fleece cap misinterprets the idea of \\"one size fits all\\" by making the biggest size possible.

I bought at another site for $76 w/shipping. Speakers look good and beefy for their size, but you are not buying these for looks. I read one or two complaints about one speaker not playing as loud as the other...that is exactly what i got brand new out of the box...if you unhook the good speaker and turn up the volume(volume control speaker is the bad one) all the way on the bad speaker it is no louder than someone talking at a normal decibel and it crackles..basically a bad speaker...I tried to call customer support one night, was on hold for 45min and gave up, tried again tonight-busy signal...i tried online request for help..still waiting 30hrs after complaint...so i am bashing these speakers not only on out of the box quality(did i mention made in china, like everything else we buy) but complete lack of customer support. The speaker that works does sound good and do like speaker stands it comes with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor quality product","review":"I bought these because they are supposedly professional grade monitors with excellent sound. The sound was excellent, but the speakers must be cheaply made with bad components.The first problem I had was with the aux line out. If I plugged something in there and then unplugged it to use the speakers again, only the right speaker would work. After fidgeting with the cords and multiple combinations of plugging in and unplugging both speakers would finally work again.The second problem was with the left speaker. After only 8 months of use, it started going in and out and within a week it stopped working altogether. Maybe it's just an isolated incident, but if you do decide to buy, make sure you hang on to that receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, til the right speaker suddenly stops working","review":"Bought this, set it up at my workstation, and never moved them around even once. Used them several times a week, not quite everyday. After about 6 months, the right side wasn't working at all.I looked for help online, and I came to realize this was some kind of known fault with the product. It happens to a lot of sets, and a lot of people. You'll even find plenty of reviews stating the same thing. I was out of warranty, so I had to eat the cost of a new one. I honestly think if you see positive reviews on here, their set hasn't broken yet, it's a ticking time bomg.Now I bought the m-audio av-40's here from Amazon, for about $130. They sound so much better. They're bulkier, but richer, deeper sound. Skip these and go straight for the av-40's. Don't even consider the av-30's, what's a few more bucks? You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, poorly-built, lackluster sound.","review":"After using these speakers for two years, I can confidently say they suck.The low price and purported high-quality sound sold me, but in the end I am disappointed. At home I have two KRK RP5 speakers, and it is a night and day difference in sound quality.Cons:- The right speaker is noticeably quieter than left speaker, especially at low volumes.- They really, seriously lack bass.- They are not well-built - the right speaker often cuts out as the circuitry gets confused, thinking I have headphones plugged in. I have to repeatedly thrust and jiggle my headphone plug into the jack to unconfuse it.Pros:- They come with awesome little plastic wedges that you can use to angle the speakers up to point at your head, if they rest on your desk.I would recommend buying any powered computer speakers with subwoofer instead of these. They are really not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Good","review":"It sounds good to my ear and I don't have any balance issue either. The speakers also come with an optional stand such that they will tilt upwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound great","review":"These speakers sound great and are worth every penny. As a few people noted, the bass is what you would expect from speakers this size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the box","review":"M-Audio is a decent audio company, however, in my case the speakers simply would not power up when plugged in. I can only assume a bad transformer, which happens sometimes - so I'm not saying bad speakers or bad company, just bad luck. I have heard from audio professionals though that these speakers won't cut it as real studio monitors as they just won't give you real reference bass tones, but for $100 what do you expect? I have also heard that they are going to be much better than any other desktop computer speakers assuming they work when you get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Dont buy these speakers","review":"These are junk. I went through the M-audio forum to find many owners with the exact same problem. Seems like this might be a problem with the AV30's also. All of a sudden the right channel just went out. If you are lucky enough to wiggle the connection to work then you're lucky, otherwise you are stuck listening to music in mono. I thought I would try these since the price was reasonable. Well, I got what I paid for - junk. Never again. Just stick to the good stuff that works and pay a little more. In the end it's less since you dont have to get rid of the junk that doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I've had these for 2 years now and take it from me, stay away! I'm done jiggling the rear connectors to get the right speaker working. While the sound is pretty good for the price range when they work, \\"when they work\\" has turned out to be the operative phrase. The right speaker continually cuts out. I suspect it has something to do with shoddy construction and design -- the right speaker connects with the left via an 1/8 in. mini cable -- unheard of with most normally designed speakers, except maybe cheaper computer speakers. There are only RCA Left/Right main inputs on the back -- no TRS or XLR -- although the 1/8 in. phones and AUX IN connectors on the front are convenient for say, an iPod. They look kind of cheesy with the 1970s-style silver metal frames around the speakers, too. There are better speakers on the market, you just may have to pay a few more bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right speaker died after a year","review":"I origionally gave these speakers high marks for quality of sound. But apparently the quality stops there. After a little over a year using these as computer monitors. The right side stopped working. I tried a different cable and even hooked them up to a different source and still no right side output. Since I am three months out of warranty I guess I am screwed. I also Googled this problem and it does appear that some others have had similar problems. Sorry now that I bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.

The original French text was written in the 20's. I was given this book as I am working on a masterwork on the cultural history of Olives and Olive oil. In this respect she often jumps to the wrong conculsion, and makes broad judgements that have been discounted by anthropology since the 1960's. For instance she lists oil stores in ancient Babylonia as being olive oil. We know from further scholership that this would have been sesame oil, and that olive oil was a fuel and not a consumptive in that culture at the time. This causes me to question the entire book. This may be an interesting read, but at least with respect to Olives and Olive oil, there is much better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor evidence of sources","review":"Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of \\"local legends\\" or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but completely unreliable","review":"This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable, very out of date (1920s!), and often just plain wrong.As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless. Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text. No doubt some part of the assertions here is true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!What's more, the translation is poor. Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretzels by the Dozen by Angela Elwell Hunt","review":"This book is advertised as a counting book.

The book is well written and enjoyable to read. However if you are really trying to learn our very early history this book will not satisfy your thirst. On topics such as The Battle of Saratoga, The Battle of New Orleans, Prince Philips War etc. that I had already read about, I realized how lightly each topic was covered and how much really interesting history is being missed.

It provided a satisfying, solid entertainment over 3 days and restored my faith that King can deliver the goods. It reminded me in many ways of my favorite Robert B.

I was disappointed in the actual product. The packaging was so old it was stained yellow and had other kinds of age spots or signs of long wear. It was dusty as well and seemed to be something bought by an individual who changed their mind and then decided to sell it back. The battery was not working anymore so we had to purchase a new one for it. The picture shows two watches as u can see but only one came in the package. It was manufactured from 2006 so I know it is an old item almost forgotten by its previous owner. Even my niece seems to not be interested in it as she showed no enthusiasm for it and hardly wants to wear it. I think some indication should have been made on the description of the item that it was very old. I will not buy from 'Happy Bday' ever again!!!

I really wanted the book for one of the poems in the book. I couldn't find the poem on the Internet since it's not titled in the book. It is a poem that the bat makes up about the owl.

They talk about every sexual thing you could ever think of, everything and after everyone is having sex, sneaking girls in their room, etc. at the end they say don't have sex...ugh but you just spent an hour showing them sex. And every single character loves sex and talks about it all the time and then at the end you say, \\"Don't do it\\", its too late. I wouldn't be surprised if this show doesn't cause the teen rate of pregnancy to increase...after all the main character thinks she's grown after having a child.

The lack of pace is a killer! This is an excellent 400 page book hidden in almost 600 pages. This is a must have SF novel if you like the depth of development, but it isn't for you if you prefer more motion in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good first novel","review":"If you like science fiction about genetically modified people, AIs with personality, lots of fighting -- then this is a pretty good action-packed book. What, I think, makes it actually worthwhile, however, is that the main character, Catherine, is well drawn. Unfortunately, some of the other characters are rather cardboardish. As I understand it, this is the first book in a series, so maybe we'll learn more about motivations in the future books. But certainly, this is worth a nice afternoon of reading. I look forward to reading more of the author's books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche and derivative . . .","review":"Moriarity does an admirable job of world-building but his characterizations tend to be two-dimensional and predictable. The personalities and dialogue will be familiar with anyone who has watched 70's era cop show. All that's missing is the cheap jazz background. The villains don't twirl black capes and laugh maniacally and neither do the power brokers stroll around in smoking jackets and ascots but the characters come too darn close to that for my tastes. Pass this novel up unless you consider eye rolling a sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I have to say that Moriarty's debut was a fantastic read. Not for the SF amateur. This book combines elements of military SF and cyberpunk beautifully and just throws you in. It expects you to swim, and even though I stumbled in the first few pages, I found my footing and the book read at a good, solid pace, though not a pace you want to speed through. It's a complex and detailed plot that focuses on Catherine Li, a genetic construct who snuck her way into the military and, thanks to FTL jumps, forgets more than she remembers. But she does remember the name of her homeworld, and dreads going back there when she's assigned to investigate the murder of a famous physicist who also happens to be Li's genetic twin. There's a little bit of everything in this book, battle scenes, Emergent AIs, and a touch of romance (same-sex romance, in some cases). Definitely worth the read for any SF fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Spin State starts off great but then suffers from two major problems. Before I get to the problems, I want to say that the pros are great. The author has a nice writing style and was fun to read on that basis alone.But there were problems. First, there are too many characters and frequently a minor character will appear and the reader is like \\"who is Ramerez again?\\".Secondly, the tech in the story is not explained well. I honestly have to wonder if the book was edited in terms of content and and in terms of understandability. Towards the end a \\"World Mind\\" emerges which was not justified via the story or explained in terms of how it would emerge. I have to say that this almost made me laugh towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start, slow middle, disappointing ending","review":"This book is more about mining than about science fiction. The story line could have easily taken place during this time than in the future. The story also takes a very long time to develop and readers will have to struggle to continue reading this book to the end. Furthermore, the characters are very poorly developed, and fictional concepts in the book are poorly explained.In conclusion, this book is more of a novel than a science fiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Fiction At Its Worst!","review":"Spin State could've been so much more. This novel had the opportunity to be one of the best I've ever read.Mr. Moriarty saddles himself up beside other authors who chose to incorporate their own language (nouns, verbs, etc) into their work. Much like Tolkien and A/V's Clockwork Orange.The problem is that Chris doesn't explain any of it. For every word that he makes up, it pushs the reader that much further into confusion, and ultimately, oblivion. I was so confused by the end of this novel that I wasn't certain exactly what happened. Sure, the novel takes place in the future, and new technologies will develop... but the reader is still here in the 21st century. If you're going to conjure several dozen futuristic words out of thin air, at least explain them to the reader!!!The book is so vague and gray without these definitions that it seriously hinders the reader. I almost didn't finish the story.VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic First Novel","review":"C J Cherryh's Union-Alliance novels were clearly a big influence on Ms Moriarty. Add a touch of Heinlein, a touch of Vinge, a dollop of MacLeod and a goodly helping of Richard Morgan style noir, and you've got the flavor of this first outing in a future history where the economy is based on quantum entanglement and the rare material that makes it possible.Catherine Li is caught in the middle. More than a few middles as it turns out. There might be no one she can trust. And all she has to do is defang a crisis that threatens a civilization-wide war (or worse) if she fails and the mere genocide of her homeworld (and an incidental xenocide) if she \\"succeeds.\\" Luckily she hates her homeworld. Then there's this AI who's stalking her (and that's an ally). And the murder of her twin, only nobody's supposed to know it's her twin, but nearly everyone seems to. And then it gets complicated.Great fun, and there's a sequel coming out late 2005 called \\"Spin Control\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up half-way through","review":"Maybe I'm getting too old, but I just gave up. I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and the technologies/realities were too vague and confusing to keep straight.

A kickass heroine, a mystery to be solved, fascinating speculation on quantum physics and the evolution of Artificial Intelligences. And did I mention the love story?It's hard to sum up this book because there's so much to enjoy. Major Catherine Li is a fascinating character- a woman who has hidden her past even from herself. For years she's managed to hold things together, but when she returns to her homeworld everything starts falling apart, and she no longer knows who to trust. Suddenly it's not enough to solve the murder mystery-- she has to find a way to get herself out alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"This is good old fashioned science fiction, by which I mean it introduces new ideas and causes the reader to think.

Apparently they didn't get the memo that said that songs should RHYME. Perhaps as they mature as a band, and as people, they will make a good album; but this wasn't it. The guitar and other instrumental parts are fine for a new band, but just as you think that maybe this could be a good song, they spout some terrible lyrics with no rythm.

The story is told from the point of view of Dracula himself, and begins at the same point as the Stoker novel. But, with the arrival of Harker at Castle Dracula, the story takes a very different turn. Saberhagen portays Dracula as a great warrior prince, caught in a life that he did'nt chose. Without apology, Dracula tells us of his true love for the women in the novel and how he only made one of them (Lucy) into a vampire to keep her alive in some form, as her death was caused by VanHelsen's instance on using an untested medical procedure, blood transfusion. This is a great indication of Saberhagen's love for the person of Dracula. I would suggest this book to anyone who thinks they know the legend inside-out. Also, try \\"The Holmes-Dracula File\\" from the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Lives!!!!","review":"This book is fantastic.

It does help to have read the tedious Bram Stoker original. As at least one of the other reviewers has pointed out: there are a lot of in-jokes. My favorite one is where poor, misunderstood Dracula tells his side of the flinch away with a look of horror on his face when Van Helsing shoves a consecrated Host in his face: It turns out Dracula is a good Catholic and he was horrified by Van Helsing's desecration of the Host. Saberhagen's explanation seemed to make more sense too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from \\"novel of the century\\"","review":"I was curious to see Dracula's perspective, but this probably would be better suited for an audiobook (Fred, tell amazon.com it's ok to give you my email address so you can financially thank me for this suggestion).First of all, especially at the ending, keep in mind this book was printed in 1975.The rude comments about Van Helsing (such as: \\"Van Helsing's answer was yes. I paraphrase omitting some five hundred words.\\" and \\"The vision of Van Helsing as a vampire is one before which my imagination balks; this is doubtless only a shortcoming on my part; he may have been well fitted for the role, since as we have seen he had already the power, by means of speech, to cast his victims into a stupor.\\") are sometimes dead-on funny and othertimes tiresome.For the price, a worthwhile read. However, the time could be much better spent re-reading the original Dracula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Films Speak Again","review":"If you like silent film history then you have to have this book.

The title cut is also interesting, a 26 bar tune, \\"You Must Believe In Spring\\", modulates up a 1/2 step on the 14th bar. This sounds like it could be an Evans piece but is one of Michele Legrand's finest. Sometime Ago is my personal favorite...his lead in to the solo transports us to Paradise! This is one of Bill's best albums - people who know anything about jazz will love it...so will those who do...the mark of a true master."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 years later, Evans is still cutting edge","review":"Bill Evans has always excelled at using the widest range of dynamics. The jazz piano had typically been a quiet instrument to be played as loudly as possible until Evans came around.

These boots are not durable enough, there has to be something better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad toe box design","review":"I have owned and loved Timberlands since 1994. My last pair was the White Ledge. These appeared to be basically the same boot but with Gore Tex. I loved the white ledges so much that I thought these would be a great upgrade with the Gore Tex lining. Since the outsole is the same and similar lacing. However, there is one design difference and it is a bad one. The the leather of the toe box and the leather strips that the lacing bolts run through, they meet and overlap at the top of the toe box. Since they overlap, it is not as flexible as the surrounding leather, and when you step forward, the extra firm leather digs straight down crushing my toes. I am hoping after more hikes and unfortunately more suffering, they may break in. This is unfortunate and downgrades an otherwise exceptional boot. I wish I would have stayed with the white ledge instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few months old and stitching is already coming apart","review":"I purchased a few months ago (but I don't wear them in the summer) so they have seen some winter weather.

It's very comfortable and weather proof as well. Less than a month I made the purchase, I wore them to climb Mount Kilimanjaro as well as on an extensive Safari trip in central Africa (Actually that's what I bought them for), it keeps my feet dry and warm in low temperature conditions on the 5000 meters mountain slope. It equally breaths well in the 80 degree African tropical dry lands. and won't smother my feet.I'm glad to make the purchase, now I'm wearing them regularly, both for outdoor hiking and during rainning weather.One thing to keep in mind, If you buy them for hiking purposes, You should always try the boots out in the afternoon and with your hiking socks on, since hiking socks are usually pretty thick than reqular cotton ones, and in the afternoon your feet is larger than in the morning. I wish i bought mine a half size larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best boots ever!!!","review":"Just bought my second pair had the first pair for 2 years.

They will keep you feet dry going across a stream, but a half mile through long wet grass will leave you with wet feet.I don't know if this is just me, but they hurt my feet. Given the nature of the construction with a molded EVA last and sole this is a function of the shape as they will never break in. I find that after 3 or 4 miles I just want them OFF! I have tried the factory insole and 2 kinds of orthotics based upon casts of my feet. They hurt no matter what.I read the reviews and everyone said ordering the normal US size was okay.

Huge design flaw","review":"I love these boots, I really wish they were designed better. The first time I put on the boots they felt broken in, I wore them all day, and did not take any time to break in. However I don't wear these boots that often. Usually just for rainy days, and in Southern California, that is not very often. After I would say 5-10 days of wearing the boots, the inside fabric on the boot by my arch has started to fray. And not on just one side, but both sides. So it is not an instance where maybe I caught one boot on a nail. The other thing is the eyelets on the boots are starting to fray the laces. I'm not pulling a MacGuyver and using these laces to shimmy down a zip line either, I am lacing up my boots and It is only a matter of time before the laces snap.I will probably send back to Timberland to swap them out, from reading some other reviews it does not sound like an isolated incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Quality","review":"I purchased my first pair of these shoes several years ago.

Shoe laces fell apart on the second wearing and one of the lace hooks started coming off; one of the two rivets pulled out of the upper leather.Timberland's website claims these shoes are manufactured in New England, when in fact they are cheaply made, as evidenced by the quality, in China.Returned shoes and ordered Hi-Tec hiking boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality shoes","review":"Hi, I bought you a pair of shoes Timberland Men's Chocorua Gore-Tex Hiker.

I don't know if the pair that I got is defective or if they're all like that but the sock liner was not glued to the roof of the boot in the toes. It hung loose in both boots and was very uncomfortable. And I think greatly contributed to the boots being very hot.

I've always found that buying hiking boots was a risky proposition. You never know how you're going to like them until after you've put some miles on a pair. These boots have met all my hopes and expectations. The only thing that I'm not thrilled about is the last two sets of eyelets at the top of the boot. They are open hooks as opposed to closed loops or eyelets. I find that the lace keeps popping out of the hook when I'm trying to tie it. It's probably just my personal quirk and I suspect most hiking boots have these open hooks. There must be some perceived advantage to these, but I would have preferred something closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed -stitches broke quickly","review":"My husband took them on a trip abroad and after wearing the shoes for one day, the stitches broke.

They fit great , are light weight, and tractible .Gore-Tex is truly waterproof; waterproofed leathers aren't. The problem I've had with walking three or so miles a day is the fabric insert .Although these are stitched well , the fabric is cut short and not folded over and hemmed when sewn into the leather , so after several weeks the fabric becomes internally frayed and pulls out of the leather through the stitching on both pairs ; so I know it wasn't just a fault with the first pair .That's too bad , because I really like the fit and comfort.There is a similar shoe with leather sides and no fabric -but they aren't Gore-Tex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Issue","review":"On the plus side, these boots have been very comfortable right out of the box. The break in time was almost zero. Unfortunately there are quality issues with my pair. The seam along the webbing on the side of the shoe came loose after relatively short use. A minor problem has been the laces. The outer sheath broke very quickly after I started wearing the shoes. A nice shoe with some quality issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Initially, I was very happy with these, as I have been with Timberland in the past.However, within a few months, 3 or so, the stitching between the canvas and leather (or faux-leather) came apart on both boots. This is unacceptable in a boot from a brand like Timberland for the price. I expect better quality, and will not likely be buying Timberland again anytime soon. I can get better quality cheaper.On the upside, the boots are comfortable...until it rains or snows. Wet feet are NOT comfortable at all, and once the stitching splits, they are no longer waterproof. Haven't had any issues with traction, but as I got them in the spring and they had begun to fall apart by the summer, I have limited experience with them on snow or ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable.","review":"I bought these for hiking boots. Wanted something to support my ankles, provide traction and be waterproof. I saw the great reviews and cheap price and thought I had nothing to lose. I have foot issues with plantar and arthritis. I wear orthotics in most of my shoes so picky about what I wear. These boots felt great from the minute I put them on. I did put some inserts in for support. They fit great.

They secure well and give good all around support. I also have slightly flat feet, and these have given great support to my arches. I haven't had to put an insert in this shoe so far and I've hiked miles and miles with them.

After reading \\"The Firm\\" and \\"A Time to Kill\\" I have come to the conclusion the Grisham is one of the worst writers ever to top the bestseller list. \\"The Firm\\" starts out plausibly, but then goes totally haywire at about the two-thirds mark with an ending as believable as your average romance novel. If Grisham was as good an attorney as he is a writer, there'd be a lot more people on death row."},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief","review":"It takes a lot of guts (or possibly a brain problem) to write a book this bad.

Science fiction romantic comedies are never done for the simple reason they don't work. Give Grisham credit, he tries something off the beaten path here but it all goes horribly wrong after a few chapters. without revealing the plodding plot, nothing is going on here !! Two people sitting in a small closet talking quietly to each other may make for riviting German arthouse film, but in book form all it induces is a zombie like state. Even the mandatory surprise twist at the end fails to awaken the slumbering reader. Not recommended by this particular reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott Brick does a good job reading this thriller","review":"The FirmStory: 4 out of 5 starsAbridged: NoQuality of narration: 4 starsReader's range of character voices: 2 starsPros: I have read the book and listened to the audiobook, both versions are unputdownable. As for the audiobook narration, Scott Brick's voice is warm and listenable. His delivery is clearly enunciated and pitched so you don't have to keep changing volume to hear what's being said.Cons: Brick does an excellent job on New York and Long Island accents (check out his reading of Nelson DeMille's John Corey series), but \\"The Firm\\" takes place in the Deep South and his southern accents are weak to non-existent.

Of course, it turns out that he doesn't get the full story until after he accepts the job. The rest of the story entails the exciting efforts to get him and his wife out of their desperate situation. Like most Grisham novels, this is a fun and fast read that many readers would classify as light fiction.Many people are familiar with the story through the movie. The book is significantly different from the movie; if you have seen the movie you will probably still enjoy the book and be consistently surprised throughout the second half of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amused and satisfied","review":"The Firn is brilliant, its tricky, clever, deep, ironic,gripping and genuinly funny.

And the government sees McDeere as their ticket in, to have an insider, to arrest people in the firm involved in illegal activities. It seems like the feds should be on his side, but carelessness on their part gets him in even more trouble with The Firm....thus he decides to try avoiding both organizations.The Firm is very suspenseful.

This is a fantastic novel thatI managed to stay up untill 4 AM sometimes reading it because I could not put it down. As I said,this is a great way to be introduced into John Grisham's works. By far this is my favorite novel of hisand of any other multitude of genre or author I have had the pleasure of reading. The Firm is alsoprobabally the most ejoyed and is revered as his finest work.

The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm","review":"The Firm was definetly a very good book that never bored me. It kept me on the edge the whole time i was reading the book. I especially like how Grisham transitions the prestigious firm into something alot less likeable as the book goes on.

Good reviews and personal recommendations prompted me to buy the thing. Thankfully I bought it in paperback (they burn easier). I have never been so disappointed by a novel in my life . Grisham's boring attention to meaningless detail is equalled only by the flatness of the characters he created for \\"The Firm\\". It is as dry and unliterary as a history book.

It must say something about the reasons people read. As pure escapist reading for someone who has worked 55 hours and needs an undemanding book, I guess it has its merits. A simple plot. An okay premise. A menacing corporation. It's like settling in to television after work and watching a bad drama. Maybe television can explain the success of this book.

Boring!!!","review":"John Grisham sure turned out a stinker in this book, but for some reason people seem to like it. The Firm starts out by giving obvious clues (not just to the reader, but to the young lawyer) that his new employers aren't exactly above-board. How he can be such a brilliant young man and not see the clues is beyond me. He gets suckered in, and as it finally dawns on him that he works for the Mob, they start pushing him to do things he shouldn't, and are completely out of character. Most of the things he did seemed \\"realistic\\" enough, but his beach tryst was nothing more than a plot device. This is the one Grisham book that I would not recommend to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's best","review":"This is a truly amazing Grisham book, full of plot twists and suspense. It's no wonder it catapulted Grisham into the bestseller arena.The story starts out simple: Mitch McDeere is recruited into a creepy law firm situated in Memphis. They give him a high salary, a BMW, and a good mortgage. No one has ever quit this firm, which seems to be a good thing... But then Mitch realizes that people from the firm have a tendency to die, and the FBI is involved too. No spoilers, but it gets even more intense as the book goes on.This is a great and fairly easy read. Like most Grisham books, you will find yourself hooked to this book from the start.

It's the story of Mitch McDeere, a new lawyer employed by a seemingly perfect law firm until he discoveres the Mob is behind the firm. The book is about his grappling with what to do concerning the FIB, the mob, and his friends at the firm.I truly enjoyed this book, it made me want to keep reading.

This story is packed with all the familiar threads of urban thrillers that put a Harvard law school graduate and his young wife through every conceivable emotional wringer and grave danger that finds them one jump ahead of Mafia types who aim to keep the young couple from cooperating with the FBI and airing their very dirty laundry. The novel was read by the excellent Scott Brick, who has narrated several best-seller audiobooks.

They offer him a huge salary, a new BMW, and no more school loan expenses, it seems too good to be true, unfortunately it is. Mitch begins to see the darker side of the firm after he gets there. No one has ever left the firm, and some of the lawyers tend to die mysterious deaths. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but let me tell you that it will suck you in and leave you breathless.

I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. The movie is awful and uncomprehensive, even though it starred the gorgeous Tom Cruise.It always amazes me how Grisham was able to weave such a thick plot. How Mitch got started, how he got involved, how he managed to find out about the entire scam, how he got out... it takes a genius to write something like that. One thing I don't really like about the book is the way it ends - Mitch leaving his career as a lawyer and living on an island for the rest of his life - how impractical and uninspiring!!The story is so engrossing and so cleverly written, there is no doubt that it was a best seller in NY and Singapore and I suppose in many cities in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Books I've Read","review":"I think that John Grisham's book The Firm is one of the best books that I have read because he uses great detail in his writing but doesn't use swearing in it like a Stephen King book.

Assuming that you haven't read Grishom yet my advice; read 'A Time to Kill' first. The Author wrote that first and I think it is a better way to get into his mind and style. The intial printing of his first book was small, so most people read Firm first, as did I, but I really think as good as this one is, 'A Time to Kill' is more personal, more emotional and is really a better story.The Firm is a solid story with plently of action and suspense and should be read along with the 'Pelican Brief', 'The Client' and 'A Time to Kill' before you read 'The Runaway Jury' and 'The Rainmaker' only because I think the latter two wouldn't be quite as fun as they are without a good base on how Grisham writes and thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ ANOTHER GRISHAM NOVEL - ANY OTHER ONE","review":"This book started out well, Grisham can definitely write well and create characters. What he fails at is convincing stories from time to time. Don't get me wrong I like most of his stuff, but this one is WEAK. The wet behind the ears lawyer takes on these evil all powerful experienced lawers and they never know? He goes off to the Bahamas with file after file like a cowboy??? Everyone else would just call the FBI and turn over the evidence. By page 50 the character becomes cardboard and the evil guys toddlers. Read \\"King of Torts\\" or \\"The Client\\" first. Those books are much better and worthy of praise this one is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, easy to read story","review":"The Firm has a great plot, characters that are easy to understand and identify with and a quick pace. Like other Grisham novels, The Firm is not bogged down with page after page of useless detail and description. Instead, the author uses dialog to carry his story and adds just enough narrative to make the story come together. While I don't like the fact that Grisham leaves a few loose ends, I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to just about anyone interested in a fun, exciting book that doesn't make you think too much. It's a book that will keep you entertained and probably up late because you want to keep reading.

So, I went into reading the book with many of the details of the story still clear to me - I could even picture the scenes in the movie. As with other films I've seen that have been made of Grisham's books, the moviemakers have stayed very close to the book - a little less with this one, but you won't be terribly unhappy with the places where they've taken liberties. I've already given my opinion away, really, any movie that I remember well for more than a year has to be good. In this case, the plot surprises and its complexity keep you fascinated. Grisham is such a good writer that even having seen the movie, you don't mind seeing the plot unfold again. It's not Tom Cruise, but then the casting was excellent! Do read the book with or without him in mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun story, TERRIBLY written","review":"I admit, I was sucked in by the plot. Grisham has a good story here, but his WRITING! I honestly think that a high school freshman Creative Writing student could have produced better, more interesting prose. Boring, repetitive character descriptions, an extraordinarily limited vocabulary, sentence fragments galore...For good lawyer-based fiction, I'll stick with Scott Turow-- he tells a good story AND tells it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is the worst piece of Floyd-related garbage I have ever seen. There is some weird Floyd-like music the whole way through in styles that don't even match the style of the Floyd-era that is being talked about.

Nothing but a money-grab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst documentary I've ever seen, period.","review":"This is the worst documentary about a band I've ever seen. They have no rights to any music, a handful of still photographs and drawings of band members, and a terrible host. The host runs around the field of Knebworth humming songs in his recollection of the concert he saw there. He barely mentions the names of songs, as if he's afraid to do so. No live footage. No band interviews (or interviews of anybody else for that matter!)Liam Dale (the host) even has his own little music video at the end where they are playing music that is not Pink Floyd.Let me be clear, if you value your time, save part of your life by not watching this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of all \\"on the rock trail\\" dvds","review":"this is the worst thing going. some guys on here giving it 5 stars. somethings wrong here , he should be removed . do not buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"***Aproach with caution***","review":"I expected to see interviews and concert footage of the band, kinda like the \\"Making of Dark Side Of The Moon\\" DVD.

There are I think I counted 3-5 pictures of the band, about 5 knockoff backing tracks like \\"Sorrowesque\\", \\"Jog Like Hades\\" and \\"Wish I Was Close\\". The narrator is almost funny. The 5 minutes he talks about being at the Knebworth 1975 show was interesting in that drunk guy at the bar telling a crazy story kind of way. Otherwise horrible! They couldn't even use a pic of Syd, but instead used horribly drawn pictures of their faces.I paid $2.00 in a bargain bin for this and I still feel ripped off.For a better background look for the Classic Albums Dark Side disc, 24 Hour Technicolor Dream, or the Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett story. Even the Rock Milestones series is waaaay better than this.

While you're having fun reading about all the Hollywood stars, you can also learn a lot of somewhat useful things. There are book, music, television, and movie reviews packed in as well.The ad to page ratio is fairly decent. For example, you won't encounter an ad smack-dab in the middle of an article. However, if the article was taking up half a page, an ad may take up the other half. There also are fragrance samples, but making a request to People can take out the perfume samples, in case you're allergic.The most important aspect is that People magazine 99% of the time has confirmed sources, unlike some magazines that sputter whatever they can onto their cover just so they can obtain publicity. So no, you won't be reading bizarre lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I am glad I finally decided to renew my subscription to People. I love this magazine.

Yes, the setting is the same - England during the Victorian age, but the writing is totally different. This series does not dwell on the dark side as much as Ms. Perry's do. But it's a good start to what looks like a promising series. It's a good mystery and there is enough diversity of characters to keep you interested. Kate Ardleigh is a wonderful heroine. She's smart, sassy and gritty, as well as a genuinely nice girl. Charles Sheridan is a find as well. A true studier of the criminalistic arts. There is a lot of Vicoriana lore in the book, but that adds to the charm if you are a buff like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading!","review":"I am an avid collector of \\"mystery\\" books.

My evaluation is manifest in the fact that I am now pursuing the remainder of the series. The authors write well and, at least in this volume, try to make the characters and story bear the weight of interest rather than relying solely on murder or murders to provide a puzzzle upon which to focus. They succeed in this effort. While not a Sayers, Allingham or Marsh, they produce a quickly read, neat package, with an attractive pair of detectives who, in this first in the series, still don't realize that they have been fated to be a pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book on lean that talks about human issues","review":"1) at last I find people, be they fiction heroes, who repeatedly wonder whether they wouldn't be happier if they were back working in their lab / classroom / previous job (select the most appropriate) rather than trying to implement lean and lobby management, suppliers or customers2) the novel is a great idea to explain both lean techniques and human issues, which other books on lean usually overlook.3) it may be a bit arduous to read when reaching the takt time computations or kanban implementation without visual support : I would advise this novel only to people who have at least seen a bit of lean in action, if not implemented it4) it's a good progressive summary which provides an interesting overview on the lean tools and approaches, and how they cling together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn something new each time","review":"I've only read this book twice, and I'm just about to graduate from college so I'm no Lean expert, but I seem to get something new, or more understand something at a little deeper level when I read this book. Great introduction to Lean. One of the things I like about the book is how it tries to change your mindset to think more Lean. The characters set up something in the factory they think aligns with Lean objectives (and you would generally think it's a good idea if you have no formal training in Lean and haven't \\"learned to see\\"), only to have the \\"sensei\\" come and tell why that isn't the best approach.

Even more ominous is the growing shortage of water in the world, a shortage being compounded by global warming which is reducing the snow melt, a key factor in creating the water flow for rivers. An ugly secret of the \\"green revolution\\" that reduced hunger has been the huge expansion of pumping out underground aquifers around the world. From Arizona to northern China water tables have been falling rapidly for years. The percentage of world crops dependent on irrigation has soared in the last 50 years. Even the US CIA sees water as a severe global crisis. I don't agree with all the points in this DVD but it serves as a wake up call about what is to come.

There was one main feature that was quite good that gave some good historical background on the making of the film (which is what I was hoping for), but the other features were very short and disappointing and were mostly made up of clips from the longer feature.

It's based on the 8th Army Airforces early attempts at daylight bombing of Nazi Germany in WW2. It portrays the extreme danger young men had to face day by day in the course of flying these missions. Although it's not a documentary it's a film that reminds us of the sacrifices thousands had to make in order to preserve our values and freedoms.

This is another area where some great extras could have been added.It's a great film, don't get me wrong. It just seems natural for Fox to put some effort into the presentation.

In a \\"classic\\" World War II movie you would expect more action and less yacking.

Gregory Peck portrays General Savage, a man that falls victim to his own hard and disciplined professionalism.To fully appreciate the scale of stress and fatigue experienced by these B-17 bomber crewmen, I recommend the DVD \\"WWII in HD - The Air War), sold by amazon. Perhaps in 1949, less was better and there was not much need to repeat the terror of the air war.To view this film from the present, the stress and fatigue is there as told, but not shown, as it would have to be had the film been made today.The two disc set includes features about the making of \\"12 O'clock High\\", the actual B-17s used in the film, together with the actual 'crash' scene piloted by Paul Mantz. Mantz did stunt work for both Hollywood and Howard Hughes and later died in the making of the film \\"The Flight of the Phoenix\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive WWII Air War Film","review":"If you're only going to watch one WWII air combat film in your life it should be this one.

Not overly glamorized or contrived like most of its contemporaries, \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" serves as a role model for any study of leadership under fire. It's frequently used by many of todays best military training instutes for leadership training. It also stands out, along with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" as Peck's greatest role. Long overdue for a cleaned-up laserdisc or DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy scent and just the right consistency...","review":"I have been using Tree Hut products for the past year, but this lotion wasn't available at the store I shop at.

If I recall correctly I bought it several years ago from Amazon. So what is this new thing they're trying to sell me that's about to be released on DVD, \\"Golden Ring (Sub Ac3 Dol DTS)\\"? My only disappointment with what I have--and it is a very trivial one--is that whereas the sound of the Decca Ring is stunning stereo for its time (late 50's to late 60's) the sound on this BBC film soundtrack is mono. Is it possible someone went back to the original multitrack studio takes and derived Dolby and DTS sound from them, and re-dubbed them? Doubtful, but if it were I'd be tempted to buy it. As it is this \\"product page\\" is sadly typical of many of Amazon's: absolutely useless for gleaning any information of interest. A person who had no idea of what it is would be even more baffled.

BUT, I was very disappointed that the book literally fell apart in my hands after using it only several times. When I buy a \\"guide\\" type book, I would hope that it would last for than a few days of use. This thing was so shoddily made that pages were falling out of the binding almost immediately after I purchased it. The book was not misused, bent, or even creased. It just looks like it was poorly made.It is unfortunate that the author's hard work is compromised by haphazard printing and binding. I would buy another book by this author, but only if it were published by a different company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Info, but...","review":"I purchased this book in preparation for a trip to the front range and RMNP.

Nothing but a really bad ripoff of the Simpsons with nothing but pop culture references for jokes. Some of them funny and others just aren't. Absolutely nothing about The Family Guy is even remotely original and mostly it's just mildly funny. What's even worse is that Seth MacFarlane sunk even lower with his American Dad show which is even more redundant than The Family Guy. Even worse is this movie is even less funny than most actual Family Guy episodes. Spend your money elsewhere. Go get Skinny Puppy's new Greater Wrong of the Right live DVD. It's a better use of your hard earned money. Also, watch Robot Chicken on Adult Swim and give your ratings to that show instead of Family Guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite freaking sweet at all","review":"My hopes were high. I couldn't wait to watch it! So how come twenty minutes into it I was wondering when it was going to either a)be funny or b)be over.

The premise is uninteresting and the ending is incredibly lame. Utterly disappointing. The beginning is a little amusing and after the credits too but by then you'll be so pissed off you won't care. Save your money for the next season dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't the fans bring this show back from the dead?","review":"The uproar of the fans. The ratings on Cartoon Network.

And this is how we are repaid with a $13 two-episode disc or a $25 \\"special edition?\\"Can't help but think greed, greed, greed here. But when Lucas gave his blessing for an episode like this to happen you had to know the marketing wheels were rolling in his head, thus here we are at 48 minutes for either 13 or 25 bucks.As for the episode itself, it was great for the most part. It has the awful let's-see-how-long-we-can-drag-it-out jokes that unfortunately Family Guy has relied on since its return.

I wasn't expecting anything all too great or bad ...just a fun, well made flick like South Park. As I watched this movie, from the start I was pretty dissapointed. There were some funny scenes but overall the dialogue was poor and it seemed like the plot was just getting dragged till the end. It didn't seem like there was much effort put into making this movie even though it has been the hot topic with the show for many months now.

It is basically a fairly straight run-through of the first Star Wars movie. Jokes are VERY few and far between, and I'm left with the impression that the Family Guy crew was so in awe of being given permission to do this show that they forgot they were supposed to be making Family Guy and not re-making Star Wars.This episode was SO incredibly boring that it burst the Family Guy bubble for me.

I did laugh... sometimes... but it was all \\"eh\\". If you are a die hard fan of the old family guy, you probably won't like this movie that much. If you are just an average person who doesn't follow family guy that much, then you'll probably like it (because a lot of my friends aren't big into family guy, but they loved the movie). The movie has memorable moments, which is why I would suggest seeing it once, but over all I wouldn't waste the money on owning the DVD. Borrow it from a friend or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 bucks for an episode???","review":"The 1 star rating isn't for the episode itself. I'd give that about a 4.

Stewie is played like one can imagine would be a remake of The Omen, if the part of the moppet anti-Christ Damien was played by David Niven, wearing a smoking jacket and sipping martinis. The character Stewie is a figure that can give you hours of belly laughs as well as \\"sleeping with the lights on\\" night terrors all in one package.But this \\"Untold Story\\" just doesn't do right by him.

First they separate the last season into two DVD sets to get more money out of fans. Now they are charging this much for one episode! If they don't want to put it in the next box set, if fans don't wait until then or if someone only wants this one episode, they could at least offer it on iTunes for the standard episode fee. This is getting ridiculous. I am not paying for this and I seriously doubt that I will buy the next set.

While much of it is \\"amusing\\" I only laughed out loud a handful of times. If you have the expectation that this movie will go where the TV show couldn't, you will be disappointed. The movie is significantly less edgy than TV show. Stewie's acid tongue has been nuetralized and Brian's wit and charm have evaporated. Much of the movie is focused on the Brian-Stewie relationship and the two even take a road trip together, but nothing here compares to the TV episode where Brian and Stewie find Brian's mother.As has been pointed out in other reviews, the movie is really 3 TV plots woven together into a long form.
