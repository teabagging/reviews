As always, Richard Simmons is loud, motivating, and cheesy. An example of this is the beginning where everyone (including Richard) acts like they were \\"invited\\" to the disco by an unknown person and seemed shocked when the spotlights come on, but just start the routine. That gets old to watch EVERYTIME. The workout is great, but long. I tried the 60's blast off for a 30 minute workout with Simmons, but that video was awful. He can be hard to follow at times, but the moves aren't so difficult that you won't get it the second time. Just walk and move your arms.

When I got the screws installed, I then discovered another issue, where the magazine was hanging up, and not inserting or extracting freely.

The geometry of the latch hook location, the seat surface, and the belt path on the car seat combine to make a situation where the car seat is barely restrained from pivoting in a vertical direction. Side-side the car seat can be pretty secure, but the whole seat can pivot upward quite easily, and we do not want to risk harm to our little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This seat drove me crazy!!!","review":"It's great in concept...a seat that should take you through to 80 lbs...but I can't stand using the seat.

It is too difficult to hold the top of the buckle together and try to push down to get it buckled at the same time...you would need three hands.I did like that it was relatively easy to install and the aesthetics are great, but it's just not practical. Thank goodness for Babies R Us' 90 day return policy - I'm on my way now to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use","review":"We bought this seat on the recommendation of a friend. We liked that it is rear-facing and converts to a booster, but we hate the car seat.

The directions were a little difficult to figure out but my brother-in-law (who has 2 girls in car seats) was able to help us install it.My son enjoys being able to see out the window with this car seat. He is very curious and was miserable being below the level of the window.The only complaint I have is that I am currently unable to recline it enough so that the lines for level to ground actually are level to the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated and Frustrating","review":"I am a new mother and of course I want nothing but the best for my son. The salesperson at Babies R US recommended this seat and said it was the top seller, plus it had a weight capacity of 100lbs. My son has out grown his infant seat, so one evening I tried to install the Cosco seat. It took me 30 min to get the infant head rest out, another 10 min to separate the seat from the base, and another 10 min to adjust the straps. Not to mention I could not even get the seat belt to secure properly in my Jeep liberty ( the latch belt is too short)! Needless to say it is going back to the store! The car seat is very complicated and frustrating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great and comfy","review":"My daughter loves this seat. It's soft and cofy and she seems to be happy in it. However i have some small issue with it. First, at rear facing the seat does not tilt emaugh to keep my daughter's head back when she falls asleep. Secondly the latch in front is sometimes a pain to put together. Especially if you are in a hurry to buckle up the child, and or if the child is moving too much, it could be a pain. But, other than that it's a great seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy arm rests","review":"We returned it for a Graco Ultra CarGo.The arm rests on Coscos are a joke.

We will be returning this carseat tomorrow!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate This Carseat!","review":"Not only was it a complete pain to install, the straps loosened up while I was driving and my 10 month old worked her way out of the shoulder harnesses. In addition, it is TOO DIFFICULT to get my daughter buckled up - it takes so long to get the complicated buckle to latch that the last time I used it (before I returned it) someone in the parking lot actually ended up helping me buckle it! So it wasn't just my imagination - even they said I should return it!DO NOT BUY THIS CARSEAT! I did only so we would be saving money in the long run and it ended up wasting time and energy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far I love it!!!!","review":"We got this carseat for my now 3 year old daughter maybe about 4 months ago and passed her Evenflo triumph carseat to her younger sister. So far I haven't had any complaints. My husband and I love the way it latches and don't find it difficult at all. We just see it as a pretty neat feature. Also it is so light compared to the Evenflo. That makes it much easier to move when you need to and it doesn't take up so much room on the backseat. The color is amazing at staying clean and presentable without having to wash it every other week. I just love it so far compared to our last purchase. If I wasn't trying to save money by passing the evenflo down to my younger daughter, I would buy a second one for her!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to use correctly rear-facing","review":"The seat cannot be reclined back far enough to use correctly when rear-facing even by the manufacturer's standards. When in a fully reclined position sitting on level ground, it does not recline far enough according to the level guides on the seat. Almost all rear seats in cars cause it to lean forward even further. This causes the child to slump forward when sleeping. The only possible way to position the seat correctly is to prop items under the front of the seat. This seems very dangerous considering the props could fall out and the car seat would then be loose. Ours is going back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busy Mom","review":"I am the mother of three young boys (the oldest is 3) and have 2 of the Alpha Omega carseats. The car seat is a nighmare, the straps twist and it is nearly impossible to get the children in tightly. I have to pull it apart at least once a month to untangle the straps. I have even tried ironing them but nothing works. I know at least 5 other moms with the same seat that have the exact problem. Save yourself headaches and buy another seat with thicker straps that don't twist so much.I hate these seats so much I am actually buying new ones for my youngest two because I can't imagine dealing with this for 3 more years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but a little bulky","review":"We really like this car seat and the fact that it \\"grows\\" with our son. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit bulky---maybe that is because I have a small car? But even with that, we don't regret our purchase one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This seat takes up too much space. But the biggest drawback is that the seat cover doesn't come out. So, if your child gets sick in the car, guess what.... You get to give the car seat a sponge bath. We found this out the hard way. The smell is virtually impossible to get out. We are now looking for a new seat with a washable cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must READ.....VERY DISTRUBING","review":"Recently, I got into a car accident with my infant son while using this carseat. I do not recommend this at all for anyone. Not only was the carseat destroyed but it did not hold up in the accident. Later the fire department told me that the carseat did not pass highway standards for 2002. That is enough information to avoid this carseat at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it!","review":"This was my son's very first convertible car seat and it is great. He was comfortable in the car for our very long 12 hour trip back to visit family. It seemed really big and bulky when I first looked at it, but it fits in our little Dodge Neon really well. We don't have to move our seats forward and we have plenty of room up front. I'm sure it will be even better when we can face our son forward in a couple of weeks.I thought it was a great price (I got it on sale for $125) especially since I had to buy it when my son was 6 months old and now I don't have to buy another car seat for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this seat if you need a rear facing restraint","review":"This seat sounded like it was just what I was looking for because it could accomodate my infant son through his toddler years and beyond. Once I brought it home though, I felt differently. It is IMPOSSIBLE to install this as a rear-facing restraint!!! The manufacturer wants you to thread the seatbelt under the padding of the seat itself which seems physically impossibe for most people to do (unless your hands are the size of a toddler's and you don't mind a little bleeding). I've read other reviews that said it just took a little patience to install this seat, but I realize it takes much more than that. This seat seems to be made for the forward-facing position and as a booster seat so if you're interested in a rear-facing seat, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRUSTRATION!!!","review":"I am a new mother of a 6 month old. I did exactly what every mother would do for the safety of their child and did my research. I found the reviews pretty good so I went ahead and purchased one. I have to say that everytime I put my son in there I get so frustrated!!! The \\"puzzle\\" buckle is not the problem, it's pulling the strap that makes it secure. Also, my husband had such a problem installing it and he is a very handy man! It wouldn't be tight enough or it would wiggle back and forth. Finally after about the 5th time and a few choice words, he finally got it secured. Well you know the cold weather we have been having? Well let's just say that everytime I put my son in there, I work up a sweat. Maybe it's our bad luck, but I would look around before purchasing this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat, fits nicely in Escape","review":"I have bought many carseats for my 17 month old daughter. Our first convertible seat was a Graco Comfortsport which I hated. We live far from family and go on many long trips and when she fell asleep her head would hang forward. This does not happen with the Alpha Omega. She looks so comfortable when she's sleeping. Also, the seat fits great in my small SUV (Ford Escape). Yes, it is a big larger than some other convertible seats, but I like the fact that it is bigger and more \\"sturdy\\". I think bigger in this case means safer. I have seen that many people complain about the straps twisting, but we have had this seat for a few months now and I have not had them twist even once. I think if you're careful and observant when you take your child in and out you will not have a problem. To me, most straps in most carseats are the same. If you are not careful any of them can twist. Overall I LOVE this seat and it was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt Fit","review":"I was so excited when I bought this carseat. My 5 month old son had just outgrown his infant seat and this one came highly recommended to me. I tried putting my son in it in the store and he loved it. Unfortunately I had to return it. When I went to install it in our Subaru Forester it wouldn't fit in the rear facing position. In order for the \\"level to the ground\\" bars to be level to the ground the foot of the carseat had to be almost 1/2 way up the back of the seat of the car! Not only that but the front seats would have to pulled up so far that were unusable. I think that it would fit well in the forward facing position in just about any vehicle, but if you plan to use it rear facing you need a vehicle with a LOT of room between the front and back seats (minivan, LARGE suv, etc...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Head falls forward","review":"We have used the Britax until trying this model and Britax is worth the $. We bought this model b/c of Consumer Reports and regret it. It has been sitting in the garage for instances we need to transport a friend. If my daughter falls asleep in it - her head is instantly falling forward and WILL NOT stay even somewhat up. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big and difficult to install","review":"This car seat was too big to fit in my 4 door Honda Civic-which has a pretty big back seat (granted I didn't try moving the passenger seat forward, but I didn't want to crunch my husband.)We ended up keeping it because it did fit in my husbands car. It was also extremely difficult to install following the directions, we had to go to the store to figure it out. It will fit and work fine as a forward facing seat when my son turns 1 year. I ended up paying a little extra to get the Peg Perego Infant carrier/seat, but it was worth it, it installed in seconds and is so much easier to handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS CARSEAT","review":"Where do I begin? First, don't even think about using it rear-facing. There's no room. And we have a Yukon XL. Second, it is impossible to install. Plus the directions are horrible. Third, I had to literally cut the infant head pad out of the seat with scissors. Fourth, the material gets really hot in the summer. Fifth, the belts for the latch system are really not long enough and it makes the whole seat uneven. Sixth, it doesn't lean back enough. And finally, the buckle is REALLY difficult to snap...especially when it is 90 degrees and your child is screaming.Save your money, do your research and don't just buy the least ugly carseat at Babies R Us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware if you want to trust the LATCH system.","review":"We bought this car seat based not only on the reviews, but on the fact that it seats a child up to 100 lbs, was light weight, and looked good. We were told it was a new and improved model.The LATCH system on this seat does not work! The straps don't even go beyond the base of the car seat much less go down far enough to be attached to the car!We ended up using lap belts only to secure it, however are unhappy with how top heavy and loose it seems. We are having it checked over by the Highway Patrol (they will do this for free in many states) before we decide if it will keep it or not, however I see a return in my future. I should have stuck with the less expensive car seat I KNEW worked that goes up to 40 lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible To Clean","review":"My parents got this car seat as a present before my son was born. He is now 16 months. My son gets car sick easily and we needed to clean the upholstery of this car seat. It was impossible! You cannot remove the covering without completely disassembling the seat. I had to remove the straps (which we constantly tangled anyway), unscrew the seat belt guides on the side and I still couldn't get the cover off to wash it. The seat has never been very user-friendly and my son's head was always flopping forward when he was younger. I would not recommend this seat to anyone. My husband and I have the Evenflo Triumph in our own car and we LOVE it! I would never buy the Omega Elite. I gave it one star because I believe that when it is installed that it is probably a safe seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The seat is OKay","review":"I loved the seat in the store, I even put my 8 month old daughter in it to see how she fit. Everything was great, until I got home and realized that the seat DIDN'T work out rear facing in the back seat of my 2002 Silverado. So we waited and use it now forward facing and it is wonderful. But the buckles?? The people that designed the set up obviously have never tried to put a squirming, screaming child into a car seat that requires two hands to buckle them in! But over all the seat is okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"We at first bought a cheap $30 car seat and it was horrible. This car seat is well worth the money. We didn't buy it until are daughter was 8 months old so I'm not sure how it works with a newborn but my daughter loves it!! So comfy she falls alseep in it and her head doesn't drop down like it did in the other car seat. I drive a minivan so I have no problem with it fitting. It only takes up one of the bucket seats in the back. AWESOME!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Mom","review":"I picked this carseat based on all the reviews in magazines that I read. American Baby listed it as one of the best for children 5 lbs to 80 lbs. When I bought my newborn home from the hospital (weighing 6lbs) I found this carseat to be much too big. In addition, it was much too big for my SUV. The seat was too large to recline fully without pulling the front seat up as far as it could go, not to mention the 5 point harness is not the easiest to fasten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"After trying for an hour to install this seat, I FINALLY got it in. Then, it was so big (I have a Jeep Liberty)that when installed rear-facing, I couldn't see over it. I put my daughter in it twice, and each time she screamed. Needless to say, I returned it the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good carseat!!!...","review":"I read several complains along with the good reviews...I think this is a good seat!!! My son(9 months old) looks comfy in this..And it's not hard to buckle him.As several people said it's kind of hard to install the latch for the rear facing position.They haven't given the instructions properly. I hope this might help you along with the instructions in the manual.First you fully recline the car seat. Then you can remove the strap from underneath, that is connected to the seat pad.Now you can fold the seat pad. It will be much easier to thread the latch this way.For installing in the car with the latch system,they haven't mentioned that we have to 'make sure the level lines are level with ground'.But the customer rep says so!!! .I'm worried about the expiration date given!!! May be it's b'coz of the \\"recommendation\\" that car seats has to be replaced every 6 years..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat!!!","review":"I just bought the seat this weekend and although my husband had a bit of a problem installing it (like most men he was stubborn about reading the instructions), it seems to be a great seat. My 5 month old seems to be so comfortable in it. The reclining option is excellent. I wish a seat like this one existed when my 9 year old daughter was a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok... if you never need to clean it","review":"My biggest complaint about this carseat is how difficult it is to get all the pieces apart when it needs cleaning. My daughter throws up an average amount in the car, and taking this seat apart to clean it is a nightmare. Also, I agree with the other reviewers that I never felt like I was getting the straps tight enough, and they are constantly getting twisted. The \\"puzzle-piece\\" buckle is a pain, but I've seen the same thing on lots of other carseats, so I thought it must be a standard or something. I would recommend going with 3 separate seats - infant seat, toddler seat, then booster seat. This one seems like a good deal, getting more in one package, but the stress is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"We found something better","review":"After having bought the Cosco Aplpha Omega Elite we instaled into our car as soon as we got home and put our 6 month old in for the first time. The first thing I realized was the seat was a little big for our sedan, then after driving about 5 min down the road our son fell asleep, the seat doesn't recline back much and his head fell foward chin to chest. I wound up riding in the back seat with him with my hand on his forehead holding his head up all the way back to the BRU we bought it from. We then exchanged it for the Evenflo Triumph 5. It was the same thing all over again. We now have the Roundabout and 2 months later we still love it. Sooooo comfy I wish they made a car seat for me! The restraints are very easy to use and there is a cushion under the buckle between his legs that keeps the belt from rubbing on his thighs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS SEAT","review":"I didn't want to spend over $200 on a car seat so I purchased the Alpha Omega Elite, thinking it would be a good purchase. I couldn't have been more disappointed in a product. On the Alpha Omega Elite, the buckle was so difficult to use and the straps kept getting twisted. In addition, my son's head kept falling forward whenever he was sleeping (in the rear-facing position). This was so frustrating because someone would have to sit in the back seat to hold up his head. After doing more research, I went back to Babies R Us and purchased the Britax Marathon. The buckle is easy to use, the straps don't get tangled, and my son's head rests comfortably on the back of the seat whenever he is napping. Plus, it fits perfectly in my Pontiac Grand Am. I wish I would have purchased the Britax Marathon seat first. It was well worth the extra $100. Don't go cheap when it comes to a car seat. Spend the extra money to get a QUALITY product. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too big for expedition","review":"I bought this as an extra car seat for grandmas ford expedition. And we couldn't believe it didn't fit! My daughter is 8 months old and I was tired of taking our seat (britax decathalon)from our ford explorer and putting it in her suv. We tried to install the seat in the rear facing position and to make it level with ground the driver seat would have to be pushed almost all the way up to the stearing wheel. Then when you turn the car off the seat automaticaly slides back. With the seat in the correct position the seat cannot go all the way back like it should. I am not a person hired to slam products, I am a mom tring to make life easier and the britax decathalon rated for up to 65 lbs. will last longer than any other rated at 40 lbs. and even though it is a larger seat it fits perfectly where the omega did not. britax is worth the extra money I wouldn't waste the time trying to use the omega in the rear facing position it takes up too much space!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this seat is #ONE","review":"(...)this seat is great and if u need to complain about strap ...well then i guess that ur childs safety doesnt matter .. it is very easy to install i did it in 20 min with my 11 month old daughter helping ... if u get your seat in order the straps will NOT TWIST if they are you are in a hurry and safety doesnt matter Love this seat highly recom.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, that car seat's horrific!","review":"I returned this extremely disappointing carseat one week after purchase. *Impossible to install rear facing* *Impossible to level, even with car seat leveler* *Buckle difficult to use and presses hard against baby's thighs* *Shoulder harness can not be pulled tight enough for baby's safety* My only thought is the manufacturer must hate children!

Thank God I was buying it for forward facing toddler seat I LOVE IT!!! and yes the belt does twist, but only at the bottom, but guess what I do, I simply untwist as i bring the clip up,after I strap her in, they dont twist anymore!! For cryin out loud people! when you get in the car you untwist your seat belt dont you? anyway this seat is very easy to install it took my husband 3min to install and its extremely secure. The straps are freakin easy to adjust it's wonderful I feel very comfortable with my child's safety in this seat and she loves how comfortable it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We HATE this carseat","review":"We have 3 month old twins and are returning 2 of these terrible carseats. After 2 hours of trying to install these seats, we've decided that they are not safe. In the rear facing position, it is impossible to tighten the Latch belt enough to prevent the seat from moving from side to side. We also tried installing it with the car seat belt and did not have any better luck. The \\"level with ground\\" guideline (on the side of the should harness) was only level when the base was placed half way up the back of the seat. This left only 2-3 inches of the base supporting the weight of the child and the carseat.The seat is also HUGE. We have a Volvo S80 and a Chevy Tahoe and neither are large enough to accommodate this carseat in the rear facing position. Because we have twins, we have to place the seats behind the driver and passenger seats making both very uncomfortable.This may be a good seat in the forward facing position but it definitely isn't a good \\"3 in 1\\" seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for rear-facing","review":"On the recommendation of the sales staff at Babies R Us, I bought this car seat - HUGE mistake. It cannot be levelled in my Camry. It sits bolt upright, no recline at all, even with the recline set fully back. Furthermore, the LATCH tethers are insecure - the seat wiggles all over the place - and it's very hard to install using the seat belts instead. I only found out that it won't work in my car after two solid hours of struggling with all the little bits and pieces and trying to make heads or tails of the worthless instruction manual. I would really think that a carseat manufacturer would make the seat functional for a car as popular as the Camry! Naturally I won't put my baby in this piece of junk - I only hope I can get my money back and buy a Graco!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why so many bad reviews???","review":"i would like to say that this car seat did not deserve all the bad reviews people gave it..

At 7 months old we decided to purchase our daughter a new car seat and we wanted this to be the last . Installing it rear facing was challenging but with a seat designed to last up to 100 pounds we knew it was basically designed for forward facing. I think the five point harness and long straps are GREAT and getting her in and out is a piece of cake. Any competent adult should not have any problem with the harness, it just takes a little while to get use to ( as most things do). I highly recommend this car seat - we are actually going today to purchase 2 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be the best...","review":"After researching options on the infant to toddler car seats, I decided this had to be one of the best. Practical because it would last until toddler age, safe with the rear facing 5 point harness, comfortable because it looked and felt soft...Not the case at all. We've used it only 4 times and each time it has been 160 something dollars of sheer aggrevation. You're praying you can get the latch fastened fast enough not to upset the baby or hurt the baby in the process, the straps are next to impossible to adjust, the seat takes up the ENTIRE back seat of my 4-door Accord, and you definitely need a neck cushion for the baby in this seat. My husband brought home a Graco infant carrier model to use for now and pulled the Elite out until the baby is older. If you purchase this seat, don't expect to be completely happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Car Seat","review":"This seat is a challenge to install, it is heavy, and the 3 piece buckle is difficult to use. We had a lot of difficulty with the belts twisting and like the other reviewers we could never get our daughter tight enough in the seat.The best car seats on the market are by Britax, we have 6 between our 2 young children (2 for Nana's car). After the Alpha Omega seat we decided to spend the extra money and get a good quality, easy to use/install seat. The belts never twist and the buckle is very eay to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"PROTECT OUR LITTLE ONES","review":"Yes, it is larger than my last car seat, but this way I only have to buy one seat till he is out of car seats/boosters. I LOVE that!!!! Easy to install, change around, and I love the ease of adjusting the head rest. YES the latch can be a little challanging at times but when it is correct you know your little one is safely harnessed in. It is worth the piece of mind. He has fussed getting in and staying in other car seats and has yet to fuss in this one. I'm very satisfied and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone. I bought it for our long trip coming up & I want our gift from God to travel safely and comfortable. I know we made the correct choice!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a comfortable seat","review":"We purachased this seat after my daughter outgrew her infant carrier. I had it installed by the police, in which they had to remove the base and use three \\"flotation tubes\\" to get it positioned right. It is in the most reclined position (and the flotation tubes make it more reclined) and it is still very upright and at a very uncomforable angle. My daughter is 11 months and about 21lbs. and screams when she is in this seat and never falls asleep. She would fall asleep all the time in her infant seat. It appeared comforable at the store but do not be deceived, it is a very uncomfortable seat. I does appear to be a safe and secure seat and may be more comfortable in the forward-facing position, but I will probably be buying the expensive Britax because I dread driving in the car now. Would not recommend at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the rear seat","review":"We registered and received this car seat as a baby shower gift.We were initally very excited about it, but until we had to actually use it 4 months later, we quickly changed our mind. Once you figure out the puzzle of the interlocking harness, it is a breeze, however, untwisting in the plastic pieces is very frustrating. Also, we have a Santa Fe and the car seat does not fit well in the center of the back seat. It rocks side to side, it does not stay in a firm position, even after it is intstalled by a Fireman. I am constantly tightening it. With a second baby on the way, we need to purchase another car seat and it wont be this one again!!!!!Liam's Mom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good for rear facing...","review":"To have this installed correctly per the manufacturer, having the lines level to the ground, you need to have the front seat basically kissing the dash board.

First off it would not fit in my car at all and I drive a 2003 Chevy Tahoe. When I reclined it to get the right angle, it took up a ton of space! My husband, who is 6' 4\\", would not have been able to ride in the car as we wouldn't have been able to move the front seats!! And to get it to the right angle I would have needed at least one noodle. The instructions are horrible!! We have LATCH and it does not say anything about the angle or how to angle it!! Hard to install!!! The puzzle clasp is also awful. Try putting it on a wiggle worm!! It also seemed like the sides would not tighten evenly and I never felt as though my daughter was safely fastened. I took the seat back and traded it for a Britax Roundabout! Well worth the extra $50 and it will save you the headache and agony!! Don't waste your time or money on this seat!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Install","review":"We bought this car seat for our 8 month old son who outgrew his infant seat. After spending 3 hours trying to install this seat properly (rear facing), we made the decision to return the seat and buy the Britax Marathon, which took about 15 minutes to install and does not move an inch! The Britax also takes up much less space in the back and allows the driver seat to go back further when the car seat is in the fully reclined position. We ended up using this seat for about a week and my son appeared to be comfortable in it, however my husband and I were still not comfortable with the amount the seat moved. If you want to spare a few bloody knuckles don't invest in this seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this carseat","review":"after carefully doing hours of research on car seats i choose this one. i read other peoples reviews and thought that they weren't doing something right. the bottom buckle is like a puzzle peice and when your baby is crying and kicking it's near impossible to get to together. the straps twist too easy and although it's not hard to untwist it's just one extra thing i don't have time for. my son is 4 months old and looks smushed in it. the recline doesn't recline as much as you'd expect. the strap you pull to tighten the harness is near impossible to tug. refacing it hits the back of the seat and you can't pull up on it only out and the seat is in the way. but even with no seat it still doesn't tighten enough for my 4 months old. maybe it would be ok for a 1 yr. old and forward facing but it still needs a lot of time to figure out and adjust. im returning it and playing with every seat out there before i buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the chest latch brakes","review":"6 months after i bought this carseat the chest latch broke.

We bought it when my son was 3 months old. He's 20 months old now, and I called the manufacturer for a refund. First, the base of the carseat broke. I was annoyed, but I called Dorel and they said it is safe to use with or without the base, forward or rear facing. Then the plastic on top where you adjust the headrest broke, so the bars to adjust the headrest started falling out all the time. Then two weeks later I took the cover off to wash it and noticed the plastic buckle at the crotch was cracked all the way through!!! There is no way this seat would have lasted several years like I wanted it to. And I just used it like a normal car seat, it's not like I was throwing it around or something..... Other than falling apart, it was a nice and comfortable car seat while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat, Only Downfall Being It's Size Rear Facing","review":"I got this carseat as a shower gift for my daughter. I absolutely love it. The only downfall is that it is big, and rear facing will not fit in all vehicles properly. For those saying that it doesn't recline enough. There is a line right on the carseat saying how far it should recline, and if your seat doesn't recline it far enough, which it probably won't, you must put pool noodles under it to make it recline, or it isn't safe. It reclines much further than my evenflo, and my daughter likes it far better. As for taking it apart, there are a lot of steps, but the manual shows you step by step how to do it, and it isn't too tough. I love it. The reason it is so big, is because it works until your child is 100 pounds. If you want a carseat that will last that long, you have to deal with the size. Also, I have never had a problem with the staps twisting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This car seat is perfect. It is large but it fits fine in my van.

We thought we got it, then realized we had it installed incorrectly. The first time I put our son in it, I almost pinched his thigh-good thing I was paying close attention and stopped before I clicked the buckle. We messed with that carseat for 2 days, thinking eventually a light bulb will go off, and we would figure out how to use all the straps. We got so frustrated, we took it right back and bought a Britax. We have only used it once today, and our son fell right to sleep in it. It is much softer, reclines more, and MUCH easier to install than the Cosco.

The lock was clicked as if the buckles were allready in except that they were not in! I had to fool with it for a long time to \\"unclick\\" it so that it would accept the buckles.

The only thing worst than an overly complex (horribly complex) and crappy product is two of them...and we made exactly that mistake. My wife purchased one for her car and one for my car.The two primary reasons that product absolutely is the worst product we have purchased for our daughter are as follows:1) It is EXTREMELY to set up...this is a huge failing in the engineering and design. It is easy to make a difficult and cumbersome product; it is challenging to create a well designed and easy / intuitive product. It is VERY clear to me that the engineers that designed this monstrosity have never actually had to use it for their own families.2) You simply cannot remove the cover---in less than 1 hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky, Cumbersome, Difficult to Install","review":"I really hate this car seat. It takes up way too much room. The only place we could fit it rear-facing and securely was behind the passenger seat.

And even then the seat isn't reclined as much as the indicator says it should be (almost but not quite). I would have never purchased this seat. My mother bought it without consulting me and I used it because I'm broke. I have an incredibly small car and this is the worst seat for it. If I had an Escalade maybe there would be room.

This made driving impossible for one of us, and very uncomfortable for the other.(...).Only consider this seat if a) you own an SUV/minivan with a lot of space between the front seats and the back seat, or b) if you only need it to be a forward facing seat.Nice idea, but it wasn't practical for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat!!!","review":"My Husband and I picked this car seat for our daughter when she was about 6 months old (she was already 26 inches long and about 19 1/2 pounds).

The price is alittle high but if you figure in having to buy a safe toddler seat later with the lower end models it really evens out.Edit: Our daughter is now 2 and is still in this seat! It's still in great condition and although the straps do bunch from time to time it's not a big thing to fix them. Nothing has cracked, frayed, discolored, or worn out. The buttons are even still firm to press. I feel she's safer because she can't unbuckle herself. This was a great buy.

This seat looks nice & I'm sure it makes a great forward facing & booster seat, but it is TERRIBLE for a rear facing seat. It would not recline far enough - we would have had to put 2-3 pool noodles under it to get it to the correct position, and at that point our front seats would have to be all the way forward.

If there is ANY way to try this carseat out before buying, please do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Seat, Big Problems","review":"I thought this seat would solve my delima with a tall baby. My child is long and lanky. Not Thick at all, and it rubbed his neck RAW! The pads moved out of the way and the straps are too close together. Also, his head flops fwd, like the other reviews have said.I had to return the seat, after 5mths use. The end of the line with it, was trying to put it in a friends van! It was sitting straight UP! I have it rear facing as he has Just turned 9mths old. We took a 2 hour road trip, and he was miserable, and that is when the straps hurt him. I would be afraid, VERY afraid if an accident had occured! DON'T Buy this seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great childseat","review":"I got this seat for my three month old son because I hate those infant seats. They just don't feel that secure. So after much looking I got this one because it is a three in one. I love it. I installed it with latch. It was very easy. I did have to put it behind the passenger side because my husband is tall. I was able to get it in very tight and it doesn't move. yeah! I love that it is a five point harness My son fits in it great. He is only 12 lbs. and there was no problem. I love that I can easily tighten and lossen the straps I don't have to rethread a thing. all I do is pull a strap or push a button. Great seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"We are very satisfied with this car seat. We have 3 car seats by this brand name. All have worked well. No complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use","review":"We bought this when our 8 months old grew too long for her infant seat. Although it comes with a video (which doesn't help in the car) the user's manuel is very vague so you kind of have to figure it out on your own. It doesn't recline enough for an infant (our daughter's now 1 year and I still wish I could get it to recline more), and if it's rear-facing the only way to adjust it is to unlatch it. Also, adjusting the straps is near impossible unless it's unlatched due to the positioning of the strap release. Oh, and forget about washing the seat cover or straps, they are hard to take off.I'm actually getting rid of this after only 4 months and am getting one that's easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible seat!","review":"This seat is terrible for rear facing. It will not recline the way it should even if you put your front seat up to your dashboard! It takes forever to install because you have to put it together and adjust everything before you even attach it to your car! The instructions are not very clear either. The puzzle buckle on the five point harness is a terrible pain with a wiggling baby and has very sharp edges that can scratch your babies legs for sure! After one day of trying and watching my five month old sons head bob when he fell asleep I took it back and bought the Triumph by Evenflo. It took about five minutes to install because it comes fully assembled and it fits in the proper recline position even with my SUV's seat all the way back! It is easier to get baby in and out too without any scary looking sharp edged puzzle buckle to hassle with. It just has a normal five point harness. Save yourself the hassle and do not buy this for a rear facing seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to install","review":"I bought this seat and spent an hour trying to install it in the rear facing position. I tried it with the latch and with the seat belt and either way the seat still moved around and would not stay reclined. I took it back the next day and bought the Britax Roundabout, installed it in about 5 minutes and it is very stable and comfortable for my 5 month old son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning this","review":"My 6 month old outgrew her infant seat, and we decided to get a convertible seat for each of our cars. I got this and the Britax Marathon at the store. Out of the two, I prefer the Marathon. The Cosco seat took forever to install on the LATCH, and will not recline at the 45 degree angle even with the base detached. Plus everytime my daughter has been in it, she screams until she is out or until she has thrown up. She doesn't do this in the Britax, which was a piece of cake to install. I'll be exchanging the Cosco seat for another Marathon. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking, Bad in Use","review":"I bought the seat and was impressed with all of the features it has, but. When I installed into my 4Runner, I had an almost impossible time getting the seat tight (don't have the latch system). After getting it installed, we put my daughter into the seat and tightened the straps. and the screaming started. the lower straps ride across the thighs of a baby and must be fairly tight for the upper body straps to be the proper tension. my daughter had a fit and wouldn't stop crying until we removed the seat and put her old back in. I went and bought the Evenflo Triumph 5 and she loved it, also easier to install.I would definately not recommend this to anyone who needs a rear facing seat. The seat should work just fine for children facing forward or who need a booster seat only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome episode!","review":"The Talisman in this one is cool, the Dragon, since it holds the power of combustion. Like the Sheep Talisman, this ends up in the hands of the bad guys, though in this case they get it early on rather than stealing it from the Chans like they did the last episode. Valmont decides to have some fun with it once he realizes just what it is capable of, and does not tell Shendu that the Dark Hand has gotten the Talisman.This is one pretty awesome episode which features a LOT of Valmont as he uses (and abuses) the power of the Dragon Talisman, and it leads to a showdown between him and Jackie illustrating the downfall of anger (Jade has her own bully to deal with at school as well) One of my favorite episodes of the season (and all time!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch animation and story-telling","review":"When this first aired back in 2000, I was initially disinterested because so many cartoons at that time were simply bad (and still are) I didn't really start to get into this till Season 2 started airing, and was surprised and impressed with the Season 1 episodes.I love the artwork and animation (even if a few character designs are wonky) There were lots of funny lines and great action sequences - Jackie Chan's kung fu moves are animated nicely and Season 1 had some of the best animation in the series)Overall the story focuses on twelve mystical talismans (one for each of the animals in the Chinese zodiac) and Jackie fighting the bad guys to make sure that they cannot abuse the magical power of the talismans. Between this and the second season, this cartoon was SOLID. Definitely worth watching for the writing and animation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mind you, I rated one star not for the show itself, but for this DVD and the few others that were released. These DVDs are missing a few minutes, often the teasers before the theme song comes on. This particular DVD is region 2, so buyer beware. I don't understand the need for regions, and was only able to play it on my computer (and it was also missing a few minutes of the episodes due to bad editing). Why is Amazon.com selling DVDs that weren't even designed to play on US DVD players?I am also befuddled at the lack of a complete season or series set of this wonderful series. It would be so awesome if a series boxed set was released, with each and every minute of the show accounted for, and the Ask Jackie bits as well. I'm not sure why the quality of these DVDs are so poor, or why only a few were ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would like to see more","review":"I would like to see more seasons of Jackie Chan Adventures.

These stories are mind blowing. Bradbury is the greatest short story writer of our time and maybe all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I highly recommend this book to any fan of Ray Bradbury's work, or to anyone who wishes to introduce his classic works into their library. He is a passionate visionary that writes not only about sci-fi, but his colorful writing style encapsulates the sometimes ineffable feelings that each and every one of us have had about every possible situation in life, and dare I say, in death. I always feel like a kid again when I read his books, I am taken away to warm, sunny Saturdays when I was still in awe of the newness of life. I can hardly force myself to read the works of others as I am convinced that no one can do with words the magic that Ray Bradbury has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not his best work","review":"I have to admit that this particular novel didn't really reach me. The story is told from the point of view of a 17 year old - but that doesn't excuse the fact that the novel struck me as being a poor attempt to emulate one of Heinlein's juvenile novels. For the first two thirds of the novel plot was somewhat predictable. Past that point, the plot went haywire - things happening for no reason, simply to allow the author to finish off a story he didn't seem to have a decent conclusion for. I found the work disappointing, and could not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!","review":"The straps are hard to adjust, the buckle in the front hits my baby in the thighs (ouch) and does not adjust.

My daughter spent 12 months in this seat and my experience with it was wonderful. It was very easy to detach from the base and the handle was very sturdy. The base provided a recline which was very helpful on long trips. The material was easy to clean and didn't stain easily either. I highly recommend this car seat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I liked this car seat. I only had two problems. In the beginning, it was hard to lock into the base, but after I figured out to go at it from an angle, I had no problems. Secondly, the shade visor cannot be taken off and washed. After a while, the shade visor gets pretty nasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looks, poor performance","review":"We recieved this car seat as a gift. We were initially very pleased because it is amazingly stylish for baby gear. The problems arrived when our little man did. He HATES it! The head/body support made him extremely uncomfortable- he would cry immediately upon being placed in it. We removed that. But he still cries as soon as the straps are fastened- something about them is very uncomfortable. We've tried loosening them, but there is not enough strap material to keep him safely fastened (it slips when there is too little). He's not that big a baby, but after only 3 months, we're going to have to buy a new seat! Also, the seat is enormous and difficult to carry compared with others. I don't recommend this seat at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire dept couldn't even install it!!","review":"We spent way too much money on the Eddie Bauer infant seat. I thought with a name like EB we would be very satisfied. Instead it was a nightmare. We own a newer Dodge Intrepid and no matter how tight we got the base in it would still slide around. We even brought it to the local Fire Dept that specializes in installing carseats and said this carseat is not safe in our car because it would slide. They even tried to use foam noodles and towels to help support it and that didn't even work. My advice to anyone looking for a carseat is no matter how bad you feel like a nag at the store, ask if you can take the model out to your car and see if it will fit before spending money on something that isn't safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Buy...not worth it.","review":"At first glace this car seat is very appealing. We bought because it was an Eddie Bauer and we really liked the pattern. We thought that buying an Eddie Bauer named product would be good quality, but we were wrong. It is very very poorly constructed and the doesn't always lock into the base very well. The hood is poorly made and very flimsy.We decided to return it before our daughter was born and went with a Graco car seat and have been very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to install","review":"I had a very difficult time trying to install the base in the car. No matter how tight I thought I had the seat belt, I could easily work it loose by rocking it from side to side. I spent 1 1/2 hours carefully reading the manual and then 2 hours trying to install it in 2 cars - a Nissan Pathfinder and a Ford Mustang. I called customer service at djusa and after waiting 30 minutes to talk to someone - they of course blamed me for how I installed it. I don't believe installing a car seat should be so difficult. No wonder 90% of them are installed incorrectly. This seat is too long to fit in a small back seat because it touches the back of the front seat - even when I push the seat so far forward that no one could sit there. The only way I could get a tight fit was to install the carrier without the base - and that eliminates all the convenience of a detachable base."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAFE????","review":"I bought this car seat with the stroller as a combo. I mistakenly made the assumption that since it was more expensive and carried the Eddie Bauer name, it would be top of the line. When we came home from the hospital, it literally took us 45 mins to fix the carseat adjuster on the bottom of the base so that he wasn't sitting straight up. I don't like how the lower straps snap, I think it pinches my baby's legs. The harness straps are also constantly coming out and I don't see how this would be safe if I got into a car wreck! We don't have much money because my husband is a stay at home dad and full-time student but we wanted to make sure our baby was the safest he could possibly be. I'm so disappointed with our purchase and am now out of quite a bit of money. I thought I had investigated all of the options and thought I was getting the best and safest! I was wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this product is very good","review":"I ordered this product for my infant daughter,and I'm very satisfied.I have not had any major problems with this product,the service was great recieved the seat in record time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets us by","review":"We placed this car seat on our registry because we thought that the Eddie Bauer brand would be of good quality, but the straps always slip after about a week of use. The visor doesn't stay up either-it's very flimsy! We did drive accross the country with our daughter at 3 months, and she was comfortable for the entire ride. Overall our daughter likes her car seat, but I question it's safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try it before you buy it","review":"The LATCH system on this car seat is wonderful--it is so easy to put seat in and out of car. The problem with this Eddie Bauer seat is that it takes me 4-5 tries to move the handle --it is super stiff and the red buttons on both sides have to be ALL THE WAY IN or it doesn't click. My 6'foot, 220 lb. husband claims he can move it in one try, but I don't think it should be something you battle with on a daily basis. If you want to purchase this seat, take it out of the box in the store and see how easily you can move the handle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfiedwithcarseat","review":"We bought this car seat to replace one that would not fit in the middle seat. Our son never cried in the other car seat. The only time he does not cry in this car seat is when we are moving. He is not comfortable in the seat when we are sitting still. The straps are not easily adjustable. You have to adjust them from the back whereas other seats have a strap in the front. The handle is straight across which makes it more difficult to carry. Also, the handle is very loud when it snaps into place almost always waking up our baby. I think there are better car seats out there for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter cried out in pain every time we put her in this!","review":"I hate this carseat. We registered for it (big mistake) & received it as a gift before our daughter was born. My husband & I installed it -- it took about 30 minutes -- when I was 6 1/2 mos. pregnant. We really liked it until we had to take our daughter home from the hospital. It took 4 people about 15 minutes to figure out how to properly adjust it -- and we did read the directions. The straps are way too short & extremely difficult to adjust. Our poor daughter cried every time we buckled her in. The straps just don't provide enough slack to comfortably put her arms through, and the puzzle buckle is a pain. Our daughter is less than 9 lbs. at 4 wks old & we finally gave up & got the convertible Britax Roundabout. The Roundabout is much safer, and although it's $199, it's worth every penny & lasts alot longer. Thank God we aren't causing our poor little girl pain anymore.Do not get this car seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad.","review":"We used this car seat for about a year.The color hides dirt and stains and overall was a good seat. However, the straps twist all the time and as if you don't have enough to do taking care of an infant you will also need to untangle them on an almost daily basis. We were never in an accident with this car seat and I believe that is the true test for a car seat.Consumer reports may be able to help with that info. This seat is heavy and my son was also heavy it was very hard for me to lug around. We purchased the Britax roundabout now that he has out grown the edie bauer and we LOVE IT! He is our second child and we have purchased five car seats the Britax is the best it is worth the outragous price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I wish I would have known more about what to look for in a car seat before we purchased this one.-The handle is very difficult to move and the loud noise it makes wakes our baby almost everytime we move the seat from the car.-The latching system requires quite a bit of coordination and strength- I did not have either after many nights with limited sleep.- The car seat is very heavy and difficult to carry the baby in. For the first few months I dreaded every trip with putting him in the car seat.-Our baby is now 4 months and 20 lbs- I am looking forward to getting a new car seat and never using this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not all about the name!","review":"Do not buy this car seat!

I receive more comments on the look and quality of this carseat than any previous carseats (I have 3 other children, he is #4!) The latch is tricky at first, but easy to use after you catch on. Took me a day or two to get it down! Once they are strapped in though - VERY secure! I am very comfortable with his safety in this carseat.I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful carseat and will be purchasing the upright Eddie Bauer seat after my son has outgrown this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good investment","review":"I would not give any stars to this item, but you have to put at least one. I would not recommend this car seat to anyone. Basically you are paying for the name and nothing else. The base and seat are very flimsy. You have to adjust the straps from the back of the seat which is very inconvenient and after strapping the child in it still doesn't feel secure. Also the canopy is worthless, the back part is not even connected to the seat, it hangs down and doesn't attach to anything. The worst part is that it does not snap into the base easily. You have to move it all around to get it into place. I received this car seat and the Graco Snugride both as gifts. I highly recommend the Graco seat for your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery drainer!!!","review":"My parents bought my son VideoNow Jr. for xmas and from today's date which is Jan. 29, 2005, I have been through 25 batteris thus far.

Although hearing some good points on unrealistic expectations I couln't believe my ears when I heard that \\"day care is the modern version of child abandonment\\" and that \\"feminists have messed up so many things\\"... The author seem to be suggesting to half of her radio audience to give up the double-income model and move to a little town in the middle of nowhere far away from all temptations... It makes me wonder what kind of relationship the author experienced with her own parents and I'm pretty sure I know what Freud would say about this... Overall quite disppointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Laura knows what she's talkin about","review":"I bought this for a friend so don't know what it's like but I do know Dr Laura writes a Mean-ing-ful book, with powerful examples to follow. In her not-so-sensitive, don't be a crybaby approach, she does present a good \\"case\\" for her advice and suggestions. She's quite arrogant, critical, impatient and cruel in her way of communicating to callers on Talk Radio as well as in her books, but much of what she says makes sense. She definitely favors men and blames women for the bad relationships that are described to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evergreen Advice!","review":"On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this book an eleven!

If you are married or single, the advice Dr. Laura despenses is timeless and well worth your investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Advice","review":"'Ten Stupid Things Couples Do to Mess Up Their Relationships' is Laura Schlessinger's best work. Her insights are profound and her prose is delightfully readable. All couples will benefit from Ms Schlessinger's knowledge. Particularly impressive is the final brief chapter, in which Laura recapitulates, in simple headings, the ten mistakes detailed earlier. On page 214, she writes, 'Let me summarise the ten stupid things couples do to mess up their relationships.1) Date2) Get engaged3) Get married4) Have a kid5) Have another oneSome people even do these things AGAIN, following divorce. It's a simple equation; 5 + 5 = 10.'This book is essential reading for couples everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"According to Dr. Laura, having sex with multiple people, having sex for fun, practicing S&M, practicing oral or anal sex, living with your significant other without being married and being sexually experimental are all horrible, terrible things that ruin relationships. In some cases, yes, these can ruin relationships but this book makes anyone who has ever done any of the above out to be a bad person. Dr. Laura's books are a waste of paper and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book","review":"Dr. Laura is a great author and host because she doesnt play the \\"politically correct\\" game. If you are looking for a book that will tell you that there are many paths to happiness this aint it. And if you want someone to tell you that you just have to be positive and assert yourself, Dr. Laura wont do it.Having a great relationship takes sacrifices -- biting your tongue, not gazing at others, cutting back on your personal persuits.

The cover said it was 3 hours long, but it was more like 2 1/2. I was a little disappointed with the brevity. The narration itself was expressive and easy to listen to.\\"Dr. Laura\\" admittedly does take some getting used to, with her strong opinions and old-fashioned standards. When I first starting listening to her radio show on Sirius, I couldn't believe how harsh she is with callers she doesn't agree with-especially the women. (She's totally against mothers who work outside the home and divorced parents who even entertain thoughts of another relationship before all their children are 18. I think it's great if mothers are able to be stay-at-home moms, but not everyone is able to do this.)That said, if you can get past her judgmental nature and are open to doing things differently to improve your relationship,she does offer some good advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The latest in her Ten Stupid Things series, this one about couples is a clunker!I ususally love Dr. Laura's writings. They tend to be down-to-earth guides on having a happier, less complicated life. But not this one.As I turned every page, I hoped for some of the great examples and wise teachings that I learned to expect from her other books. It is full of examples from her listeners, but it lacks the wisdom that should bring the examples into a meaningful thesis. The examples don't alway exemplify her points, and there are so many quotations from listeners that they lose their impact. Some even seem to contradict the very point she is trying to apply! About halfway through the book I wondered if Dr. Laura hadn't written the book just to clear out her \\"clever quotation\\" file.None of the good, simple advice on relationships, or passages about how good morals make good neighbors. Really, just a scrapbook of incohesive thoughts. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guidance for the clueless","review":"Read Dr. Laura and your life will be transformed as you accept a fundamentalist view of the universe where there are no greys and everything can be reduced to a simple black and white.

If you have a life and a mind, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Rush Linbaughish","review":"Any book that recommends the bible as a follow through is not truly addressing the issues but merely echoing conservative religious beliefs for relationships.

Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years. She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her. Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public. Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot? What Plot?","review":"As a history and Civil War buff, I looked for to reading Doctorow's novel for more than a year. Disappointment doesn't adequately describe my reaction to this book. The characters are without personality, the battle scenes are dismissed in paragraphs, not pages or chapters, and Doctorow's stream-of-consciousness is his apparent excuse for a plot. In summary...save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great, not bad either","review":"Rambling and disjointed The March slouches along. Much like Sherman's Army of the West itself. It is not Doctorow's best work, but it is also not his work. If you have liked anything of his before you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books from an already acclaimed author","review":"I wish I could go up to the people who gave this book a one or two star review and suggest to them that they read it again. This is an achievement! There are so many different characters and plots and timelines involved in this that it can get confusing for some, but it could not be more worth it. This is a story both big and little about a horrific event that has been captured in literature and on film in the past, but by focusing on extremely divergent characters Doctorow makes it so that you get a much more complete view of Sherman's March from all different points of view. One of his best books. Five big stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gruel","review":"I'm not a big Doctorow fan but the reviews were so good I thought I should read The March. It seems outrageous to say that it's a pleasant book about Sherman's march but that's pretty much what it comes to. Expecting a bracing, frightening and complex literary account of one of the most storied military events in American history, instead I read a mild-mannered young-adult novel which didn't for a minute ring true. Read Killer Angels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but...","review":"I just found it tiresome to read. Doctorow is an excellent writer but maybe a little self-important, feeling that he doesn't have to live by the rules of lesser minds. His conceit in casting aside quotation marks is really irritating; there's a reason they exist. I got tired of trying to figure out if the characters were saying something or thinking something. Ultimately I realized I no longer cared and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctorow's Weakest Book","review":"I have read all of Doctorow's books, and this was by far the most diappointing. It goes back and forth between the Union and Confederate armies, something I thought I would like, given the number of civilians who are suffering in our current \\"leader\\"'s Iraq war. But north or south, white or black, there was no character to identify with and root for or against. Most reader's know what happened through history class, so there has to be something new to hold one's attention. There is little. I agree with the reviewer who said it was actually a children's book. Sherman is not much in it, nor is any other character. The cleverest device was Coalhouse Walker who appeared in \\"Ragtime.\\" My own opinion is that this is the character who should have been focussed upon--a slave boy who 40 years later has success in New York City. I would not recommend this book. It was given to me as a gift, so I felt I had to whip myself through it. I actually felt myself skimming pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"While I'm not a Civil War buff, I would be willing to bet that there are better historical books written about this time and certainly, E.L. Doctorow has produced more memorable characters than are present here. People come and go, and none 'grab' you.The description of the horror and devastation are on so braod a level, that the reader cannot emotionaly identify.All in all, the book was a great disappointment to me, as I am a great fan of Doctorow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Doctorow know when to end a sentence ?","review":"Doctorow's initial sentence in his Civil War novel rivals the length in distance Sherman's army covered decimating the South. Is it flow of consciousness or simply poor syntax that prompted the author to string together 168 words,separated by 21 commas, before finally giving the reader a chance to breathe by mercifully inserting a period.This verbiage is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to piloting your way through this somewhat disjoined and cumbersome historical novel.It will take patience and persistence to complete this tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Considerable Waste of Time","review":"I read this book for my book group (who usually chooses good books) and found it to have little to its credit. It has a thin, disjointed plot, mostly weakly drawn, incomplete characters who come and go in a somewhat willy-nilly fashion, (many of them I was not quite sure why they were included at all) poor dialog (without so much as a single \\" in the entire book), more sentence fragments than an entire freshman English class could write, and no sense of motivation, place, or time.I read historical fiction expecting to find not facts so much as a perspective and an enhanced understanding of the period. What was it like to live at this time? How did events impact people? Who were these people, what was it like to be them, and how was it to live in their world? What did they think and feel about what was going on around them? Why did they do what they did? etc? I found satisfying answers to none of these questions in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor History","review":"I tried to read it just as a book. But when the author uses actual historical people it becomes more than that...it becomes a historical novel. In this instance the author has portrayed historical people not as they were...but rather perhaps as he sees them. As an amateur historian I see far too many distortions...which rather ruined the book for me. I guess I could not separate fiction from reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense","review":"I hate historical fiction. My own error in reading this nonsense. Does anyone know what historical characters thought or said? let,s muddy the waters more and create make believe people."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Plods","review":"Very disappointing. Numerous characters, none of which are developed, or interesting (to me), or ring true. They come and go in a seemingly random fashion, interact, and then go away. No sense that Doctorow has any feel for their internal lives, that they have any internal lives.If you are interested in the Civil War (as I am) almost any literate history is much better than this. Grant's autobiography, which is essentially a series of campaign dispatches, has ten times the life, human, historic,and literary, as this.If, as another reviewer implies, Doctorow was trying to emulate War and Peace he will have to deal with a very angry Tolstoy inthe next life. It just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can read his thoughts...","review":"I found this book to be tedious, and very hard to follow. The lack of quotation marks is very annoying, and makes the separation of dialog from description difficult (at least, for me). Also, as others have said, not at all historically accurate; Doctorow takes liberties that wouldn't be tolerated in others. But, because he's an \\"accomplished author\\", it's acceptable. All in all, a very tedious story, and a hard narrative to comprehend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable, yet flawed.","review":"The March is an okay read. I am glad I did not purchase the book myself though. Despite the rich historical background, Doctorow fails to pen a cohesive novel. Many of the characters, as well as the plot are poorly developed. Certain characters such as house slave Wilma are dropped from the plot in the middle of the book. The reader never has a chance to know what becomes of her as the March progresses. The ending too is trite and unrealistic for the time. It is as though Doctorow threw the ending together hurriedly in order to get the book to the printer. For a great Doctorow read, pick up \\"Ragtime.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself. It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING","review":"After approximately 70 pages I had to stop listening to this book. The prose is so florid it's practically tropical. It's as if Tennessee Williams was writing about the Civil War. I was greatly looking forward to some quality historical fiction. Unfortunately there isn't much of that. But it is full of soap opera characters who never are more than 2-dimensional, characters the author has rendered very badly. . When I had to hear about Sherman wondering (at length)if the dead dream, I sensed I was in big trouble. The author's approach is utterly baffling. A good author doesn't give General Sherman dopey things to think about. He provides a quality story w/ engrossing characters. There's none of that here sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Faulkner","review":"For those who read literature for literature's sake, Doctorow is our contempoary Faulkner--and more so; he has given us treasures which include critical insights into the adolescent years of our nation. The March is not 'about' the South, nor is it really 'about' the Civil War, though the peculiar forces of that particular war in that particular region play a role. The March is about individuals and the psychology of those who are captive/liberated by others, by their own means. It is a novel about the human condition in time of war, and as such it is brilliant, and it is timely; if there's one thing we need right now, it is to be reminded of what war does to individual lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fragmented soap opera","review":"A psuedo-romance novel set inside Sherman's march to the sea and beyond. The disjoined story lines lead to a fragmented novel that reads like the script from a daytime TV soap opera. There is little historical insight or significance; in fact, quite the opossite, with the fabrication of events that didn't happen(assination attempts of Sherman??). Not recommended for fans of the civil war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherman's march the skims the surface","review":"I never really got the feeling of outright horror while reading this book. Sherman's march across the South was a gemini state of brillance for the North and a near holocaust for the South. This book never really portrays that feeling. This is more of a 'made for tv' type of book. This needed to be harsher and more cruel."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MARCH to Nowhere","review":"I am a fan of Doctorow. I consider Ragtime, with its brilliant mix of fact and fiction, a clear window into the soul of late 19th century America. As an avid reader of military history, I was eager to find the soul of the civil war in Doctorow's newest creation, The March. My disappointment is on every level. The characters are shallow and often killed without any apparent narrative purpose. The war is presented as a cartoon backdrop without any insight into the stress of battle. I was neither happy nor sad at the end of the book, just disappointed that The March led to nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The March on CD","review":"as a long time reader of American history, the Civil War period is one of the most dramatic in US history. The March provides great insight into the day to day lives of soldiers, slaves and civilians during Sherman's march through the south. beautifully written and narrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Ragtime and Billy Bathgate were great novels. This one isn't. I was so looking forward to reading this as I am a student of Civil War history. Instead, The March is a confusing mish-mash of about two dozen characters that a reader can hardly remember as he/she gets deeper into the book. Compounding that - it's a hard book to read. Doctorow chooses not to use quotations when people are speaking, which forces me to re-read passages constantly so that I am in sync with the characters. General Sherman and a few others are constants throughout the book, and admittedly Doctorow has a flair for describing certain incidents. In the end, there are so many characters and so many banal passages where nothing ever happens, that finally 3/4 of the way through the book, I finally skipped to the last 10 pages just so that I could be done with it. I checked this book out of the library. I suggest you save your money and do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"soap opera","review":"The novel is made up of several intertwined narratives, following the lives of many characters. The events take place during Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas. The book starts out with some promise, but the characters never come alive. Neither are there any compelling historical perspectives. In the main quite predictable, the book is a good alternative to passively watching television."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"this novel is not very good...weak on characterization, poor writing, hard to follow at times. find yourself another book on the civil war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, predictable, disjointed...","review":"I had high hopes for a good read on the \\"March\\", but when I started to read this book, I found it lacking a certain depth and style that I like to see in this type of historical fiction. It lacks excitement and I cound not stay interested in it. Perhaps if he devoted more time to develop each vignette in a lot more detail it would be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"E.L., Say It Isn't So.","review":"When I saw this book was rated 5-stars, my head exploded. If you're curious about the civil war, read Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels\\" or Kantor's \\"Andersonville\\"; if you're curious about Doctorow, read \\"The Book of Daniel\\" or \\"Ragtime\\"; if you want fluff, read a novel by a woman with three names or \\"The March\\". What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one.","review":"If you want to read good historical fiction I would suggest that you read \\"Widow Of The South\\" by Robert Hicks and skip this one. I have read both and the \\"Widow\\" is much superior, in my opinion. \\"March\\" jumps from one scene to another and does not really generate much interest in any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thin boring book","review":"If you are E.L. Doctorow, you get published in New York Cityand you will get lauded as he has been for this book. That doesnot make it a fine and compelling read. The plot and characters and scenes are known and as predictable as the ending. The hoopla for this book comes from the New York literary world's appreciation for his past writings. Just like Hemingway's Nobel for \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" Awards for past services rendered. Why not a watch !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I believe E.L. Doctorow is one of the finest American authors. However \\"The March\\" isn't half as good as his \\"Sweet Land Stories\\" or \\"Cold Mountain\\" by Charles Fraizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"If this book does not receive every major literary award in existence, the author will have been cheated. One of the best books about the American Civil War I have ever read. I thought I would never find another book about that era that would have the same impact on me as \\"The Killer Angels\\". I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"I couldn't even finish this dime-store romance novel. The protagonist is Pearl, a 13 yr old black former slave girl who \\"looks\\" white, puts on a drummer-boy uniform over her dress and becomes a confidant of General Grant. Of course General Grant is too stupid to notice Pearl is a girl. As you can imagine, I am recommending you don't waste your time & money on this historical fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, tedious need I say more","review":"I know I should not have bought this book. My past experience with E.L. Doctorow's literary works have been less than enjoyable. His writing is consistent; dull and tedious. Since my college days, about 50 years ago, I have always finished every book that I started to read. There must be something worthwhile in every context. There may have been in this book, but it certainly wasn't in the joy of reading. I was taxed to finish reading this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Another reviewer started out his review with the question: Did we read the same book? Those are my exact sentiments to the reviewers who praised this work.Doctorow has always been a difficult read to me. Although I loved the musical RAGTIME, I found the book difficult to read. At that point I gave up on his books. Had I taken that pattern into consideration, I would not have bothered with THE MARCH.As usual Doctorow has a \\"shotgun\\" - scattered approach to his characters. You get a little bit of various characters who eventually interact. As a result, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters, except perhaps Pearl, the mulatto former slave.I'm sure that THE MARCH will become a movie. Sean Penn will be great as Arly and Hallie Berry will play Pearl. The screen writer will tighten up the story as did the writer for Ragtime, the musical.General Sherman makes limited appearances in the story.The only strong point of the novel is the demonstration of the brutality of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same novel?","review":"This novel is a great disappointment. It is mostly pretense and stereotype. This is no Ragtime. Doctorow's characters are flat and tasteless as are many of the pedestrian musings they are prone to. The March is not a tapestry of rich and vibrant characterizations nor is plot driven. There are no surprises, no great revelations, not even much of a story. It is more cotton candy than even mind candy. It is at best a callow Gone With the Wind. Doctorow has not written a story; rather he has just filled pages. Find something better. What novel did the other reviewers read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book is simply unreadable. I agree with the other lower stars so there is no need to reiterate what they have said. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike Three for Doctorow","review":"This was the third - and last - Doctorow book for me. This one was basically unbelievable. For example, at a time when the photography was a completely new phenomenon, Dr. Wrede is predicting \\"Someday .... we will photograph through the body to the bones.\\" \\"We will replace lost blood.\\" What a visionary! And how about this dialect from an illiterate slave: \\"I have the whip marks of that life forever after across my back to testify that I have endured.\\" \\"A man who owns his own land is a free man.\\" There is more, but this didn't sound anything like a slave talking.

Gave me a sense of actually being in the South during the horrible devastation, and a lot of the emotion of the southern people,both rich and poor, white and black, plantation and shanty! General Sherman came off as more of a human being, and less of a monster than I thought. And Pearl, the half black slave, was the focal point of the book!! Marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Snap Shot of the Civil War","review":"This book gives a good snap shot of the impact of the Civil War on civilians as well as the line of thinking of the generals and the common soldiers.

If you are interested in the Civil War, I think you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book was so basic as to be worthless to me. I bought the 'two' book package that is often advertised.The other book is called \\"Great Jobs for Criminal Justice Majors\\" and is more in-depth and helpful.

She does have a clever use for language and vivid imagery, so I can see why she won the Flannery O'Connor award, but other than that I can't agree with the praise of previous posters. Many of her stories seem a bit hokie and too cutsie for my taste. The vagueness of her prose when trying to illuminate the thoughts and feelings of her characters substitute depth with nonsense that drags on and on and on.I hope to see bigger and better things from Ms. Wells, and I wish her the best.Buy some books by Aldous Huxley if you want experimentation and existential depth.

There is very little good new music being released. You probably like this more than you should because on a relative scale of new realeases it is near the top. On an absolute scale it is probably 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album","review":"I got myself hooked on \\"Take Me Out\\" after hearing it once. It was stuck in my head for days, so I went out and bought the album.My first impression was that this was a local quality band, and didn't care for many of the tracks. But as I was driving from Florida to Virginia, I had alot of time to give it a chance and I'm glad I did.I like the album from beginning to end. Overall, Franz is not as tight as they could be and I feel they try to cover up their lack of experience with too much distortion. I dig it anyway, and hope they have another album in the future with a more mature sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Art Rock","review":"These Scottish lads sound like the descendents of David Byrne and the Talking Heads to me - and I like it! It is nice to have something to combat the doldrums of the \\"Nickelback Era\\" where many of the current crop of largely interchangeable modern rock bands seem to struggle to find some personality. This is a great album, and highly suggested summer listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scottish Rock Superdebut","review":"Bump. Bump. Bump. Wicked bass beats and addicting guitar riffs are the order of the day when pop-rock outfit Franz Ferdinand are cooking up the tunes. With their self-titled debut, the band have served up eleven truly fantastic tracks that are sure to keep you in beat. The first single, ?Take Me Out?, is a dancetastic song featuring confident beats and brain-destroying guitars. Other stand outs include ?This Fire?, a manic song with 70?s pop-rock influences; ?Jaqueline?, the powerfully loud intro song; and ?Auf Achse?, a melancholy love song with, surprise, some pretty upbeat music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulousness and gorgeosity!","review":"I can't remember the last time I heard a song, really liked it, bought the album, really liked it, and continued listening to the album over and over for, like, three months in a row. I usually don't like new music right away, or if I do, I lose interest in it after a few weeks. Franz Ferdinand has proven that I can be won over! This album kept me company on a road trip from Sacramento to L.A. and back. F.F.'s style is a sort of funk indie disco that is to the ear what a pouch of Pop Rocks is to the mouth. The disco beats give the album a danceable quality, but the loopy guitar work, bassy rhythms and casually playful vocals provide tons of interesting texture. The songs are fairly short, well-crafted, and just plain fun to listen to. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely addicting. Maybe moreso than most drugs.","review":"I purchased this CD when it was still an import back in March, and honestly, it hasn't left my CD player since. Every track is a killer; I don't think it gets any better than this! I would recommend this to anyone, and I can guarantee that no matter who you are, you'll be dancing and singing along. And I don't even think I could choose a favorite from this album, as every song is equally as great as the last. An amazing debut from an amazing band. Go buy this. Now. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is derivative bad? Hell, no.","review":"Laser gun guitars, maudlin art-school lyrics, keyboards, glitz, vocals that evoke Morrissey and Morrison, a touch of homoeroticism, a gallon of speed.Every song is fast and vibrant. This is rock for people who like to dance, but who think Jet sucks. Fabulous debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the latest in a long line of recent throwaway bands","review":"Franz Ferdinand is without a doubt one of the most horrendous discs to pelt my eardrums in years. What makes it worse is the fact that outlets such as MTV are touting them as, for example, \\"Buzzworthy\\". The problem with such practices is that it seems every band to emerge in the past two or three years which doesn't sound like Creed is labeled this way.Bands such as The Strokes or The White Stripes aren't doing anything for music other than sounding different from Blink 182 and Britney Spears. They're not necessarily good bands. They're only different from the other crap that we've been abused with in recent years. The music industry is in a funk and we're being punished because of it with bands such as Franz Ferdinand.On the other hand, Franz Ferdinand's music isn't THAT bad. It just sounded a lot better in 1983 when it was something new and performed by Duran Duran."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acchh Pleeez!","review":"I'm always astonished how certain kinds of music can create such a buzz and be so incredibly bad. I don't think I've ever seen a band that had so many comparisons made to other bands. When I saw a review mention The Jam, I nearly lost it! How do you dare even consider comparing the genius writing of Paul Weller to this stuff? I agree with several other reviewers that this music will be forgotten in a very short time and another review that comments on the incredibly weak lyrics.Sometimes people try too hard to act like they're on top of the latest music trends and if that means endorsing mediocre music so be it.I guess it is a good sign that more people are searching for a true alternative to the mainstream crapola but when something is compared to 40 different bands and still isn't as good as any of them... you do the math."},{"rating":"1","title":"Influences?","review":"Everyone forgot the actual source material for this band... the late great scottish band Josef K... try their record The Only Fun In Town which was reissued awhile back and be amazed at the gall of these nitwits who lift an entire sound without adding a single element while their clueless audience eats it up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"Sadly I just don't get it. Every song sounds the same. To be honest this album is just all too predictable, boring and ...yes plain dull. Original you are joking. A bit of Radiohead a lot of Suede and a large dose of post punk Brit Pop thrash. Listening to this truly was painful. Inane lyrics and a screeching sound to put your teeth on edge. To me yet another case of hype overpowering any sense of musical judgement. Everyone to their own I guess. I haven't seen them live and that's the acid test. Perhaps I am getting old and cynical but I think a decent tune or melody is a useful ingredient in a song!! Nope, I just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique+Different Sound","review":"It has the slightest hint of sexy edge beneath all the poppiness, or maybe I'm just reading into it too much.

I love listening to art-house bands like this and pretending to be smart right along with them. Their faux-art music videos and angular guitar work allow me the freedom to make my friends think I'm smarter than them...too bad they won't hang out with me anymore because they're at least smart enough to realize how boring Franz Ferdinand is.

It's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEIR SINGLE IS A RIP-OFF","review":"I can't believe I'm the only person I know who noticed that the main riff, which carries the entire song, of \\"Take Me Out\\" is a blatant ripoff of Led Zep's \\"Trampled Underfoot\\". I'm so tired of bands becoming popular by stealing old music and re-releasing it to people who aren't old enough (or are far too lazy/stupid) to have heard it the first time around. I have a huge problem with bands becoming famous by stealing other people's work, and it surprises me that no one else I know has noticed this none-too-subtle musical theivery.

They were good enough to make me buy the entire album.You might have heard \\"Take Me Out\\" on the radio. That song is representative of the remainder of the album.

Interpol \\"Slow Hands. http://www.matadorrecords.com/interpol/music.htmlsounds a lot like \\"darts of pleasure\\" What they did was take the goth and dark sound of Interpol put a lot of pop hooks on the songs and call it party rock , sounds like the bizzaro nsyncAnd the name of song number five \\"Auf Ashce\\" partly copied from the group the german group Rammstein complete posers which they also have copied from with the heavy riffs listen to \\"Ich Will\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break","review":"1 good song (Take Me Out) does not a great band make!And by the way what the hell is a homoerotic dance punk bliss anyway?

I heard people in subways play better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good CD!!","review":"I HATE when people dislike music just because it's mainstream and they liked the band before it was on MTV and TRL. Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands and I'm thankful they were on TV or else I probably would have never heard of them. If you're a fan you should be happy a good band has made it big. Like a lot of people I bought this CD because I heard their hit single \\"Take Me Out\\" but when I listened to the CD I was surprised to find that, even though \\"Take Me Out\\" is a great song, there were so many that were even better! But this CD, it really is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"When i first heard \\"Take Me Out\\", I knew this was a band I had to check out. This first album does not disappoint. Although they draw heavily from the sound Interpol has minted so well, they are unique in every other aspect of their sound. Some of the best track, including Take Me Out, are Jacqueline, Darts of Pleasure, Dark of the Matinee, and the hilarious (and catchy!) Michael."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"We needed a band like Franz Ferdinand, too pop to be indie, and too indie to be pop.GREAT album, Michael is the best track, for it shows how much fun the boys are having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take this album out!","review":"Ok, it is official. The new sound of alternative rock is to sound like punk/modern rock bands from the late 70's to the early/mid eighties. The Stills sound like Joy Division, and now Franz Ferdinand sounds like the Talking Heads. Even the video for \\"Take Me Out\\" screams Talking Heads. This is not bad because I grew up listening to this type of music, and I would rather listen to it even if it is recycled. These top 40 pop songs and boy bands of today are so annoying that to me listening to Ferdinand is a pure blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ich heisse Superphantastisch!","review":"It's excellent to see a band like Franz Ferdinand break onto the scene when most other bands are either mind-blowingly depressing or all too untalented. Franz Ferdinand seems to be, on the surface, a mix between Interpol and The Strokes, with some 80s nostalgia thrown in. The lyrics are unenlightening, but this record isn't about songwriting prowess--it's full of great melodies and riffs that make this LP addictive. The 2nd and 3rd tracks, \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" and \\"Take Me Out\\", are definitely the highlight, although the inclusion of obscure and nonsensical German in \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" is a good laugh: Ich heiße Superphantastisch / Ich trinke Schampus und Lachsfisch = \\"My name is superfantastic, I drink champagne and salmon.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"finally! some decent music from the UK!","review":"this album has been named \\"album of the year\\" many times, and i don't think they are far off.the best songs are obviously \\"matinee\\" and the catchy single that got them noticed: \\"take me out\\". this is a totally different kind of music than has been around recently, but this change is good! they show that the uk can actually produce good artists, not complete rubbish, like the stuff that has been released recently.i can't wait for their next album to come out. excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped Garbage","review":"I love the songs Take Me Out and Auf Asche, but for the most part this album blows, and the hype is completely unjustified.

Unfortunatly for the world It was a horrible band by the name of \\"The Strokes\\" who everyone things is so \\"Innovative, underground\\" that it makes one want to vomit just hearing it.Anyway, this album is just a rip-off of anything that looms in the underground world of music that is good.If you want \\"Dance-Rock\\" listen to The Faint, or Q And Not U.

A return to great 80s Brit pop.'Take me out' is simply awesome with it's change in tempo from twangy rock to stomping beats. It starts off as a gentle rocker, which then progresses into a stomping rocker about either taking me out (as in shoot me) or as in take me out on a date.The lyrics are clever and largely innuendo laden; 'Take me out' and 'Michael' (about dancing with a guy, Michael, so sexy!..) for instance.Other gems are the rocking 'Jaqueline' (which starts off with some gentle crooning before exploding), '40 feet',Tell her tonight', 'The dark of the matinee' and 'Darts of pleasure'.Can't wait for the follow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"I bought this album before \\"Take Me Out\\" had hit the radio and I was disappointed from the beginning. Being a fan of the BritPop/Rock scene I thought I'd found a new gem, but this album is nothing but a boring, ho hum effort. I don't understand why this album has garnered so much attention and critical aclaim. The only standout track is \\"Take Me Out\\", and the rest did nothing to inspire me or really even catch my attention. I had a tough time \\"getting into\\" the album and gave up after 3 or 4 plays through. Franz Ferdinand just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why ipods are so popular","review":"This CD is terrible. I bought it hoping that it would rock like the single, but the rest is moody, meandering, poorly produced and sung work. Moody is fine if it's Massive Attack or Joy Division, but not if it's a typically bad Cure cd, as this resembles. I had to check the credits to see if, as is often the case, someone different produced the single, the excellent \\"Take Me Out\\", while some unfocused, art school novice did the rest. But that isn't the case, so I don't know what accounts for the difference. Either way, I'm trading it in for the CD single, as I just don't want it on my shelf. It's that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I am not sure if this cd has changed my life, except to make it much more enjoyable.

On this recording, movement three is great, and at 9 minutes it is about the longest clarinet solo available for this quartet. The other two movements, however, are way too short. Movement five is 4 mintes shorter than the EMI release and movement eight is 3 minutes shorter than the Haitnik rendition. It's not because repeats were not taken, it's because it's played way too fast which ruins the mood of this austere work. Get the RCA Victor recording with Serkin on piano or the Haitnik.

The only accessory that actually stays in the action figure's hand while you use it is the ball on the chain for the Penguin. Other than that, this set is a good start to a Batman action figure collection. The accessories do work, just not while the figures are holding them.

Do not fear the opening 32 minute track named 'On Earth', because it's an artist like Woob who knows how to pass the time away seemlessly with smart vocal samples and complimentary percussion. The track 'Wuub' floats purposely forward with a slow lazy beat and calming female vocal sample. However, the pure gem on this release is the glorious 'Odonna', where soft synth ambience starts the track and is taken over by engaging dialog from a film long forgotten. Then a glorious choir style vocal sweep (you have to hear it to appreciate it) floats on until the track subsides. Fantastic track from a fantastic release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ambient music you'll never get","review":"I heard the track \\"Odonna\\" on SomaFM Radio and was stunned, it was so unlike anything I'd ever heard. I've tried to track this album down ever since and have discovered that it is extremely rare. I have been occasionally searching for it over the last year, to no avail. One might be able to buy a copy on eBay for $100+, but otherwise forget it. It should be available on iTunes or something, but the label that originally produced the album is defunct, so the copyright is in limbo, ne'er to be rescued, with the label's former employees being the ones selling the only existing discs on eBay.If anybody finds a copy, post that information here for God's sakes.Edit: Update December 21, 2009.

I don't normally finish a book if it hasn't caught my interest within the first few chapters, but I decided to give this one more of a chance since it won the Christie Award. I truly wish I hadn't wasted my time. In the words of the first reviewer, it was \\"a long, rambling first-person account\\". This was the LONGEST book I have ever read. It just seemed to never end. And, the poetry excerpts and long-winded accounts made the story seem to drag on even more. I don't know too many people who want to read about poetry when they are reading a book of fiction.The plot overall, was a good one. It just could have been over in ten pages, versus 350."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A disappointment - long, wordy, and just plain old boring. The book is riddled with snatched of poems forcefully jammed into virtually every page - just crammed throughout the book as if the reader has no knowledge of poems at all, let alone recognize the meaning of them. I found this rather insulting (and haughty). The author herself comes right out several times indicating the patience required to keep going with the story, which was tough because it's one bunny-trail after another and difficult to simply keep interested. Each of Turner's books have been consecutively worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like her others","review":"I, too, thought Turner's latest book was a bit on the boring side and not as good as her other books. I found myself annoyed at the poetry throughout the book and thought it took away from the story of which was already hard to follow.

Zoe finds the body of Cassandra Dunne, a local environmental activist, who has fallen, or been pushed, from the tree in which she took up residence to protest a new development that threatens the blue spotted newt.While Zoe tries to find a murderer, she wrestles with jealousy and worse fears as her husband, Billy, is drawn back into the rock and roll life that led to his earlier drug addiction and financial ruin.Everyone has secrets that are slowly peeled away.

If your library doesn't have it, they can probably get it through an Inter-Library Loan. You may not really need to own this book unless you are sewing for quite a few people.

The sound quality is not great and I was surprised that the loudest setting was fine to fill my bedroom but that was about it. Using it outside on the patio with a group of any size doesn't really work and it doesn't really even fill a larger room.Also the remote did not work at all and just ended up sitting on my desk and never being used.It takes C batteries if you don't want to plug it in and the battery life left something to be desired.Overall this dock works ok and looks nice but I would not buy again unless the price was discounted around the $50 range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dosent charge","review":"This product states it charges iPod 4th generation - it dosent unless it was made after February of 2007 - which mine was not - I sent it back to the manufacturer for one made after Feb 2007.

This one works really well, is a lot cheaper than most of the decent docks that I've seen. You have to make sure the sound settings on your iPod are correct or the audio can come out just a little bit fuzzy. However, I do wish it had a clock on it. I was also a little disappointed that it didn't come with batteries for the back. You can still listen to it without batteries, you just have to plug it in which can be a pain if you want to listen when you aren't around an outlet. I love that it supports shuffle, has a radio and presets and the remote is cute!.

Owning a Jwin iLuv i277, I was happy with the somewhat cheap products the company puts out. From what I gathered from other reviews the major weak points are the sound quality isn't the best since the speakers are on only 2 inches and ipod fits too loosely in the cradle. One the first point they are somewhat correct. There isn't lots of bass and the sound distorts a little at the high end of the volume dial. On the second it was as wrong as it could be (at least in my case). I have a video and nano ipod and they fit snuggly and dont come free when moving around with the unit. The only other small minus is that the unit has a power brick electrical plug, but overall a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little machine!","review":"I purchased this ipod player about two months ago. Presently, it is in my office. For the price, it is a great little machine. I have had no problems with it. The quality of the music is very good, considering the price.

But because the price was so cheap, I bought two. I was quite pleasantly surprised by this product. It gets very loud and the sound quality is fantastic without any distortion no matter how loud you turn up the volume. The remote control is a big PLUS!!! My Ipod is always charged and ready to go using the dock. I am so glad I waited and didn't buy the Bose sound system for $300. During the Holidays Target had the Bose system on display so you could hear how it sounds. I think this much cheaper unit sounds just as good as the Bose. So if you're looking for an inexpensive sound system for your Ipod that sounds great, get this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasantly surprised","review":"I purchased this about 3 months ago and I absolutely love it. I bought it to use in my darkroom which is a small space and it is perfect. I am really big on stereo systems. I don't think that it is worth listening to music if it doesn't sound good. When I was thinking about getting a speaker system I did a lot of research, when I decided to go with this one I wasn't expecting too much. But I was blown away by the sound, it definitly goes a lot louder than I expected. Now granted it isn't the best but for the size and the price I can't complain. There are however two things that I would change about it. The base sound, it just doesn't sound the way I like but you can't expect too much from a portable speaker system, and I think that it would of been better if they put seaking buttons on the machine, its fine if you have the remote with you but if its not around then you have to navigate on the ipod itself which gets a little annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made---look for something more solid","review":"When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time). The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it. I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs). This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry level PLC book","review":"The material covered in this book is great for an entry level class in PLC programming. This appears to be the intent of one of the authors (Robert Filer), having been instructed by him directly using this material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Thin","review":"For all its faults as a novel, The Blue Flower gets its prose right -- page after page of happy perfection. And I think Ms. Fitzgerald's rendering of the period German -- and the feel of that rare, long-dead cultural milieu -- into English, is absolutely perfect. That said...watch out! The novel is either a) too short; or b) short of adequate raw material. Ms. Fitzgerald's task was daunting -- how to make interesting this story of two star-crossed, half-formed provincial children in 18th century Germany. I didn't get a feel for Novalis's art (was there any really?) or his commitment to Sophie (notice he wasted no time after her demise in betrothing another!) or what they felt for each other (the little Sophie limned in this story would have preferred a cute warm hedgehog). Nor did I apprehend any calls to issues so often encountered in the humanities. Give dis one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated","review":"I kept reading this novel, hoping that the conclusion would reveal the motivation behind the actions of the main protaganist and the people around him but I came away disappointed. Characters seemed to drift in and out of the novel, revealing little about what they do or are about. The epilogue could be made more poignant if only the reader could connect with the characters at some level but this was made difficult by the author's inability to reveal the motivations about the characters. The positive side to this novel is the brief exploration of European aristocracy in the 17th Century. Check out Penelope Fitzgerald's Booker Prize-winning Offshore instead where the characters are rich and heart-warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccable scholarship;compellingly told","review":"Penelope Fitzgerald engages the reader immediately with the odd behavior of quirky historical characters. Short, rich chapters make the reading easy, while strongly drawn psychological studies draw the reader in. In the end a knowledge both spiritual and intellectual of the poet Novalis leaves one deeply satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its funny to see that people either love or hate this book..","review":"The Blue Flower is a sad and funny book. Ms. Fitzgerald has written a wonderful novel besides her other one named Offshore, in \\"The Blue Flower\\", she has created a character to explore the meaning of love & loss, poetry and life. This book contains fierce intelligence and perceptive characterization-a must read I must say... its not easy to understand this book, but once you do, you'd enjoy this book as much as I did =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Form meets content: excellent result","review":"Like others, I bought Fitzgerald's book based on readers' comments, and I'm glad I did. What is striking is not only how well the historical and literary forms are woven together, but the structure of the novel. Stylistically, content becomes form here. It has the feel, prose of a novel of its times, and captures the fanciful flights of imagination and bourgeois thinking of the times. The attention to detail domestically, the preoccupations with money, chores, class separations are all key ingredients of the novel. Metaphysics and ideas aside, the book holds its own quite well. Marvelously entertaining, I found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissapointment!","review":"I purchased this book with eagar anticipation after reading several highly favorable reviews. I was so dissappointed with the story that I could not even finish it.The historical content was boring.

I haven't read her other books and have no intention to. There so many other superb works out there to read so don't waste your time on this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it is a masterpiece","review":"This is a book that captures a time and place and sensibility that is vastly different from our own.

What a disappointment! It was a quick enough read, and not uninteresting, but the characters were underdeveloped and I never understood what made Sophie so beguiling. I won't remember this book a year from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Impressionistic -- Leave that to Artists","review":"The Blue Flower is supposed to be an award winning book, but it is certainly one of the most disappointing pieces of \\"literature\\" that I've ever read. The writing is beautiful, even sometimes lyrical, and creates an impressionistic picture of its time, place, and characters. But, it is too impressionistic. While I think I understand something of the main character and even, perhaps, his feelings about Sophie,I reached the end of the book and said to myself: who cares? Normally, when I've read a good fictional account of a real-life person, the fiction almost always inspires me to either seek out more fictional accounts about that person or to seek out a biography. The Blue Flower left me hoping that I'd never come across Novalis! I'm sure that cannot be what the writer intended. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz....","review":"I'm desperately trying to get through this book. It's full of German language and history...not a bad thing but makes it quite difficult to follow. Thus far (nearly halfway through the book), I have yet to find anything compelling to keep me reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I could NOT for the life of me get into this book. I found the writing to be convoluted and confusing -- so much so that I couldn't follow what was happening. After about 60 pages, I finally gave up and never finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another pretentious Booker choice","review":"Seriously folks, if the Booker Prize panel hadn't chosen this as a winner, would it have received such favorable worldwide reviews? This book is really an extremely slight novel masquerading as a serious piece of literature. I read it all the way through only because I couldn't believe that it was really going to continue being so bad--it never improved! A HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half as interesting as the ratings suggest","review":"On the strength of the ratings and the fact that she won the Booker I bought the book. It really wasn't an interesting read and the character development seemed pretty poor. I, like many of the other reviewers, wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for it to end","review":"I wanted to like this book -- really. I tried and tried to until I got about 3/4th of the way through, then I had to own up to being bored. I wish I could have just appreciated the quality writing, but I couldn't get past dull characters and a slow plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Flower","review":"This book was not as interesting as I thought it would be the characters were not as exciting. The characters in the story were easy to relate to, but there could have been more drama, and more exciting things happening. The story is very boring at first then towards the middle there is a little excitement, but still not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this to be a disapointing book It's been lauded as bringing an earlier German period to life, but I don't find it more convincing than other novelists. The writing is terse, leaving too much to the imagination, and there is not enough details about the characters to care much about them. It portrays the early life of genius student Fritz von Hardenberg, before becoming the famous Romatic poet Novalis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental","review":"An interesting book about love. The reviewer who comments on the feminine character being boring is correct, but love rarely has to do with mutual admiration.The word for that is friendship, or partnership.Just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendously overrated","review":"In my opinion, this book is/was over-rated. While Fitzgerald is a decent writer and many of the subcharacters in this novel have interesting lives and one-liners, this book does not add up to a satisfactory read. My fantasy is that after spending a few years translating Novalis's writings, Fitzgerald felt compelled to put her knowledge to good use -- there's nothing wrong with this, but it just didn't work for me. I didn't know who Novalis was when I started this book, and I had virtually no interest in finding out who Novalis was by the time I finished this book -- I didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointly shallow","review":"I had just finished rereading Thomas Mann's BUDDENBROOKS, in which he uses German titles and place names but without the confusion I found in THE BLUE FLOWER where I had to go back to find out who a character was or where a place fit into the novel. The book had no real plot, one dimensional characters and what is most important no real sense of who Novalis was as a poet or why he was admired in his time. There was no real description of Sophie, except that her hair was neither brunette nor blonde, and her stupidity was apparent from her journal entries and the few letters she wrote. There were some nice turn of phrases and descriptions but that did not compensate for the lack of interest I had in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Researche, nothing ventured and little gained.","review":"I don't know what Fitzgerald wanted \\"to get at\\" in this book. There is not enough \\"life\\" and \\"living\\" for us to feel the time and either live in it, or evaluate it for it's Romantic Follies. There is little of the poetic of Novalis, Goethe etc, but some \\"understated signposting\\" of philosophical interests and perspectives. One feels that there were better books out there this year that were deserving of awards. This book never opened its arms wide enough or peered deep enough to gain a place in our affections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging characters kept my attention. Lovely prose.","review":"The writing is extraordinary. Books allow me to experience different perspectives and widen my horizons. As I entered the world of \\"The Blue Flower\\" I recaptured that joy of reading (the last few books I read weren't very good). The characters were not predictable and I cared about them. During the day, at work, I pondered what would happen next. That is how I know I love a book. It engaged me when I least expected it (when I wasn't reading) and I was sad when the final page was turned. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking... and a great historical snapshot!","review":"We read this book for our book club -- not only did we all enjoy reading it, but we loved discussing the details of the characters' relationships as well as the numerous little language nuggets found throughout the book. Fitzgerald does an amazing job of integrating the historical facts with beautiful descriptions of everyday common scenes. The beginning is a little slow and disjointed, but once you get past the first 40-50 pages everything comes together and you really begin to understand the essence of the poet/philosopher portrayed in the story and his friends and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy read.","review":"I had so much trouble getting into this book it was painful. It is written about a time most of us are not familiar with and in a way that it is not embracing. Not a good choice for the beach or the train."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"I wanted to like this book. I knew it would be a hard read and was up for the challenge. I just didn't like it very much. After reading one of the amazon reader reviews, I feel I have a little better understanding of the book, but it still didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I was so relieved to read that other people found this book boring. I found myself reading on the train and after about two pages would be nodding off. I just couldn't get interested in any of the charcters. The whole book made no sense whatsoever. I felt like I was missing something because I kept reading how great this book was. Be prepared to analyze every word if you attempt to read this tedious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, Shallow & Boring.","review":"If one was trying to fight the old ennui one would not attempt to read The Blue Flower. Why do Fitzgerald's characters behave so? No attempt to explain their actions or emotions is made. What made Sophie so attractive? She seems to be devoid of personality & lacking in either charm or beauty. Frederica seems the most interesting character. She did, after all, have the intelligence not to be able to understand the parable of the blue flower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...do not buy it","review":"This book was one of the dullest I have read. The characters are uninteresting, and the story tedious, Despite what other reviews have said, the book did not make me think about any deeper issues. other than the time and money I lost on it. Frankly, there is nothing in it worth remembering. I only have thrown away two books in my life; this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"There I was, trapped on a train, with nothing to read but this book. The reviews had been favorable, so I dove in. Conclusion: it was mind-numbing, with characters who just weren't interesting. I've read 1000 page novels that flowed more quickly and evoked deeper introspection than this one. Clearly, I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome science fiction book.","review":"Alyssa and her best friend, Caitlin, are on a dinosaur dig inthe midwest. After some eggs are dug up, strange occurances andattacks begin to take place. None of the attacked people die - they all become ill, and then vanish. Alyssa begins to wonder - are the victims turning into dinosaurs? Read this exciting book to find out. It was a fun, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME,CREATIVE, ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love the idea of dinosours coming to life. At times in this book I wanted to laugh, others cry. Alissa (main charecter) is smart to think something is going on when an odd fern grows in the middle of the desert. This book has great twists like how Caitlin, Alissas best friend, becomes a dinosour. Just the right amount of adventure, horror, and fanstey. If you liked Mr. Peel's work with \\"Diadem\\" you're going to LOVE this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This CD has one of my favorite Prokofiev's pieces, the \\"Montagues and Capulets\\". I just love the perfect balance of timing and volume at the beginning, it gives me goose bumps. The creschendo is awesome. Most other conductors dont seem to get this as \\"right\\" as this one. But that could be because he's the first I heard.The conductor, Gerard Schwarz, does not seem as famous as say Bernstein or some other big shots, but often times I find myself hearing a piece for the first time on the radio and liking it, and it turns out he's the conductor. It seems to me that he'sa bit underrated.I almost gave 5 starts, but had to give 4 because the rest of the CD is not as thrilling as the one piece I mentionned earlier. A DDD recording, for those who care about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"I like for the hero and heroines to have chemistry. What I don't like is reading four hundred pages of one continuous love scene. I don't know how many ways one can write about heart-bursting, soul-wrenching, cataclysmic maelstroms of passion, but after having read A Gentleman's Honor, I can go on and on... and on. It was so repetitive, I ended up skimming most of the book.More substance, less redundant love scenes, please.I also found the heroine, Alicia, to be finicky. She so deeply cares about her younger sister and yet engages in a love affair that has the potential to ruin everything (we know it won't because our hero is an upright, gentleman-y sort of a chap). She decides the passion and lust she feels for our hero is enough for her to remain his mistress - and yet kicks herself for putting herself in a position where she will \\"indubitably\\" end up hurt. Um..?Was disappointing, to say in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes buy, but.....","review":"Yes buy (it's Stephanie Lauren's), but the hero and heroine are unusually dim in the last third of the book. I mean California clueless...I mean frustratingly dense...I mean \\"hanging chad\\" stupid...oh you get what I mean. But hey, it's Stephanie Lauren's...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book!","review":"Ms. Laurens does an awsome job at keeping you reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed every plot twist and change. The love scense are great. She keeps you guessing till the very end! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo Sad........zzzzzzzzz........","review":"It's just so so sad, so sad that I wasn't able to finish this book, I just hate it when this happens. It start out okay, I liked the intro, the 1st - 20 pages were interesting, liked Alicia and Adriana alot, then it went downhill from there, it just totally lost me. I kept telling myself over and over that it will get better but....I just didn't care anymore. I spent three days reading this, have not reached 1/2 of the book, then told myself, it just wasn't worth it, i could've read and finished two books during those three days i spent reading this one. This is my first Stephanie Laurens book and it will definitely be my last. Should've listened to the reviews but was too stubborn, thought it might be different for me but...zzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a whole lot about honor","review":"Well, to begin with, this book is about people engaging in sex acts, a lot of sex acts; so I guess I'd say it's probabably female pornography. There is a plot, sort of. It winds in and out of the story like a sine wave; but at each loop of the wave, there's is another sex episode. It gets tedious. The author's premise seems to be that if there are enough of those episodes, the hero(?) and heroine(?) will become \\"bonded\\" so to speak. I'm not sure that is to be taken for granted; I'm sure there are many ways to become emotionally bonded, and the repetition of the physical bonding becomes nothing but boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't HATE it, but don't LIKE it either","review":"First, I love Stephanie Laurens. I used to buy based on her name alone. This book is surely written by an imposter. I'm forcing myself to finish it, but under great duress. The man is not a gentleman, and the woman is not a lady. Dang it, that's why I READ these stories. She decides to allow a seduction because she'll never get to find out what its all about otherwise--ah, and then we're frequently (albeit quickly) told about all the potential suitors she waves away. I think I hate Tony. If he would stop mentioning he plans to marry her, I think I'd like him better. There is NO WAY he is in love with this woman any more than she's in love with him. Alicia is an idiot, and if I might add, possibly the worst chaperone EVER. I dislike these people immensely. Please do yourself a favor and skip this--read Ms. Lauren's \\"On a Wild Night\\" instead. (Don't bother with \\"On a Wild Dawn\\" or, do what I do, and read those 2 out of sequence...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well below this author's standard","review":"I loved most of Laurens' Cynster books, they combined interesting characters and really good sexy scenes with well-written, intriguing plots. However, this book, along with her last three or four books, lacks the charm of Laurens' earlier works. The author has used passion as if it were some type of filler to stuff into all the empty space around the bland characters and limp plot. To my own amazement, instead of savoring the love scenes, I found myself skipping over them just to get on with the story before giving up on the book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and a bore","review":"I've enjoyed many Stephanie Lauren books. Regrettably, this isn't one of them. There is a remarkably stupid mystery around which Ms. Lauren tries to craft a plot. The humdrum details of this mystery are regurgitated every chapter -- to take up space, it seems. The main characters could have been more exciting.Save your money or at least get the book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got to page 80 and couldn't read another word.","review":"I was so bored by Anthony, the murder plot, and most of all, Alicia. I couldn't have cared less who killed Ruskin and Alicia was about as interesting as a wet noodle. Anthony sounded sexy, but how he could be interested in someone as boring as Alicia I don't know. Maybe she perked up a bit after page 80, but I wasn't going to stick around to find out.Stephanie Laurens may have written too many books to come up with an original plot. This one is so overdone by S.L. that I simply couldn't force myself to read it anymore.Sorry to all the SL fans out there - this one is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I love this author and would buy anything with her name on it.

They really could have done so much with this movie. Most of the middle of the movie when all the action is supposed to be happening- it just loses the interest of the viewer big time. It's the same stuff over and over again and there is NO suspense. The acting is pretty bad too. I started to fast forward through parts of this movie because it just went on and on but not in a good way. I was extremely disappointed with this movie to say the very least. There was nothing fun about this movie at all. Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This film looks like it was shot in a single day. One thing that I like to do is look at B movies and see how well they could do with what they had to work with. This movie failed in almost every way.1. Corny dialogue;2. Bad acting;3.

I was in junior highschool, and I am still playing their two albums, and it's a very sad thing that they seperated.Darren has a fantastic voice, as he's shown us all. But I am really, really not impressed with this album- the album's main single is a complete flop, with an over-repetitive chorus- not to mention the more-superficial-than-normal lyrics.His album \\"Spin\\" was very poppy, but had some great lyrical content. And it wasn't so sloppy!But I guess all artists have their days, and so I gave it two stars for his honesty: \\"I'm willing to sleep my way to the top, I wanna be pop...ular.\\"Check out his first album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!","review":"This cd is just awesome. It is way better then Spin was. The songs are so deep and thought provoking. Darren just seems to get better and better with each album. Can't Wait For The Next.

His first new disc since his first in 2002 SPIN. THE TENSION AND THE SPARK is a really brave album and worth listening to. It's very open book, very personal. The lyrics are painfully real and honest. The music is very low key electro but it works. My favorite track is definately the opening \\"Darkness\\" which is a great song.

I sort of vowed I would never listen to that piece again. But I was given this CD with a few others a while back, and amazingly I have become a fan of Respighi's Feste Romane in James DePreist' inspired and very musical -- non- bombastic -- reading. In addition the Strauss Don Juan is superb and exciting. James DePreist is a phenomenal conductor. I recently downloaded a Minnesota Orchestra concert from the early 90's with him, and his performance of the Barber First Symphony is one of the most sensitive readings of a quirky work I have ever heard.

Then a neighbor recommended Musher's, and everything changed.It's really easy to apply; it has a consistency similar to vaseline, and you just smear a small amount over the paw pads and in between the pads in the fleshy areas on the paws. That's it! I do it right before we go out so he doesn't track it all over the house and I only use a little (maybe the size of a quarter for each paw). We just had a blizzard and an ice storm here in New York, and with Musher's on, he didn't stop and raise his paw once! He doesn't mind having it on and it really gets the job done. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paw Balm","review":"Balm worked well on the dogs paws. The snow and ice was irritating my little dogs feet so we got it for her. We ended up using it on the big dog too because his feet were just dry and cracked. I think it helped both with protecting the little dog feet from the salt and the big dog feet cracking. Overall good product and worth the money I'd say. It was easy to apply and had a nice scent as a bonus. No stains on any of the flooring, although the first time we used it the dogs wouldn't stop licking their feet, so the next few times I used it I'd apply it right before we went out for a walk so they wouldn't have the opportunity to just sit there and lick it off. The dogs seem fine, so I'd say it's non-toxic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using Musher's Secret on horse hooves","review":"Horses living where winters are cold and snowy are often plagued by ice balls building up on their hoof soles, which can be irritating or even painful. I tried other substances to prevent ice build-up until I heard about Musher's from my farrier. It works pretty well, and has the definite advantage of being nicer to handle than greasy substances. Try to keep the jar at room temperature between forays outdoors to apply it, because it gets very hard when cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its up to you","review":"It works, but it is messy.

So I tried this stuff. It seems to work pretty well with salt and snow, but when it gets down below 10 Fahrenheit, he still walks better with the shoes. The best part is that I only need to apply it once a day.Product has a very faint odor of citronella -but ten times weaker than citronella candles. Keep a rag nearby to wipe your hands after applying - it's not a great human glove, and dog paws transfer stink. Who knew?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs well","review":"I think this product does help protect my dog's paws during the snowy and salty winter months.

I have 3 dogs that i walk 4 miles a day on pavement and pads on one of their feet were getting thin and needed something to protect them, and why not add to all 3 dogs to prevent it from happening to them. Well i had each one lie down and applied 3 coats to their pads and had them stay down for ten minutes. When i let them up I had waxy paw prints all over the ground, glad i did this outside and not in my house! Think when wax gets hot what does it do-melt of course, so they need to take the all year protection off the description. We don't get snow very often here, but if it does I will try to put it on their paws then and see if it works then. So if u buy this don't use it in warm or hot temperatures. Can't rate it on the cold weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for snowballing","review":"We bought this for our Wheaton to try and prevent the snowballs from forming in his pads. It didn't work. Within an hour of starting to snowshoe, we had to stop and get the snowballs out. We re-applied, filling his pads with the wax thinking that might be the trick, but by the time we got to the halfway point (another 30 min), he had snowballs in his pads again. I do think the wax lessened the amount of snowballing, and they seemed a bit easier to get out, but we have decided to buy booties instead. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!","review":"After reading previous reviews, this sounded like a great product. It is NOT!!! The winter salt is a killer to my dalmatian and I was looking for something other then boots to put on him, so we could go for walks on cold winter days. Once the temperature gets colder then 20 degrees, the salt really starts to bother him. Well, today we finally got a chance to use the the stuff. Went about 20 feet and he started hobbling from the salt. Turned around and went back inside. I let his paws dry and then I put on another layer. Once again, we only made it 20 feet and had to turn around. I knew this product sounded too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me!","review":"After reading the other reviews I was excited to try this. I have a 60lb lab mix who loves to run in the snow. Extreme cold temps and road salt made it painful. I've tried this product a couple times and it did not work for my dog. First the product says it dries in a few minutes after applied. This did not dry and left greasy paw prints on my rug. Also, once out in the snow, it appeared the snow stuck to my dogs feet and he painfully picked up his feet more frequently. My latest attempt was a disaster. After walking on the street, the slushy grime, typical once snow starts to melt, mixed with the Musher's Secret and formed a tar-like consistency stuck between my dogs toes. Wiping his feet did not remove it and only after several washings with Dawn dishwashing liquid did the grime come out. Unfortunately I now have black, greasy paw prints on my good rugs.Am I doing something wrong? Any advice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Product","review":"The perfect product for both my dogs and me!

Thereafter the whole experience of this purchase has left a bad taste. The cost for the product was acceptable as was the delivery price but when it came to actual delivery the cost of the product to arrive at our door was increased by a customs charge that took the cost of the product up by more than 50%. Further it had a handling charge applied and as a result we had to make the effort to collect the album within a set period or face losing it after it was returned to sender. We will not be using this service again.

You could brush off my review as simply that - but I would recommend staying clear of this particular product.

Interesting that not ONE album from Motown is mentioned. However about 30 come from the British invasion. Before the Beatles, there were the Supremes who were the biggest force in American music, and groundbreaking race breakers. No mention. Marvin Gaye...no mention. But every psychadelic crap artist is listed, including imitations from Britain, where the psychadelic movement was an imitation anyway. I'm inclined to believe that intense druggie music writers compiled this book. Alas, the General Editor is from Rolling Stone magazine.Very disturbing, and very poor example.

But I thought the characters could have been handled a little better. I also did not hate the main villian, Qin Shang, like I did many other Cussler villians. Plus, Shang lacked a prevalent cadre of henchmen. There didn't seem a real sense of how evil these guys were. Still, an enjoyable read and a very interesting plan for the Mighty Miss.

Most of the other Dirk Pitt adventures were fast-paced and full of surprises. This one was neither. I had to work to finish this book, much as I did when reading the first few hundred pages of War and Peace. It lacks brilliance, and I (correctly) figured out what would happen after reading about halfway through. It's also got some elements that are, to say the least, slightly discriminatory against Asian peoples. What I do like about the book is that it seems Mr. Cussler has finally got his military information straight. I always found it a source of amusement when he described weapons and units that are completely nonexistent. Hopefully, the next adventure will retain these improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This was my first Clive Cussler book and will probably be my last.

Cussler seems to demonstrate in many parts of the book a fear and ignorance of the Chinese culture.The book starts out with Dirk Pitt on vacation rescuing Chinese immigrants who have been bound & dumped into a lake. Apparently the incredibly smart and devious villian of the book thought it was a good idea to take Chinese immigrants clear across the Pacific Ocean and dispose of them in a US Lake. Things get real goofy after this point.The heroics and lines of Dirk Pitt are so cliche that it seems like you have stepped back into the 70's (or maybe even the 50's when there was a 'Red' scare?).

However, this book is not entertaining. It does not have a complex plot. It starts out well enough, but since the plot is mostly revealed after the first 100 pages, there is no reason to continue reading. Unless you are enthralled by Cussler's vivid descriptions of old cars, old wine, and old men running around with old guns. Dirk Pitt is not a very likable character, and it is frustrating to be told over and over that he is. It's obvious Cussler loves patting himself on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Clive - Go back to writer's school","review":"I started reading Clive Cussler's books with Raise The Titanic.

What an ego! Along the way the writing became cookie-cutter, and the imagination and uniqueness that made the books stand out slowly disappeared. The plots became totally predictable - no surprises anywhere. We knew how the book would end somewhere near the middle. I could not even complete this book.

I expected much more from such a prolific writer, but what I found were contrived plot lines, underdeveloped characters, and prose loaded up with cliche phrasing (She stared up at him with pure hatred in her eyes), and way too many adverbs. I get tired of characters saying things caustically, shrugging smugly, and muttering contemptuously (all of which occurred on just one page: 78). I got to chapter 18 before I decided it wasn't going to get any better and put the book down. Thank God the copy I had came from my public library. At least I didn't waste any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Self-Indulgent","review":"I used to enjoy Clive Cussler's novels; that is, until he started inserting himself into the story lines. Each time Dirk at some point has to take a break in his adventure to meet with some mysterious hermit-like fellow (Cussler) who just happens to be loaded with crucial information about the local area. In this book Cussler writes himself into the story line as the \\"Bayou Kid\\"-- an old timer who knows every nook and cranny of the Mississippi swamp Dirk must investigate and who just happens to have a sophisticated and well-appointed undercover swamp boat (complete with comic relief guard dog) for Dirk and his lady de jure to borrow for his mission. Yawn! Cussler's habit of writing himself into the plot may have been cute the first time he did it, but at this point it's become downright annoying. Let Cussler have his fantasies--and his books--for I shall not subsidize him any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitt dealing with real world issues","review":"I enjoyed this Book by Cussler as I have enjoyed the previous novels read. I did have one issue with the story from historical preservationists view point. **SPOILER** I did not like the fact that Cussler reveals the bones of Peking man to the open air due to their age after being submerged 50 years. Pitt acted very uncharacteristically when he orders the anthropologists to unwrap them for all to see. Not a big deal, but just something that bugged me as a historian. Other than that, it was a fairly new plot with interesting insight into problems America faces today with our dealings on the international level and the immigration issue. Cussler may be using his work to express his views on these matters which could detract readers who disagree. I will still read because I enjoy the plot and writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"This was my first Clive Cussler book ever and it was great. The pot paints a grim picture of what could happen to our country and the world because of the large numbers of immigrants, legal and non, into nations around the world. The villian in this book is a billionaire shipping tycoon who makes a large ammount of his fortune from smugling illegal immigrants into the US and other countries of the world. Dirk Pitt accidentally foils one of the tycoohn's smuggling operations and he himself becomes a target of this man's rage. Dirk Pitt is then assigned to investigate some of his suspicious bussiness ventures, such as digging a canal to nowhere in southern louisiana, building a shiping port in the middle of a marshland and buying a decades old cris ship for no aparent purpose.

I made it to page 132 but could not bear to read another sentence. Mindboggingly unrealistic characters, dialogue, and action. Perhaps it takes a male reader to appreciate Cussler, Clancy, and Ludlum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underwater Indiana Jones","review":"First it is a good read, it is set in interesting places (scenic northwest, Mississippi swamps / river, great lakes) and talks about interesting activities (Illegal Alien Smuggling, Ultramodern new harbour, Navigating the Mississippi, Navigating the Great Lakes, treasure recovery). However, after quick-reading the book, my impressions were too much like those of an Indiana Jones movie: quick action with the barest link between the scenes and a sense of outrageous disregard for even the most basic credibility. Dirk Pitt is too much the unkillable archetypal hero, with an archetypal \\"Sancho Pansa\\" sidekick and a loveable Dulcinea of Chinese descent. The archetypal villain Fu Manchu (Qin Shang) and his lieutenant are also true to type. For all these same reasons I would bet this will quickly become a script-book for a successful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one kept my eyes glued to the pages.","review":"I found it very exciting.

I really enjoyed it. Cussler's Hitchcocky cameo was a nice touch. The action scenes are very realistic, and you really do think Pitt is done for in a couple spots. While I wouldn't really recommend this being the first Dirk Pitt book to read, if you like Cussler read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't keep my interest - Plot unbelievable","review":"This is my first Cussler book and I must say I was disapointed. The first couple of chapters kept my interest - but then I had to force myself to finish the book. It got very old to have the main characters get shot/stabbed/beat up etc. and be asked to go on to the next adventure immediately. I also didn't think it feasible at all that the research department that Dirk works for would be involved in ANY of the espionage type stuff that they were working on. The plot had possibilities - but I didn't like the style at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of adventure","review":"Flood Tide John Henry Beddingfield Clive CusslerUnknown Waters. 1948. An old cruise liner the Princess Dou Wan is on its final voyage. It is caught in a violent storm the hull is ripped apart, and the ship sinks with its mysterious cargo on board.Dirk Pitt is relaxing on a lake when he discovers an illgeal immigration project and rescues beatiful INS agent Julia Lee. Dirk Pitt and Julia Lee are on a race up the Mississippi River to stop the sinister villain Qin Shang, so he won't change the face of America. They are also racing to find the cargo of a cruise liner that sunk over fifty years ago. I give this book a four star rating becauseit is a typical Cussler book. Good guy wins, good guy gets the girl, and beats the bad guy. I liked this because of the non-stop suspense and the plot that thickens on every page you turn.

They have nothing in common other than traveling the world, playing with expensive gadgets, falling in (brief) love with fiesty heroines, and saving the day in an action packed climax. I don't know how I could have confused the two. But I digress from a review of the book.An evil Chinese businessman has a nefarious plot at hand to take over the United States. Dirk Pitt stops him.

I thought they were all pretty good until I noticed the repetitive pattern in them. They all involve Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino being in the wrong place at the wrong time and getting involved in some crazy guy's plot to take over the world. It is always the same. And as if to put the cherry on top it always involves a hopelessly boring section somewhere in the middle. I put this book back on the shelf after getting stuck in this one's boring section. However I have mainly been reading the later books in the series after having one of them recomended to me by a friend. But I have heard that some of the earlier books are much better so I think i will try those and see how they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitt is the Pits","review":"This was my first and definitely last Cussler book.

That is, almost read; I couldn't take it any more at about mid-way through and put the book back on the shelf.The characters in this book wish they could be called one-dimensional. Plot elements (which I won't give away, though I'm asking myself, why bother?) are so preposterous and unrealistic that the old \\"A-team\\" TV series looks like a Ken Burns documentary.I'm not fussy; I like just about everything I read, but this is too much to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the Dirk Pitt that I know and love!","review":"In Clive Cussler's newest book Flood Tide, our hero Dirk Pitt is a tired shadow of himself. There is little excitement or derring-do in this latest adventure (so-called) novel. A very political story line spoiled this book for this reader. I read Mr. Cussler for the adventures that Dirk, Al and Rudy experience. Give me treasure hunts, fantastic sojourns and less reality, please. I strongly suggest that anyone interested in trying one of Mr. Cussler's books for the first time skip this one and start with an earlier and far better story ie Treasure or Sahara (the best he has ever written, in my opinion). Flood Tide is best left as a last resort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This is the first Cussler novel I ever picked up and I have to admit I couldn't finish it. The plot is inane and the dialog is simply terrible. How does tripe like this make it into print? Can't the guy afford to hire an editor? Is he holding the publisher's family hostage? I gave it one star because the system didn't offer any fewer. Do yourself a favor and read Graham Greene or V.S. Naipaul, not this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"Although I am a big Dirk fan, I felt that this book fell flat. It just never seemed to catch fire. I enjoyed the total lunacy of 'Sahara' so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirk and Al save America again!","review":"You can't beat Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino for a great adventure. Dirk is as usual his larger than life self. He and Al always manage to escape certain death, stomp the evil-doer and protect truth, justice and the American way! Am I complaining? No way, that is what makes his books so entertaining. You know that evil will not triumph and that Dirk and Al will come through being little wrose for the wear. Cussler does all that and can make the technical data interesting too. All, in all, a terrific way to spend a few hours!Ree-views"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"A good adventure and an enjoyable read. I am looking forward to reading the next Dirk Pitt adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flood Tide doesn't hold to the Dirk Pitt tradition","review":"I've long been a big fan of Clive Cussler's work, but this one just doesn't cut it as a good story. Most of the other Dirk Pitt adventures were fast-paced and full of surprises. This one was neither. I had to work to finish this book, much as I did when reading the first few hundred pages of War and Peace. It lacks brilliance, and I (correctly) figured out what would happen after reading about halfway through. It's also got some elements that are, to say the least, slightly discriminatory against Asian peoples. What I do like about the book is that it seems Mr. Cussler has finally got his military information straight. I always found it a source of amusement when he described weapons and units that are completely nonexistent. Hopefully, the next adventure will retain these improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Self-Indulgent","review":"I used to enjoy Clive Cussler's novels; that is, until hestarted inserting himself into the story lines. Each time Dirk at some point has to take a break in his adventure to meet with some mysterious hermit-like fellow (Cussler) who just happens to be loaded with crucial information about the local area. In this book Cussler writes himself into the story line as the \\"Bayou Kid\\"-- an old timer who knows every nook and cranny of the Mississippi swamp Dirk must investigate and who just happens to have a sophisticated and well-appointed undercover swamp boat (complete with comic relief guard dog) for Dirk and his lady de jure to borrow for his mission. Yawn! Cussler's habit of writing himself into the plot may have been cute the first time he did it, but at this point it's become downright annoying. Let Cussler have his fantasies--and his books--for I shall not subsidize him any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Beat Dirk Pitt With A Stick/Gun/Bomb/Plague...","review":"What do you get when you cross James Bond, Jacques Cousteau and Indiana Jones? DIRK PITT, of course!!All of the Dirk Pitt books run along the same themes, but for light adventure and easy reading you just can't beat it. Who in their right mind wouldn't love a guy who always escapes the unescapable trap, foils the bad guy, finds the treasure, saves the world AND gets the girl in five hundred pages or less? And he always has such COOL TOYS...We're not talking \\"fine literature\\" here - this is pure escapism: mass market, broad appeal-type stuff. Clive Cussler has developed a winning (if a bit predictable) formula that is easy to follow and sure to please, whether you're a first-time reader or a die-hard fan (as I am). To his critics I say, \\"Let's see you do it better!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read....","review":"One great read from start to finish....I have only read a few Cussler books and so far I am very impressed.

After that, I have found myself waiting in line at the bookstore on the release date of his new novels. I usually buy two copies so I can have one and loan the other to all of my friends I have gotten hooked on Dirk and the gang. Some of the reviews I have read indicate that Cussler's stories are not a good as they used to be. This may be true, but let's face it folks, how many more are left?

Taking genetics off the table as an explanation you then have to move to pseudoscience and make things up because genetics is the foundation of those gaps and differences. That's what this book does. It's a pseudoscience substitute for the real reason why there are gaps in such things as intelligence, abilities, and general state of advancement between the races.

This book could have been worthwhile as a laugh, but it is not well written enough and therefore comes across as garbage instead.

However, I couldn't find a duffel bag that has metal zippers, so this seems like the best of what's available.I will write a follow-up review after more time has lapsed... so long as I remember to do so.

I think that everyone should give the song a listen to. Westlife is very talented and they have great songs. I think the best part of this cd was \\"Flying Without Wings.\\" If you like it I would buy their self-titled cd. Well, the rest of the cd seemed kind of boring...so I guess just listen to \\"Flying Without Wings\\"!

Well, I'll be honest, the game isn't too bad, but the anime is laughably awful, and don't even get me started on the card game. But anyway, I would love Al to re-release \\"Polkamon\\" on some collection of rarities in the future. However, other than that, I can't stand the music on here at all. I used to own it, but I tossed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This is a pretty good CD, even though I don't have it..Anyways,there isn't much to say, except that the music is pretty good, but forsome reason I can't bring myself to like Polkamon.

Not to mention that one line Al wrote in the lyrics for his diehard fans... you know who you are and what I'm talking about! His talent continues to amaze me.

Ever since the Reagan years it's been fashionable for writers and movie producers to trash white people, as if all whites are inherently evil, murderous, devilish, stereotyped, and incompetent. If you agree with Grisham's view of the world, please enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not only bad, but dangerous","review":"\\"A Time to Kill\\" is not only poorly written, like most of Grisham's stuff, but it is sick and entertains dangerous notions as well. The action hinges on the a father taking revenge after his preteen daughter is raped. This is a disgusting enough theme, but then the reader is made to believe that such vigilantism is not only justified but perfectly acceptable! At the end of the book, a court ruling is made based on the threat of mob violence. If that isn't enough to chill your blood, all of this is in service of a weak story with cliche characters and an overall lack of imagination that is startling. The reviewer below says reading this book is better than watching television. Much as I love books, I respectfully disagree. Most television shows don't insult the intelligence nearly as badly as this does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The used copy I purchased for more than half the original price was so old and dirty that I had to throw it away. I have since purchased a new copy from Walden Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissatisfied reader!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I recently finished reading a book titled A Time to Kill, and I have to say it was one of the most boring books that I ever had the misfortune of reading. The beginning is good there are these to white guys that rape this little girl, then the dad gets all heroic and shoots them up with an M16. After that the book just crawls on, I felt lucky when something remotly exciting happened every hundred pages or so. Not only that, the ending was very disapointing....well, less disappointing more completly unrealistic. All in all I would rather close my hand in a car door than read this book again, and if it was possible i would have given this book zero stars but the minimum was one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"A father takes the law into his own hands, shooting point blank (with premeditation) two handcuffed men who raped and beat his daughter. This is vigilantism, this is murder. His alcoholic lawyer gets a no-good \\"psychiatrist\\" to testify that the man is insane even though everyone knows that he is not.A clear-cut case for the death sentence except for one thing: the murderer is black and the victims are white, and the novelist, Grisham, is a white-bashing racist. The murderer is acquitted BECAUSE he is black.Don't bother with this piece of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book","review":"I read this book after being told about how good it was by my younger cousin. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. The story brutally depicts the contrast between black and white. At times, I would have to grit my teeth in order to restrain myself from yelling at the racism portrayed throughout the book. Out of all the Grisham books I've read: The Pelican Brief, the Firm, and A Time to Kill, I'd have to say that A Time to Kill is definitely my favorite. It was so realistic that I had horrific nightmares about lynchings at night. To anyone that is considering to read a Grisham book, start with this one. It hooks you from the beginning and keeps you gripped until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally powerful; captures the reader's heart and mind.","review":"This book was excellent. It showed all the types of racism and hatred that can arise from a small-town crime. It portrays a black American father who takes justice into his own hands after his daughter is brutally raped and beaten by two drunken white boys. It has been popularly mis-reviewed that she was killed, but she wasn't. She was severely beaten and recovered, although not fully. The young girl, Tonya, sat behind her father every day that he was in trial and supported him through everything. Jake Brigance, the lawyer who defended Carl Lee Haley, dealt with many hardships and heartaches throughout this trial. It was a brilliant novel and a very powerful and heart-wrenching story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Movie, Excellent Book!!!","review":"I was very unimpressed with the movie, but my friend told me that the book was much better. And it is. I almost cried at the beginning whn the horrible crime was committed. I would have done the same thing Carl Lee did. Don't be fooled by the movie. Read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!!!","review":"This was the first Grisham I read, and I read it because I saw the movie and enjoyed it much. I was wondering how the book could be as good as the movie and I was totally blown away. Grisham's grip on dialog is the best I've ever read, and the background stories missing from the movie are enjoyable as well. All in all probably the best, heartwrenching, emotional book I have ever read and it hooked me to the rest of John Grisham's books. A definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a book!","review":"My dad supplied me with this book saying it would be an interesting read and that I would enjoy it. I must say that it is quite interesting, and I have enjoyed it so far. I have no time to read, therefore, I'm only 350 pages in, but so far it's been great. Grisham's use of multiple plots and transferring between them throughout the story keeps things interesting in a book full of courtroom drama. I wouldn't be interested anymore if he didn't write the book the way he does. Vivid imagery appears in this book every page, as well as intriguing plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is a good read for adults, and isn't a difficult read at all. Everyone else who has read this book said it was good, and I'm going to agree with them on that. This book was a bestseller years after it was published! I'll rate it 4 out of 5 stars, and coming from a critic like me, that's not bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"The book was in great shape and arrived on shedule as promised...good job....will do it again in future.I liked Grisham as a writer but this was not my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but I don\`t support what happened","review":"It was a well told story but I don't support what Carl Lee Haly did. I support the right to self-defense and the right to defend what's yours. I do not however support revenge. The difference between the two is like night and day. Had Carl Lee happened upon the two dirtbags raping his daughter and took them out (like a man in Texas did earlier this year), I would have admired that a lot more. And quite frankly I think that would\`ve perhaps made for a good story.This whole book basically glorifies revenge and vigilante justice. The evidence against the two rapists were overwhelming. There is no way they would have skated.A story about self-defense and protecting your loved ones IMO has a much better message. This book was instead about revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's Best","review":"\\"A Time to Kill\\" is definitely Grisham's best novel. It's interesting that it was Grusham's first novel, but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published. The story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly. Racism, murder, justice, revenge, law and order, etc. The story will hold you from start to finish. Most of Grisham's newer novels are simple, predictable stories that bash attorneys. That is not the case with \\"A Time to Kill\\". It will grip you, tear you and entertain you all at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"If you want to read this book, you should reade \\"The Firm\\" or \\"The Client\\" instead.

Likeable characters and an extremely well written book makes a Time to Kill one of the most refreshing books i've read in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good legal drama but not Grisham's best.","review":"The story in this first novel from John Grisham has enough clichés that the reader knows very early the book's conclusion. Despite appearing at first to be Matlock-type story, there's enough action in both the main and side plots to keep the pages turning. The author clearly knows the rural South. One complaint about this and all Grisham's book is when the plot is over the ends very suddenly. The rush to end leaves several side-plots unresolved or poorly resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP -- UTTER CRAP.","review":"Okay. Where do I begin? There are so many things wrong with this book. Grisham spends a great deal of time in this courtroom drama dealing with the protaganist's theory of defense in a criminal case. In the end, the theory of defense turns out to be irrelevant -- so the bulk of the book is irrelevant. Grisham introduces characters who are ultimately inconsequential. I kept waiting for the main character's law student sidekick to do something to justify her inculsion. In the end, she comes and goes without doing anything of significance. She could have been cut out of the book without the least impact on the story. If you distilled this book to its essence, you'd end up with nothing. Skip this book; your time would be better spent reading the label on a tube of toothpaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Boring","review":"A Time to Kill must have been one of the worst books that I have ever read. A Time to Kill is a book about two men that rape a little girl. The girl's father kills the two men, and risks going to the gas chamber. The reason I hate this book is plain and simple. I hate books about politics and court trials. A Time to Kill is just that, dull and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to be Grisham's best--and that's not saying much","review":"The story does a good job of highlighting racial relation in the American Deep South, but that is about the only thing it does. Rather slow, it certainly did not hold my interest for very long. The best thing I can say about it was that the characters were more believable, not as cliched and certainly less hateful than in subsequent Grisham books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest short srory on record","review":"I thought Grisham was an average writer who had gone down hill recently.

This book dragged on and on and on, with characters that were so boring they had no life at all. By the time I got two thirds of the way through I could not stand it any longer. I began skimming until I finally had to just go to the last chapter to see how it ended. Then I felt it wasn't worth it. I wasted so much time getting through this piece of boredom that I am mad at myself. What a waste from a good author. I wouldn't pay a penny for a used copy and am sorry it is on my Kindle.

It is perfectly thought out, with never a very long space of boring words. Always smoothly stated and with great detail and those moments of surprise and suspense.I had seen the movie quite a while before I purchased the novel for my Kindle, at first I didn't recognize the storyline, but as I read on and got more into the book, I realized that I had seen the movie because the one scene when the KKK attacks an elderly ill man was still vivid in my memory.Definitely a well planned and well written work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time to Kill","review":"I enjoy this novel.

Before they can stand trial Carl Lee Hailey, the girl's father, shoots and kills them both. Arrested and on trial, Carl Lee hires Jake Brigance, a white friend, to defend him. What starts out as a small local trial grows into utter chaos as the NAACP, KKK and many others get involved, not necessarily in the interest of justice.A compelling story and still one of my favorites legal dramas by John Grisham. Those who are familiar with the character of Jake from the movie will notice that he's not nearly as sympathetic as he was portrayed in the movie. Even he is involved mostly out of his own self interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Time To Kill","review":"The book was okay although a back top corner was broken. The jacket was in a very tattered condition. I have received a refund back from Amazon.com so I will try to obtain another copy at a later date. The service from Amazon.com was exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Legal Fiction","review":"John Grisham takes readers deep inside the lives of law professionals and provides a level of vision that only someone with personal experience can. Grisham, a former, attorney proves that he is up to the challenge, steps up to the plate, and shares what appears to be personal experience at times. If it's not personal, then that shows how good this is, because it feels personal, and that's good writing.Characters are developed throughout the story, slowly and completely. Mr. Grisham gives you just enough information on each character to keep you feeling as if you know the character, and then you learn more of their past; what makes them tick; little personality traits that reveal more of who they are.\\"A Time To Kill\\" is John Grisham's first novel, and the only one of his that I have read. I hear he's gotten even better. Looks like I'll be busy for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was mostly about segregation and the Klan.","review":"The book wasn't that different from the movie. It went into more detail than the movie did though. The lawyer got more drunk in the book. In the book, one of the jurors turned the case around so it was a white girl being raped by two black men, this caused the jury to see it as if it was their little girls. (The jury was mostly white) In the movie, it was the lawyer who turned it around. I, personally, liked the movie better because some parts in the book were very sluggish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me thinking about for weeks","review":"What can I say? It's the best book I've read in years.

They're both great"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling novel of law and the equality of man!!!","review":"I just completed the John Grisham novel \\"A Time to Kill\\". This was a fantastic novel that gripped you from beginning to end. I saw the movie following the completion and I found it enjoyable but they altered a few scenes. Definitely, finish the book prior to seeing the movie. As we enter the novel, we see a young child violated. When the father takes the law into his own hands, the trouble begins. With action and adventure throughout the novel, it is difficult to put it down.

The unexpected and beyond surprising events of the raped ten year old, Tonya Hailey lead her father, Carl Lee Hailey, to take the two rapists' lives in his own hands. Meanwhile, Carl's lawyer, Jake Bigance was threatened by the Ku Klux Klan and many disastrous occurance were taken place (which would of led anyone to give up his case). However, Jake did not fail to make a fulfilling speech which justifys that Carl's actions were righteous. To Jake's assistance, there was Roark, a \\"brilliant, wicked chick\\" who did not really make a difference in this story. Mostly why I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"A riveting read with racism as the ticking time bomb. Fascinating characters and non-stop plot.

After reading To Kill A Mockingbird the book seemed even better. The characters were well developed and the book was really believeable.A Time To Kill is the story of Jake Brigance trying to defend Carl Lee Hailey after Carl Lee killed the two rednecks that raped his daughter. Carl Lee was black.I liked this book because it showes how a father will do anything for his daughter even if it means going to jail, how people care more about what colour someone is then if they really are guilty or innocent, and how even when you think that you are defented you just have to carry on.I recommend this book to anyone who likes law novels and John Grisham. Also to anyone who is trying to understand more about racism towards black people in the Southren United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very dissapointed","review":"This is the second John Grisham book that I have read and found it very boring and very slow moving.

They get arrested after trying to kill the girl, and then the dad comes along and kills them both. Throughout the next four hundred pages it is all about the trials and tribulations of the black man and his lawyer.I would not recommend this book to someone who has previously read or this is their first John Grisham book. It is slow and looses you after page one hundred."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!!!","review":"The worst book I've ever read. Insipid, shallow, ridiculous plot.

Most whites want him dead; but if it was a white man trial where he murdered a black man, he would be set free. Racism is very strong, and it could not be erased from these people. If you want to know what happened to the man who is a hero to his people and some others, but a devil to white people, read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was good, But it could use more detail.","review":"This book is about A man who kills two men who had raped his ten year old daughter. In which he has to be put on trial for murder, he is a black man in which his lawyer is the one who got hisbrother out of a jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very realistic account of a highly emotional story.","review":"I grew up in Mississippi, in the area where John Grisham's novels usually take place. I am well acquainted with the incident that probably originally inspired Mr. Grisham to develop the plot of this book. Although in the actual incident, the little girl was white, and the rapist black, the reversal that was in the novel made for a very fascinating situation. I also thought of the grief and frustration of the father of the girl, and was deeply moved by the portrayal of the father in the book. The characters in the book are so familiar, and the story details so obviously personal, that this may very well remain, in my opinion and many others', Grisham's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is a book that if you can read it in more than one sitting I am shocked at you. This is a great Grisham book. Being his first I expected it not to be that good. But it seems from the being Grisham wanted to show the world who is king. It is about a girl who gets assaulted by some white folks and during their trial the father decides to ... them. Now it is a battle to determine if it was a legal move to do. They pleed insanity. And on top of all this the KKK is there. This book is everything that Grisham is I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is slightly better than a bad movie","review":"I've read all the Grisham books and am amazed that he has such a wide readership. His writing is superficial and stretches credibility. His plot lines have gaping holes (ex: The Client) A Time is his best effort, but he asks his readers to sympathize with a black man who shoots down two manacled white men in cold blood. He may have gained some black readers, but even the most broad-minded whites question his motives in wrliting this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always 5 stars","review":"Highly recommended book for Grisham fans. You will enjoy this one. I wish I could write like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item sent","review":"Book was to replace one I lost that was loaned to me by a friend. Had it sent to them.

In this action packed Carl Lee's daughter, Tanya, is missing, which she eventually gets beaten by some redneck guys. When the guys get convicted of doing this to Tanya, Carl Lee goes crazy and kills the guy who had beaten his daughter. While the trial goes on The Lawyer, Jake, becomes Carl's lawyer. While he is the lawyer, he and his family become under fire from a clan that is trying to intimidate them. as the book goes on the odds are against Jake and Cal Lee on winning the case. At the end of the book they win the case.This is one of those books that when you start reading you will not put it down until the books is over"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tense legal thriller by John Grisham","review":"John Grisham's first novel is a dandy, although controversial and troubling to many citizens of the south. A black father takes the law into his own hands when his young daughter is tortured and raped by two white men. Carl Lee Hailey becomes a vigilante and evens the score but this is only the beginning of this powerful story. The racial lines are drawn in the town where the trial is to be held but all over the state of Mississippi, and predictably violence erupts and the NAACP and the KKK are front and center during the trial, each side awaiting the verdict that may change the community of Clanton forever. The audiobook was read by Michael Beck whose expert narration brings listeners to a front row seat for this riveting novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's Best","review":"After The Firm became so incredibly popular, I decided I should read it, just to know what everyone was talking about. But since I always like to read books in the order they were written whenever possible, I decided to read A Time to Kill first, and I'm glad I did.This book was just great, it had everything you could ask for. A sympathetic figure at its center, a protagonist who was a good guy and easy to root for, and plenty of bad guys that were easy to dislike. Add to that an action-packed plot, and the result is a book you just can't put down.I've read all of Grisham's books so far, but this one still remains the best as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time To Kill","review":"This was a page turner.

However, most people who would find such a book interesting have already seen the old chestnuts in here and know how to solve them. A serious puzzler would rather complain about how the problems are ambiguous, well-known, trivial, poorly stated, and/or poorly solved. I'd recommend this to an elementary school teacher trying to teach a unit on logic. But for everyone else, I suggest looking elsewhere. Fortunately, I got my copy free from the publisher.

I am very satisfied with the service and will order again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out-of-date shoclarship, archaic language, no change at all.","review":"It is only a minor change and worse version of the renowned RSV. Worse, because the ESV does not give any clue to the amendments in the text! RSV did so. ESV footnotes say only \\"Or\\" at the palce more detailed explanations are required. ESV uses archaic languages and it leads misunderstanding. The linguistic study in the biblical text is far more in progress! The \\"new\\" translation is not eventually new at all, but it is an effort to keep old tradition (back to KJV) alive under a seemingly new face. I cannot understand why other reviewers hail such a low-standard translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wonder this is a classic.","review":"You will love reading about the main character, \\"Jesus\\", and his crazy antics. The three wise men are hilarious! I don't want to give anything away but the scene with the cow in the dinner is a gut buster! However, it's not all fart jokes and uncomfortable sexual situations. This story is packed with action. Toward the middle of the book, Jesus gets drafted in the Vietnam War were J.C. meets some of his closest friends.I grantee you, you will be the life of your next party when you get this baby out and read passages. I recommend chapter 6 entitled \\"where am I ?\\", in which Jesus, after a drunken Star Wars party, wakes up outside only to find himself keeping warm inside the caucus of a freshly slain caribou! No wonder this is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"onion skin paper","review":"What I like: a good translation, cross references on each page, and a concordance in back. What I don't like: the paper is so thin you can see through to the next page--very distracting when you're reading. Why can't they use decent quality paper?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best balance of literal translation, readability and artistry","review":"The ESV is highly literal, but without the awkwardness of the NASB. It is very readable, but with much greater fidelity to the original languages than the NIV. It provides a high level of artistic richness in its language, retaining much of the majesty and reverence of the KJV but rendered in modern English.It allows one to use a single translation for both casual reading and serious study."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid translation","review":"I picked this bible up to replace/complement my aging NIV Student Bible and have been very happy. It is clear that the translation is more literal than the NIV; very beneficial for seminary/college classes and bible studies. The brief concordance included is more than adequate for most people. The reference system is convenient, and the type is pleasant to read. Also important for students, the paper holds up well to highlighter.Before trading in your old NIV beware, the readability level of the ESV is higher(simply by its more literal nature) and you might find that for personal devotionals or for use with younger students, the NIV might be the better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESV BIBLE","review":"I love the little Bible and its color.

Very nice quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best contemporary translation of Scripture available","review":"I ... [feel] that reading this translation is truly a delight. It is great to finally see a translation of the Bible that is both literal and pleasant to read.However, upon further use and consideration, I ... have problems with the Classic Reference edition as published by Crossway. I was a bit disappointed in two things: (1) the genuine leather binding doesn't appear to be as high quality as similar bindings found in some other Bibles (Foundation Publishers (NASB) comes to mind), and (2) the typeface is somewhat difficult to read, especially the references and footnotes.... In my humble opinion, this is an excellent translation of Scripture that deserves nothing less than excellent editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the lot","review":"Among the many Bible translations, the ESV will be a standard for many Christians. It avoids some of the unfortunate renderings of the NIV - such as 'atoning sacrifice' (1 John 2:2) and 'sacrifice of atonement' in Romans 3:25 for the preferred 'proptitiation' - used by the ESV. Yet, it avoids the sometimes wooden rendering of the NASB.Try it, and I think you will like. Also included is a pretty good CD - with an electronic version of the ESV & KJV - along with other study guides. The CD is in the Wordsearch format."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Bible as our Pastor is using it also in church.","review":"This is a beautiful reading Bible and I love it very much.

The CD is great -- really gives the flavor of his improvisational genius, and his warm sense of humor and joie de vivre.I know that calling him the Dalai Lama of Music may sound a bit extreme, but he is truly a magical and charismatic person -- the joy that he has in music and his life shows in his face every time he sings. He is truly an ambassador for music, and I wholeheartedly recommend not only this wonderful, fun album, but also to take any opportunity you have to see this man perform live (his real forte) -- and sit as close to the stage as possible!

The storyline drags. The two main characters, Joe Warder and Dennis MacMore, continuely escape unscathed via highly unlikely circumstances. Max Brand's fantasy is again interlaced in this western, portrayed by Arturo -- the tall, thin man dressed in black with a lean, ugly, long face -- showing up at opportune times with his prophecies. After reading the novel completely through, I reread the first 50 pages and gained a little more appreciation of the paperback. However, if one is looking for reading entertainment, this is not the novel to choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent book for the Japanese WWII Militaria Collectors!","review":"Unlike the first edition, this revised edition has more pluses and minuses. The greatest thing is that the availability of the English summary, at least it gives a gist what book is about. On the other hand, despite the add-on of new pages on new weaponry, some original content from the first edition was replaced, and the previous illustrations somehow smaller as well. Still, the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy Uniforms and Equipment is an incredible book for the Japanese militaria collector (surly, there are many great in Japanese language military books, but this one of the easiest to access, since after WWII Japan's peace policy influenced the making of those books in very limited publications). Note that book covers the Japanese history since 1860's till 1945, and not just the regular military but Royal Guard and Civil Defense Corps with the enemy display of the Chinese National Army."},{"rating":"2","title":"A purchase worth it...","review":"John has brought forward a number of real life parables to assist us in getting to the core of a common definition of courage. At times it might have been more useful to have fewer anecdotes and more of the blunt McCain we have come to know (and love). However, he appears to rally these thoughts in a powerful conclusion and makes the book a worthy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last of the Samurai","review":"You have to have respect for this guy just for what he managed to survive. There aren't too many writers that can authoritatively whip off a book on this subject.McCain uses sharp and very elloquent English to account his experiences in the midst of courage greater than his own. He is modest and humble and, at the same time, his observations penetrate and enlighten with great effect.Very little of the book is about him directly. He speaks mostly of people he knows, respects and has learned from. From Eleanor Roosevelt to Roy Benevidez, numerous accounts of valour, honor, wisdom and raw courage are siphoned off from a master survivor.I may not be any more courageous now than I was before the read, but, what can I say...? A book that needs to be written needs to be read and I've got even more reasons now to respect political leaders that actually 'walk the walk.' Pity that so few of them are recognized now by the greater public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage is more than grace under fire","review":"In this short book, John McCain examines the nature of courage. In it, he finds far more than today's usual fare of synthetic Hollywood heroics, peace-at-any-cost idealism, or self-affirming mantras.Instead, he tells stories about individuals whose courage is or was founded in principles -- particularly the principles of a free and just society. Each story is complex; heroines/heroes have blemishes; consequences are a mixed-bag. Yet all share a common theme: that courage in its simplist form, no matter how inelegant, is about standing up for what is right.And in doing so, John McCain illustrates that courage and a meaningful life are inextricably intertwined.Outstanding reading for those who wish to live thier best life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading About","review":"Reading this certainly convinced me that McCain wrote it, it sounds like he is talking to you. Short, precise, loaded words.Passionate about courage, courage that matters, McCain sifts through many heros who displayed it, telling their stories and probing for what links courageous people.Not all war heroes, either, but there are those here also, Mitchell Red Cloud and Roy Benavidez. Hannah Senesh and Cheif Manuelito, John Wesley Powell, and Aung San Suu Kyi to Eleanor Roosevelt and John Lewis.Inspirational, motivational --- a triumph for human dignity, which is slowly, evily being destroyed in our time. Here it is uplifted, held high as what really one would want to be graced by courage to uphold.Magnificent read! McCain is solid stuff of our day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book - should be required reading for our kids","review":"this is one great book and should be required reading for our kids. regardless of your politics or feeling about Senator McCain you need to read this book.

As a prisoner of war living in such harsh and adverse living conditions would be able to reflect on both. This book has helped me confront some of my fears, example anxiety and drepression. If I could only find the courage and strength, I'm sure it would make me a better person as it did John McCain."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Unreadable!","review":"Love John McCain. Don't love this book. Between wonderful stories of individual courage, this treatise on courage and what causes people to react without respect to fear is totally unreadable jibberish. It makes no sense at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I won't criticize this book by bringing up Karl Rove politics as one reviewer did. This book has nothing to do with Rove. It has everything to do with courage and how important it is for every single one of us. There were too many military scenarios for my tastes, but I can appreciate the huge heart and love of country that many of the characters he describes possess.I have to admit I would have liked the good senator to include more about his own captivity and his spiritual beliefs. It would have been very interesting to hear about his relationship to Jesus, especially in those dark and cold battlefields where evil lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed...","review":"This book is an interesting collection of stories of courageous acts. In between the stories McCain rambles about the meaning of courage. The ramblings sort of meander and are not well-structured. This would have been a better book if it were marketed solely as a collection of courageous stories, possibly including McCain's own story, and possibly with a BRIEF, cogent essay at the end on his thoughts on courage.I am an avid reader and a McCain fan, but this book was difficult, and boring to read, and brought him down a notch in my estimation. (My parents, both avid readers of fiction, non-fiction and biographies, passed the book on to me, and later confessed that they passed it on for the same reason)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos!","review":"In this book McCain inspires us to have courage by showing us that real courage is born from commitment.

This movie was made with a sort of cynicism about our Greatest Generation that seems to only drain the audience's attention. By focusing too much on the 'bad' side of America during the War in the Pacific, Clint Eastwood overlooks the good that America can stand for leaving the viewer with their own battle fatigue. Jumping from the war to modern times and back again and again during the whole movie was like being drug through the mud having to endure another one of hollywood's cynical anti-American rantings.Poorly made and although it had potential, the movie will leave you wondering what message it is the viewer is supposed to swallow.

On the plus side, this film has great acting and superb cinematography-reminiscent of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in it's harrowing depictation of the horrors of war. Unfortunately, that's it. The multi-layered characterization of our \\"heroes\\" is rendered dull and one dimensional. (We're not sure about their motivations, and worse yet, we don't even get a chance to care). Even one character's bout with alcoholism is rendered lifeless and boring...Believe me, like you, I WANTED to like this movie, but the directing, editing, script, and overall flow made it impossible.

The battle scenes are terrific but the whole angst over the three soldiers who are held up as heroes lost me. I just felt the movie was much ado about nothing. Worthy of maybe an hour documentary or investigative report on \\"60 Minutes\\" but not an entire movie.I also spent half the movie going: \\"Oh, look, it's the crazy murderous husband from 'Desperate Housewives.' There's the guy from 'Mad Men' and the crazy neighbor chick from 'Two And a Half Men.' \\" Very distracting to put such TV stars in the bit roles.I'd sooner have seen a straight war movie on the Iwo Jima invasion.I sure hope \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of the movie?","review":"It seems ironic to me that while this film was heavily touted, its sister-film, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" has been nominated for an Oscar, yet we've heard relatively little of it being promoted, except for the \\"now playing\\" blip on television. As a former Marine, I honor the sacrifice of my fellow Brothers, but I have to ask myself, why isn't the other side being told? Why aren't theaters just as anxious to show that all sides in war know honor and death equally?Makes me wonder if the same thing is going on in Iraq. We have many brave boys dying, but what about the other side? They should be honored as well. Maybe we'll have to wait 60 years before we hear of their side of the story from an America that's blinded by its \\"patriotism\\" and paying for it with its dearest blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flag of our Fathers","review":"Very poor - the dvd did not function at all on several players - I sent it back and never received anything or a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fags of Our Eastwood","review":"The battle scenes were great, but too short, the rest of the movie is like a soap opera about 3 soldiers going on a fund raising tour w/ a drunken indian.

This movie however just does not speak to me. The movie is slow and while it paints a picture of realism sometimes the viewer needs a bit of the far fetched. I found myself longing for for the very good fight scenes and sitting waiding through all the other garbage surrounding th flag berrors.Now the the second movie letters from Iwo Gima - the Second movie in this 2 movie set, I give 5 star review. It is truly an amazing human struggle story. Clint really pulled that movie off well. You be the judge, I own this movie and have only wathed it 2 times. I own Letters, and still watch it time to time"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Attempt to Make a Great War Movie","review":"This is a strange movie. It seems seamlessly made and expertly done, but there isn't anything there! There aren't characters except for the son of one of the soldiers and he is the most moving person in the story. The movie seems empty, probably because they never really talked about the war and the battle of Iwo Jima and it isn't really understood what the experience was like for them. The extras are better than the movie but the documentary really provides a clue to the lack of humanness in the film. The film isn't really told from the men's point of view but of the son and the men who made the film. They didn't have the connection to the men who fought and never really connected to them themselves. Watch Letter from Iwo Jima, that is a great film - truly for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant flashbacks make it difficult to follow and to be engaged with the movie","review":"Constant flashbacks make it difficult to follow and to be engaged with the movie.

This ambitious Iwo Jima saga goes all over the map with its excessive flashbacks and cross-cutting distractions, thus keeping the audience at arm's length. Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach and Barry Pepper try to rise above the narrative quagmire, but it's a losing battle. The film's artistic failure can be attributed to Eastwood's astonishing lack of focus - he never seems fully engaged in the source material.

And also if you noticed no reference to god and we know especially in 1942,soldier's were praying and reading the bible for sure on a average.

First off, there is very little actual war in this war movie, the movie centers on the bond drives at home. The Bond drives are made to look as if the evil American government was extorting money to continue their pointless war overseas. This is no \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" it does not even come close. Eastwood has taken his feelings about the war in Iraq and imposed them on a heroic struggle that happened 60 years ago. I feel bad for the Americans who fought and died on Iwo Jima, this film cheapens and de-legitmizes their experience. Eastwood should apologize to the remaining veterans of Iwo Jima, just as long as he apologizes to the Americans and not the Japanese."},{"rating":"1","title":"it ok but disc skips a little","review":"i just got it and i was playing it and it skipped and screen got cube like at 24 minutes and ten seconds also the cover is cheap flimsy plastic. i know from is always flimsy but were DVD goes plastic is flimsy. i reccomended but be warned DVD case is flimsy and dvd may skip a couple times. and a great education movie. itr best movie ever put into heart of the action"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flags of Our Fathers","review":"I bought this movie for a friend, but he and I watched it together, totally immersed in the vivid scenes of the horrors of war.

I highly recommend watching the movie for the war and imagry effect and reading the book for knowing more of these men.It was just weird knowing more about those boys, then what was told in the movie- but I found myself explaining to my boyfriend more and more what was going on, why they were talking like that, what was happening, what time they were in, ect.I was expecting more of a heart gripping story, like I read- but it didn't get those parts.

I am not sure it is his \\"best\\" book but it is worthwhile anyway if you like his other books.This one centers on the Titanic itself and some secrets materials it holds.. Cussler is a researcher in real life and his passion for the sea comes through once again with enough points to add cedibility to something, which of course, is by its nature incedible (good guys/bad guys/evil plots), but that is what his books are about.There are some weak points along the way (sometimes the romance writing is not quite up to par) but the action and adventure aspects makes it a fun read, like the rest of Cussler's writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raise the titanic","review":"I like Dirk Pitt adventures and this was one that pecked the imagination. It brought you to a imaginary dream type of world that has you thinking if it was possable to do something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler never fails to entertain with Dirk Pitt","review":"Review title says it all. The book may be a little slow to start but it all sets up nicely. A bit of a who-dunnit when you reach the final chapters and ends unbelievably (as in the ending should not have actually reached the conclusion that it did, IMHO). Regardless of those small quirks the book still kept me entertained from start to finish - I have no problem buying any books from this authour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Although I love Cussler's work I have to give it 2 stars","review":"I've read a lot of negative reviews regarding this novel. Granted its not Cusslers best work, but there are sections I like. The triumphant Titanic entering New York harbor is breathtaking in my opinion. Still, if you want to read Clive at his best try TREASURE or DRAGON. Great books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Another good read by Cussler. It's a shame that the Titanic broke apart on the way down. It's not a classic, but its not held out as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fave books AND movies","review":"I know it sounds nutty and is one of those how-in-the-world-can-this-not-be-stupid? titles, but it's one of my favorite books. We've just about worn out the DVD.My first reading was before the ship was actually found. You will be surprised how accurate this book is.There are subplots that make it a much better book than the movie, but that's typical with something this 'meaty.'Suggest both for any Titanic fan in your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful writting, wonderful suspence, a great book.","review":"I should have put down four and a half stars, cause it's that good. Someone wrote down about how the facts about the Titanic are way off. Yes, they are, but this book was written years more than TEN years before the Titanic was found and studied. He was writting what he thought the Titanic would look like after 76 years under water, and he did a fine job in discribing what the hull looks like after all thouse years. Plus, it is a work of FICTION, ok, as in \\"Not real\\". Being that it is fiction, it is a fine one at that. The suspense keeps you turning pages wanting to find answers, and the characters are believeable. The downfall of Gene Seagram was very well done. Imagine if all you lived for, all you worked for, what you put all your money on, was found to be worth nothing, disspossed in less that a day. I would probably break down. It is a great book, a very enjoyable book, and one that keeps it's head-on pace right to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring book By a GREAT WRITER","review":"This book starts off good, but gets worse and worse! The title lead me to believe it was about the Titanic and I mean hardly! But Cussler is a good writer and many of his books are great. This book just wasn't interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Dirk Pitt","review":"This is a classic Cussler book! Action packed and suspenseful; will keep you on the edge of your seat. Definately worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is an excellent read. My only problem with the book is that it caused me to miss my stop a few times taking the train because I just couldn't look up from the pages. It's a tad on the unbelievable side, but hey, It's fiction. Also, Pitt is made out to be the \\"perfect\\" human being, which is also a tad irritating. Give this a read. Disappointment is unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame. Lame. Lame.","review":"This fast paced adventure thriller would have been excellent reading- when I was 14. I gave Cussler a try and read the first three books. I think I'm done. James Bond can't get into a girl's pants like Dirk Pitt. In \\"The Mediterranean Caper\\", Pitt slaps a girl he just met and screws her on the beach. In \\"Iceberg\\", he pretends to be gay. In \\"Raise the Titanic\\" he just screws a woman he seemingly had no prior connection to on the Titanic. The plot is intriguing but just doesn't play out. I was sick of this book by the end and just wanted it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever finished","review":"When I was a little kid, I'd see this book on the shelves at the library and in used bookstores and wonder what masterful tale was contained inside, and yet somehow I never managed to pick it up. 20 years later I finally splurged and got it for a dollar at the library book sale, and read the whole thing cover to cover on a transpacific flight.Oh, man! What I had been missing! Some of the worst dialogue ever committed to paper, the most appalling junk science since \\"The Core,\\" and gratuitous sex scenes that made me actually laugh out loud. Dirk Pitt is like Doc Savage -- only twenty times smarter and stronger! The fact that this one reached the NY Times bestseller list makes you question the fate of humanity.Good for a laugh or two, especially with some of the utterly ludicrous scenes near the end (don't forget that sultry strip-tease, seemingly written by a ten-year-old), but probably not worth it in the long run unless you're a fast reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpieces lifted from masterpieces","review":"Stan Getz was the greatest. The most consistently satisfying jazz musician. He is the personification of Cool. To listen to his music is to hear a healing balm poured over the troubles of the day.This is album is another in a series of Verve reissues of his music, some early some late. Great intros to Getz. Yet as romantic, soothing, charming and lyrical as the songs herein are, they are taken out of context. There is a dark side, unlike the reissues of say, Miles Davis, whose entire set of recordings is still with us, the various \\"Getz Best\\"'s seems to be replacing the originals as the masterpiece albums from which these gems were lifted keep drifting out of print.So listen and enjoy sheer beauty of the music of the man they called \\"The Sound\\".

The opening essay, \\"Philsophy and the Scientific Image of Man\\" is an excellent synoptic overview and introduction. One will find oneself constantly refering back to this essay as one moves on in the text. \\"The Language of Theories\\" brilliantly discusses Sellars' teleology, which is a Peirceian progression towards completed science. The centerpiece, of course, is \\"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind.\\" This is the essay that put Sellars on the map. Along with introducing concepts such as psychological nominalism, it is a brilliant and largely flawless attack on logical empiricism. The text concludes with \\"Some Reflections on Language Games\\", a Wittgensteinian discussion centered around the notion that one must \\"live the game.\\" If you only own one book from Sellars (which is no where near enough), make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Leash","review":"very well made,and good price.

So 15 amp saw, 14 gauge wire, under load...you do the math. It was either redoing the entire wiring setup in the garage or find a cheap simple solution. I found a cheap simple solution, this cord, I could run it 40 ft to a 20 amp circut in the kitchen, to the garage and my saw works like a dream. That was what I BOUGHT IT FOR. I took it on site a few times now everybody wants to use it.

The Fourth Symphony, a lesser known work, proves dramatic and eventful, but always lovely sounding in this performance.

It starts with a murder of an English Lord and his servants in Paris and a most inept and financially-broke French Police Officer is dispatched to the ship \\"Leviathan\\" to find the murderer. I don't why people say that it is a tribute to Agatha Christie for I found it similar to Wilkie Collin's Moonstone right from the narrative style to the plot. Fandorin is not in his element meaning that the author himself is not very easy with a non-Russian environment. After all the Author, apart from the last 20 years, had been living in an isolated vacuum of sorts - a hallmark of Soviet Russia. I think he (Akunin/Fandorin) had better not move out from Russia. We will try and learn to deal with those long Russian Names. I must say that his two Sister Pegalia novels were much better than his Fandorin series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad I have never stoped reading a book till this","review":"I actually did not even read the whole book it was so bad I stoped reading it after 100 pages.

I would give this 0 but you have to give it a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"Who-done-it\\"!","review":"This was probably one of my favorite Fandorin novels of the series. Here, we meet our hero as a more mature Russian diplomat as he finds himself in the middle of a murder mystery that started in Paris and led itself onboard a luxury passenger ship en route to the East. Fandorin, after his adventures during the Turkish war (which were covered in the \\"Turkish Gambit\\" that was the second book in the series in Russian, but skipped for the English readers at least for now), is older and wiser, elegant and stylish, yet somewhat more cynical. He displays great observation qualities of Sherlock Holmes, and, at first, stays out of the way of investigation conducted by the \\"old walrus\\" Gustave Gauche, \\"Investigator for Especially Important Crimes\\" - but is forced to interject as he sees that the search for the villain is turning more and more in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and enjoyable","review":"Having read _The Winter Queen_, I had to read the next Erast Fandorin mystery. I was not disappointed, and in fact, I believe _Murder on the Leviathan_ is the better of the two.Written from the perspectives of the various suspects, Erast more or less takes a \\"back seat\\" as the reader is led through the murder mystery on a ship bound for Calcutta out of France. Each character provides their own perspective on the mystery, the suspects, and the clues - a very intriguing and clever device. The cast of characters, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, are straight out of an Agatha Christie novel, but with the unique and humorous twist I have come to expect from Akunin.As the story plays out, we learn that each suspect has their own story to tell - more than a few of which are red herrings, but all are entertaining. A very clever book, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I look forward to more titles from the same author being translated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erast at sea","review":"I was eagerly awaiting this new book in the series, having thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Winter Queen\\" by the same author. This book continues the tale of Erast Fandorin, who was a junior detective in the first novel but now, three years after experiencing a terrible tragedy, we find as a Russian diplomat on his way to Japan. There are a series of murders, both on land and aboard ship, and the presence of an officious French detective and a small list of subjects makes for interesting reading. Erast once again shows his capacity for rational thought in going to the heart of any mystery. I rather preferred the somewhat vulnerable Erast of the first story, but advancing age and tragedy certainly would change a person, so its not unbelieveable. I know there are several more Erast stories in the process of being translated from Rusian into English, and I look forward most eagerly to their publication!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted!","review":"Am mad about Boris Akunin, the author. I first read Winter Queen which starts with Fandorian's story. My friiend had the book in his library and I just casually picked up and could't stop reading. I read his second book when I returned to the U.S which is Murder on the Leviathan. I am on to his fourth book which is Special Assignments. Will be purchasing his next book as this guy is addictive. Didn't realize there was a Russian mystery writer like him. His knowledge of Japanese culture is amazing. Reminds me of Trvanian's Shibumi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fandorin unweaves a very tangled web","review":"I can only assume that the original book was just as good as the translated version - but, nonetheless, it is a very enjoyable read. It is well written, with enough clues to keep you involved and guessing. You may be able to figure out the 'right' villans as you travel this literary journey, but you won't be sure until the end, and even then, you might have a surprise or two. I've read all of the translated Fandorin books and although this wasn't my favorite, it was quite enjoyable. I anxiously await the next one. You will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun with Fandorin","review":"Ten people murdered in the Paris household of an English lord, a hidden treasure to be found, a steamship full of suspects and \\"Papa\\" Gauche, France's top detective is on the case.

Yes, Fandorin is on the case again.Yet again, Akunin has produced a fun detective story with a cast of diverse and interesting characters and several good twists. Based on this book, I have included the Turkish Gambit on my must buy list.I notice that some previous reviewers have classified this book as a \\"Wanna-be Agatha Christie Tale\\". My reaction is that it is not a \\"Wanna-be Agatha Christie Tale\\" rather it is a rather loving homage to Ms Christie, just as the first Fandorin story was a loving Homage to Ian Fleming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Working in the banking industry I was turned on to this book by a colleague and what a colossal waste of time reading this was. The vast majority of this book's models are outdated and if Mr. Saunders was trying to write a historical piece he has accomplished that in spades. Nothing in this book is relevant and it is obvious the esteemed Mr. Saunders lent his name to a very poor book that he probably should have glanced through if not read. Linda Allen should probably get some real world experience because she is wasting people's time with her research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great one-disc sampling of the whole Bossa Nova fad...","review":"The merger of cool American saxophone with sultry Brazilian folk sounds hit our shores in 1962, and was pretty much over by '65. While the craze was hot, it was everywhere. Now, 40 years later, it still pleases, especially because one never hears music like this on radio stations. Stan Getz was the USA's big champion of this style, and this CD takes selections from six of his vinyl LP's from the early '60's. Joining him are Antonio Carlos Jobim, composer, pianist and guitarist; singers Astrud and Joao Gilberto; vibraphonist Gary Burton and guitarist Jim Hall. All the biggest Bossa Nova hits are on here, in original versions. The mood is mostly mellow, but it's a happy hour overall. If you like jazz, and you don't have any of the original records sampled on this disc, don't be afraid to buy this. It is worth the price, by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought that the book was one of the best i have ever read","review":"This book was very down to earth and i thought was very excellently written.

It is about a young womans life and everything she did. I loved that the book was a true historical. This is a must read for any fan of Jenette Oke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very abstract, very high level, very old","review":"If you have to buy it for a class, get it. Otherwise, find something that was written more recently. Although the 2nd Edition shows a 2003 date, the vast majority of the text is obviously out of date and was written about 20 years ago. It has one chapter on object oriented design and it discusses it almost as if it were a passing fad. If there's a 3rd edition, let's hope it gets rewritten and doesn't just get a few references updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not care for her voice at all...","review":"A dramatic soprano must have power as well as a fine line of singing, well supported by her breath. One can hear that Ms.Marc may have the vocal power of a dramatic soprano, but she hasn't the correct breath support in order to prevent bad defects such as scooping and low intonation. She must improve her skills in order to sing with more agility and less forcing of her vocal cords."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alessandra Marc--THE BEST SOPRANO I have yet to find.","review":"5 STARS-- Pure, rich and full of emotion, this phenomenal collection of performances by Ms. Marc is the finest example of Soprano in my collection. To be appreciated and shared, this cd is a masterpiece.Scott Baty"},{"rating":"2","title":"The young Alessandra Marc begins her career beautifuly","review":"Despite the horrible photo on the cover,Ms Marc demonstrates here on this album why she has come to be one of the leading dramatic sopranos of our time. She commands with grace the Verdi excerpts and shows a great deal of artistic and technical poweress throughout. The most exciting part of the recital is the last piece \\"Dich Teure Halle\\" which allows us to see the begings of one of the most important wagernians of our times. The recording quality is'nt the best but it's good enough. The orchestra dosen't always mantain a good balance with Ms Marc, but it dosen't take away from her performance. You simply must have this if your a fan of dramatic sopranos."},{"rating":"2","title":"yodelling fan","review":"As previously mentioned -Randy Erwin has such a clear voice - I also purchased these two LP's on vinyl and am waiting to transer to cd - again \\"record player \\" problem - Now available on cd I will purchase - A Must for any Yodelling Fan - excelent C/W singing at its best - Well Done"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Forward","review":"The book is precise and clear in its wording meaning and many examples. The examples are the reason this book is so large plus the fact that every effort is made to make the font large so that every note, symbol and chord is clear and exactly where it needs to be. Also each topic is developed in a one-at-a-time manner so that students of harmony need not think about more than one topic at a time - a valuable attribute of a complex subject such as harmony. The examples on motive, phrase, and sequence are well done. Particularly remarkable are the choices of composer and work that Seigmeister has used throughout. Coverage is from intervals up until Modulation. Modulation is the beginning subject in the second volume.Although this book has much to recommend it, I would not want to use it for a course since it doesn't have problems for the student to work. Nevertheless the book would make a great supplement to any course that covers Harmony in the common practice period."},{"rating":"2","title":"super sleek and unbreakable","review":"I have the super treker and unbelievably have had it for almost 2 years. This is the strongest little clip ever. I bought two just because I always break them and really liked the style of this one. Well the second one is just laying around ...somewhere. They include extra stickys, which is handy if you buy a new car or a new phone. And with the durability of this product I'm sure you will need them. If you have a silver phone this will match great with your phone. The attachment that sticks to your phone is small and all silver metal. Just super!!con...The only reason it isn't a 5 star product. The clip is a little tough to get used to. You will be fumbling a bit trying to get it off the clip. Definitely worth the extra effort to get it off when it is so sleek and unbreakable."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRISTMAT GIFT","review":"It was a great Christmas gift for a great daughter who is a grown women with three children who only heard of Shirley Temple by name and never experienced viewing any of her movies.

I was a little worried since they weren't animated like her favorite shows she wouldn't be interested in watching them.

I also had no idea when I ordered these videos that you can watch them in black and white or in color which I think makes them even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoying dvds of Shirley Temple","review":"I purchased this mainly for when my 8-yr.old granddaughter comes over togive us a break from The Beverley Hill Billies which she absolutely loves!We both are enjoying these.

They arrived in a timely manner in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entry Level book...","review":"Digital Video Essentials is a very thoughtfully organized book.. It gently walks you through the entire process from your first take to burning your memories to DVD. It covers everything from the basics of videography to the more technical aspects of digital video.This book is geared towards the newbie videographer. It has a lot of information about basics like composition, shot preparation, and explanation of the basic technology behind digital video. It also covers the basics of iMovie and Ulead VideoStudio,. two entry-level digital video software packages.If you're new to digital video, and want a book that helps you get started with the very basics, this is a great book to get your feet wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY IT","review":"Its does not \\"Replaces Nokia BL-5F\\" as the \\"Product Features\\" say. It is a \\"BL-6C\\" as the \\"Product Details, Item model number: CLKBL6C\\" state.I ended up with a BL-6C that did not fit my N95. Customer support argued that I was wrong ordering the product even after I pointed them to these incongruences on the product page, but if I send them the battery back they could refund me.Since I live in Buenos Aires the price of shipping it back was more then that of the battery and they said they will not take care of that, so I had to go directly to Amazon for a solution. The credited my card soon enough. Great Amazon customer service!Horrible Seller customer service. They didn't even corrected the page!Stay away from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Sheets arrived with two top sheets and no bottom sheet.

Toddler sheets are hard to find but these were definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"If you are expecting to see an Aziza-style performance of her working her special brand of majic with the veil, you will be disappointed. Presentation is a bit flat (not like her in real life at a workshop at all) and only basic moves are taught. Good for the beginner dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing CD","review":"This CD is a huge disappointment to me. I love the organ music of Reger and Vierne, which is why I purchased the CD. David Craighead is a fine organist, from the famous Eastman School of Music of the prestigious University of Rochester. So, what went wrong? The organ and its acoustic space. The recording sounds as if it were made in a Kleenex Box underwater. There is no spaciousness,no reverberation. I would definitely not recommend this title to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Peformance, Recording","review":"The previous reviewer must have been listening to a different recording, or listening to it on inferior equipment. There is nothing wrong with this disc. This Reger/Vierne CD was engineered by the great John Eargle. The sound is clean and bright. That said, I prefer the sound of the Vierne Finale as played by Michael Farris on the Delos CDFrench Fireworks: The Symphonic Organonly because I like the sound of the Casavant organ used there more than the Rosales used here. David Craighead is the consummate organist. If you want an excellent CD with the Reger Sonata and the Vierne 6th Symphony this is as good as any, and the download price is excellent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin Drum and Bass beats!!!!!","review":"This has the most kickin drumm and bass beats that you'll everfind on a CD. The only thing I find weird about it is that they areall American originated,this is one of my favorite CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE for a first course in abstract algebra","review":"The major problem I have with Artin is his stubborn reliance in teaching group theory via linear algebra. In my experience, undergraduate students encountering group theory for the first time have only a limited background in linear algebra, so using this text book forces students to cover two (albeit closely related) subjects at once. Also, Artin's discussion of the major areas (groups, rings, fields) is sufficient for the geometric applications that he enjoys, but feels lacking in the general theory. This book could be useful for some classes, but using it for a first course in abstract algebra will be a major disservice to students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not disagree more","review":"I could not disagree more with the reviewer from Michigan. The book does attempt to stretch to cover a broad range of topics, but it is the examples that make the book interesting. Perhaps the other reader would be more interested in an engineering approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dummit and Foote is the Better Text","review":"According to other reviewers, Dummit and Foote is dumbed down and easier to read, whereas Artin is for the very elite. The simple fact is that \\"easier to read\\" means the book is better. Artin is stenographic in brevity. If you cannot figure something out on your own, Artin will not help you. You will need your instructor or a better book to explain it. And later, when you have finished a semester or two of algebra but you need to recall whether a certain group has normal subgroups or how to prove some boring, tedious thing about rings, Artin will have your question listed as an exercise (completely useless to you, as always). Dummit and Foote will have the proof you need or an example very similar worked in full, concrete detail. Perhaps that is dumbed down, but it's useful and it's better. If you didn't need help, you would not have referred to a book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic.......","review":"My professor started the course by telling us how this was not only an amazing textbook, but one that we surely would want to keep and reread from time to time. He then went on to show himself to be the worst teacher I have encountered in college. This book may be beautifully written but is not a good textbook. If I had a great knowledge of the material (for example, was a great and self-absorbed mathematician with little to no teaching skills) I am sure I would enjoy this book. However, it is an awful way to introduce already difficult material to undergraduates. Hopefully, with multiple supplementary texts and additional courses on Algebra I will be able to go back and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was thoroughly confusing, and poorly written","review":"This book is considered by many to be a classic. I consider it a classic waste of time. It does make an attempt at covering the whole gambit that is modern algebra, but sacrifices content to do it. There is a total lack of good examples. I CANNOT understate this. There are no useful examples in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Undergraduate Algebra Text","review":"Artin was my introduction to Abstract Algebra and I feel it does a great job of using linear Algebra as a motivation for more abstract Group theory. In fact I would venture to say that studying this book would give a thourough introduction to both abstract and linear algebra. The review by Munkres, however, should be enough for most people. NOTE as a general reference a more advanced book would probably work better (Lang, Jacobson, etc)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradoxically useless","review":"This book is useless for students enrolled in a college or university. As others mention, this book mimics lecture notes and doesn't follow the theorem-proof-example-excercise format. Why make a textbook of lecture notes? The students who learn from lectures don't need this book because they can attend real lectures, and this book is unusable for students who don't learn from lectures.EDIT: The presentation of the material is non-axiomatic, yet an axiomatic style is often what students are seeking when they turn away from lectures and turn to textbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little scissors","review":"great little scissors for my left handed little girl. she is working on perfecting the motor skills use for cutting. and nothing is more frustrating than trying to work out a skill with kid scissors that don't work.

Not a big deal, since my four year old didn't care whether it was in the packaging or not, but worth mentioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy with this product","review":"This cook pot is wonderful. The pot has the interlocking system outside andthis seems to be very convenient and easy to use. Previously I did purchase a cook pot which had the lock in the inside of the pot (somewhat a sliding mechanism) and that always had a tendency to get jammed. Finally I had to throw that in the trash.This one does not have the locking problem. One can cook pasta and rice very efficiently in this pot. The pot is a non stick one and can conveniently be washed in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pot EVER!!! Unfortunately they are not made anymore.","review":"This pot is wonderful. I have a larger one as well... (so glad I bought both at the time as now I can't buy a replacement). I wrote to the Frabosk company and they said they don't make it any longer.... Such a shame as the pots perform well and are light weight enough to make draining an easy task. My pots have lasted about 18 years. I wish they still made them as I would buy a replacement - I use it every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are really good slides but use caution before installing","review":"I installed these slides for drawers in a small coffee table for my daughter's living room. They are well made and work beautifully. Sadly, I left them on my work bench (out of the plastic wrap) and they got covered in saw dust. This caused a rough sliding action and I had to clean them (tedious but not difficult). My bad. I gave them a 4-star review because one slide was missing a piece of plastic that prevented over-extension of the slide. Since this didn't really effect the slide operation, I went ahead and installed it as we had to drive to Chicago to deliver the coffee table to my daughter the following day. This product was shipped quick so I believe the vendor (Woodworkers Hardware) would have replaced the slide if I had requested.This is my first review of a Amazon purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Essence","review":"One of the things I enjoyed was how simple the book explained the Spiritual Essence of Angels. Throughout the book as you read, you'll begin comparing and finding similarites between what the author wrote and what you're experiencing. It's also good if you don't have the time to read because it's a small sized book yet it contains so much interesting information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overview of every DBMS buzzword, but lacks of substance","review":"Despite the size of this book, no in-depth details are given about Data Warehousing or OLAP. Product evaluations are minimal to the point of being useless. (OLAP product descriptions include Powerplay , but not Essbase or Express.) The data mining chapters are useful, but other books contain much more detail.I would recommend sticking to books dedicated to single topics such as Kimball's \\"Datawarehouse Toolkit\\" and Thomsen's \\"OLAP Solutions\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thorough","review":"A very thorough treatise on data mining.

Although it says for IA-64, the concept is pretty much the same if you are looking for IA-32, great book, definitely recommend it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this book mainly for understanding Linux Kernel's Virtual Memory Management. Reading The Chapter on Virtual Memory was a breeze. This chapter alone is worth the price of the book. Although some of the information no longer holds true for Linux's kernel which is acceptable given the fact Linux kernel changes just too fast. For Example, linux kernel now uses 4 level page tables, but according to the book it uses 3 level page table which obviously is not wrong but it is simply outdated information.Disregarding the specifics, it does a nice overall job of explaining the kernel internals. The use of simplified diagrams by the author instead of having a code commentary to make you understand the stuff makes this book an absolute fun read. After reading the book though, you have to patch your knowledge database by getting updated with the latest stuff. Hence, the 4 four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"searchable index","review":"Not only it this a fine book, the book mentions the website: www.lia64.org/book which has a book search feature.

This CD is wonderful. Great dark moody pieces. The opening track is on a lot of compilations and I feel falls short of other tracks on the album like The Giant of Illionis, or My sisters Tinys hands.

To my mind, this is the first time in this genre that Dan has pulled it all together (his \\"Hemispheres\\" is much more a \\"world music\\" album). And it always helps when you can get other top class musicians to contribute, like Boney James' lovely featured sax on \\"In Your Eyes\\".Dan's playing early in his career was competent but uninspiring. But he has developed constantly over the years, and is now a genuine A-list keyboardist, as well as a mature, high quality composer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not differentiated...","review":"You will hardly differentiate this album from many others sounding alike.

The premise is thin and the story line starts off slow and gets slower. You can't identify with any characters, (which are more two-dimensional that I've seen in any published work in years.) The finish is almost a relief, and you can see it coming by the third chapter. I'd avoid this book, even in paperback. Anyone want my copy? Cheap?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was hoping for a more humorous book. I loved the MYTH, Phule, and Time Scout series. This book was dull and the plot was not very original. After 100 pages, I jumped to the climax of the story near the end of the book so I could finally be done with it. I wished I had at least waited for the paperback edition. Although I don't think paying a cheaper price would make up for the time I wasted on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthwhile even at bargain basement price","review":"I agree with everything reviewer J. Martin said: two great writers but no effort showing here, 2 dimensional characters, lack of any development in plot or characters as the book continues. I found myself wincing throughout the book at bad dialogue, bad internal monologue, just ... bad writing, as though it was someone's senior high school project. My only addition is this: I bought the hardcopy from a bargain bin at my local store for $1.00. This should have been a warning, but I thought hey, maybe it was a print overrun. Please keep in mind I am a fan of both of these writers. But after reading E.Godz ... I wanted my dollar back.

There seems to be a lot to work with here---but the end falls so short of its possibilities.The action takes place in the span of a few days---making it difficult to believe the \\"eternal\\" love that manifests suddenly in the last chapter.There are far too many questions unanswered about these characters to develop any attachment to them--- and as a result the choices they make seem arbitrary and disjointed.There may be great potential in the series if the characters are \\"fleshed out\\" a bit---but I withold judgment until further reading in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money.","review":"I was really surprised with this book.

Also I feel that it would also be helpful for them to tell you in the description that it does indeed come with its own hard plastic case. I didn't know this and bought the nicer starrett case to keep it in, but I didn't really need it.

Mest is amazing.What's the dillio and Hotel room are probably my favorite songs on the whole CD. But all of them are great. Long days. long nights, Drawing Board, Girl for tonight, and Last time are all close seconds. This is a CD i can listen to over and over again at any time of the day. Mest has great talent.

Really, how many times do we need to hear the exact same punk album we've been hearing since the early 90's? Enough already. For some real punk, try Dillinger Four's newest or the Five Fingers of Dr. X compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Punk that stands out from the crowd","review":"A good pop punk band that has a lot going for them. They're young(so they have lots of time to get even better), they're pretty(so they get all the hot girls swoonin' so you can look to meet some cute punk-rock chicks at their shows), and they're not afraid to play fast, which most poppy bands don't seem to want to do these days. This album most reminds me of \\"Life In General\\" era MXPX, which is a big compliment as far as I'm concerned. The only really bad spots are when they try to play some rediculous reggae/ska guitar riffs behind some of the slower parts. I'm sure this silliness is intentional, as all good pop punk bands do tend to be quite silly, but it still sounds awful. But fortunately those are all towards the beginning of the album, so once past those, you're home free."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun pop/punk","review":"these guys aren't real punk, their lyrics aren't emotionally driven and their sound isn't original...BUT...this cd is still worth buying just for something to listen to in the summer. it's fun pop/punk, just right for hanging out with friends or driving with the windows down, it's worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Pop Punk At its Best....and midgest adorn the cover!","review":"I am a die hard ska-punk fanatic.

Though Chicago based, this band's sound is straight outta So Cal. \\"What's the Dillio\\" is an incredible song. It is not musically powerful or emotionally inspiring, but the pure funkbeat and sound get your off yo bum and on the floor. I believe the best song, though most are great, is \\"Drawing Board\\".

Mest doesn't bring much new to the table but so what, we're not all looking for deep artistic changes, we're just looking for good music to have fun to and that's what Mest is.

This movie brought my tears to the surface of my heart and they spilled over as I thought of the many places of my own life and how much I need God.

It shows the deep faith and deep love the husband had for his wife and for his belief in Christ.

Since I'm part of a world-wide movement to observe the Luke 10:10 principles for prayer evangelism to Transform Our World, I can't subscribe to the unbiblical concept of relegating leadership of help for the city to Mary. The Holy Spirit gives gifts and callings to all Christians to be marketplace ministers -- in education, government, and business -- for bringing the Kingdom of God to their cities. I so enjoyed and believe the JOSHUA book because it took personally the call of Christ, but this one is too focused on Catholic doctrine for me to share or apply to my experience of Jesus' love for our cities.

Though the story was okay, I was disappointed in the book, overall. As others have stated, the writing was clumsy - a bit amateurish. The characterization of these inner-city residents was not believable. Still, wading through the less-than-stellar writing would have been worth it for the sake of a really good story. The bigger issue is that the theology presented in the book is atrociously unbiblical. The last thing we need is one more universalist, but that is just what we get in this story. Worse, we get a JESUS who is universalist. What a grievous misrepresentation of the King of kings and Lord of lords! Repeatedly, Joshua equates Yahweh and Allah, Islam and Christianity. Politically correct but Biblically INcorrect, this book is going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story...poor writing","review":"The Joshua series was suggested to me by a friend, so I bought the book.

They soon realized it was a great idea. They are safe non toxic I have never had one leak or even break super safe around kids. The little tab at the end where you can hang it by a string. On all my tents there is a little loop at the center. I just cut a slit in the side of where the whole is and it acts like a hook.The light really lasts as long and in most cases longer.

I'm usually very \\"Go Team\\" about any music that comes out of my fair city, but was never able to fall in love with them the way I was with Seger, Nugent and - to a degree - Eminem. So I went out and bought two CDs and this book. I must say that this book did more to endear them to me than their CDs did. It was informative, well-written and easy to follow. Buy this book, it's a good read. If you're a fan, you'll learn a lot that you didn't know. And if you're a casual observer as I was, it's a great introduction to this colorful act.

Some of the songs on the album have been sung by better singers who emote every sense of what was meant to be conveyed. However, in the hands of Kathie Lee, songs are reduced to little more than collections of notes, strung together in a barely tolerable manor. More emotion and honesty can be found can be found in a letter to the editor of Husler magazine than in this collection of bloopers and verbal diarrhea.

This is the only NOW CD I have ever wanted. It has all the great summer pool songs from '00 -- it didn't leave too many hits hanging (maybe Spears' 'Oops!'). A lot of the songs are dance-able, a lot are singable, and I have a lot of memories with all of them. This is a great compilation and it's for anyone who wants to capture the feeling of the first summer of the millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is very cool!!!","review":"I like almost all of the tracks on this cd,but some i don't. It is a good cd though because it has several types of music on it and it is very diverse. It would be a good cd for almost everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weak!!! A big let down!","review":"This is by far the weakest volume in the Now series. I personally bought the CD only because of Smash Mouth's hit \\"Then the morning comes\\" and I was hoping to be rewarded with other great songs that would come in the CD. Sadly though, the only other track I liked was Macy Gray's hit. The rest, I felt, was fluff that I didn't even liked hearing on the radio.I'm sure the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears has better songs than what was placed in this CD. And also know that there are better Alternative tracks out there. I feel the producers of Now: Volume 4 did us (Now through Now: Volume 3 customers) an injustice with this volume. I liked the first 3 Now volumes, but this one just plain sucked! A big dissappointment and a big let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now That Is Mostly What I Call Music","review":"Pretty good cd. Alot of great songs, except Macy Gray. I wouldn't have anything against her except for the fact that her song is played on the radio every single hour and it has no beet. But all in all a good cd and a recamend a purchase of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"an ok CD i guess","review":"i only gave this cd a 5 because hanson was on it but oh well. i guess this is an ok cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely for TRL fans","review":"I don't have this cd (and I don't plan to get it, either!), but I've seen the ad enough to know what's on here and I have to say something. Come on. Annyone who listens to the radio has heard these songs. Most of the songs are teeny-bopper pop (ie,Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, etc.) Blink 182 is on here, but the song is All the Small Things, a HUGE victim of overplay. And the songs by Macy Gray & Savage Garden are awful, even though they've both had good songs before (see \\"Do Something\\" by Macy Gray, \\"Crash & Burn\\" by Savage Garden).The kids who watch TRL religiously will probably like this for simply not knowing better. Everyone eles will roll their eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now this is what I call crap","review":"Music is KISS, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, L7, W.A.S.P., AC/DC, and Slayer.

What I found was that I really like the songs I bought it for, and the others are just okay. I really think that the CD gives some of the best of all types of music. From Eiffel 65, to Macy Gray and Smashmouth, there has to be something there you'll like. And there were even a few surprise songs like Next Time Around by Hanson which I had never heard and they are just awesome. Sure there will probably be a few songs you won't care for, but it is really worth the variety of very good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"New For My Collection!","review":"This CD rocks! I just got this CD today, and very good to my collection! I have NOW 13,15,16,and i now have NOW 4! Blue is my favorite song on here! Although I don't like it having only 18 tracks but is still cool!

What a thrill! Each song has a fresh, harmonious sound that welcomes you from the very beginning. The collection of song material is simply beautiful and full of life. Olivia's voice is perfect! She delivers such emotion and style to each song. It's funny but I have never had any of these songs in my music collection, other than Karen's Rainy Days.... I have known these songs most of my life, hearing them in the background, on the radio or from a friend. But now, Olivia has created her own beautiful style for each of them and I simply love it. Thank you Olivia for this wonderful gift of music.Douglas Gantt ShullAtlanta, Georgia"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG dissapointment from a BIG Olivia Fan","review":"She has one of the most beautiful voices, and is one of my all-time favorite female singers. This album is terrible though. Unlike Agnetha Faltskog, K.D. Lang, and Alison Moyet, who (in my humble opinion)succeeded recently with their \\"cover\\" albums (made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past), Olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs, production, and style of singing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"1970's pop star...still at it!","review":"Those with an interest in nostalgia and 70's pop culture might be advised to sample this album. The sometimes charming seventies songbird surfaces from time to time with new albums, and her efforts are a mixed lot. Ranging from the unbearable \\"Gaia\\" to the ill-advised \\"Back With A Heart\\",both filled with unmemorable new tunes, this latest effort is a cover version album. Many reviewers choose to fault Olivia's weakened voice, but I have a fondness for her and we must allow our singing stars to age, it's natural. I found my copy of this CD for a buck, but it's enjoyable enough to purchase at full price. There's no question, it's the most listenable album she's recorded since the end of the 1970s, and is perhaps a perfect ending to a career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ceasars","review":"After reading I Claudius, my interest wanted to learn more of early Roman history after the Claudian reign.This book provided what I was looking for and I enjoyed it immensley.Would recommend it to any person interested in early Rome as regards to the Ceasars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Emperors Up to No Good!","review":"This set of biographies of the first twelve Roman emperors is a fascinating and enjoyable read. Through chatty anecdotes and gossip, Suetonius builds up a vivid picture not only of the characters of the remarkable men about whom he writes but also reveals much about life and attitudes in the the late Republic and Early Empire as he reports on graffiti, popular rumour, superstition and religion and the reactions of crowds at the theatre.Though Suetonius doubtless recycled plenty of rumour and gossip, it must be remembered that he also worked for the Emperor Hadrian and had access to palace archives, so for example, excerpts from letters between Augustus and Livia can provide important evidence.Some of the content is shocking and/or salacious as Suetonius leaves no stone unturned digging up squalid allegations about the private life of emperors such as Tiberius, Caligula and Nero - so be warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Epic","review":"I had heard that Seutonius' usage of what were household names referring to prominent Roman citizens could be initially slightly discouraging for the casual reader - but they weren't. It is simply an epic read. Structured, to the point, at times gory, but gives great insight into the personalities of Julius Caesar and the following 11 emperors, and a glimpse into Roman life at the time. I couldn't put it down. It may be difficult to dissect Seutonius' own influence from the writing, but that just adds to the drama..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased this book for class","review":"I purchased this book for a Greek and Roman history class. I have only started reading the section on Julius Caesar but I am enjoying it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"very off beat and odd","review":"I'm sure most people will come to Fitzgerald through her novels, so I have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories. I still haven't decided if I enjoyed the collection, but they are unique. I thought the first story was by far the best, but after that, the quality varied widely. Unlike a classic short story writer (someone like Guy de Mauppassant), these stories have NO resolution for the most part. In fact, they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the major key. Discordant is the word I'm looking for. The settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries. I suspect most would enjoy her novels more (I am certainly heading in that direction to read them next), but I can't say since I haven't read them myself. Overall, I found this collection a bit unsettling, but still well written. I'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than I did on this first encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro keyboard adventure!","review":"Former beastie boy keyboard player money mark (mark ramos nishta), brings more than just bits and pieces of keyboard and guitar rifs to his second album,push the button envokes a blur of emotions and retro senses.

But in both cases, I was amazed by the musical and songwriting ability of this quartet. No personal disappointment, except for knowing that bands that don't follow a standard don't get the same play as others, and never really get a fair shot at true popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While this is a very talented group with excellent harmony, their second offering was a big disappointment. After listening to this CD several times, I just couldn't find a title that \\"caught on\\". It was almost like they were looking for a new sound. Their first album, DAKOTA MOON was far superior. I couldn't believe the two albums came from the same group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystery in these pages...","review":"Throughout the book, you'll be asking yourself if Francesca truly is the religious icon her community comes to believe she is. Is she carrying an immaculate conception? Can she heal people with a touch? Well told, this story is one you'll find as thought provoking as it is entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This story is about a fourteen year old girl struggling with who she is, what's going on in the world around her and how she fits in to the whole mess. It is about the very human desire to believe in a higher power, something perfect. I really felt that this young girl could be the Virgin Mary in the beginning and middle parts of the book. I was filled with anticipation. All of that sort of unraveled towards the end, but this was still a very enjoyable read. I felt the writing was pitch perfect and I liked that it was told from the point of view of four different narrators as they each bring something new to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for anyone!","review":"Some say that this book is hard to read because of the different characters telling the story, however, there are only four narrators telling the story which I thought made the book more interesting to read.The Annunciation of Francescia Dunn tells the story of a 14 yr old who suddenly finds people are worshiping her. Throughout the book you feel for her, and you feel for her mother and the people around her. The book keeps you hoping that she really is the virgin mother, with each chapter you wait to see what new developments take place. Not until the very last chapter does the full picture come together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've read in years!","review":"I loved it! Great, off-beat sense of humor; refined yet cunning characters; an interesting and absorbing novel! I was captivated and impressed by such a refreshingly amusing and insightful story. It is engaging, page by page, and ends with a satisfying exhale. The author's witty descriptions are colorful, unique and beyond compare. I honestly haven't read a novel like this in years (Grisham should worry). I highly recommend \\"Noise Rage\\" to anyone with a scrap of intelligence. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it's out of print","review":"I found this book at my parents house and asked to borrow it for some reading material for a plane trip. Parts of it were interesting and I actually liked the authors unusual sense of humor, but it really didn't hold my attention the whole time and the transitions between the different scenes were pretty jumpy and didn't flow well. It wasn't a bad book at all, but certainly nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming","review":"Only vaguely reminiscent of the humor and zip of the original series.Almost everything outside of Rocky and Bullwinkle in this movie comes off poorly, and the squirrel and moose only have a few good lines themselves even. A clinker and poorly realized. Treasure the original cartoon series by Jay Ward. Long live Frostbite Falls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute - But Inferior to the source","review":"The high point of the film is when Robert DeNiro, as Fearless Leader, confronts Boris (Jason Alexander) over the news the \\"Moose and Squirrel\\" have escaped again.DeNiro adjusts his monacle, and asks:\\"Are you talking to me? Are you talking to ME? You MUST be talking to me, because no one else is here!\\"Of course, if you've never seen 'Taxi Driver' it's not funny.Since I have, I fell off the couch..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childhood Memories Destroyed","review":"Oh how disappointing!!!!!Rocky and Bullwinkle should have been a natural for those of us who grew up with the cartoon. The simple, yet endearing, themes of the cartoons could have been produced via the marvels of modern computer animation into a funfest for both kids and adults. Sadly, this attempt missed every single mark.The story line had promise, but it was left unfulfilled. The implementation appeared to be clearly aimed at 4 year olds, except the adult themes and gimicks wouldn't have been understood. The characters were petty, lacking in charm, and poorly acted. How, in the name of heaven, did they miss the opportunity to cast Danny DeVito as Boris???? Would have been a natural. The female lead came across as selfish and inept (but not in a funny way).It's hard to imagine how they could have made such a stinker out of such a beloved cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tis better to let sleeping moose (or squirrel) lie!","review":"That may not be an actual proverb, but it sums up what was wrong with this production. While Jay Ward's classic (surprisingly one season only) show is remembered for its innovative blending of the political and the satirical in the guise of a cartoon, this film will simply be remembered as the one that Robert De Niro SHOULDN'T have made.Thankfully, June Foray, the original voice of both \\"Rocky\\" and \\"Natasha\\", is on hand. That is more a tribute to her talent than it is the worth of the film. Jason Alexander is No Paul Frees (\\"Boris\\" in the series).Keith Scott is quite good as \\"Bullwinkle\\" (initially done by Bill Scott) but his turn as the \\"narrator\\" falls short. William Conrad (AKA radio's \\"Matt Dillon\\" and television's \\"Cannon) provided the original's \\"bite.\\"All in all, it may have looked good on paper..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle","review":"This move made Dudley Do-right look like the Piture of the year. I could not believe that Robert DeNiro even was in this movie. This was a movie of has been who even sunk to their lowest by being in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am not a Rocky & Bullwinkle fan, however, I enjoyed it!","review":"Being that I am not a fan of Rocky & Bullwinkle, I was not too thrilled to go & see the movie. However, since there are not too many movies that are decent for ahild to watch & because mt five year old son showed an interest, we went to see it.I was immediately drawn in by Rene Russo's excellent portrayal as NaTasha. I found the script to be funny & it helped me to realize in a comical & relaxing way how far we have come since 1964.I also must say that I disagree with the reviewer below. I have heard & seen some Rocky & Bullwinkle shows on rerun & I am part of the X Generation. Therefore, to immediately dismiss that Piper Perabo's character would not know of Rocky & Bullwinkle is unfair.In closing, we saw it twice at the movie theatre & about seven times on home video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"A movie based on Rocky & Bullwinkle could have been a really funny movie and still have been kid safe, but this was not the case. Mostly because it wasn't funny, but also because there were too many slow moments and just too many things that did not need be in the movie(do we really need to be told what a fax and e-mail are?). There were a few funny moments in the movie, most of which was acknowledging that a previous joke was bad, but the movie lack too much of the cleverness of the orignal series. Also the animated sequences are a poor attempt at recreating the TV shows animation style. The only thing that I like that really stode out was the Dudley Do-Rightish type name of Piper Perabo's character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinton Schwartz' s review for Rocky and Bullwinkle","review":"I don't this is even a good film because 30 minutes into the film I was bored to death I'd rather watch a Pokemon movie than this movie and why I trew the copy I recorded away forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This is maybe the worst movie since \\"the Invasion of the Killer Tomatoes.\\" It is boring and lacks any creativity. \\"The Killer Tomatoes\\" was much more creative and interesting.I enjoyed the original Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons. Unfortunately, the transformation from animation to real human and animal characters does not work in this movie. The characters are real goofy and boring and simply awful. This movie does not do justice to the original cartoons. I do not see anything of what others describe as \\"whimsical, funny--at times hysterical.\\" This is simply not true. I suggest that you save your money and buy a different movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great at what it is","review":"This is a genuinely fun film to watch. We just rented the tape and we watched it 3 times in 24 hours. We had a blast and the kids enjoyed it (though much of the humor went over their heads). The animation was decidedly so-so, but the humor was good enough I didn't mind. I counted 2 \\"bad\\" words in the whole thing and Karen Sympathy learns a lesson about honesty (not sure how true a morality lesson is to the original, but it fit well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable movie.","review":"This movie, by no means is a \\"film\\" or a classic in anyway, but does it really need to be? I thought the cameo's were great, the one liners were hysterical and Bullwinkle and Rocky as always made you want to jump up and say \\"awwww!\\" I fell in love with the lovable two all over again. Piper Perabo held her own, and did a sweet/tough job of playing her serious, fumbling character. Way to go Rocky and Bullwinkle, your movie was a success in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST EVER MADE","review":"This would have to be one of the worst films ever made in Hollywood history. All the actors must have been hard up for money to even think about reading the bad script. Thumbs down to this garbage. I could only watch about 20 minutes of this film and took it straight back to my video dealer and got my money back.....Don't even think about hiring or buying this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This movie was downright PAINFUL to sit through. I actually fell asleep (in the theater, mind you) somewhere past the middle, and that NEVER happens when I am watching a movie! I can enjoy pun oriented humor with the best of them, but this movie was riddled with really, really bad puns. The overly simple plot could have (should have) been compressed to under an hour. It's a shame, because the majority of the cast was top-notch talent; they just weren't given much to work with. From the kids perspective, my nine year old daughter didn't like it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe they could mess this up...","review":"You would think something which was based on this classic, zany cartoon just couldnt miss but somehow the creators were off by a cartoon mile. The script is horrible...and there isnt a single funny gag in this thankfully short (82 minute) movie. The effects are good if not eye popping but thankfully the strength of the original franchise will withstand this forgettable and misdirected assault."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of FUN!","review":"I sometimes wonder if I and Professional Movie Reviewers REALLY looked at the same film. If I laugh out loud four times when I watch the movie alone, it MUST be tremendously funny. I laughed twice and snickered twice - not bad! My first laugh was at a Robert DeNiro line. DeNiro does a great job of bringing Fearless Leader to life. To me, it can't be easy for an actor to bring to life a well known, established cartoon character. (Then too,look what Hugh Jackman did with The Wolverine.) Add to this the talents of Jason Alexander as Boris and Rene Russo as Natashia along with the original character voices and you have a WELL DONE Fantasy-Adventure tale. Plot? You're gonna' tell me that THAT much attention to plot was also given in the original series? \\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\\" In my eyes, it was GORGEOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got it right the first time","review":"Robert DeNiro is slighly amusing and the voice of Bullwinkle in this film is by the guy who recently wrote and excellent bio of Jay Ward (and Alex Anderson, the true inventor of Bullwinkle) and his wonderful cartoons. However, the plot involves making people watch bad television. I wonder if they should add bad movies too. There is really no need to bother with this film if you're a fan of the original cartoons. As Spanky Mc Farland (of Little Rascals/Our Gang fame) said upon the release of the 1990s Little rascals remake, \\"Why bother? We got it right the first time!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Is real lead balloon, Natasha. Watch old originals instead.","review":"The TV show was fast, sharp, and funny, but the movie is slow, dull, and pointless. Fans may have a hard time reconciling the original cartoon characters with these pale carbons: Rocky, formerly the brains of the outfit, is now a forlorn wimp, and Bullwinkle, who used to fire off hilarious puns anytime and anywhere, now offers a few tired one-liners as tedious live-action characters monopolize the footage (the only bright spot is Robert DeNiro's Fearless Leader). This effort would almost certainly have worked better as a 100% animated feature. If you don't know the Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons you might get a few laughs out of this, but you'll wonder how the show ever got such a following. Diehard fans of \\"moose and squirrel\\" will be disappointed. Sadly, Bill Scott (the original voice of Bullwinkle and co-creator of the TV show) does not get any screen credit at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desription of the methods and materials of 40 years ago.","review":"This book is a republication of what appears to be \\"modern\\" methods of the 1950s.

In other words, there is some accurate information, and the facts in and of themselves are usually correct. However, the bias is terrible. The title of the book is misleading, as it makes the book seem to be an unbiased historical account of the Church in the 20th century. It is, rather, one man's opinion of the Church's actions and its motives behind them, and furthermore (and this is the worst part) what the Church ought to do in the future. If you want to read an editorial with bad logic, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very British - Very heavy","review":"This 2006 Release shows these NWOBHM legends still soldiering on, doing whta they do best.

If the author would drop all the finger salutes and the gutter language, which slows down the plot, the stories would read much better. The way that he portrays spec ops folk, makes them all to be pyscho paranoid people. Any language has its own dignity, and the use of its lower class slang has a dimunitive effect on it. Try replacing f--k you with fornicate you. Not as much punch for the semi-literate, I guess. There are plenty of adventure novels that so not resort to constant sexual referrals!

The book was so boring, I did not even finish it. The only thing different from the past books is the location. Same characters, same plot, same amount of ammunition.

At least Red Cell was believeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst RW book to date.","review":"This book was in a word - BORING! I have read all the books in this series to date and have enjoyed most of them. What I enjoyed about Marcinko's stories is that he makes it very realistic, in that you actually feel like you are on one of his ops, or are at the very least hearing him recant something from his real lifwe exploits. It really lacked depth and originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT blast! Blues, Rock 'n Roll, what else do you need?","review":"I really enjoyed this CD. It is one of those \\"turn-it-up-roll-down-the-car-windows\\" types of CDs.

I didn't get a good hold on the characters. There descriptions vague, so I couldn't picture them. I know the object of it was forgiveness, especially forgiving one's self. But the logic of holding on to something for 18yrs and blaming not only yourself but your childhood friend seemed unrealistic. Especially when the parents have been their for the children so that they could heal. Although Ms. Reeves weaved in another plot along with it, that was more interesting than this inner turmoil her female character had going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame plot","review":"This was an exceptionally lame offering, not up to the usual standards of a McCaffrey story. The plot has great gaping holes, and the writing in general makes it much harder to believe in the events of the story than is typical for Anne McCaffrey. Definitely not worth the cover price, no matter what the discount! Now I am wary of anything Todd McCaffrey collaborates with his mother on, if this is what he brings to a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I have been an avid \\"Pern\\" fan ever since publication of the very first book. Granted, not every book in the series has lived up to expectations, but none were total disappointments until now.Dragon Kin seems written for children, not for an adult audience. Hollow stickfigure characters and unbelievable action. I'm very glad I read a library copy rather than wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchwhers can do *what*?","review":"I bought this book with high hopes for the continuing saga of Pern. All I can say at this point is that Todd obviously has a \\"get out of canon free\\" card. The characters were mildly interesting, but I found myself shaking my head over the number of times he \\"Mary Sues\\" the watchwhers. Part of what makes Pern, Pern, are the dragons, whers and firelizards. When the basic design and function are changed, and extra abilities are added to the unique creatures (like the whers), it makes me not want to continue reading the series.I have just about *every* Pern book out there (including the hard-to-find \\"The People of Pern\\") but I will not be adding any of these collaborations to my collection of Pernese gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"I always have high hopes for a new Pern book.

This is a lovely new book and gives us hope for more and more in this great series. It was especially nice after buying two \\"new\\" books from this author and finding they were old books with a new title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Baffling","review":"This book is BAD.Embarrassingly bad. I cannot imagine why or indeed how this book was ever printed.Anne and Todd Mccaffrey should get a new editor and fast! This is one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read, and I am an avid reader.This is one of the very few books I can remember not finishing, the other being Cold Mountain (a laughable book). The dialogue was repetitive,phony,amateurish and uninteresting.The plot was non-existant and boring. I don't understand the purpose of the new Pern books.Are they going to re-hash the same plot lines,character types ad nauseum? I was wholly expecting after Skies of Pern that the next novel would involve the story of Pern meeting people from other worlds. After all, Pern was an interstellar colony. That would have been interesting! Too bad. I won't read any more of the new Pern books,I'm sure. I find the positive reviews in this for this book quite disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many inconsistensies!","review":"I did enjoy Dragon's Kin by Anne and Todd McCaffrey, but I thought that it had alot of inconsistencies.*spoilers*At one pointt in the book, Anne(or possibly Todd) tells us that whers always base their name on their handler's name, hence Kindan's wher calling herself Kisk at first and later Nuellsk when she bonds with Nuella. She also tells us that their names always end in -sk. This really irritated me because in another book(The Masterharper of Pern, I think), there is a watchwher named Burr. Did anyone else notice this? It was almost as annoying as the mixup involving Larth, Lytol's dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"filler\\" novel","review":"I read this book with some apprehension when I saw that Ms. McCaffrey had let her son co-author it, and the apprehension was completely justified. I think the series got so huge that she gave up on writing with any elegance or style (not that she was an amazing writer to start out with, but her teen fiction series Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, Dragondrums was very nicely executed) and just wanted to fill in the gaps in Pern's history. That's why I kept reading her novels after the first few - the world is addictive, and it's not often an author gives you such a complete picture of a universe. However, that's no excuse not to put some effort into making the stories readable. I don't care if he's her son - she should be able to tell him, \\"Son, you need to learn to write.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB","review":"Seems to me that a people who can travel to and settle a distant planet would not be relying on specially bred dragons to burn away killer \\"threadfall\\" emanating from a sister plant.Threadfall = Thin silvery wisps (of what?) that grew on and sucked the life out of every thing it touched. \\"Turning soil into lifeless dirt, searing through flesh to leave nothing more than charred bone.

DAH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother.","review":"I was disappointed to discover that I can't give zero stars for a review - this book doesn't even deserve one.I was fond of the Pern books when I was younger, so I read this one because of that remembered fondness, and because I was curious to see how Todd McCaffrey would handle the world of Pern. I'm afraid to say that the answer is, not very well. To be blunt, I found the writing amateurish, the characters shallow and uninteresting, the songs sounding like the efforts of an uninspired junior-high student, and the \\"science\\" beyond horrible.If you like Pern, don't read this book. It'll only disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I was EXTREMELY dissapointed by this book. I expected something similar in style to the previous books. Instead I found a book with passages that were blatant copies from previous books, and an attempt to imulate their style. It failed miserably. I realize Todd is trying to make it in tandem with his mother, but their styles are too different, and it turns out to be a miserable mix. The book doesn't keep in sequence of events. There are way too many inconsistencies and disagreements. For anyone who's been following the Dragonriders series, BEWARE!!! You'll probably be as irritated and enraged as I was. I was never more dissapointed with any other book as I was with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. Unlike the other books in the Pern series, this book was written through perspective of children and seemingly for children. It was lacking any of the complexity of a book written for adults. On top of that, the first half of the book dragged with little to no action. The pace picked up in the second half but the plot of the second half seemed poorly developed. Throughout the book, the reader is continuously \\"told\\" what is going on and rarely allowed to \\"discover\\" anything new about the story or characters. This is especially true in the second half and gives the book a very shallow feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the worst","review":"but definitely fighting the Dolphins of Pern for that title. There is nothing much to be done about it; it might be a nice present for children but it is lacking about everything that made books like \\"The White Dragon\\" so special. I guess Pern just ran out of news."},{"rating":"2","title":"ffantasy","review":"II always enjoy anne mcaffrey. She alway does great fantasy. I finally found out this form of dragon came to be. I liked the ending also, everybody became happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon's Kin","review":"Watch Whers are perhaps the most scorned creatures on Pern. With neither the cuteness of firelizards or the regalness and majesty of dragons, these ugly creatures are looked down upon, relegated to darkness both because they can not bear the light and because no one can stand to see them. Yet, they are essential to the survival of Pern, especially to the mining communities were this book is set. With their handlers, their relationship somewhat mirrors that of the dragonrider and dragon, but not totally. Still, the mother and son team manages to mine a story from the bond between one handler and his beast. However, none of the characters, human or otherwise, wins readers' allegiance as Lessa, Mennolly, Robinton, or F'Lar has in the past. The main point of this novel is apparently merely to return the readers to Pern, but re-reading one of the older books would suit that purpose better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon's Kin","review":"very disappointed.

Instead, it interviews the reporters about where they were and what they did when the saw the Buckner play or Vinatieri's kick. I live and breathe for Boston sports and this DVD bored me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk...","review":"If you like lots of talking and pictures, then this is the DVD for you. I was expecting much more footage and excitment, something this DVD was sorely lacking. Instead of feeling the \\"goosebumps\\" I was yawning. I thought this was going to be more like the DVD \\"City of Champions: The Best of Boston Sports\\", but it was anything but. City of Champions uses music from bands like Aerosmith and Pearl Jam to bring the moments to life. Here, they just sit there. Almost unexciting. If you want a grandfather's tale of boston sports legends, then this is for you. If you want to scream into your TV and get out of your seat and cheer, then get City of Champions. It's by far the best Sports DVD I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for developing a motion control design sequence!!","review":"As a purely mechanical engineer for years, I've recently been tossed into motion control. Huge difference in design requirements. I had to identify the new and learn all I could about it fast. This book is the best for laying out a design sequence and covering all the bases. The expertise of the author is obvious but he does leave some holes in information that a rookie like me really needs. This is a very minor flaw, as I have found other books for these details. For design sequence and checklist this book is a good one to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"American in Paris highlight!","review":"The real reason for this purchase is for the performance of Gershwin's American In Paris. This is an extended version, about an extra 5 minutes, that really in the style of a jazz rendition of a classic. The variations are crisp and keeps the music true to the rest of the work. I am absolutely excited that I am able to get this version in my files of great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This main character in this book didn't need a man as much as she needed mood stabilizers. Every other page was how she \\"flew into a rage\\" about a comment from her love interest. Also this book has only the slightest relationship to the Titanic. Very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best shaving cream I've ever tried. It's a bit expensive, but a tub lasts me about six months, so I figure it's a relatively cheap indulgence. It smells great, and it feels wonderful on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good lather","review":"I have to say, Taylor of Old Bond Street makes a good shaving cream. I put very little on my brush, rub it on my face and then go back and re-wet the brush and then rub some more. The cream lathers up incredibly thick. My skin is fairly sensitive and this cream protects my face like none other that I have tried. The lavendar smell is not overly strong and could be a little richer. Other than that, the increase in quality over a grocery store cream or gel is worth in the increase in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the thorns","review":"I adore TOBS products, I really believe they are of great quality and value. This particular shave cream delivers on the slick cushioning that users have come to expect. I cannot fault it on that aspect... however, the scent, the scent is dreadful. Sorry to say that I couldn't wait to wash this off and be rid of it forever.The aroma is of \\"fake\\" rose and has to my senses, a chemical smell that I simply couldn't abide. It did give me a great and comfortable shave, but it seemed I was enveloped in a cloud of sickly awfulness that wouldn't go away easily.A great product, but this one is not for me.Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shaving creams","review":"This is one of the best shaving creams on the market. It takes very little amount of cream to make a good lather (used with a badger brush) and exfoliates like any anything. I got the closest shave in years.Higher on the price, however it outshines every 'canned' shave/gel out in the market. Love to buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good If You Have Dry Skin","review":"I bought this following all the rave reviews. I may have been expecting too much but this stuff definitely dries your skin out far more than regular cans of shaving cream. The lather stuff is nice but if it doesn't leave your skin soft, then it is kind of pointless. I bought this stuff last fall and used it for a bit, but as winter came I had to switch back to a can of cream which surprisingly worked really well with the safety razor. Also the Rose fragrance is not as overpowering as you think. I was personally hoping it would give off more smell, but it is really suttle and does not stick with you throughout the day unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lil Zane got no skills of his own","review":"This song is horrible because this fool Lil Zane doesnt even have a style of his own so he went and jacked 2Pac's style.

Unfortuantely, most of the novel has vanished in the transition to the screeen. Thompson's great strengths were his ironic plots and pyrotechnic language: Greenwald's movie eliminates about half of the twelve intertwined plots that run through the book and contains very little dialogue. All the viewer is left with is a bleak and cynical tale of violence that smacks of daytime television."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lucky Find","review":"As a passionate fan of Wilco, I blindly purchased the CD solely because it contained a Wilco song, \\"War on War\\", hoping that the CD would contain other great music and perhaps produce a diamond in the rough band to my collection. And the CD filled my hopes on all accounts. It's a really great record.The music is largely acoustic-based but contains an eclectic blend of folk, country, bluegrass and rock sounds. Lyrically and musically this CD delivers the goods.Some bands that caught my eye from this album are Jim White, Kelly Jo Phelps, Hayden, Len Brown Society, and Mighty Flashlight, but all of the bands are decent and there isn't a dud on the record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the recording you're looking for...","review":"While the music of Machito and the Afro Cubans is excellent and mesmerizing no matter the conditions under which you encounter it, this is a poorly recorded transcription of a radio broadcast from the early 50s, featuring an annoying announcer before (and over the intro to) each song and dated and inferior sound quality.As a time capsule this album is interesting (features Zoot Sims and is recorded at Birdland during its heyday), but there are many, many FAR better recordings of the amazing music of Machito and the Afro Cubans.

I have listened to this off and on for about six months, waiting for most of the songs to catch on, and what I have found is that most of the cuts are to 'noise orientated' and sloppy. Songs that are plain awful are 'Bomb', 'Testosterone', 'Monkey', and 'Alien'. To much \\"whining\\" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as 'Everything Zen' and 'Comedown'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn't happen !

The lyrics to \\"everything zen\\" are \\"try to see it once my way-ay-ay....everything zen, everything zen, I don't think so...zen...zen...zen...I DON'T THINK SO!\\"...I actually think a generation of American's are now dumber for having listened to this album. It's like Gavin Rossdale cut random words out of a dictionary, pasted them together in no particular order...went out drinking and smoking for 3 days straight and then came back and sang/yelled 15 sentences of moronic drivel in as gravelly a voice as he could muster while his band played Nirvana backwards.

The fact that he is so good at what he does for the band does not mean that the rest of the band members live in the shadow of all he does. The rest of the band members make bush what they are. But Rossdale gives the band the edge over every other band out there. Songs like glycerine make you want to fall in love every second of your life, Everything Zen targets the anger of practically being misunderstood, and shoots the misunderstanding right back with ferocious intensity. Comedown... In such wonderful ways, this song states the simple theme of staying with what makes you happy. With songs like these and many more, there is nothing missing from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't We Heard This Before?","review":"The biggest problem with this album is not the meaningless lyrics, nor the uninspired vocals of Gavin Rossdale. Nope, the biggest problem is the lack of originality and creativity exhibited in a majority of the tunes on Sixteen Stone. We've heard this guitary, angst-ridden slop before, and it's at its worst here. Playing loudly is not a substitute for playing well, and, unfortunately, Bush does not seem to realize this. It's music your local garage band could reproduce quite easily. The most disturbing thing about Sixteen Stone,however, is the way the lyrics feign depth through a series of non-sensical lines. I would say it's a shame for all this talent to go to waste but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, They Don't Sound Like Nirvana...","review":"...because Nirvana' Kurt Cobain knew how to tap into emotions, and create complex, interesting arrangements. On the other hand, Mr. Rossdale and his band simply pound their guitars loudly -- and badly. Furthermore, Nirvana's lyrics, whether they touch you or not, come from raw emotion. Rossdale's shallow slimy lyrics make me want to vomit. I think he's been picking words randomly out of a hat and making songs out of them. Bush is the absolute lowest common denominator kind of slop that appeals to people, though. They sure as hell try to sound like Nirvava, but fail miserable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush will always be my favorite","review":"Bush has been around for a few years now and have really done well. They will always be #1 on my top 10 list of favorite bands. I can never get enough of them. Not only do they gr8 music, but the lead singer Gavin Rossdale is hot. I have posters of him all over my room. They have some of the best lyrics too. Try it out and see what i'm talkin about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXELLENT","review":"I loved it!

I love glycerine because of their performance in for springbreak 96. It was pouring down on the stage and soaked Gavin while he was playing the guitar. He said he thought he was going to die while performing that song. There was lightning and thunder. He thought that if the lighning hit anywhere it would be him with his guitar. I can tell that thir music is from the true soul of who wrote it, sang it, and also performed it. His voice is so great and makes you feel calmed down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking the World Right","review":"This is a band of phenomenal talent.I think this was the second CD I ever bought and I'd say it is my No.3 album of all time.This is the English band that made it, and made it big.Not only did this album go to number 2 on release,which was unheard of,but it sold over 7 million copies. Not too shabby for a bunch of guys termed as shot's in the dark and one hit wonders.This is a band I rate with Collective Soul,S.T.P. and Creed for sheer love of music and doing it right, and for staying true to themselves and going against the odds.There are so many all time greats on this CD that it's scary.Glycerine is phenomenal and Little Things is the type of song that you'll enjoy even when you're so severely hung over that you're virtually dead.It just rocks your socks off.If you can,try get your hands on the limited edition double album with the bonus tracks and live CD.Well worth the extra money as are all awesome albums.kadu81@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"Nothing quite blows your head than Bush's guitars in this album.Its not a very focused album on the whole, but that does'nt matter, thats what makes the whole album as good as it is.Its a mix of catchy tunefully raw guitar riff sounding songs and raw unmelodic songs that focus mainly on instrumentals.Whatever the heak it is, its brilliant without a doubt.Oh and by the way, its completley pointless comapring Nirvana to Bush, because they sound absolutley nothing like one another.(Unless your stupid and boring enough to sit down and compare \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to the similiar riff in \\"Little things\\" $#$%%% hell, its just bloddy pointless!!!)Lets see you try and right an really great original song then?If your gonna complain about a bands music, write your own thats better.(gee I wrote that with so much agreesion I made some spelling mistakes)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Everything\\" is your fault Gavin...","review":"I blame everything on BUSH for destroying good music and paving the way for all the fake, untalented, unimaginative, low-frequency bands that would generate hence forth after 1994.

But the rest of the songs I hadn't ever heard also blew me away. I also liked Razorblade Suitcase tremendously, and I'm well... trying to appreciate the 3rd album. But 16 Stone just rocks, and the next release Razorblade Suitcase is also a masterpiece, all hype and personalities and bs about eras, etc. aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums ever in my opinion..","review":"This is one of the best rock albums I have ever heard. There are some songs on here that bring back strong memories to me. The songs \\"Comedown\\" \\"Machinehead\\" and \\"Glycerine\\" are worth the purchase price alone. On top of that.. all of the other songs are fabulous. I am also a huge Nirvana fan, and I think this album is just as good or better than anything Nirvana put out. I would strongly suggest to give this one a listen if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent but \\"RazorBlade Suitcase\\" was better.","review":"This is a pretty good album. Just not good enough to rank up with RazorBlade Suitcase. That album was the absoulte best! This album still has many good songs too. If you want to buy a Bush album, I recommend you get RazorBlade Suitcase first. I like Razorbalde Suitcase better than this one because this one seems to be so.... plain. You might have different thoughts though. If you really contemplate about Bush, then you'll see that they have a lot of talent. They just don't show it in this album. That's what bands are supposed to do though, right? They are supposed to improve through time.This album is a good buy, but I recommend you get razorblade suitcase first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though it was a mainstream hit, \\"Sixteen Stone\\" is actually a pretty good album - not for everyone, though - 4.5 stars","review":"\\"Sixteen Stone\\" is not a classic alternative album, but it certainly delivers the goods. Three alternative \\"classics\\" (at least hits) are found here - \\"Everything Zen\\", \\"Machinehead\\" and \\"Glycerine\\". While those are indeed great songs, the rest holds up surprisingly well. The lyrics tend to be somewhat interesting, although I doubt you'll be paying too much attention to them. Singer Gavin Rossdale definitely has a great voice for the band's style as he fits it perfectly. Musically it's essentially standard alternative rock except with great hooks - no innovation here. If you're a Bush or alternative rock fan, though, chances are you'll love \\"Sixteen Stone\\". If you liked this album then chances are you'll love Colective Soul's \\"Collective Soul\\" (it's got a slightly different sound, but I think you'll still love it). Highly recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixteen Stone is a FABULOUS Cd!!","review":"Bush is an absolutely GREAT band to start off with and this CD amazes me nearly every time I listen to it. I like every single song, although i wish they would've made x-girlfriend into like an actual-good-length song because it's too cool to leave at 45 seconds! I would recommend this CD to anyone!! Someone wrote in their review that Gavin isn't a good guitar player-well, he MUST be halfway decent to be playing on three albums and in concert all the time...Anyway, \\"Machinehead\\", \\"Everything Zen\\", \\"Little Things\\", \\"Comedown\\", and \\"Glycerine\\" are my favorites off the album although they're all good--this CD keeps you wanting more.

I think this CD sounds more like Pearl Jams music. So if you like Pearl Jam i recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing To be Skipped Over!!!","review":"Bush has been harshly accused of having the sounds of \\"Nirvana\\", but to anyone that is not tone deaf, we all know this is false. Bush shows a range of capibilities, ranging from the hard but smoothly connecting \\"Machinehead\\" to the far more mellow and still fabulous \\"Alien\\". This is by far on of the best CD's in my collection. All of the songs run together in a seemingly effortless manner. The astoundingly good guitar riffs in \\"Everything Zen\\" are wonderful. After owning the CD for quite a while, I accidently scratched the disc. It skipped terribly on every song, so immediatly I ran out to buy a new copy. It is that good and then some. I highly reccomend it to anyone in search of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST IVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME","review":"This cd is a great mixture of rock and pop. There hasn't been a cd this good in a long time. Machinehead, Everything Zen, and Glycerine are a great example of what Bush is capable of. This cd should definitly be on your to - buy list. You should also listen to Razorblade Suitcase, especially if you like music that kicks a**."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD from a good band","review":"Great CD!

I loved it in 96, and i still love it in 03...in fact I probably appreciate it more now than I did then..I've definitely grown up with bush. This album is Rad- Gavin's voice is good, and every single song on this cd is worth playing- little things and machinehead are fast paced and kind of agressive, glycerine and comedown (the hits of the album) are what brought bush to fame, the former is pretty melodic and the latter is harder, so alien, at the end of the cd, is also pretty melodic... I've gotta say that 'little things' is my favorite song off the album..it just gets you going and is full of angst- it's awesome. To put a long story short, the songs on this album are excellent, rock hard, and are catchy as hell. BUSH is rock in top form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicious but deadly","review":"Very tasty, but these tomatoes sent everyone in my household to the Imodium bottle.

I am amazed that no one else writing reviews seems to have been disturbed by the film's \\"hero,\\" a small-town sheriff who is also a Mormon bishop, sending out church elders--not deputized and without warrants--on a search of the interior of people's houses. The film seems to not only countenance, but espouse, egregious violation of the U.S. constitution's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. If this represents Mormon-ism, then there is much for citizens to fear from its practitioners."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORNY TO THE 10TH DEGREE...PREACHY GARBAGE!!!","review":"What? Did these people see the same movie I did? What I was unfortunately forced to endure was a poor poor excuse for a movie. The sentamentality of the film ranks right up there with Little House on The Prairie. The only difference being is that their religious convictions were not rammed down your throat. What a bunch of hogwash...garbage from beginning to the end. The director should stick to his sermons and his religious cult and leave directing to the impartial and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense mystery with a hint of Hitchcock","review":"I found the movie a little difficult to get into in the first 20 minutes or so. My original impression is that the acting was a little stiff and not much to grip me into the story. However, as it unfolded (like a good mystery should), I found myself gravitating to the story, the characters and the true suspense. In a old-style Hitchcock way, the understand and sometimes non-existent soundtrack gave me no clues as to who the real murderer was. Really, the only time I remember receiving those audio clues was for the patsy suspected killer and when a murder had occurred. In the end, I was completely moved by the story, and bought into the characters. Top that off with it being a clean movie and I would consider adding that to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"non-mormon perspective","review":"After reading the national reviews for Brigham City I purchased the DVD in hopes it would be at least mildly entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised to be watching a sophisticated, tight, well acted and ingeniously directed murder mystery that would have made Hitchcock proud. Aside from the few gratuitous inclusions of Mormon trumpeting, this film rises above to evoke a fear that touches its audience. Kudos Mr Dutcher, you are a true master of your craft. I highly recommend this film to murder mystery fans and fans of fine filmmaking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Written with class","review":"Simply the best written mystery I have ever seen.

Hey, since there'll be food at her place, I said yes. I really liked it! It had me going to the end! Albeit, not everyone will entirely understand the internal working of a small Moromon community but I thought the director gave us a good idea of it! And lets face it, it doesn't need to be a Mormon town--it's like any small town with its quirks, and dynamics, where everyone wears many hats! I liked the fact that I recognized no one save Wilford Brimly. Very refreshing! The sheriff/Bishop is a little low-keyed but hey, he's a widower with a murder on his hands. All-in-all a great 'indie' movie by director/writer/actor Dutcher--a one-man-show. I'm buying this one for Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too dark for me.","review":"I really didn't like this movie. It was just too dark for me. But, if you like a good murder mystery, you may enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mormon/Bad Mormon","review":"I really liked this film. It's a small murder mystery set in an apparently 99.9% Mormon fictional small town in Utah. The primary unfolding drama is the story of the small town's sheriff facing up to the sudden presence of a serial killer in their innocent little western oasis where nobody even locks their doors. What I really enjoyed, as both a non-Mormon and a strong believer in mysticism , was the film's humanization of Mormons through the subplot of a small faith-based subculture confronting tragedy and resolving its place in a non-believing world. I enjoyed the tension between the \\"outsider\\" female FBI agent and the widower sherriff (who is also a Mormon Bishop).The film has some flaws; but its by-the-book predictable plot devices don't get in the way of it being a deeply affecting film about the place of spirituality in modern life. I recommend it and will probably buy it when it's out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally saw B.C. ...disappointed I didn't see it earlier!","review":"Great flick!

I've been a fan since I moved as ateenager to Germany and bought Phenomenon; Schenker within the framework of the rest of UFO has always played with a lyrical power and touch missing in so many other guitarists. So much of Schenker's \\"solo\\" work has been so-so and Mogg/Way only sometimes brilliant so after Walk on Water it is great to see the core group back together for a second \\"reunion\\" CD and blazing. With all the pieces there except for Andy Parker (! ) they sound great. The 1st songs to really strike me were Midnight Train and Fool's Gold but Schenker sounds strong throughout. The live stuff sounds good too! For two discs at only slightly more than the price of one you can't go wrong if you're in the market for some good hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"thinking this is a good record is just flat-out denial","review":"this record is so bad it almost makes you long for the laurence archer years. i am a longtime ufo/schenker fanatic and was shocked to hear how lame this record is. all of the negative reviews here are accurate and the ufo/schenker legacy has been desecrated with this rushed release. all of my ufo loving buddies completely agree.this review is the safest way i could think of to let out my anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even..","review":"Fair warning to all of you good people that think you're buying the real deal like \\"Force It,\\" and \\"Strangers In The Night.\\" Better think again!

And UFO is back with a vengence. Covenant is a two CD set. The first being 11 new studio tracks. Schenker's guitar is flawless and soars on tracks like \\"Unraveled\\" and \\"Fool's Gold\\". The sound is a bit rawer than most UFO albums, but still manages to capture both the power and melody that is UFO. The second CD has 7 live tracks from their '95 US tour. 5 classic UFO tracks plus two from their underated Walk on Water album.

Production values - I've heard better demos for bands just starting out. And, that \\"bonus\\" CD - it would nice if the songs were listed in the correct order on the booklet.

Riffs...some of Michael Schenker's lamest moments, lyrics...embarassing, songwriting...horrible, Phil's vocals...expressionless, production...amateur.

File this one under, \\"Either put out next time or retire gracefully.\\" Caveat emptor: serious UFO fans that know anything about anything should forego the \\"Covenant\\" CD in lieu of insomnia over what used to be. As an aside, and for those of you that need a taste of contemporary UFO (as opposed to, but necessarily in contradiction of \\"classic\\" UFO), check out \\"The Wild, the Willing, and the Innocent.\\" Despite the absence of Michael Schenker, this album is worthy of Friday night contests with neighbors residing between thin walls about who can out-crank the other.

As a total UFO freak I was at a fever pitch for this box set, since I was blown away by how excellent \\"Walk on Water\\" was. The sound quality and song writing on that album is seriously ranked w/ the best UFO ever did. I came on amazon to order my copy of Covenant, but after reading what was said will not buy (no Andy Parker?......forget that!).

The pictures don't really do much for such a colorful medium like polymer clay.The table of contents doesn't reveal much about the book's contents. Chapter titles like Sentimental Circle, Bangle Beauty, Cute as a Button, and Crazy Daisy are cute enough, but you have to browse through the book to find out exactly what all these things are. Browsing would be more fun if the pictures were all in color.There's not that much focus on technique and how to make your own unique projects. It's mostly about how to make various objects in a very specific way (a starry clock, a haunted candle, etc.), though I suppose there's nothing to stop anyone from tweaking the projects and taking away ideas or tips that can be reused.Overall, it's not a book I'd recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book, easy to follow instructions, great for learning the ropes of crafting with polymer clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be in color","review":"This was such a disappointment.

The idea of getting the German side of the story is quite compelling and does shed some light on what happens within their ranks as this event unfolds. However, unless you are already very familiar with the details of this battle before reading this book, it is rather difficult to follow the author's presentation.As mentioned by others, the author is not a writer, but a former soldier. As such, his descriptions might appeal more to those who are interested in tactical details and not so much an easy to follow/well written prose. To those who plan to read this book, a primer on this conflict is first highly recommended. As always, A Bridge Too Far is a good starting place, but there are others that cover the Allied side as well. Also, a decent and detailed map of the area where the engagement took place is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Presentation of the German Viewpoint","review":"The difficulty with reading Ryan's \\"A Bridge to Far\\" or Middlebrook's \\"Arnhem\\" (both excellent books) is you don't get the full sense of what's happening on the other side. It wouldn't matter so much in histories of many other battles, but Operation Market-Garden was notable for its confusion. As a result, the understanding of the whole story particularily benefits from the German viewpoint.Kershaw takes a logical method of breaking the battle down into pieces, and has added new insights to each section of the battle. Some parts are slightly sketchier than others, but I suppose that's due to the lack of available information. The book also has several series of photographs, though Kershaw takes the somewhat annoying tack of describing each photograph in the text as well -- one picture is worth a thousand words. Lastly, the author disputes the theory that the British 1st Airborne would have held the Arnhem bridge if they had landed closer to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"German View","review":"If you are looking for a war story from the point of view of the soldat this is a good read for you. I enjoyed it becuse it was a good ammount of story instead of strait historical fact. There is Historical fact in the book but it is used to show an over view of the situation and then it moves on to the personal story. You get a good feel for the soldat and his personal view of the situation on hand. There is a desperate feel to the men in this book. You will enjoy it and by the end feel for the men desperate to save there country, family and brothers. They are surronded by Hope, sadness, mistakes and betrayal by there own goverment. It is a great read for war types of all likes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Familiar Story, But From The Other Side","review":"This is an excellent book which is well-written by an author who not only communicates WHAT happened, but also the HOW and WHY it happened. This is an excellent companion to Cornelius Ryan's \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" in that it tells the story from the German side. Even more than performing that needed task, it also performs the desperately needed task of showing why the Germans consistently outfought all opponents - even when their units were mere burnt-out shells of what they once were. The author shows, by excellent narrative and first-person accounts, that the Germans - at every level - moved and thought faster than the Allies. This book provides even more evidence that WWII was indeed won for the Allies by sheer weight of material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one book on Market Garden you must have","review":"Blow by Blow , Maps, Orbats,comentary by those that where there.After reading this book I felt at first as if I had lost a Family Member.It shows the British Airbourne to be a Fragile Human thing torn to bits frame by frame in front of my eyes , tear filled I was unable to close them. My own myths where shatered ,they were mere human beings not the gods I had always admired.I went the standard route Denile (nazi propaganda)Anger (so many brave young men and a Division gone)In the End I came to realise that in truth The first Airbourne stood higer shined all the Brighter for that very Fragility.

All of the paintings are gorgeous and well done and stand out in my mind. I do, however, have a couple of quibbles. First Synthetic Men of Mars is entirely unrepresented with no explanation given as to why. Second many of the paintings don't match up to the action they purport to describe. For instance O-aa is featured as a brunette with a jalok facing a T-Rex when in fact she is a blonde who's climbing up a cliff alone to escape a Tylosaurus in the scene supposedly painted. Although the picture is beautiful, it doesn't match up to what we should be seeing. These though are relatively minor quibbles, and I think anyone who gets the book won't be disappointed.

Ms. Wiehl has less experience at trying cases than most first year district attorneys. Wiehl has an amazing ability to sell herself. The problem is that there is very little to be gotten from such shallow waters. Worse still is the utter irrelevancy of so-called \\"lawyer lessons\\" given that lawyers suffer inordinately high divorce rates, alcoholism, depression and other stress-related illnesses.

The information is thin (the \\"theory of your case\\" point that trails on forever, could have been summed up in one sentence), and the analogies are weak. \\"How-To\\" books like this always seem to state a lot that seems obvious, but I honestly believe the average person will take nothing away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff, and lots of it","review":"Approach challenges in your life with logic, not emotion.(I just saved you some money and a 300 pages of filler.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legal skills for everyday life","review":"Lis Wiehl, legal analyst for Fox News and co-host of the O'Reilly Factor, explains how to make use of legalistic ideas and reasoning for everyday life.

This book is filled with the \\"what ifs\\" of a perfect world. It is a sad and scary thought that lawyers think that the public wants to think as they do. It is equally as scary (and dangerous) to find an author who thinks she has the answers for every problem or situation. This book espouses self-help rhetoric without adhering to a rule of social services which is -DO NO HARM. These \`blanket' one size fits all solutions just don't work in the real world.

'Second Grand Constitution and Bylaws' is just as wild, unpredictable, challenging, and utterly satisfying as the first SC3 album. SC3's unique blend of Arabian folk, 60's surf, techno and death metal is in full effect on the record as well as a heavier dose of songwriting, with most of the songs lasting over three or four minutes, as opposed to the short, mystifying bursts of insanity found on the first record. Every song on this album must be heard to be believed.

I get irritated within the first 3 minutes of the cardio and turn the video off in disgust, with only the 15 minute warmup under my belt for a work out. I have come back to this video every year, to determine whether I just gave up too easily, and the same outcome occurs.

I watched and tried to remember exactly what was going on, the moves, etc. This is what I do with all of my workout videos. The first few times of actually trying the aerobics segments were a bit hard and it took some rewinding and redoing to get the moves down pat, but I now have no problems with it.

But all in all, this was a muddled book, trying a little too hard to bring in the Bride of Frankenstein and other \\"second stringers\\" in the Universal mythos. Some of the reasons the Universal horror series ran out of steam in the 1940s are evident here -- last minute appearances by the Frankenstein Monster (just for the sake of showing him) and back stories that underemphasize the monsters.

The previous work in the series, RETURN OF THE WOLFMAN by Jeff Rovin, was a delight from start to finish. But this book features paper-thin characters and an emphasis on gore that is untrue to the spirit of the original Universal Monsters series, and betrays a singular lack of taste on the part of the author. The author writes in short paragraphs, I guess in an effort to replicate the writing of the \\"shudder pulps\\" of the 1940s. But it all becomes an arbitrary exercise in stylistic excess, with zombies flopping about with severed spinal cords sticking out. There's a rule against spoilers, or I'd tell you the author's absurd transformation of Dracula into a--well, Steve McQueen would have used CO2 on it, I'll give you that much of a clue.

THE DEVIL'S BROOD on the other hand, falls completely flat. Dracula & Frankenstein spend over 80 % of the text either dormant or in another life form. The two seperate plots have no real connecting point, with the whole Bride of Frankenstein angle left totally unresolved.

Some nights my wirfe does a lot of walking as a QC so when she comes home in the morning her legs are very tight and hurt but after 30 minutes of this she feels much better.

It was on back order, but the price couldn't be beat, so I decided to buy it. Several months later, it arrived. However, it was not the great product that I had thought it would be. This thing is very large and very noisy. For being so cumbersome, it is not very powerful. The infrared heat did not work, so I returned it to Amazon.com. Thank you, Amazon, for standing by your products, but I would recommend that Amazon stop selling these defective items before losing any more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it sucked, it would be better!","review":"I was not pleased literally or figuratively with the Aphrodite.

This film has to be one of my favourites of the last few years, or more. I rented it... watched it twice then bought it.The last half hour of the film left me with my jaw unhinged. Wow I thought... this film can be watched just for one of the most moving sequences in recent cinema. And every time I watch it, the last few scenes actually move me even more than the first time through. Can't say that for many other films.But the ending isn't what makes this a great movie. For me it's the great friendship that is so powerful and up front, and actually draws the viewer into their little group that makes the film. Although the first half hour is slow, it all builds up to a point where you can see that these guys are the greatest of friends.And it just gets better... and better and better.Just simply an wonderful film.

The jokes run a wide range of topics from the absurdity of an animated severed hand to the acting ability of Alan Hale, Jr. Although the humor is not as dense as in some later episodes like Cave Dwellers or Pod People, there is still no shortage of humor tossed at this B grade science fiction/horror film.

At first I thought it was really cute because this episode was taken from the first season, so it was interesting to see the really corny sets and even cornier special effects. However, as I watched the episode more, the more bored I became. Granted, \\"The Crawling Hand\\" is not the most exciting movie to watch, but it just didn't seem as though Joel and the bots were as funny. Tom Servo had a completely different voice and Dr. Forrester had a different assistant.I know that this episode is a part of MST3K history and for that I give it respect, but I personally just could not get into this episode. I would suggest it, though, to other fans of the series so they can make their own decisions about it.

The first half of the book is little more than a Java reference which may be fine for someone who is an experienced object-oriented programmer, but if you want to learn how to PROGRAM in Java this book provides no guidance.The second half of \\"Discover Visual Cafe\\" is even less useful in learning how to create Java applications/applets in Visual Cafe. You would be just as well off with the Help function in Cafe.Like most who write computer programming books, the authors of \\"Discover Visual Cafe\\" assume that just describing the elements of a language or application is sufficient to be able to use it productively.

No one has ever hung from the top of the enclousre as the manufacturer warns not to, nor have we ever exceeded the weight limit on the trampoline. We planned to replace the enclosure only to learn that there is no way to do so without getting an entire new unit because the enclosure is sewn into the mat. Magic Circle boasts a 10 year warranty on the frame with a 1 year warranty plus 4 year prorated warranty on the mat and springs. What they fail to mention is the enclosure is not covered and even if it were, you have to ship the unit prepaid to them for inspection before they will even make a decision on warranty coverage.

Grace Macguire can't figure out what in the world is going on, when three of the characters she'd created for recurring roles in her romance novels suddenly seem to come to life and decided that *she* is their next 'Cinderella Story.'On the pretense of doing research, Grace enlists the help of psychiatrist Dr. Max Aaronson, (and the fairy godmothers' choice for Grace's life-mate.) in an effort to really help her over her sudden bout of weird visions.Throw in some vile step-relatives and a really heinous individual who sees dollar signs in Grace's eyes and who, in my opinion, got off way too lightly and you have the makings for a enjoyable night of reading.

As for me I like some edgyness to my kidnappings and not the over the top psycho that deserves laughs more than shudders and gets off scot free in the end.I think this author has promise if she would please tighten up the plot and leave off some of the syrup.

Some might see the dialogue as \\"classic detective\\" or \\"witty\\" but I found it really contrived, cliched, and tedious given the fact that ALL the characters talk the same way.

Just because people can listen to something dozens of times, until the point that they've memorized the string of notes the way some kid memorizes the string of digits that make up pi, doesn't make it good; it just makes it familiar to them.

While there are probably 3 or 4 tracks that could've been very good, had they been fleshed out a little more, this album is pretty much a waste of time. I've heard Mr. Bungle's music occassionally described as cartoonish, and that's fine. Because at least with Mr. Bungle, the cartoonish nature was balanced out by some actual musical compositions.

However, because of the outrageous number of errors, both in the book and on the accompanying web site, it it difficult to follow and complete far too many of the exercises.

I guess they never got round to inserting it.This edition feels like an early draft of what might have been a decent volume, but I'm not paying this amount of money to have my time wasted.I'm a programmer - not a designer.

When I found a project (Advanced Interactivity Chapter, page 600) that was of particular importance to me, it abruptly ended after the intro and jumped to the next project.

The graphics were very good, the sound effects were good, and the music was by far some of the best Acclaim has come out with. This game has some sweet levels. Most are very large and take quite some time to explore. And with levels like The Hive, you feel like you're actually there. Extremely gripping and intense. As some have said, there aren't the tons and tons of monsters to blow away around every corner, but if you want a game like that, play DOOM. In Turok 2, the monsters are a little more realistic. Hordes and hordes of monsters isn't realistic, but a group of about 2 or 3 waiting in ambush around a corner is. Very well done. I've played it through several times and I enjoyed it every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you say something, sorry i couldn't hear, I fell asleep.","review":"Turok 2 is so BORING - sprawling sparse levels barely populated by the occasional annoying bad guy - the sniper weapons are a poorly executed add on , and the multiplayer option is one of the WORST i have ever played.

The tactics are true to life (at least for a sim.) with the exception of the supply rules which just don't make sense for anything other than the largest scenarios. That being said, the game is awesome in its design and scope. Lots of beautifully done options are available so there is lots of replayability.

It would turn on, but would just whir, without spitting out the correct amount of ground coffee. Read on the internet that it sometimes gets 'clogged' with powdery grinds, and that you should open it up to clean. Seems silly, but I gave it a try. After taking it apart and putting back together, no change. Seems like anything for this price should last at least a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice burr grinder and OK for pump espresso","review":"I have had this grinder for a few weeks, and here is my opinion. On the finest grind setting it doesn't grind as finely as the texture of the Illy or Lavazza espresso ground coffee I have tried.

The grinder itself quit about a year later.I am now shopping again and I would love to have another one of these, but not until they do something about their quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Warranty policy--Beware!","review":"The grinder worked great until one day it just died less than a year after purchase. No problem it was still under warranty. Well there was a problem. Cuisinart does not have any service centers so the company said I would have to pay the cost for returning the grinder and send them $10.00 to cover the cost of them shipping me a new one. Well I don't think that is much of a warranty. Because of this policy I will never buy another product of any type from Cuisinart.

First, for its size, the grinder is loud. Second, the slider switch for the amount of grounds is flimsy, and the off/on switch is too easy to press when you don't want to activate the grinder. Finally, after one month, regardless of the setting, the unit would only run for a couple of seconds with an activation. I returned the unit and received a replacement, which I haven't used yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for nuts!","review":"This product was originally listed as a nut-butter machine. However, when I purchased it, I was surprised to find that the product was labelled coffee grinder and made no references to grinding nuts.Grinding nuts in this product was a total disaster. The hopper did not feed properly, and I would guess that coffee beans would have the same problem. This machine would not even grind the smallest nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this grinder, despite some of the reviews that I read, because I had previously owned a cuisinart grinder that I was very happy with. The thought of a grinder that would store the beans and I could quickly grind just what I needed sounded great. And it does give you options for your preferred grind, which is nice. However, it does NOT grind the amount that you select. It also does create huge amounts of coffee dust, as previous reviews suggested, that spreads well beyond the area that you are grinding. After 2 months of use, I have just ordered a new basic grinder, and this will be going to the out of use appliances shelf we have managed to maintain within our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch broke","review":"This unit has a known issue with a switch. I bought one for me and one for my parents for xmas. My switch died after about a year, and my parents lasted about 3 months longer than mine. Both broke in the same way. Now you have to hold the button down for it to work. You used to be able to set the amount (4-18 cups), walk away, and come back when it was finished. We don't use it anymore because of the broken switch.You will find similar complaints in user reviews. If you only want this to work for a year, buy it. If you expect it to last longer, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, Ground to a HALT!","review":"Well, This grinder lasted for 4mo. and 5 days. I have to say that while it worked, it worked pretty well. It clogs up pretty quickly though. I kept it fairly clean but after the last clog it just quit working altogether. I gave it two stars. For durability I'd have given it one. It did work well originally though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I wish I had taken a look at the reviews here before buying this mill. What a waste of time and money. I'm sending mine back while I still can. It does none of the things it's supposed to. It's grinds are completely inconsistant. No matter what the setting, you will get a grind that ranges from coarse to fine powder. With mine it is about 1/3 fine powder. Worse yet, it somehow gives this fine powder an electric charge that makes it impossible to get it from it's container to the pot without it flying all over the place. What a mess! What a piece of crap. I see there's a new model out now, and it looks like they've changed the look a little to hide the fact that it's still the same piece of junk that this one is. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk !!","review":"I have purchsed 3 of these units in the last 2 years. After only a few uses thay clogg up and stop grinding.

I would highly recommend this to a coffee drinker for their home."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 months and then it broke","review":"I was given this grinder two Christmases ago. I've used it daily on the fine setting. Others in the house have used it occasionally on the coarser settings. It worked until last month, when it wouldn't turn on. Taking it apart showed that the plastic hopper is mounted on top of a threaded, plastic pipe (which also forms upper edge against which the burr grinds). That pipe was cracked, and that prevented the hopper from seating fully on the two safety interlocks located on the top of the unit. We used it for a couple weeks by holding the hopper down by hand, but yesterday the pipe broke off completely (no great surprise there). I could hack it more deeply, but since the finest it could grind wasn't all that fine to begin with I'm going to go look for something nicer. Preferably something which grinds metal against metal, for starters."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuisinart is a real grind","review":"To put it succinctly, this grinder jams very, very, easily and the amount of time you will spend getting the your coffee ground will negate any positive features that the machine has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Messy!","review":"We bought this grinder about a month ago, and the flying coffee grounds from the static is making me nutty! This is the first burr grinder I have purchased, and the coffee does taste better using this type of grinder. But between the mess from the static and the very loud noise the grinder makes, I think I chose the wrong one.Even though I've had this one a short time and it is working fine, I am thinking about purchasing another one with a glass container so there is less static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a piece of crap","review":"Only used it sporadically over the 1 year of useable life it was with me, and it just plain broke. Terrible is what I have come to expect from all Cuisinart products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one year","review":"This grinder worked wonderfully for the first year. Thereafter, a screw came loose that secures the grinding component. This in turn cracked the base of the coffee bean container rendering the grinder useless. Because Cuisinart no longer makes parts for this model, it cannot be fixed. This is not the first bad experience I have had with Cuisinart products. The next time a make a purchase in the small appliance category I will surely avoid Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic coffee","review":"I purchased the Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder August 2006 for a better cup of coffee than I got with a blade grinder. Until recently I was OK with the performance though I agree with another review that the static causes the coffee grinds to stick to the plastic grind container. There are two of us and we grind enough for 4 cups of coffee each morning, so never any hard use. Two days ago, our grinder quit working. Today I had time to look at it and when I picked up the grinder, the container that holds the beans came off in my hands. I wish I could post a picture with this review. The bottom of the plastic bean holder (for lack of a technical term) disintegrated sending lots of plastic shards into the grinding mechanism with the beans; and this right after I read about melamine in dog food.I can't see plastic in with the grinds, but you have to wonder ....Needless to say I will never buy another Cuisinart product and would recommend anyone who has one take a good look at theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for ESPRESSO despite what it says on the box","review":"Works fine.

About 2 wks ago...after only using it a couple times a week since we owned it...the machine completely died...motor gave up and although my husband opened the bottom hoping it might just be a loose wire...no such luck. I would greatly discourage purchasing this ..just because I'm not the only reviewer who had the machine die on them. Cuisinart makes a great coffee maker...we love ours...and wouldn't trade it for anything...but they need some new engineers working on their burr grinders...cause the current people assigned to the design of this machine...haven't got it right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll return to my old brand","review":"After my Capresso died after 3 years of daily use, I decided to purchase the Cuisinart. It was less expensive. The design of the Cuisinart coffee bin makes it difficult to see the amount of beans remaining. The container for the ground coffee is difficult to empty without spilling, and is difficult to re-insert. And this grinder generates a lot more \\"sludge\\" than the Capresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"DBM Grinder works great!","review":"I wasn't absolutely sure how good this would work when I purchased it, but now that I have been using it for a month, I could not be happier.

It is nowhere close enough for an espresso machine, even on the finest setting - don't even consider it for espresso!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for espresso!","review":"Really thought that this grinder would do the job. Purchased one a bit over a year ago and it has done a very fine job at grinding an espresso fine grind. Attempted to purchase a matching unit for decaf. To my disappointment, after purchasing and returning three machines the later crop of machines is incapable of a fine grind. Tried the same bean that was grinding very fine in the older machine to no avail. I'll have to look elsewhere.

Manufacturer should use a metal one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of $ if you want an fine grind","review":"I looked over the other reviews here, and they are generally positive. It is true that this is a nice machine because; one, it is not messy; two, it is not too loud; three, you can grind without having to stand there holding down a button; and four, it does hold a fair amount of beans. That said, I gave this grinder a poor score because its FUNDAMENTAL purpose is to grind the beans. In other words, I weighted this purpose as being extremely important. And so, the poor score because even on the finest setting I cannot get an espresso grind! I cannot imagine what grind you would get on coarse.. would the whole beans just come out whole? Maybe it works in reverse and grinds would come out whole again--that's how bad this thing is. You would never have to worry about it clogging and overheating, I guess....A waste of money if you want fine grind. I had a krups--going back to Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems with this grinder","review":"The grinder worked just as it should for the first three months then it would periodically stop. I would take the grinder apart, give it a complete cleaning and brushing because I thought that coffee had built up over a sensor but that didn't seem to be the problem because after cleaning it would work fine for a couple of grinds and then stall again. I'd spend thirty minutes or more cleaning to make sure nothing was clogging the machine or some a possible sensor. None of this worked and the grinder continued to get worse such that it now will not grind at all. It just stalls and grinds for maybe a millisecond and then shuts off. Very frustrating because I expected years of faithful service from this Cuisinart product. Now it sits in a drawer collecting dust and I'm thoroughly unhappy with it. The cost of shipping for reconditioning makes it prohibitive and no guarantees that it will work afterwards has caused me to look elsewhere for a better grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for standard drip coffee makers","review":"This grinder only produces coffee suitable for drip coffee makers. The fine setting isn't fine enough for espresso and the coarse setting still leaves lots of fine powdery dust that renders it unsuitable for use with a French press -- the resulting coffee is just too bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart misses the mark","review":"When they list \\"ultra fine\\" as one of the grind features, it is reasonable to assume this means fine enough for espresso. NOT SO! I like to make espresso a couple times a week but this machine does not allow me. And the company's response is formula, basically non-response.

You have to grind then sift, and eventually you'll end up with espresso grind.I believe it is almost fraudulent to claim that this product can produce espresso grind. Going from the coarsest setting to the finest setting, there is very little difference in the consistency of the grind produced. On the finest setting, which you'd normally expect to be espresso grind or the powder-fine grind used for Turkish coffee, about 20% of the grounds come out fine enough.I'm reminded of an old Yiddish joke about a man who gets a badly-fitted suit from his tailor... You can make it work but it's not worth the trouble.Otherwise it's a nice product as I'd expect from Cuisinart, it's just NOT at all designed to produce espresso grind.

I get a big chunk of dust stuck along the top and down along the back inside the pile of grains -- so basically, this is a useless grinder. Coffee comes out tasting terrible. I had a cheap hand grinder I almost threw out, and I'm glad I didn't. This Cuisinart grinder is going back as soon as I can return it. I have to wonder how many other people have returned these to Costco, and if they plan on continuing to carry them.Really, I have not experienced a worse grinder than this -- ever. Yes, it runs.

It is a pretty expensive paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Bad","review":"This grinder has revolutionized my coffee drinking. It is good because it delivers a fairly consistent grind for my drip coffee makers. It is bad because it does make some dust from the beans, no matter the grind setting. It is also REALLY loud. Still, it doesn't leak when grinding, is not too hard to clean and didn't cost too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Grinder!!","review":"First of all I want to say that I waited until I was beyond the 3 month mark to write this review as a past comment said that the grinder died right at that point. Happy to say that this is not the case! I love this grinder! It allows you to choose the strength of the grind and the cups. I love strong coffee and this makes that possible every pot!

The unit is unbelievably loud. And not just loud: It has a screaming edge to the noise that is surprisingly unpleasant. It wakes everyone up in the house when it's run, even with all doors closed, and we're afraid to use it in the morning with house guests. Although it has otherwise operated perfectly for us for a couple of years, I'm going to replace it with something quieter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be really dangerous","review":"I've had the grinder about 8 months and twice it would not shut off even when I put it in the OFF position and I had to unplug it. When I plugged it in again it seemed ok. This morning we were awakened by a deafening roar and it had started BY ITSELF with no coffee in it! It was good we were home as it would have burned the motor out and could possibly start a fire. Scary! Have no idea how that could happen. Cuisinart will replace (minus shipping) but don't think I want another one. I would leave this unit unplugged when not using."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was fine...until it wasn't.","review":"At first, it seemed to work fine. It wasn't wonderful, but for $45 I didn't expect perfection. There was a good deal of static, but that's to be expected with a plastic bin. Unfortunately, exactly 6 months to the day after buying it, it has died. And while I didn't expect perfection for $45, I did expect it to last longer than half a year. It looks like I'll have to look for something better made (i.e. more expensive) now. I think I'll also look at a local store, because I've passed my 30 day window in which I could have returned it to Amazon.

Kept it clean and took care of it.Until almost exactly one year after I bought it. Put fresh beans in the top, pushed start, it sounded weird, then stopped and began to smoke. Unplugged it quickly but yeah - it's dead.I'm not much for buying appliances that last only one year - and I don't allow smoking in the house - so, I am very disappointed. For a Cuisinart, I would have thought they'd put more into their reputation but apparently not.

So, two DBM-8's, average life, 11 months.It used to be that appliances lasted forever, that is no longer the case.

A complete let down. First off, it's extremely noisy, and I would wake up my entire house using it. Second, it operates at an enourmous speed, always producing ultra-fine powder in any grind level, even coarse: something a burr grinder should elieviate. Lastly, the finest setting is no where near fine enough for espresso. Upon further investigation, the burr used in this is the same as that used by Krups models and a few others, which also don't work that well. My guess is the design of burr dictates crazy high grinding speeds that ruin its performance. You pay for the lovely, seductive Cuissinart look, but that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Grinder, while it works","review":"We bought this burr grinder about a year ago as a Christmas present for my dad. It worked great for about 4 months and then it broke. Support wasn't helpful at all, and we couldn't figure out a way to get it fixed.

Has a slide setting for amount of coffee that appears to either be highly erratic like the burrs or perhaps in combination with them causes you to get a different amount of coffee Every-time you grind. So you can not set it to get that one pot ground and then expect the same amount of ground coffee the next time you grind, thus the need to use a scoop instead of just dumping it in the filter.Not at all what one should expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopper Disintegrates Over Time","review":"It worked, albeit loudly and messily for several months, then the plastic hopper disintegrated and literally fell apart when I lifted the cover to refill it.

I chose the Cuisinart DBM-8 because it was the same model purchased way back when (when manufactured by another company). However, the Cuisinart machine died this morning, functioning for less than 10% the lifespan of the first grinder. It had never ground coffee according to setting. Whatever the setting, it produced fine grounds mixed with a high degree of dust, which meant the machine frequently clogged. Although it was easy to clean, dust is subpar for french press coffee. Yes, I should have returned it earlier (when it was still under warranty - 18 mos.), but that's water under the bridge now. Anyway, I just wanted to chime in about this machine as I am shopping for its replacement this morning, which may be a Bodum model."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"Third grinder broke after 4 days.

The issue I have with this grinder is the energy it sucks up sitting on the counter. Amazon sells 'Kill A Watt', which measures the energy used by household appliances. According to this device this grinder zaps over $6.00 of electricity a year.It might be excusable if it had a timer or clock, but it doesn't. Not even a light. All it has is a simple switch that starts the grind when pressed. I called the manufacture's customer service thinking that maybe the unit was defective. The rep verified with their engineers that it was the way it was designed.Surely their designers/engineers are smart enough to create a product with a simple 'ON' switch that doesn't waste energy when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Product","review":"I bought this largely on the strength of the brand name.

Set on it's finest setting, it grinds about right for a French press.Second, the grind is very inconsistent.Third, it is difficult to get coffee out of the container without making a real mess. The amount of cleanup required after using this device is extraordinary.Fourth, the motor failed after just a few months and only modest usage. One morning I was grinding coffee and I detected an electrical fire smell and the motor just burned out.Do not waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product life too short","review":"Bought just less then 2 years ago and used to grind for a pot every day.

I still use a $25 B&D coffee maker that has lasted 10 years now and a $50 Cuisinart coffee grinder that can't even make it to 2 years.

I have never busted out my magnifying glass to inspect the grind conistency on a micro-level but in the wire mesh filter for my coffee maker, glass for french press, or metal espresso filter after grinding at each respective coarseness settings on the grinder this little machine produces a consistent grind.

It is totally useless for fine espresso grinding - the finest grind is far too coarse even for drip coffee in my opinion. Also, the grind is very inconsistent; in addition to the coarse grinds, you also get some over-fine dust. This renders the grinder unusable for any kind of coffee in my opinion.Espresso must be ground very fine, without dust that will block your espresso machine.However, regular drip or press coffees are also ruined by too much coffee dust.Spend a bit more for a working burr grinder, or just stick with a cheap blade grinder instead. Any positive reviews here must be from rather undiscerning drip / press coffee drinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"Wife bought one of these at a fundraiser auction, still sealed in the box, but more than a year old.

It is too late to return the item to Amazon, but it is covered by the Cuisinart limited warranty. Unfortunately, I have to pay for shipping this defective merchandise back to Cuisinart and send them a check for $4 so they can send me a replacement, that I hope will last longer than this inferior specimen.

Despite its coffee-house looks, it's cheaply built and horrendously noisy--don't use this at night in an apartment if you like your neighbors. Despite the snarl of its (apparently well-hidden) jet engine, it does a very inconsistent and inadequate job. Even at its finest setting, it produces coffee bean chunks that vary from drip-grade coarse to not-so-fine. If you've got an espresso machine that won't give you that crema unless you feed it consistently finely ground coffee, you'll be disappointed with this grinder. Your espresso machine will blow water through the coarse bits and give you 15-second weak shots. On the other hand, if you need a grinder for drip/filter or French press coffee, this grinder will probably satisfy you since that equipment isn't nearly as \\"picky\\" as espresso machines are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"This grinder is the absolute worst grinder I have owned. The finest grind is not acceptable for espresso. The coarse is good for french press. The plastic grind hopper holds static which makes it extremely difficult to pour the grinds without making a mess. Junk junk junk. I expected better from the Cuisinart name.

People beware.","review":"This grinder has two major problems. The first is that it is very loud. It is so loud that my dog merrily joins in howls along with its air-raid siren like whine. He loves this grider. The second problem is that the coffee plugs up in the grinder and jams the motor. When this happens you must turn it off before the motor start smoking. A knife works well for chipping the ground coffee from the grinder. Several reviewers have mentioned that it died within a year and I suspect that it's because they were too slow about turning it off when it jams.I do not recommend this grinder (but my dog does).Update: after only 6 months the grinder stopped working. Luckily Costco took it back for a full refund. The warranty required me to pay shipping and send $$. I was very happy to unload it and will never again buy Cuisinart products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Long Term Choice","review":"This grinder worked great for about two years--used most every day. A week ago I started having the same problem as another reviewer on this site with the grind switch working intermittantly. Now the motor has completely ceased. When I called the company they told me the grinder was warranted for 18 months and they were aware of motors that died shortly thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pricey Lemon","review":"I bought this grinder less than a year ago and, apart from its noise, it seemed to grind well. I liked the storage bin on top. However, last night it died completely. When I called the store where I bought it, the manager said that they only would exchange it within 90 days of purchase, with the receipt. She said I'd have to mail it back to the vandor. Having moved house since I bought it, I have no proof of purchase. My previous grinder, by Krups, lived 20 years. Guess what brand I'll buy now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"First let me say that Costco has this grinder for $24.99 and it is not worth it. The grind is very inconsistant. Do not buy this grinder for use with an espresso machine or french press. No matter what setting I try to use, there is a layer of very fine coffee dust on top of the grinds. Also, several full beans have managed to make it past the burrs and into the hopper without a scratch. My old blade grinder works better than this Cuisinart piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a Year","review":"I've had it nearly a year and like all Cuisinart products I've had they look and work great... for one year. It just quit working. It's the fourth Cuisinart product I've had that has done this. If you want to get it at this great price do it, but be prepared to buy a new one pretty soon.Looking back at my previous reviews I saw that after my third Cuisinart coffee maker went out I said, \\"Some people never learn\\". Wow. Guess I've only myself to blame for continuing to buy them :) I'm going to chalk it up to the fact that I like the style of Cuisinart. Sadly, it appears they focus on the surface appeal of their products and scrimp on the actual functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor DIED within 9 months","review":"This grinder worked fine initially. But after about 9 months, the motor just died. Completely Kaput. Totally unacceptable for an appliance this expensive. Is nothing made to last anymore?!? Don't waste your money on this piece of junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not grind for expresso and stopped working within a year","review":"My grinder just ground to a halt this morning, about a year after I purchased it in a local store. I wasn't happy with it from the start because it does not grind fine enough for expresso! Just well enough for drip...this is the second Cuisinart product that's died on me within a year of purchase...the other was a juicer. I thought that Cuisinart was a solid brand...or it used to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful coffee everytime","review":"i went into a discount store looking for a coffee grinder. They only carried this model. It was reconditioned and under 25 dollars. There were no department stores in the area, i had no options, so i bought it. i had always used ground coffee and had no idea what the difference was between a blade or a burr grinder. OF course i was amazed with the results and delighted with the product! I have been using the grinder almost daily for about 4 years and it works perfectly. i clean the grinder by running a \\"fine\\" cycle with 1 TB. white rice. while I do agree there is problem with static cling and the teaspoon of coffee powder that results, this machine meets all my needs. ALso, i do unplug it after every use as reccomended and wonder if this has any bearing on life expectancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds well, doesn't last","review":"When it works, this product grinds well and is convenient.That said, my first one ran well for several weeks, then simply would not start again. Cuisinart replaced it under warranty. Same story for the second one; ran well for several weeks, then, for no obvious reason, stopped working.Being an electronics engineer, I took it apart, thinking that it might be a simple failure that could be fixed with a soldering iron. Everything looked just fine inside. There must be an over-stressed component that does not fail in an obvious way.I would love to love this product, but there is something in the design that is poorly chosen. The engineers who designed this grinder should be ashamed of themselves. I am giving up on the product because of very poor reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID: short life and poor grind","review":"While this machine lasted about 2 years, I only used it an average of twice a week. Worse is the fact that its finest grind setting is woefully inadequate for good espresso. I replaced it last week with a Capresso Infinity, and it has made a world of difference in the quality of the espresso I'm getting from my Saeco Magic Cappucino Plus. I'm not an expert barista by any means, but the finer grind I get from the Capresso is more than worth the extra $35. I might also add that it's much quieter than the Cuisinart, which is loud enought to wake the dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 1 use","review":"Disappointed. While there are many reviews that show this product didn't work for long, I didn't imagine that the second time we tried to use it - no luck. The motor burned out. Amazon provided a refund. Sadly, I have not had luck with Cuisinart coffee products. The mill worked great the first time, too bad. On the hunt for a more reliable replacement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill never dies","review":"I have the Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill I don't think the model is the same but it looks just like this one. I have had it now 6 years and it is going strong never a problem. I do after a few refills of beans turn it upside down and tap the sides to any little bits of coffee grind and any little bits of coffee beans out. I am very happy with this it has grinded alot of coffee beans."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of coffee","review":"First time having this type of grinder. Everyone in my house (my mom, husband, and myself) think this is working great. No complaints here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I purchased one of these mills at Fry's, and it died after only a couple of uses. The motor just quit. Cuisinart must be having quality problems with their motors, because I had purchased a \\"Grind Central\\" model to replace one I had worn out, and the motor also died right away. I will try another brand (fool me twice, shame on me...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Drip, Aeropress or French Press","review":"I bought this product after being unsatisfied with the highly rated Bodum Bistro electric grinder. It is perfect for what it is: a value oriented upgrade from a whirly blade grinder. I've made wonderful coffee from my freshly roasted beans using a drip maker, aeropress and a french press. The coarseness is perfect for french press!Yes, some of the fines stick to the container, but they are easily discarded without them getting mixed into your grounds. Also, as others have noted, the unit is rather loud. This isn't a big deal for me as I grind my beans in the garage on my workbench where I roast my coffee. If you are looking for a high end grinder for your espresso machine, look elsewhere. If you want a step up from your whirly blade grinder and you make drip coffee or coarser, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"went out quickly","review":"Don't know if I just got a lemon or not, but bought this as a gift. My mom put the beans in and it ran for about 10 seconds and then she had to do some short spurts.

Unfortunately for me, I found the same proud for fifty per cent less at Costco a week later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality","review":"The finest setting is a poor version that delivers weak and almost flavorless espresso. I am very disappointed! Because I live in Venezuela I don't know how to return it"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"I prefer to grind my own and using my old touch top grinder, I could never get the right grind needed. This cuisinart DBM-8 is perfect for me. Once I found the right seting for my prefered grind, I am now a very happy camper....Very fresh coffee...every morning. Yummy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder!!","review":"We use this in our office, it gets 2-3 grinds per day, so far so good, we had a black and decker that gave out after a little over 6 months. This seems to be a heavy duty semi-commercial product. Has a lot of variable settings on grind finess and pot size gives you lots of flexibility on how strong you want your coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"After about a year of use it began clogging up and would not grind the beans. We had to take apart the unit to clean it out so it would actually grind the beans. It now clogs up on a regular basis and is useless. Looks great on the counter, but that's about it. Buy a cheaper model of anything. At least they grind your beans. Disappointed!Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill (CCM-16PC1)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Be Any Worse","review":"How's this? I brutally loud, it takes an eternity to grind and the grind is inconsistent. And it is messy. If I wasn't such a cheapskate, I should throw it off the balcony. In addition, every evening when I prepare the coffee for the next morning my wife tells me \\"I hate that thing.\\" Each and every night... I may go off the balcony before the Cuisinart DBM-8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in 8 months","review":"Horrible!! The unit died after 8 months. The coffee does not grind evenly, and if you need a fine grind like espresso, this is not a good unit. Looks nice on the counter, but truly is of poor quality. Not a good unit if you want something that will last and will give you a good grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the value","review":"This grinder is just great, better than my old one (Braun)and quiter too! Love the different grinds that the machine offers. I have told my friends about this and told to get it at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"Burr grinder works good and and price is right.

It's somewhat noisy, but that's expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is cheap. And I tried it twice. I actually bought it twice and it broke on me both times. Do no recommend it. Worth paying more for something that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable, decrease in quality","review":"The first of this burr mill lasted quite a while, so when it broke down I decided to purchase one of the same-- what a mistake. It arrived broken where it never turned on so I had to repackage it and send it back (although Amazon was really good thru the whole process.) The second one that arrived worked for 30 days and then went KA-PUT! So now I am stuck with it. Maybe there was a decrease in quality of the mill parts since the first one I purchased. Caveat-emptor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant think of how to improve this!!!!!","review":"I had grinders before, but this one clearly out performs all the others. Consistant grinds,and quantity.

The motor died this morning after about 2 years of light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No kudos here...","review":"No stars for a piece of junk that lasted about 12 gentle uses. Manufacturer offered to replace it for what I had paid, which made no sense. I didn't post a review sooner but it didn't rate even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooped out outside the warranty time","review":"It was a good enough grinder except for the powder that would build up on the sides of the chamber. I made a pot of coffee every day for about 3 years and the motor pooped out and started to smoke. It no longer works and I don't think I would get this again. 3 years is a pretty short life for something that is not that complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"Bought this at a store. Used it maybe 20-30 times over about 4 months and it died. The plastic bean chamber that threads into the drive using a plastic shaft cracked, I guess from changing the grind size.Fortunately, a replacement ordered at Cuisinart.com only cost 8 dollars. Unfortunately, a month after ordering it and receiving two shipping dates, I just received an email telling me that \\"due to high demand, the product is out of stock\\" and they hope to ship in 30 days. A replacement part that is out of stock due to high demand is not a good thing. I cancelled my order and bought the Capresso model thru Amazon..hopefully it is better. At least they didn't charge my credit card.Oh, by the way, the unit didn't even work that good...the consistency of the grind was no different than my ten buck blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"we are coffee freaks...meaning we love to have really good quality coffee all the time. when we're not spending too much money at coffee shops for great microfoam lattes, we're trying to make a good cup of french press with our burr grinder. we had this thing for 3 months and could never get in to it. honestly, it was worse than our hand blade grinder. i would not recommend this product; it is messy beyond belief - meaning crazy static mess all over my counter... we returned it for the bodum burr grinder. great design, but honestly, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're Happy With This Grinder","review":"I had reservations about ordering the Cuisinart grinder after reading the mixed reviews here. But, Consumer Reports gave it a good review. So, I decided to give it a try. I'm sure it isn't as good as a $500 grinder. But, moving up from a simple blade grinder. We're very happy with it. It is noisy, but not more noisy than our old blade grinder. I do wish it ground a little finer. But, ground coffee works fine for espresso and cappuccinos if packed into the filter basket of our basic Krupps espresso maker.As some have suggested, grounds do stick to the plastic bin. But, it's not a big problem for us. This grinder has markings to control how many cups of coffee for which you want to grind. We make our coffee pretty strong but find that it grinds too much. So, when we make 10 cups of coffee, we set the grinder to 8 cups.It's too soon to speak to durability. But, we're enjoying the Cuisinart grinder very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, but unfortunately lasts less than 1 yr","review":"We have just gone through our 3rd Cuisinart Burr Mill in 4 yrs.

I still has not figured out how this brand new coffee grinder got here but I've been using it and I can't stand the noise (I need to buy a new one and I'll do it right now, on Amazon). Well, this thing is LOUD. I have to block my ears when it grinds coffee and I do not allow my child to be near, it'll really ruin your hearing. It looks good but the loud noise is not worth it. Save your ears, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 6 months","review":"I bought this (along with a French Press)as a gift for my husband and it worked great for about 6 months. Now it only works occasionally and more often than not it either doesn't work at all or we can hear the motor but it doesn't grind the beans. We are very disappointed and I'm sending it back to Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"I have had 2 of these and both have died in less than a year. They work great but not worth buying for such a short life span."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Purchase","review":"This grinder looks nice when it comes out of the box. It has a reputable name on it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work -- at all! I used it three times, and it performed reasonably well. The fourth time I tried to use it, nothing happened. It wouldn't turn on, no matter what I did. No odd sounds from the motor, no smells indicating overheating -- nothing, silence, kaput! Doesn't even pretend to work. Oh well, once bitten, twice shy. Sorry Cuisinart, you'll never have me as a customer for any of your products ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is Junk!","review":"My wife bought me this for my birthday a year ago and after 2 months the switch stopped working. It won't stick so you have to stand there and hold the switch down to grind your coffee. Recently the opposite happened and now the switch is stuck in the \\"on\\" position so you have to operate the unit by plugging and unplugging. Just today, the motor gave out. All this within a year and I don't even use the thing that much. Looks nice and I like the design, but it's total junk. Do yourself a favor and buy something from another manufacturer. That's what I'll be doing today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice upgrade from a blade grinder.","review":"I bought some coffee in Chiapas, Mexico. I put some beans on my blade grinder, pressed the button for a little while, made some coffee using a french press and voilá... well, not voilá. The coffee tasted so bad. It was burnt. I googled on how to grind coffee beans and find out that the blade grinder is not that good; cheap, but not good.Then I decided to upgrade my grinder to this model. I put the same beans, I selected the coarse setting and voilá. The smell of this ground coffee was so different from the other one, it was not burnt. The coffee was excellent, I could appreciate all the flavors and body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor for any expresso machine","review":"It does a poor, no very poor job at grinding any where close to 'fine'do not purchase for anything other then drip coffee makers.It can be modified by filing the 'stop' off so bean holder can turn to a finer grind. But that leads to another problem, they put a micro switch that recognizes if the bean holder is on or off so cutting the 'stop' tells the machine to stop so you must open the machine ( which voids the warrenty) and bypass the micro switch. There easy right? I did it and it work well. I suggest just spending a little more and get a better one . Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 times Broken DO NOT BUY!","review":"I have had 3 of these and they all have broken. I will stick with my old Braun grinder I have had for 15 years. The last one of these I bought only lasted about 3 months and then the motor burned out. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The DBM-8 Burr grinder is of very poor quality. After only one year of once a week use, the on-off switch became unpredictable. Sometime I had to push 40-50 times before it started sometimes only once. Last week it finally quit (RIP). Don't spend your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot grind fine","review":"this is a good burr grinder if you do not plan to grind for espresso. it is unable to grind beans fine enough for my breville espresso maker. i will be returning it for that very reason as i do not like products that cannot do what they say they can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY - CUISINART DISSAPOINTS IN MANY WAYS","review":"Not only did this grinder make an awful noise, not only was it a bit pricey, but it didn't even last a year before the motor blew (and we didn't even use it every day). I took it to a local repair shop to get it fixed, and they told me they couldn't touch it because Cuisinart won't sell anyone else their parts.... but because it was after the warranty, Cuisinart wouldn't touch it either. So now I'm left with an expensive piece of junk. A complete dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Burr Grinder","review":"I have had this grinder for 5 years now and it is still going strong. I agree with the guy from coffeetweek.com about some of the strange reviews of this product. If you want a reliable quality grinder for under $50.00 I don't believe there is a better one in this price range. There is not too much powder or an affect on the taste when used in a drip coffee maker. It is a little noisy, but I set the amount of time to grind walk out the room and come back when done. I always grind at night anyway and not at 4am in the morning. Anyway We have been satisfied for 5years now. If you are a major connoisseur of coffee you might want to spend a few hundred dollars on a professional grade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo - four months later, completely dead","review":"This grinder worked great for a while. We used daily to make a pot of coffee, and although we found the machine to be extremely noisy, it ground even oily french roast beans very well. But within four months, the grinder stopped working completely. Rated a 1 due to unacceptable lifespan and noise level (much louder than our last burr grinder purchased from starbucks that lasted ten years)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Grinder that does not last over 2 years","review":"This is the third unit I have had. The first one worked for a little over 2 years then it quit. The second one arrived DOA. The third is operating and makes an excellent grind. Amazons price was better than anywhere else and when the second one arrived DOA they were quick to replace the defective unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Drip or French Press NOT FOR Expresso","review":"The grinder works well but does not grind fine enough for expresso. The grinder's quantity setting and bean hopper work well. The unit is easy to use. The lid on the coffee grind collector is covered by coffee grinds during grinding and they typically fall off (onto the counter) when removing the lid. Ok overall, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've had the Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder for over a year. I am very pleased with its performance. You can adjust the grind to your preference and it holds enough beans to last about 5 - 7 days (I brew one pot a day). Yes it's loud but aren't all grinders loud??? The only issue I had was when I let the hole get clogged (the hole where the freshly ground beans pass from the grinder into the reservoir) and that was my own fault for not monitoring that and periodically cleaning it out. It can get a little messy when scooping the ground coffee out for use, but I place the reservoir on top of a paper towel and simply wipe up any stray grounds afterward. I would definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing compares!","review":"This coffee grinder is the best you can buy for the price. Even the more expensive brands are not better than this model. The Capresso Infinity seems like a good one, looks good and quiet, but for the price, you're not getting a better ground coffee. The Breville conical grinder is a bit pricey, reliabiltiy seems to be an issue, so to replace it would cost about the price of about 3 extra Cuisinart DBM-8. I bought it to replace another burr mill I had, lasted about 3 years. It should have lasted a little longer if I didn't neglect cleaning it more often. I give it 4 stars, minus one for the noise factor, but I don't mind. Good coffee consistently, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great, but...","review":"I have had this grinder for a little over a year now. I love the design of the unit. It still grinds the beans great but, about two months after I started using it, it does not grind the right amount of beans anymore. It grinds more than it is set for, which is very frustrating. So the cup setting is worthless. Beware if you have a problem with the grinder, keep your receipt. When you call Cuisinart, they run the serial number to see when the unit was made. So they go off of that for your date of purchase. The problem is, if it set in a store or warehouse for a long time, your screwed if you can't supply a receipt to prove when you actually purchased it. Also, you have to pay for shipping to Cuisinart and inclose a check for $4.00 for return shipping. If it wasn't for the problem with grinding the wrong amount of cups, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a waste of your money!

They even make you pay for shipping on machine and replacement parts if they feel like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Durable","review":"We had this grinder for about 9 months and seemed relative satisfied with the results of the grind. However, without warning the threaded section at the bottom of the hopper that feeds the beans into the grinder just broke off into pieces in mid grind. Chewed up the cheap plastic in the hopper feeder into the coffee grinds and is now unusable. We brew 1 pot of coffee a day like most people and I expect a product like this to last for more than just a few months. Not very durable, not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUISINART = CHINESE JUNK","review":"We purchased a cuisinart coffee grinder very similar to this one,identical in appearance, a ccm-16 series.

This unit works just fine for grinding your morning brew. Yes, there is some variation in the fineness of the grind, but all I want is coffee folks. I'm not looking for the second coming of the bean. That said, if you are really, really particular about your coffee (and if you are that anal about it--get a life), this is not the machine for you.

It can take 10- 20 trys to get it over the button on the bottom.

My friend liked it so well for morning coffee, I decided to buy one for myself for grinding spices.Spice grinding: It works well enough for less oily seeds like cumin, but is a disaster for grinding dried ginger (much too hard) or cloves (too oily and clog up the grinding chamber). The last time it nearly kicked the bucket (circuit?). It stopped working for over an hour and only worked after I thoroughly cleared it out.

Though it served me fairly well for over 3 yrs, I was glad that it stopped working recently so I could justify stepping up to the better-in-every-way Bodum model.It's noisy and produces a lot of dust in all grind resolution settings. The dust tends to cake up in the upper corner of the grinds bin so you have to take some care not to make a mess when opening the lid. Also,the dust can lead to excessive sludge when using a press.The plastic threaded bottom of the hopper assembly broke about 6 months in and multiple support inquiries through cuisinart's site went ignored. I was able to repair it myself and I will not be purchasing any cuisinart products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality grinder","review":"Sad to say but it looks like Cuisinart have dropped the ball with this product. I bought this grinder at Costco several years back because of the brand name and the reasonable price... what a mistake. Along with all the relevant annoyances the rest of the reviewers are describing (lousy grinding; loud; coffee getting stuck in the safety micro-switches... to name a few) , this grinder started to fail only a year after my purchase. First the timer slider stopped working, then the circuit board gave up in its second year... how hard is to manufacture a reliable product that simple....?? It's not a rocket science after all.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for STATIC!!!!!!!!","review":"It does grind well and adjusts to a fine or coarse grind evenly, but unfortunately because of the plastic catch(I guess) it creates a static mess and grinds fly everywhere when you take the catch out and remove the lid. Even when you pour the grinds into the filter they fly across the top of the pot. This is going back to the store and I will try to find a better burr grinder with less or hopefully no static!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Burr Mill Grinder","review":"It stores the beans in the top and will grind the correct amount of beans for coffee that you want to make. It is fast, but a little loud. It is NOT as messy as my old bean chopper. It is adjustable to be able to grind a very fine espresso powder to a coarse grind. Well worth the money and I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The consistency of the grind as well as the volume output are as good as it gets. I deduct one star though because IMHO Cuisinart should have made the grind chamber out of glass instead of plastic. Plastic creates static electricity and the fine coffee grinds stick to the inside, so you have to wash & dry the grind chamber after every single use. Other than that, I love this grinder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintiegrated a few months after warranty","review":"I loved this grinder until yesterday, when the grinder mechanism disintegrated. Blew all the screws and ground them up with the coffee! Of course, it's just out of warranty, (18 months) so I have no recourse but to buy another one. Obviously, I won't be replacing the new one with the same brand. I'm bummed, because Cuisinart products have been pretty reliable for me in the past. I really think they should at least try to make products that last a good while beyond the length of the warranty they offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"dusty and messy","review":"I'm in search of the perfect grinder, of course. As a decades-old coffee drinker, I've tried several. I was reasonably impressed with Starbucks' Barista-brand burr grinder. It got all the grind settings right, even for espresso, but after each use a small pile of grounds wound up on the counter. So I tried this Cuisinart, since I have the company's coffee maker and the price was right. However, I have a couple of complaints: (1) the ground coffee must pass through a very narrow chute into the container, so the chute clogs easily; and (2) there was so much static friction from the grinding process (or whatever) that excessive ground coffee would attach to the container's sides. After each use, I had to spend several minutes cleaning up.Now, onto the Kitchen Aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Replace Yearly","review":"While this grinder works well at first, beware! Our second one just died after a little over a year. The previous one had a similar lifespan. It was not used for industrial/business purposes, parties, or anything excessive--my husband just used it to grind beans for his morning espresso, which was necessary about every other day. I knew it was every other day because the thing is so loud I could hear it in the bedroom on the other side of the house! Grinder number 3 will definitely be a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment eased","review":"After fewer than six months of daily use, this grinder began to grind less and less coffee for each setting of the timer. It now requires four cycles of the 12-cup position to grind enough beans for an 8-cup carafe. One reviewer has suggested rigorous cleaning, but even that is of no avail. It goes for replacement (along with my $4) tomorrow, but I expect the same results. Instead,the writer who recommends a simple untimed blade grinder may be on the right track.This unit was replaced under warranty by the factory at minimal return shipping cost. The replacement has been in daily use for several months and appears to be entirely satisfactory. Perhaps the key to my current pleasure is daily cleaning of the \\"exit window\\" which feeds the ground coffee into the collector. Build-up there can accumulate thick and fast and interfere with operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintegration","review":"Owned this grinder about 1 year. Worked fine in general. It is important to remove the hopper and clean the grind surfaces and, more importantly make sure the opening into the grind container is cleared from time to time. It clogs much more readily with the oil coated beans. Dry beans, such as starbucks, are much less likely to stick in the opening. The reason my 1 star is that the threads on the hopper disintegrated after a while and the hopper would no longer screw into the base. The threads are made of plastic and are a bit delicate. Would have made more sense if they were steel, as this part of the hopper is an integral part of the grind chamber. Well it is the trash hep for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"But at least it looks nice...","review":"I bought this grinder because for one it matched my coffee maker, and another, it was a burr grinder. I have had it for 6 weeks and this morning I press the button, and nothing. It does not work. I would not recommend this to anyone. There is a warranty, but now I wonder, how long will it be before I get my grinder back? And after shipping and the $4 for them to ship it back, will it really be worth it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no better than a whirly blade for a uniform grind","review":"I have used this product for a couple years. I have always been disappointed with the extra fine grind (dust) that comes through, but just figured that you couldn't do better. I don't know if it is the plastic burrs or what, but the fact of the matter is that you do not get a uniform grind. Recently I had used one of the 80$ Capresso burr grinders and was amazed by the uniformity of the grind, none of the dust was present (they have steel burrs).So what I'm saying is that if you just want to grind coffee, there is no need to buy this, just use a 15$ whirly blade grinder. If you want a uniform grind, don't look here, save up 40$ more and buy a Capresso.2 stars because the output is smaller than the input beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst coffee grinder ever","review":"At less than six months old, the automatic function ceased; next time it stopped and began to smoke. Then I could not locate the receipt to return it where I purchased it (Costco) so it will probably get dumped. Will buy another brand. Yes, I had read earlier reviews of the Cuinsinart appliance and I should have heeded the warnings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Coffee - BAD for Espresso","review":"I have been grinding coffee beans for years and have not found a perfect grinder - not looking for one. This grinder is a nice looking piece that will complement any countertop - brushed chrome, stylish hopper, clicky adjustments. It will grind coffee just fine, but does a HORRIBLE job grinding fine for espresso. On the finest setting, I have to run the grounds through 4 times and use a wooden spoon to shove them through. The only reason it is not in the trash is I am waiting for Cuisinart to reply to my inquiries regarding adjustments. It is my hope that my grinder has bad factory settings or maybe I can open it up and adjust it myself. I do not recommend this grinder for anyone intending to grind espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing lack of durability","review":"For a little while this was a pretty good grinder. It quietly stopped working a few months after I bought it. I used it for personal use once a day, every day of the week. This should have been through much harsher testing by the manufacturer.- poor quality+ When it did work, the coffee grind was consistent. The quality of brewed coffee was noticably better than that made with coffee chopped in a spice mill.- grinding coffee was messy due to static and its effect on the grounds- this device is too bulky; competitors offer much sleaker form factorsI would not buy this product again, nor would I buy and electrical device from Cuisinart. Four months is too short a lifespan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it till it died after 3 months... twice.","review":"I loved the look and function of this grinder... until the motor died, after just 3 months of use. My brand new replacement also died after 3 months of use. I couldn't get through to Cuisinart's customer service, either - I had to leave a message and wait for them to call me back, which hasn't happened yet. I will NOT be buying Cuisinart in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a blade grinder.","review":"I bought this for home use on the weekends. No Good. This grinder is an unbelievably high speed and noisy mill that turns a good 10 percent of the beans into fine powder. The high-speed burrs overheat the beans and produce a terrible cup of coffee. It sounds like a jet engine about to blow. My cheap GE blade grinder from Wal-Mart does a better job and is quieter. Perhaps the Kitchen Aid Pro-Line mill that I use every day at work has spoiled me. If you want to use a burr grinder to elevate the quality of your coffee, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok... while it works","review":"Worked great for 3 months... then it died. Out of Amaazon return dates... means it needs to go back to Cuisinart which is proving a pain and will probably cost me more than it is worth. Don't skimp on this stuff... it is a bad morning when your coffee aparatus bites it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too noisy, static electricity buildup","review":"This grinder is really noisy. It may grind the coffee a bit better than the blender-type units, but it is not worth the deafening racket it puts out. The ground coffee is also electrostatically charged, which makes it hard to pour into the coffeepot basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine in you like to buy replacements.","review":"My wife's favorite grinder and It does an excellent job but it doesn't last. We have gone through three of them and have moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not consistent in measuring coffee","review":"The timer on this product is very inaccurate. It is supposed to allow you to set the grind cycle for the number of cups you want and then grind the proper amount of beans. The timer varies greatly: Sometimes too much (too strong); sometimes too little (too weak). The lowest setting is four cups although it appears their idea of a cup is about half a cup (4 oz). Grinding works OK but they would have done better with a physical measurement (a small cache that holds exactly a standard coffee measure) than a timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuisinart dbm-8","review":"this is good grinder for regular coffee but no for expresso the coffee beans don't came fine enough for expreso machine"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple yet efficient","review":"+ Haven't tried all the settings yet, but it's pretty efficient at the lowest grain size.+ Very quick grind- As said elsewhere, the plastic of the receptacle is a bit annoying: some ground coffee tend to stick to it.- Quite noisy (but since it's so quick and there's a timer, not much of a problem to me)- Stickers on the thing : why do they have to put stickers describing it on the grinder ? It's really annoying! It's in my home, I know what it does, it's written on the box!- An air tight lid on the top as well as an opaque bean container would be a plus to avoid the degradation of the quality of the coffee beans in the dispenser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 3 months","review":"Worked great for 3 months. Then made a horrible noise, smoke came from within and it would not start. Could not get through to Cuisinart. I tried for 3 days before I gave up. Apparently they hang up after you have been on hold for 20 minutes. To be clear, I only ground coffee once a day. No excessive use, nothing out of the ordinary. Just plain ol' coffee beans from Trader Joe's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, Grinds OK","review":"This is the first burr grinder we owned. We tend to grind fine. This grinder is far more messy then any previous grinders we've had. Next burr grinder we buy will be with anti-static technology. Didn't know to look for that previously. After about a year the motor burnt out. The grinds get stuck, where they pour out. We've since learned to clean it with a toothpick or sharp object. Consistency is ok. It is a hastle to empty and change coffee beans. But the convenience of not having to fill each day is nice; a trade-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have had 3, all have broken","review":"I loved this grinder while it lasted.

I will purchase a different brand going forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD Coffee grinder","review":"I recieved a Supreme Grind Burr Mill Model # DBM-8 for Christmas. I was extremely disappointed IN the LOUD NOISE IT MAKES WHILE GRINDING. So loud that we can hear it outside of the house. Unbelievable for a Quisinart product. My cheap $15.00 grinder is quiter and faster. Getting the grind and the cups to match what we like was a game in it self, requiring a lot of pots to get it right. Thank goodness it was a gift because I would never buy it on my own. It's going back into the box and I'm using my cheap model. This way I won't wake the dead, NOT KIDDING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds well but....","review":"This burr grinder does a good job of grinding. However, the timer broke on the fourth day and it's now necessary to hold the button down while grinding. This is a hassle and reduces my appreciation for how well the grinder itself works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice grinder for the money","review":"This is a very nice burr mill grinder for the price. A burr mill really does make a big difference in the flavor of the coffee. We have owned one of these grinders for about a month now and really like it. It is not as quiet as the $150 models, but for 1/3 the price still a really good grinder. It is midly noisy (similar to a blade grinder) and the plastic catch cup does promote a lot of static, but we grind a few days coffee at a time, so the mess is minimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it if you can afford to","review":"I've been searching for a good grinder for home and I know I don't want this one. We've been using this one at work. It's messy and the throat clogs with beans regularly. The burr does not come out to clean, either, so it's difficult to maintain. If you can afford a better one, I would recommend you pass this one over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks down too quickly.","review":"No real problems with the unit until it broke down less than a year after purchase. Honestly, I was too lazy to follow through with the warrantee, but an appliance should last longer than one year. Now I'm back to a simple blade grinder. I have other Cuisinart products that are functioning well, just bought a lemon I guess. But beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This burr grinder does not deliver the consistent grind that you should expect. Whenever I did a coarse grind, there was also a fine clumpy powder that would stick to the lid. Which would make a nice coffee slushy but not a proper cup of joe. This grinder was a gift to me, so I thought I would stick with it but after three years the internal mechanism stripped the threads on the plastic hopper making it completely unusable.My advice spend another $40 and get a better made grinder. The cuisinart was bad from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Burr Grinder","review":"I grind a large amount of beans every few days and keep it in the refrigerator.

When I first got it, I loved it, which is why I gave it 2 stars, otherwise I would have only given one. After about 6 months of light use (I didn't even use it every day, and when I did I only ground enough for 4 cups) it just died on me. It wouldn't do anything. I've had the same issue with other Cuisinart coffee products. If they could make it more durable, it would be a great machine. You can store a lot of beans in the hopper, simply select the number of cups you plan to brew and brew method, and it grinds up the right amount of beans. But, only lasting 6 months makes it not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a blade grinder","review":"I bought it a while ago and expected to use it both for my french press and espresso machine. However, it is horrible for this purpose. It generates lots of powder for french press, resulting LOTS of sediment in my coffee. It cannot grind as fine as necessary for espresso either, resulting a very weak espresso cup. That said, it's good for drip coffee machine, pretty convenient and easy to clean, but don't expect it to be an upgrade for a blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great While it Lasted","review":"This grinder has been a joy for the last nine months. I bought it in Oct. 2006. Now in June, 9 months later, it has suddenly stopped working. It gave no hint that its last grind would be the final grind.The grinder I had before lasted over 5 years. I have only used the grinder once every two or three days and very gently. Why did it just stop?Will be very wary of Cuisinart products from here on out. What a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PRODUCT","review":"Perfect measurement each time..whether it's for 2,4,6 or more cups. The grounds are true to their settings.

It's probably still under warranty, but I didn't save the receipt. The upper burr is attached to a flimsy plastic spout through which the beans fall. The torque from the motor will eventually crack this tube rendering the grinder useless and in two pieces. Also, the on off switch is secured inside the case by two thin (1/6th inch) plastic rods which go through the switch and are melted on top. The least stress pulls the switch off the rods making it inaccesible to the outer sliding switch...You then can't turn it off. Save your money and buy a decent grinder. I've seen factory reconditioned solis maestro's for $53 on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Coffee Snobs","review":"This Cuisinart Supreme Grind is only slightly better than a blade grinder.The burrs are metal plates with blunt, not sharp, teeth for grinding. I am skeptical that the burrs are even steel. Another downside is that as it grinds a fine powder builds up in the corner of the container while larger grounds fall to the bottom; static is a problem, but ultimately it is easy to keep a tidy counter with this grinder.One positive feature is that one of the burrs is removable and therefore, I can have it modified and sharpened.Conclusion: spend $20-30 less and get a blade grinder or spend $30-40 more and get a good burr grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can hear it a mile away","review":"I've never heard anything louder in my life. we keep it in a cabinet in the garage- turn it on quickly, close the cabinet , rush in the garage door & close that also & it still wakes everyone up.

I usually grind 3 lbs of coffee at a time (make enough pods for a month) and the Krups did a good job but was slowwwwwwwww. This unit is apparently only for light daily use. On my second use the motor has apparently burned out. No use sending it back under warranty since the cost of shipping and insurance will be more than I paid for it. I also use French Roast coffee which is very oily and it does tend to gum up the burr grinder. Well, back to the Krups!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never knew what good coffee tasted like before","review":"See Alton Brown's recipe for coffee on the food channel's website. This mill grinder is merely ok, it grinds some of the beans down to a powder, which is not good, it is supposed to grind everything the same when it is a burr grinder. For what this does, I could have gotten a blade grinder for a lot less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice, Effective Grinder","review":"I purchased this grinder for my husband who likes fresh ground, specialty coffee. We have been using a blade grinder for many years and I figured that it was time for another one or a different type. I had heard that burr grinders were very good and this one came up in my email from Amazon because I had bought a Bunn Coffeemaker a few years ago. I priced other burr grinders and they were very expensive so I ordered this one for a start. We really like the fact that we just push a button and grinding is done quickly. We have found that, even though we like strong coffee, we can turn it to a medium setting and still get the same flavor.Our only complaint is similar to a few of the reviews I had read earlier - that the grounds stick to the plastic container because of static electricity. Otherwise we are very happy with our purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great burr grinder","review":"This was a gift for my son and he loves it.

I received this as a gift and I liked the idea that I could adjust the grind settings for different uses. I have to say that the grind from the machine is fairly inconsistent and my expensive espresso machine does not work well with the grounds from this grinder.The machine is incredibly noisy. I get a lot of comments on the noise it produces when guests are over. I also thought all grinders were this noisy until my brother used his new grinder recently and it produced 1/10 the noise as this one.Lastly, I've had the grinder over 1 year and the plastic chute connected under the hopper just recently split entirely from the hopper - so this needs to be replaced. The part is only $8, but with shipping it will be $15 and already half the cost of the entire machine. I may be looking for a total replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? WHAT? I Can't hear you over the coffee grinder!!","review":"Very. very. loud. and it grinds and grinds and grinds for a very long time and we could never figure out where all that ground coffee ended up because it wasn't in the receptacle.

I get everything from powdered coffee to the grind I selected. Not only is the grind consistency very poor, it runs at a very high rpm and is extremely noisy. It is louder than my blade grinders. If you're into a lot of noise and varied grind sizes in your coffee, then this is you're grinder.

Tired of cleaning up after using it. No matter what grind setting I use it creates a fine grind of coffee dust that explodes onto everything around when I open the grind container. The grind is inconsistent and the amount unpredictable. The beans stick in the hopper so if I select 8 cups or 12 cups I may get 4 or 12??... Find another, better brand. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product - Do Not Buy","review":"Our grinder lasted less than 3 months. It maybe ground 80 pots of coffee before it burned out.

The first one lasted five years of problem free service, used once or twice a day year round. The motor gave out.

The Cuisinart did a good job of grinding, and was no more or less messy/hard to clean than others. But, it was the loudest and then broke at about 6 months. It's back to the Braun KMM 30 for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Husband loved it until it died after only 8 months","review":"My husband was thrilled to receive this burr mill for Father's Day '05. I thought I was buying a quality piece of equipment, it looks good and I knew he would love being able to store his beans in the hopper. But it just died in January '06. I've emailed Cuisinart about it being replaced, I'll give an update when something transpires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Different Grinder","review":"I have owned a Cuisinart DBM-8 burr grinder for 1 year. My main complaint is that it always grinds at least one TBS of very fine powder, no matter the grind setting, which makes coffee overly bitter. I've had to sift the powder out of the ground coffee each morning. This can be annoying if you've bought the grinder to make french press coffee which requires a consistently coarse grind. This burr grinder stopped working after only 1 year of use. If you've got the money, invest in something better than this grinder. For $50, the Cuisinart DBM-8 should last more than 1 year and offer a more consistent grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a hammer?","review":"Regardless of the setting you use, you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds. In addition, the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work. Be prepared to grind more than you need, and then measure the grounds (somehow avoiding the powder) yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Noisy. 106db!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This grinder seems to work fine. However after owning it just 2 weeks, I can't take it anymore! We are buying another grinder. It is the loudest applicance I have ever heard. It sounds like an air raid siren! I took out my Radio Shack sound meter and measured the sound level at 106db at a half a meter!

Cuisinart.It's not a question of **if** it will break but **when**. I realize there tends to be a lot of hyperbole in some of these ratings websites such as this, but my Cuisinart burr grinder worked ***ONE*** time. Once. As in 'two minus one' times.

I was satisfied with the grind produced using the coarsest setting, although as other reviewers have noted, the grinder does produce some dust. The unit burned out after 13 months. I may perform an autopsy to see what failed, but am sure it is not fixable as it put out a considerable amount of (nasty) smoke when going through it's death throes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This grinder is fatally flawed","review":"I bought this grinder a little over a year and a half ago, and right as the warranty was expiring it started to fail. It started with a weak grind and eventually burned out completely. I used it about 4 times a week for about 10 seconds each time. That's right, less than a minute per week and it burned out. If this were a $15 cheapy model no big deal, but I bought a model that is not supposed to be junk. Customer service cordially let me know about the 18 month warranty limit and indicated that in any case I would have to ship it, and send $7 dollars as well for them to return it. It was a moot point because I am out of warranty, but I think what is clear is that Cuisinart is making products that are poorly engineered. Very convenient for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"have had this one for less than a year. it is giving up the ghost. the hole where the coffee shoots into the little holding tank constantly gets gummed up and needs to be cleaned. now the coffee won't feed properly into the grinder. it seems a simple device to have so many chalenges.

It would be nice if there were a little more control, but it is a pretty mechanical process. It has a solid construction and fits a whole pound Of beans.

Definately not a fine Turkish Coffeegrind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this grinder!","review":"Looks like most in the reviews either love it or hate it. For me, I love it. It's the perfect size for my counter and the coffee tastes perfect! I use filtered water so perhaps that could be the problem with those who complain about the taste. One negative thing I have to say about this machine is that the container that captures the ground coffee is plastic so you get a lot of static and you are cleaning up coffee grinds each time you use it. Also, the motor stops based on the \\"cups of coffee for brewing\\" that you select so you will have to restart it a few times if you are brewing more than a pot full at a time. Small potatoes compared to having wonderful fresh ground coffee. Love it!! Would recommend for the amateur coffee lover :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder","review":"Great entry level burr grinder. Others noted that the plastic reservoir has static cling and the need to use the brush to get ground coffee out. Small inconvenience. Noisy,as most grinders are, but very quick. Does not seem to create noticeable heat. A little big for the counter, but manageable. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Capresso","review":"This stopped working for me after a few months. And while it was working, I was unimpressed. My roommate had a capresso burr grinder, and when he moved out, I thought i'd save some money and buy the cuisinart. Waste of money. First of all, it just doesn't grind quite as finely as I would like for espresso. Second, it is a freaking mess and really hard to use without getting grinds all over the place. Third, the grounds are not all of a consistent size.All in all, I ended up buying a capresso after all and I am pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened","review":"I purchased the Cuisinart DBM-8 after reading mostly positive reviews, thinking the negative reviews were just whiners. Extremely loud and irritating (no longer is coffee the best part of waking up). Plastic cup to catch the grounds charges with static electricity and grounds are uncontainable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish, but short life and poor performance","review":"It's an attractive grinder, holds plenty of coffee and it worked great for about 6 months. After that, I started having problems. The first problem is that the grinder got backed up with coffee. That's not a big issue - it can be cleaned with a toothpick. The cup, even after a thorough cleaning and drying, would have places where the coffee would stick, building up over a few grinds and never releasing without scraping it out. Scraping the coffee just seemed to make it worse. I gave the whole grinder a thorough cleaning on the outside, and the cup as well. After that, the cup started slipping out when grinding and it has to be held in now while grinding. Now the whole thing has gone out (after 1.5 years) by getting caught, on of all things, a coffee bean. I'm definitely willing to spend $20-50 more to get something that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burr Mill Grinder","review":"This is my second DBM-8 I have had one at home for a couple of years now. I purchased this grinder for my office. Overall I find the grinder to work as expected. I Like the hopper I can put the days beans in the hopper in the morning and not worry about it the rest of the day. Also I don't have to count scoops anymore. I always get complements on the look of the grinder and the taste of the coffee. The largest downside of the grinder is it can be very loud which is not good for an office setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but is terrible at making consistant grinds","review":"I bought this because I have a Cuisinart Espresso machine. At first the coffee the pair made was pretty good, unfortunately this grinder also grinds a fine powder that mixes in with the regular grinds that make the coffee undrinkable. I would recommend something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"my mistake","review":"The role of Amazon in the purchase and delivery of the coffee grinder was, as usual, smooth and efficient. The coffee grinder was branded Cuisinart, a brand I have trusted and respected for many years. This particular grinder does not live up to the reputation of Cusiinart. The instructions claim the grinder can be set for fine or coarse grinding. Not so. The most coarse is roughly equal to \\"regular grind\\" coffee, and there is a lot of coffee powder so fine that it adheres to the sides of the receptacle.This grinder performs roughly as well as the cheapest spinning blade coffee grinder selling for $19.95. Does anyone make a grinder similar to my manual burr grinder, but electric? This one is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUBPAR PRODUCT!

It was my first coffee grinder. I generally enjoyed it and the flavor of my coffee until it stopped working after less than 6 months. That is simply an unacceptable lifespan for a relatively simple appliance. Otherwise I agree with other comments that it is noisy, messy, and creates a good amount of powder. I could have lived with those minor complaints and given this 3 or 4 stars if it was reliable. But it isn't - on to another brand..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it while it worked","review":"I liked this grinder for the first two years that I was using it. It did it's job and made a good grind for my single cup drip. Then one day it stopped working and my girlfriend noticed that some screws had fallen out of the grinding plates. We got a new top which included the grinding plates and it just stopped working. Bummer. I was hoping to get quality from the Cuisinart brand. You pay a little more and you hope that it lasts a long time. Not with this one. Lost faith with Cuisinart quality from my experience with this machine. Lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"be careful before replacing this","review":"Mine stopped working after a year or so, though the motor was ok. I had heard that grinding white, uncooked rice would clean one and mine ground the rice fine but beans would not go through. Unscrewed the hopper and found pasty residue around the feed tube keeping beans from going through but smaller rice was no problem. Cleaned the hopper tube with wet paper towel and back in business. Only objection now is high noise level."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a great grinder ....... for the two years of its life","review":"I loved this coffee grinder for so many reasons - the fact that you could just measure the beans, adjust the grind and the number of cups, push a button and walk away while it worked. And it did work - regularly - about twice a week - for nearly two years. Then, one morning --- I got up, measured out the beans, pushed \\"START\\" and it made a very slow grinding noise ...... produced no ground coffee ..... and gave up the ghost.So now I'm ordering one of the cheaper, dependable Braun or Krupps grinders, like I've had before - which last about 10 to 15 years before they need to be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"I have owned two of these machines in the last two weeks.

But even if you get over how loud it is, the plastic grind bin is the worst product design I've ever seen. The plastic gets a static charge which make grounds (I grind \\"medium\\") cling to it. I defy you to dump the grounds into a coffee pot without making a colossal mess. I've had 5 different people try it (to make sure it wasn't just me) but there are grounds on the counter, the floor, and all over the coffee pot itself. How could this have gotten thru product testing?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Six months? How sucky.","review":"We have used this grinder for six months and it suddenly stopped working. Since the original packaging contained no instructions on how to clean it, we have been unable to remove any debris from the burrs or inner chambers of the machine. I called Cuisinart to have it replaced or fixed, and they REFUSE to honor the warranty. An 18 month warranty!!! BUYER BEWARE. You are throwing your money away if you buy this machine.

In essence, it should produce even results, granting you the ability to use it for espresso through French press. When attempting to use the coarse setting, it produced a lot of powder, which is unacceptable for French press. Also, my 5-year old and 1-year old are both wide awake now that I'm making coffee - this thing is excessively loud.I do not recommend this product. I had better results using my blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably worth $50","review":"I took this product back the first day I bought it for the simple fact that it did not have a fine enough grind for espresso. It seemed to produce a decent drip or press grind, but would also create a clump of dust in the top corner of the bin (annoying). For the engergy conscience, it also stays warm when plugged in, maybe because of internal circuitry such as a transformer. I bought a Baratza, much more expensive, and was impressed with the quality of the grind. I recommend the Baratza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"Purchased the DBM-8 11 months ago and have made grounds twice a day since then.

(no odd increments.)The mill does produce a consistent grind - though it is adjustable, it consistently produces particles of fine grind as well as whatever coarseness you set it on. So for instance, set to a very coarse grind for use in a french press, a significant amount of fine-grind is produced. This is undesirable.It is an okay grinder, not bad enough return yet at the same time, not worthy of praise either.--after less than a year the safety switch in the base is malfunctioning and sometimes the grinder is UN-useable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Working After 7 Months","review":"This grinder did a decent enough job for the first few months, then I began having trouble getting it to turn on.

We've been very happy with this Cuisinart grinder since we were not expecting it to last this long. It grinds efficiently, but it's kind of loud. Most grinders are loud though, so expect it. This grinder has a WIDE variety of settings for course/fineness of grounds. We used this for our espresso machine a few times, and had no problems. Grounds were plenty fine to allow for adequate brewing. Most of the time, we used it for our drip coffeemaker. The receptacle is made of plastic though, so static and dust is a bit of a problem, and the more you use the brush to sweep the grounds from the receptacle the worse it gets. However, for the price, this might be the best budget grinder available. We will look for a different grinder this time, that has a stainless steel or glass receptacle, but if the price isn't reasonable...we will purchase this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Turkish Coffee","review":"I have bought this item two weeks ago.

The Baratza line has a multi-use fusing circuit, that once your grinder cools down, it resets and you can continue using your grinder. The Cuisinart has many nice features, otherwise but this \\"cost focused\\" design is a major limit. For a self-liquidating price Cusinart will ship you a replacement unit during the warranty period.

It wouldn't be cost effective to send it to returns by the time I pay postage. I'm the only coffee drinker in my house so it hasn't had heavy use.

Noisy, but all burr mills are inherently noisy. Problem is that the internal workings are housed in bakelite and that gives the unit a short life.

Well the new one has worked a year and now it has also stopped working.I'm moving onto something else where I don't have to replace it again within a years time.I've actually been disappointed with Cuisinart products in the past 15 years (blender base broke) I think they've gone a cheaper route in motor, blades and quality, too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy this if you're willing to throw it out after 6 months","review":"My wife bought me this grinder for Father's Day 2009.

It goes back to the store (Sams)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and that overwhelms all pros of this device","review":"This is my first written review on Amazon because I've never felt so strongly about a product that I wanted to share my opinion. This grinder is messy. The device grinds the coffee beans into a plastic box. The plastic box has a lid on top and a hole on the side for the grinder to spit coffee into.When you open the lid and then set it down on a table, a cloud of ground coffee goes poof and you have ground coffee on your table. When I grind 4 cups worth of beans, a fourth of the ground coffee is stuck to the side of the container. When I scoop this out, the ground coffee (being statically charged) does not always land into the coffee filter. It gets in the coffee water, the table my coffee machine stands on.I tried to simply empty the contents of the container directly into the filter. This seems to work best but I still cannot avoid a mess removing the lid. It takes 100 seconds to carefully do this and it still makes a mess. This is not convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"Like many others, I bought this hoping it would do a great job, that the name Cuisinart would mean quality, and that it would look great in the process. Well, the last one it did, until I threw the unit in the trash. Like many others, I was so-so impressed with its grinding accuracy. But, the biggest disappointment was its failing within the first year of light use. The power switch simply stopped working. Real shame, I had equipped my entire kitchen with Cuisinart products [coffee maker, juicer, toaster, griddler, can opener, blender]. But this one was a terrible buy. Don't get one, you'll likely be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Power. Failed. Will Not Buy Another","review":"Initially I gave this product five stars. It worked well for about 150 grinds.

A couple of months after I received it, the on/off switch went out. I called Cuisinart and promptly sent another. But, just after the warranty ran out, the same problem with the switch recurred. I don't know which brand I will replace it with, but I will now stay away from the Cuisinart. The bad switch seems to be a design flaw. Apart from that, however, the machine adequately ground the coffee beans.

I like how easy it is to use this and it really does have a sharp appearance, and I love it while it lasts which is why I purchased 4 of these in only two years before deciding this is my last one! Each one worked great until one day it just quit working. My husband took the last one apart hoping he could fix it however he found that the inside was all corroded, and there were a couple screws that seemed to belong nowhere. I think that after the 4th grinder, it's safe to say that Cuisinart may need to go back and do some fine tuning on this one, some think this is too loud, but most electric grinders are, and the noise doesn't last long. Still, I wouldn't recommend this grinder just because they just don't seem to last very long, and we only use ours once each day in the morning, and that's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Grind","review":"It looks nice, and easy to use but it does NOT grind very well at all. The \\"coarse\\" grind creates big shards of coffee that nobody would ever use to brew drip coffee and the fine grind is more like what you WOULD use to brew drip coffee, not fine enough to brew espresso at all. Its annoying because in the directions for use it says that the fine grinds are very compact which is not true. It isn't only a fluke on this particular machine because I have had two of the same machine. One I bought six months ago and took it back and another that was given to me. Don't buy this.

A little background: We have owned this unit for approx. 2 years. It is used 2 to 3 times per week. The quality of the grind, regardless of the setting, is accurate and consistent.Just recently the clear bean carrier or basket, broke completely off where it connects in the unit. This happened while the grinding was taking place. No, the unit was not dropped, tipped over or handled without the utmost in care. Yet, this component broke cleanly off where it meets the blade area in the unit.We are disappointed to say the least! Is this a design flaw? A materials faliure?The unit is out of warranty and Cuisinart will offer no repair or replacement.You be the judge. : ((I might add, the unit was not available, 2 years ago, in the current price range.

This one is one of the worst. Big, Clunky, EXTREMELY Loud (gets louder after the first month...?) and messy as all-get-out. The plasticky build quality (with stainless panels hot glued on) creates a static force field which impart a lovely avalanche of grinds that defy gravitational forces.The grind selector is ambitious with it's multiple settings, however it will only give you about 3 different grinds (coarse, medium and semi-fine)- which also needs to be cleaned about every 5 grinds to be even remotely accurate, which it isn't and I don't have time to clean this thing every 2 days.Bloody Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice But Cheap","review":"After only 2 years of owning this product the plastic piece that joins the hopper to the grinder is broken and is unuseable.

It seems like the last products I have bought from Cuisinart have not lasted, one coffee pot broke after 3 months which was replaced. One 14 cup food processor broke after 6 months of very infrequent use, which Cuisinart would not honor the warranty, charging me $100.00 to fix. This grinder when it worked was wonderful, much quieter than my last grinder, easy to use and clean. I would check other reviews to see how long their coffee grinder lasted.

Then arbitrarily it just stopped working. I thought it was because of something I did, so I re-read the directions in order to try and trouble-shoot the issue and found nothing in the instruction booklet that would give me a clue. Finally, I had to chalk it up to poor quality. If you are looking for a good value, don't purchase this coffee grinder.

Previously this grinder was too pricey for my pocketbook, but I found one at a military exchange for a reasonable price, so bought one there. Then went online at Amazon and the price was somewhat less, so bought another one for my son & Amazon shipped it to him---it arrived in two days. Then, the price went down even further, so I bought another for my daughter's boyfriend and another to be shipped to friends back East! Amazon makes things easy for Christmas shopping!

This was a great grinder for a drip machine with a filter, but when I switched to a vacuum pot, I quickly realized how pathetic this machine really is. I was used to a fine grind, but this was too fine for the vacuum pot and created mud at the bottom of the pot of coffee. I tried a coarser grind, but found that it still created quite a bit of fine grind along with very coarse coffee. Not very efficient.If you are looking for convenience and use a filter, this is a good coffee mill, however, if you use a French Press, vacuum pot or screen filter, you will be unhappy as the grind is very inconsistent.

So while I originally thought it was a solid piece of equipment, it now looks like a crap shoot. I tried to return it, but the return window has already closed (after 1 month).In terms of my experience:1) This grinder tends to be aggressive on the grounds/cup ratio (set on 12, it easily makes 16 cups worth of ground coffee)2) There are always some really fine grounds that will go right through a reusable filter.3) It's a bit loud and takes a little while to grind, but you only have to touch it once, which is pretty nice.So mine works well - but now I have to say order at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Grinder","review":"The Cuisinart DBM-8 coffee grinder is great.We were given one like it as a gift 3 or 4 years ago.

It does a good job of grinding beans, it does so with a minimum of fuss, it's clean, and it's not too loud. There are only two drawbacks: First, it tends to produce some powdered coffee with every grind. This is inevitable with any grinder; but when you grind in small batches it's more noticeable. (Grinding a half pound of beans at a time will minimize the difficulty, but it sort of obviates the purpose of having a home grinder.) Second, as mentioned in another review, there are four or five tablespoons' worth of beans inside the grinding mechanism when the hopper appears empty: it does make it difficult to change quickly from one group of beans to another. In all, it's much better than a blade grinder, at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inexpensive and poorly made grinder","review":"Yes, its a step up from a blade grinder, barely.

Over the last four years, FIVE Cuisinart products have failed us, including this one this morning. We have used it daily and have never been happy with it. The grind was extremely inconsistent, the timer rarely delivers a consistent amount of coffee, and at least every other time it was used it clogged itself up (creating a lovely screaching noise while it searched for more beans). The plastic parts are cheap. The amount of coffee dust that clings to the sides is pretty annoying, and trying to get it out makes a huge mess every morning.Finally today we threw this junk in the trash. A plastic internal threaded piece broke and if not for the backup KitchenAid grinder we have had for ten years we would be at an espresso stand buying our morning coffee.Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 2 Years and Unrepairable","review":"This unit was OK as a grinder - better than a blade grinder but not the best. Consistency was not great, and it was usually too fine. There was always a mix of fine powder produced, and some of it stuck to the output and the container. Still, it was an OK grinder until it had a massive failure. The bottom part of the bean hopper broke and jammed into the burr mechanism, freezing and destroying it. Nothing to do but trash it. I'll be looking elsewhere to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. Complete waste of money.","review":"I bought this in December 2011 as a Christmas present. We drink coffee once a day in the morning and use it then. It broke this weekend. The motor burned up. It's March 26th, 2012. So, if you want to spend forty bucks for something that works for three months, go for it. It's junk. I'm tired of every \\"used to be decent company\\" cheaping out and having China make their stuff. Never again, Cuisinart.

I had a Braun blade grinder for 10 years that we only retired because the plastic top finally got eaten away, but for a regular pot (filter or press), it made perfectly good coffee. It didn't do espresso, but then, neither does this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine Start, But Short Lived!","review":"This Cuisinart Coffee Mill started off performing very nicely about 4 months ago. It produced a very consistent grind of coffee without the heat buildup - and associated loss of flavor - that I had experienced with the smaller coffee grinder products.However, over the last 2 weeks or so, the unit has been grinding the same amount of time on the same setting, but producing less and less coffee each time. It is almost at the point of being useless now - you have to grind 2 - 3 times just to get enough coffee for 6 cups of brew.Very disappointing!! This product should have a life measured in years rather than just months!! This is the first Cuisinart product that has disappointed me, but this one has really changed my opinion of the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I bought this thinking I would be able to regulate the size, (I have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr. still works), to say it is loud is an understatement, & 1st thing in the AM.

I have not contacted them at this point, but do not want a replacement, and a part of me is glad it broke, so I don't have to listen to the noise anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK while it lasted","review":"I bought this model elsewhere (Macy's) a little more than a year ago to replace a similarly priced Krups that never gave an acceptable grind. It was better while it lasted. On Christmas morning I ground some beans but when I went to empty the basket nothing was there! So I cleaned it up and checked to make sure nothing was jammed or interfering with the beans dropping to the mill. Nothing. Plugged it in again and tried and this time there was simply no power; wouldn't turn on at all even though that receptacle put power to other appliances and it didn't work in other receptacles either that had power (i.e., no tripped circuit breaker).So one more item for the landfill. I am fast coming to the conclusion that those manufacturers who0 are trading on a name and prior reputation but have shifted to mass marketing simply don't deserve to keep their former reputation. Cuisinart, Kitchen Aid, and Krups are several to which this comment aptly applies."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many features.....so little to like!","review":"Absolute waste of money!This unit has all the features you would want.......but it isn't worth buying!It is so noisy it scares my grandsons (me too)!On the same setting it would grind anywhere from a couple TBSP to a full bin.....no rhyme or reason!No matter what setting it was on, it created everything from talcum powder fine dust to coarse grounds and everything in between!The flakes and dust were all over the area in my kitchen where I used it after just 10-12 uses!Thankfully, I bought it at a place that has a liberal return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor is not durable","review":"At the third time I used this grinder, the motor smells after 3 minutes of operations.

This is *not* the sort of system you should use hold vital data that ammounts to months and months of hard work.For your sanity and your time, DO NOT buy this product.

The result is a tumultuous ride through an exotic land, ending not as you might think. The book is phenonmenal, if not just for the crafty prose, than for the mere fact that the author takes a huge risk: She gives us a main character whose actions we might not agree with, but makes us root for her regardless.

Although it would be wrong to expect 10-year old videos to match today's technical standards, it doesn't appear that this compilation was created from original source videos. If you're truly desperate to view some hip hop history, buy it--it does contain some good musical choices.

When I was feeling a particular way or they had trouble understanding what I was going through, I would get the book out and read the chapter to them that was applicable. I even took the book to my young widows/widowers support group to share it with them. This book is a \\"must-have\\" in the world of grief.

Most of the time thinking that her situation was so different from mine that I was wasting my time. Much of the book seemed to make me more despondent and I cried a lot. But I plodded on. Somewhere in that little book there had to be something that might help me. And, yes, there was. The section titled \\"On Preciousness (and Loving)\\" was very enlightening.

He just tells a story, and a damn good one at that.I don't want to give away the title and where it comes from, but I can sincerely say that this great story will give the reader a sense of the turmoil that was going on with Indian/white relations and perhaps give way to a new way of thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, well-done Western novel","review":"I enjoyed this novel immensely, reading it during a three-month stretch where I read nothing but westerns. This book is a lovely, well-drawn portrait of Plains Indian life, with a protagonist who is interesting, likable, and human.Beyond the insights the novel gives to American Indian culture and daily life, it does an excellent job with the elegy of a dying people. The Pikunis are at the edge of the end -- their way of life may be ending and they are powerless against the inexorable advance of the white man's future.Definitely recommended. A solid, thought-provoking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring, having to read this felt like punishment.","review":"I was forced to read this for a history class. I felt like I had done something wrong and was being punished. Everytime I picked it up was torture. I read the page numbers like a child in class watching the hand of a clock. A half page felt like a gift because it was done so quickly. It skips around and every small glimmer of interesting plot is swiftly disguarded. If you have any option at all to avoid reading this book please consider your self lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful look at Indian Life during the Great Expansion","review":"Fools Crow is a wonderful look into Indian life as the Great Expansion is taking place. One sees the mystical ways of the Indians; how their dreams depict them in the great picture. I am not fond of \\"Westerns\\" or books relaying our past; however, Fools Crow is fabulous. It made me wonder about the many sacrifices they made during the White Mans' plight for more land. This is a must read book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The instructions book was the best part.","review":"For wargamers that have the time and energy to spend on this game I suppose it would be ok. Personally I found it to be more frustrating than anything else. I was looking for something with a feel like Close Combat or Robert E. Lee: Civil War General; this game lacked appeal after I read the instruction booklet. The battle sequences absolutely sucked and they were the most boring battles since the boardgame RISK. Needless to say, my CD became skeet after a month of tinkering with the game. Final thoughts: A waste of money. Don't even bother to borrow this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A SINGLE!","review":"great song, i love this group, emphasis on the singular SONG! because it's a single!!!! nowhere did amazon indicate that this is a single, i'm furious, and i'm contacting them to complain. how obnoxious--no need to spend $10 on one bloody song."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a review of the song!","review":"Sei Parte Di Mei is a great song, very beautiful. Zero Assoluto has grown into quite a good band, and have really branched out their style (especially if you compare them to how they sounded a few years before this album). So don't get this wrong, this is a review of the product and I do not want this to reflect on the song itself, which I find to be very good and would definitely give it 5 out of 5.As Amazon finally has listed, this is a single album. As one of our colleagues already pointed out, this is VERY expensive for just one song, and you don't even have the option to buy a digital copy of it for 0.99 cents. The price should definitely be lowered on it.So, my advice is to try and find a digital copy of the song and purchase it that way, at least until the price is lowered. Save your money on this and try to get the whole album. Great song, but this album is a terrible deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sei Parte Di Me","review":"This CD is great!!! I purchased it for my husband who is Italian and loves Italian music as well. I am looking forward to puchase more CDs in Italian language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Literature","review":"I read this book many years ago whilst still in high school, as part of the literature syllabus. On the surface, this book seems to portray a story of a long standing rivaly between two tribes over a pond. But upon deeper inspection, this story infact gives us an insight into the political and social beliefs of a community of people. The great pond itself, was simply not just a watering hole, but it was the \\"be all\\" and \\"end all\\" of a way of life; it was to die for; and Elechi, through his exceptional ability to bring the story to life, allows the reader to decend into the very fabric of a war; never-ending and tragic. This is a beautiful, well-written story and political commentary, and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the way it really is !!","review":"If someone reads and enjoys this book that's fine. Just don't read it as being the way people in Mississippi really live and act. This is a description of how mythical people at the very bottom of the social ladder might be expected to behave if they all lived in the same small area, and not influenced at all by any collective morality or common sense. It's fiction / make believe. Taken as that, it's something to read. But it's not the way Mississippi is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbits are cute. This is not","review":"Larry Brown's south is the stereotypical Southern White Trash Redneck and his characters aren't the least bit likeable. The \\"hero\\" worries about his ability to satisfy his wife, but she's such a tramp the reader wonders why. The abuse victim acts out of character for someone who's been so severely violated, and that's just one of the flaws. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters!","review":"Larry Brown delivered an assortment of interesting characters pulled together by their self-destruction, desperation and curiousity. This is a very interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"I was expecting a lot more from a band that came up with such a creative name. Although, what I got was an album that sounded like a teen garage band. The vocals are WAY too loud and drown out the music The musicians do not sound good together. The CD sounds way too compressed with no clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I got this as a Christmas present for my wife. I guess that there are actually two people out there named Tony Danza. This was a hard rock album, and not a very good one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Majestic Choir and Organ","review":"Fine choice of choral music. I listen to this one again and again. Uplifting and enchanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I ordered this movie and it is a Chinese dubbed version of the Korean movie. Now that is great for someone who speaks Chinese, but if you are looking for the Korean version Amazon is defrauding you. For those of you who like foreign films, you need to urge Amazon to do the right thing and tell us what we are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"had a few very, very funny moments","review":"The movie overall is a bit slow, and lacks structure (and for this, I subtract one star). However, some of the moments in the movie are simply hilarious. I watched it in Korean without any subtitle, and am not sure how the humor would be found by non-Korean-speaking audience, but speaking for myself, I was gagging for breath at some scenes. I don't want to ruin the movie by giving you spoilers, but strongly recommend that everyone sees the movie at least once.The actor who plays the main character for this movie (Song Kang-ho) is a very fine actor; see \\"joint security area\\" to witness him at the peak of his powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, WOW & WOW","review":"I am constantly buying & never using cookbooks, but this one is incredible. It isnt exactly new, but the recipes are tried & true favorites & most of them are not complicated & they dont require a zillion ingredients. Cannot wait to get started. I own 2 other Southern Living cookbooks that I love & will add this to my list of \\"successes\\". There is something for everyone in this classic. 175 recipes & 60 photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Visual Aids","review":"The Complete French Learning Suite has numerous problems with it. The Vocabulary lists must be created by yourself by typing every word in, and there are glitches with the flashcard system. If you've had at least 2 years of high school French, you will find what the software offers to be too basic and simple. Not worth it if you're considering learning French beyond the few travel phrases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I am very dissapointed in this product. I am sorry I bought it. It only comes with two lessons on the main program. I had expected a lot more! Those two lessons were definitely not worth the money. If I had known that before I opened the package, I never would have bought the product. When I called customer support to ask why I did not have any more lessons, they said I would have to buy more software. Yeah right...not in this lifetime. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This product is only good for increasing your vocab. skills with the vocabulary master. The voice record won't work with Windows 98 even after calling and trying to download a program that was supposed to fix the problem. It did however help to increase my reading ability, but not speaking ability. The program is a bit boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good program","review":"It did not work well with my computer. In spite of doing a full install it was necessary to keep changing CD's. The video files would not automatically open and would not open from the CD. I had to find them on my hard drive, interrupting the lesson. It was very poorly designed and not well intergrated. I lost money on this one. It's in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windham Hill","review":"The sound tracks are pleasant and typical of Windham Hill; reason enough for purchasing. However, I have been profoundly disappointed with the DVD product. I was originally acquainted with the Laser Disc releases in the late 1980s and remembered them as visually stunning. However, the quality of video imagery on the DVD version is very poor resolution and not at all comparable to what is shown on the cover. Unfortunately there is better satisfaction from CD versions without distracting video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Film Put on DVD","review":"I remember this series on Laserdisk and at the time it was a nice background diversion. But times have changed and my equipment has improved. The video quality is very bad. The film grain is very evident and flaws in the film are clearly visible. It's the first DVD I've seen that looks like bad TV reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissue shows its age","review":"Ignoring for the moment the artistic merit of new age music -- you wouldn't be reading this review if you weren't predisposed to enjoy it -- this DVD shows the age of its release. Pioneer doesn't say whether this reissue was created from original materials or from captured LaserDisc frames; it shows all the wear and tear of a print at a second-run art house! Get used to black specks, white spots, and the occasional vertical bars from a color sync problem on the left side of the picture. Sound quality is acceptable. (You get your choice of PCM or Dolby Digital.) My advice: buy the excerpted CD's instead, and skip the DVD -- unless you just fell in love with some scene from your old LaserDisc copy. You are of an age that you bought the LaserDisc in 1984, right? Sure, I knew you did... Why else would you even be considering this DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Excellent, better than c.d. quality d.v.d that is crisp with beautiful imagry. Dissapointing length. If The Three Stooges can have 222 minutes on a d.v.d. why only 50 minutes here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer that noted the cheap clip on this skin. It is great while it lasts. Today at the gym by headphone cord got caught on my arm and the Stone got pulled on. Not very hard mind you, just snagged. The plastic clip broke at the hinges.

Luther and the boys pound through two discs worth of smokin' electric blues, with a song selection weighted toward his later releases (also Aligator). The only reason I took off one star is that there are other live blues CDs in this style that I like better. Try Son Seals' \\"Live & Burning\\". It's a little more \\"raw\\", and it mixes the tempo better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blues Album From Late Guitar Slinger Luther Allison","review":"Luther Allison died just as he was on the verge of gaining the recognition in America that he so greatly wanted and richly deserved.Live in Chicago features a broad range of guitar playing, from the straight-ahead blues playing on Soul Fixing Man and Cherry Red Wine, to great slide playing on Give Me Back My Wig, to plaintive singing and playing on Big City and You're Going To Make Me Cry.Luther Allison is more than another tragic story of great talent lost too soon. On Live In Chicago, he proves that he has achieved music immortality with the skill, heart, and talent of someone whose music will be celebrated forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't suck","review":"what can I say that the others haven't said already? This is the underestimated Allison at his very best. Luther was an amazing guitarist, whether on lead or slide. Versitile and rather original, Luther played and sung with as much feeling as any of the other chicago legends, combining the bottleneck prowess of Earl Hooker or Elmore James with the intensity of Otis Rush or Howlin' Wolf, the passion of Muddy Waters, the humor of Sonny Boy II, and (occasionally) the compositional skills of Willie Dixon. Throw in the personability of Jimmy Reed,BB King, or Charlie Musselwhite and you have one hell of a bluesman. Great band, too, especially when trading licks with James Solberg. His son, Bernard Allison, is one of a raft of 2nd generation giants of the blues. Luther's performance is naturally a bit different playing in a steamy barroom, as compared to entertaining a half-million folks in Grant Park, but he pulls off both with all the power the BLUES has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther is really missed","review":"After listening to this CD set I can understand why Luther is so missed. The live recording of Bad Love is the best. All the songs make you know why you love the Blues. James Solberg you sre right Luther is the Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind!","review":"Luther Allison is one of a kind! You can literally feel the passion Allison put into this perfomance. Solo's like the one in Cherry Red Wine are hard to come by. Allison melts the frets away during this solo. This live performance in Chicago is unique and certainly worth getting.

I thought it would be a great product since the Dirt Devil name is well known in the vaccum industry. There is a reason they don't make these anymore. The product is not easy to work with. Its like moving an 8\\" high rectangle back and forth. There is an ear-piercing whistle that comes out. The dirty water reservoir is not detachable and therefore hard to dry. I'm considering a more expensive and useful replacement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Bought this item and brought it home. Never could get the solution to spray out the front. \\"Primed\\" it over 100 times, nothing. Took it back and exchanged it thinking i must have picked a bad one. Nope, second one did it also. And the number on the side you are supposed to call for customer service. Forget it, they never answer. I held on for 45 minutes one time no answer. Sent an email trying to get customer service. Nothing. Buy the Green Machine, you will get about a year out of it until the solution tube clogs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most worthless appliance I ever bought.","review":"I purchased this item from a traditional vendor. It was absolutely worthless! It is literally so loud you have to wear hearing protection to use it or your ears ring for several minutes afterward. Most of the water it sucks up gets sprayed back out the exhaust vent and all over your clothes and the room you are using it in. I threw it out after a couple of times using it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great For 5 Years!","review":"My spot scrubber has the blue housing not the green one. I guess mine is an older model. I have to say my Dirt Devil gave it's all to the end. A couple of times I did have water spray out the exhaust vents but, after I mastered how to use this little machine. I thought it did a great job. The brush gives the impression of being a total joke but, it actually works. I have no complaints. The motor started getting really loud because it was starting to seize up. I replaced it with the Bissell Spot Lifter. I am not at all that impressed with it. I didn't buy the Dirt Devil again because of the appearance, it wasn't the same color as my old one and maybe it is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"By far the worst item I ever bought. It does not work one bit. Yes it's loud (most cleaning machines are though) but the water splashes everywhere and does not suck up water...well very little. Leaving your carpets and upholstery soaked and moldy...blah. I returned mine and went and bought a standard steam vac with attatchments. This standard steam vac blew this little dirt devil out of the water!!! Would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This product is horrible. I have been really needing a floor cleaner because my cat is gettin older and having some \\"accidents\\" and it was the worst. I bought it becasue it was only $40.00 and didnt think it would be that bad. I tried it out when I got home and the vacuum didn't suck anything up! Maybe a table spoon of water at most! I should have researched before I bought. I took it back the next day and exchanged it for a little green pro heat (which I love!). Its a bit more but well worth it. Save yourself and don't buy the dirt devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"Liked the size of this machine and thought it would be nice for spills and pet troubles...it doesn't do any better job than a can of carpet cleaner and a rag. It didn't scrub that great and didn't suck up the water it puts out. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had higher hopes for this machine....it doesn't hardly scrub or suction at all and is EXTREMELY loud! Louder than some of the tools my husband uses in the garage with ear protection. My full size Hoover upright carpet cleaner has replaced this since it has hand held attachments that are great for spots and furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cleaner EVER","review":"All the negatives (so loud it probably violates noise laws and certainly makes your ears ring, spews crap from the side vents, very difficult to open the tank, etc) from the other reviews all apply to this thing and are completely accurate.In addition, this thing doesn't clean spots worth a darn.If you really feel like buying this thing, do yourself a favor and just take a $50 bill from your wallet and hold a match to it. You will thank yourself later when you don't actually have to use this horrific device and you'll still be out the purchase price. I mean really, I can't find one positive thing to say about this thing.Too bad we bought it from Target or we would have known from the reviews on Amazon that it was so bad.. what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"sprays the water all over","review":"If you are contemplating on buying this thing: forget it. It sprays the dirty water all over through the exhaust vents if you end up moving it a little vigorously or tipping it in the slightest. At first I thought I was doing something wrong. Then I go online and read all these bad reviews with people having same problem. This thing is junk and it's very loud! If you have ear plugs and enjoy endlessly cleaning up a mess, this is the best thing for you then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"I borrowed this from my landlord and it is HORRIBLE. We have a green machine in storage that I have used for the past few years and it works well. This machine did not work at all (except for the spin brush thing). It sprayed water and cleaner all over from the side vents and did not suck up anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I got it at yard sale","review":"Bought it at a yard sale in NEW condition for 5 bucks...worthless piece of junk...Noticed many people rate the Dirt Devil low because of this and that problem..Here is a BIG problem..the tube that is used to vac up the liquid is so small that it will plug very easy and is made in a solid piece so trying to clean it is a nightmare and you really can't get everything out..even using a high pressure nozzle on a garden hose...even tried my air compressor at 150 PSI to blow it clean..Bottom line...even at 5 bucks it will end up at my next yard sale or in the trash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does clean well but has design flaws","review":"Along with joy, small children bring messes and spills to a household. While this does a reasonable decent job of spot carpet cleaning, it tends to spew the dirty water out of the sides of the tank (even when the tank is not full!). As the purpose of a spot cleaner is to remove the dirt from the carpet (or upholstery or whatever), the fact that this spews that dirty water right back out makes this a fairly useless appliance! Try another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as gross as the carpet stain...","review":"This little machine could be handy for small stains, but it's horrible if you want to clean up messes from dog urine which is what I bought it for. What makes it so icky is that even before the reservoir that holds the dirty water you've sucked from the carpet fills, it begins to spit that dirty water out the side of the machine. Yag! Right back on to you and your carpet... Almost as infuriating is how hard it is to detached the cap on the dirty water reservoir... Avoid this little demon, it's not a good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I paid alot for this unit for what it did. First I have to tell you that it only worked for one year. The motor burnt up! Also for anything more than about 1/4 cup of water (or whatever) the dirty solution is,it shoots out of the machine spraying a mist of whatever you just vacummed all over the rug and you! I will never buy anything made by dirt devil again. Oh, I did contact them after using it only once and they would not do a thing about it! Not happy! So now I'll find a better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I am not impressed. To spray the spot you have to push the button 30 times to get it wet (most cleaners let you hold the button down and release when wet enough) because you have to pump it to get water to come out. It is 10X noisier than my full size carpet cleaner. The suction is poor! I dont recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"Given the size of this thing, I certainly thought it would work better. The amount of solution/water that is needed is laughable! It felt like I was putting water in an iron, so that means if you have multiple spots, for each one you have to stop and refill the solution. Save your money and find a better product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm not the only one!","review":"I have used my Spot Scrubber multiple times and have never been impressed with it. I just finished using it again and thought , \\"enough, I'm going to write a review to prevent others from purchasing this piece of junk.\\" Well, it seems I'm not the only disappointed customer. The scrub brush doesn't do anything, and the suction on this thing is terrible! I have to go over a spot multiple times (a fresh spot not an old dried spot)before it looks any different. You might as well just use a rag and water, results will be the same and you will save money. I should have bought the \\"Little Green Machine\\" instead of this but the \\"Dirt Devil\\" name led me to believe this product would be as good as other \\"Dirt Devil\\" products I have owned. Steer clear of this product. Dirt Devil should issue an apology for even producing this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is HORRIBLE!!!","review":"I bought a Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber about 2 weeks ago to clean up my living room furniture. What a joke!! I think I could have bought a better second hand spot cleaner than this. Some people say it is better for small jobs, well it is useless in my opinion, for any job. I used it for the first time today and am terribly disappointed. I had to put a lot of pressure on it just so the brushes even touched the area I wanted to clean, even then I don't see where it did much cleaning at all. The worst part is I felt like I scrubbed and scrubbed and yet in the dirty water tank was hardly anything at all! maybe a tablespoon or two of dirty water. Do not waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Bissell instead","review":"I had a similar Bissell spot cleaner for several years and wore it out (I have pets and kids). I couldn't find that kind anymore and this was about the same size, price and design. It's TERRIBLE! Difficult to open the clean and dirty water tanks. I have to use a knife to pry open the rubber tab to dispose of the dirty water. The bristles began flatten out after the 4th use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy, worth the money.","review":"I have a big carpet steam, but I refuse to use it often--too much work and too heavy for me. My pets sometimes have accidents on the carpet, this handheld scrubber then becomes very handy -- just plug it in and turn it on, no sweat like using the big heavy one I have which also can NOT clean the corners around the house. For this price, it works great, I have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this product","review":"The vacuum didn't work so I have a wet upholstered chair that I hope won't end up streaked due to this product. Yes, I followed the instructions to the letter and then had my husband (a retired engineer) go over the instructions again and it was no use.

I recommend this product, and it also shipped very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful","review":"This book covers basic and slightly-more-advanced math, plus 600 SAT words (something the other reviews here didn't say).

It moves along at a crisp pace, with characters that are quite vivid and real.So often debut novels are over-hyped by publishers' marketing... it's nice to stumble upon a young east coast writer who delivers substance, style and wit. I devoured this book because it earned my interest in the characters' lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved London","review":"I was so sure that I'd love Laura Dave's most recent novel, The First Husband, that while just one day into reading it, I happened to stumble across this book, London is the Best City in America (a title which thoroughly, albeit momentarily, confused my son) on sale in my local library for .50. That was just too good a deal to pass up, and while I did not end up loving TFH, I still decided to give this one a go, and I'm so glad I did!Ms. Dave did such a wonderful job of capturing the complexities of relationships, that the word entanglements could almost be synonymous. She skillfully shows how we do hurtful things, not intentionally, but sometimes by default when we refuse to take a decisive action. Just like Emmy and Josh in the novel, I think for the most part people don't intend to be mean spirited, it just sort of happens that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely...","review":"This book is sweet and funny and a little bit heartbreaking.

Unfortunately, I didn't find it very likeable. It wasn't beautifully written, or funny, or deeply insightful (the book's message seems to be: you've got to make choices, and they must be realistic...what a surprise). I just wanted the twenty-somethings to grow up and stop being so self-absorbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it....","review":"I'm not quite sure what all the praise is about. I read \\"The Divorce Party\\" by Dave and loved it. This, I found highly disappointing. It starts with an unrealistic story line of breaking off your engagement to hide away in Rhode Island, where a young, pretty girl settles on working at a bate and tackle shop. Yes, she is supposed to be doing research for her documentary, but it's just not realistic. The relationship Emmy has with her brother is sort of sweet, but again, the story that unfolds is highly unbelievable. I have read some pretty cheesy chick lit books that at least I cared what happened in the end. This one, not so much. Just finished it really to see how bad it would end. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Boring","review":"This book was recommended because it was supposed to be \\"similar\\" in genre to Liane Moriarty's writing. I completely disagree! In Laura Dave's defense, I do think this book is aimed more toward a twenty-something, who may enjoy/relate more to the plot. I am a bit older, so it seemed like some silly boring drama. The brother/sister character relationship fell flat for me, I don't think there was enough support for either of them. I wanted more character development, more setting descriptions and just more background for ALL of it. I was really surprised at all the 5 star reviews. I have a hunch that they were written by friends, and may be a little skewed. I think the story could have been better, had there been more substance. I found myself not caring so much and just rolling my eyes. I had to slog through to the end, which was predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LINCOLN PORTRAIT - WOW!","review":"I totally agree with the other reviews about how superb this offering is of Copland's music.I simply want to focus on A LINCOLN PORTRAIT.

In addition to Mozu's touching tale, other aspects of this film are also very beautiful including the lovely scenes of ice, snow, thermal pools, and Mozu's babies.

Most poker books discuss how to play premium hands against large fields of players. This is a book about how to play sub premium hands in situations where isolation is possible; that is situations where the opponents are tight and unimaginative.The strategy involved is:1) Play cards that will do well against the opponent's likely hands (since the opponents are tight these are limited)2) Play in position so you end up heads up3) Make sure your little cards are seen by the opponents so that you get an \\"always plays junk / always bluffs\\" reputation and thus win big with your big hands that come in due to lose calling.4) Play defensively so that you are unlikely to be bluffed atThe book is certainly original enough to warrant picking up for $20.

She's gorgeous but has a reputation of being a wooden actress. She's getting better but La Brassiere is not her best role. The humor is typical for most modern Hong Kong films, bawdy, tasteless, broad and -- as one reviewer has already stated -- very similar to Benny Hill. It's just not done as well as Benny Hill did it. You can watch it to watch Gigi, there's much worse things to do than that. Karen Mok appears for a few minutes in a completely nonsensical role. That was a waste of her time. Hope she got paid well for it. Lau Ching Wan is always funny...except this time. Louis Koo is on hand for the ladies but you'll have more fun watching him in Why Me Sweetie.

There are many, many voices that we are not hearing.This was an insightful, lovingly written book that describes both universal and unique aspects of the experience of depression.

She writes so beautifully that I feel that she is mostly concerned with turning a phrase to showcase her skill as a writer. The 'dialogue' in the book seems stilted and planned. The characters seemed to fit to neatly into her narrative and real life is just not that way.

This one will have a long shelf life. It solves many of the puzzles about the family. Self appointed critics who imagine that this project was sponsored by the family obviously don't know the family because it is all told here, warts included, and it is fascinating to find it in one epic volumne. I see some partisans are out in force during an election year - knocking this book because it so clearly debunks some of the more bizarre conspiratorial theories and focuses on what really happened. But in the end accuracy rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish, sycophantic drivel","review":"What a waste of tree. Whether you like George Bush or you don't, this book tells you nothing. It's a perfect biography for an 8th grade book report.

But this tale of the Bush family is a flawed skimming of all the questions that ought to be explored. We get little in the way of serious personal portrait of family individuals and especially the two President Bushes. Instead a sugarcoated story that excuses all their bad behavior and poor decisions almost without exception is served up in a manner designed, but failing, to evoke admiration. It reminds one of those complimentary biographies that CEOs pay to have written. It further always assumes that the reader will agree with the Bushes political actions leading you to conclude that no serious scholarship was intended by this work. The only accurate description would be that it is shallow, like the Bushes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs fact checking....get me rewrite!","review":"Thin, amateurish, pure kiss-up.....but ready for easy condensation by Reader's Digest press....I tried to give it a chance, but gagged when it within the first few pages misstakenly placed Stevens Institute of Tech. of New Jersey on Long Island, in New York....The level of writing suggests Peter and Rochelle may need couplet counseling."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sources for information on gambling scams","review":"Gambling Scams is really an encyclopedic description of gambling scams, from con men to cheating at dice games and card cheating in private games. The author's repute, experience and skills in card and dice manipulation are unquestioned. Darwin Ortiz is truly providing worthwile information to protect oneself from gambling scams from the \\"inside\\". Thus, the correctness of his publication is undoubted. I highly recommend this publication to anyone wishing to protect themselves from dishonest gamers or those with a particular interest in gambling scams in general. If you're thinking of buying the book to learn card manipulation then perhaps you should look elsewhere for more descriptive explanations of particular \\"moves\\", such as \\"The Expert at the Card Table,\\" by S.W.

This is a very thorough introduction for those not familiar with the charter school model or why it came to be. The writing is clear and succinct.

When the parents of four sexually precocious children die in quick succession - the mother's corpse being entombed in a concrete block in the basement in order to stop the family being splintered by the authorities - the children must learn to cope on their own. In lesser hands this could have been worked up into a straightforward monster-in-the-basement-style thriller, but with McEwan at the helm it more interestingly becomes a study in grief, repression, adolescence, and the dissolution of the family in late twentieth-century Britain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable","review":"Although I'm a big fan of Ian's, I found this book to be predictable. I enjoyed the character development of the main character. This is something that Ian's has developed since in his writing. The story line, however, was totally expected and I was disappointed in it. Although I did expect the ending, the final pages, when the authorities showed up left chills down my spine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it but too predictable","review":"The attention to detail was great.

The cinematography is wonderful, and the story is deeply disturbing. I read the book and found that I didn't get as much out of it as I did the movie. I think the movie shows us how four kids set to making a family to replace the one that fell apart in a very short period of time. The tone of the book did not shed this kind of light on the story. The book seemed to be more about the boy and his world, which is more lecherous, seedy, and selfish. The movie shows us how the oldest girl is trying to keep things together and at the same time trying to enjoy her young adulthood (the sunbathing and the boyfriend with the fancy sportscar). I did not get as much insight from the book, although I think it's important to read it as well as watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressed","review":"I agree with the reviewer that called this book \\"juvenile and tasteless\\". It is a poor man's Lord of the Flies, for sure. It seemed like nothing more than a sick indulgence on the author's part.

I guess we all have to start somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWWW!!!!!!","review":"I can't even begin to put this book into a category...I will say that this is in no way a pleasurable read. I didn't find it haunting or even bothersome; annoying and tasteless is more of an apt description. It was predictable and plodding as well.

So, inevitably, this, known unsurprisingly as FATAL RENDEZVOUS in its US edition from Heavy Metal--a remarkably clumsy story about a woman being anally raped, on a daily basis. This isn't really a spoiler, it's frankly the selling point, as well as very nearly the starting point. Manara's bootless nihilism comes into play, but, well, it IS well-drawn, no two ways about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"A must read for all -- the book takes you through the chronicles of an unforgiving disability and they way one person perserveres.

I would have love to learn more about the other family members such as his sisters who while not vision impared still paid a price.

The pacing that he is noted for just wasn't there; there was none of the tension or excitement which always kept me on edge while watching his earlier movies.It also seemed that there was too much dialogue. Most of Rollin's films feature action and suspense with sparse talking. Even the sex and nudity, which is usually awesome, was no big deal. And, I wish we could have seen more of Celine Mauge, the cute, but daffy nun, who always had the yellow ball and paddle with here.I'd recommend Requiem for a Vampire, Living Dead Girl, Lips of Blood, Fascination, and even Killing Car if you want to see Rollin in his prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jean Rollin misses the mark","review":"Rollin is as confused as ever, only his earlier stuff is saved by stunning if quirky visuals.If you know Rollin, then you'll know that this film is unlikely to make sense.

You can hear this song ten times from various performances he has done and hear a different version each time. The version on this LIVE ONE album (Disc 2 cut 6) is BY ITSELF worth the price of this double CD live album. As always, Tommy nails every single note on every single song. There he is live on stage with ZERO flaws, no matter how insanely fast he plays.

It was primarily the originality of one of the female leads that makes this novel so very different! (I don't want to spoil it for you). If you like your female characters strong and independant, then you will definitely like this book. I have to say that I was strongly drawn into the stories of a few of the characters, but I did at times feel very irritated with the male leads (although that could have been the author's intention).

This is good history and it makes for great reading. What is really great about this book is that it captures the feel of a long forgotten time and brings to life events like the dramatic capture of Fort Niagara and the valiant struggle of the eastern woodland Indians to preserve their race in the face of two warring white factions.

This is the PSX version with better sound. Acclaim lost it's WWF license on Nov 15th and had to get this game out by then to score the $$$. It shows.

When I popped this into my DC, my only reaction was \\"Dammit, this sucks!\\" Before I even get into the graphics (yuck), let me first state that the roster of wrestlers is only accurate as of November 1998. Absent are Y2J, Dudleys, Big Show, Rikishi, and Tazz; present are Goldust and Dr. Death - Enough said. To explain the graphics is a tough one - just picture the PlayStation version with anti-aliased effects and rope texture. Other changes are limited to slightly better sound and a marginally enhanced resolution setting. The control and collison detection are also still terrible. I see no reason anyone would want to pick up this game, as it's a rushed port with an outdated roster and graphics that didn't even do the PSX justice. Even if you're a DC owner in need of a WWF game, don't get it - wait for THQ's forthcoming WWF offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game gives the WWF a bad name","review":"Horrible game. The roster is so old it looks like a WCW game. The gameplay is impossible, all you do is stand there kicking and punching. The only thing I liked was the intro when they do the entire Raw Is War theme song; But I can watch that on Monday night. Don't even waste your money with this game.

Graphics are NOT up to Dreamcasts 128bit standards.This could have been a great game. It should have been completely reworked for the Dreamcast to better use the speed and graphics capabilities.

The protagonist is a troubled high school senior boy who is struggling with the loss of two people very close to him. I'm not saying more to avoid spoilers. This is one of those books where information is given just bits and pieces at a time and I don't want to give stuff away.In the book, the voice of the protagonist is uniquely done. There is LOTS of internal dialog. This might turn off some in the book's inteneded audience (YA I believe), but others will find it refreshing. As an adult, I thought it clever.As for content, I don't remember any swearing (at least nothing that made me cringe). There is one very short make out scene that younger teens might wince at. Or, I should say, that parents of younger teens might wince at.

Perhaps some would be entertained by the thought that it's psychologically damaging to call your spayed cat an \\"it\\", that cats relax best to New Age music, and to consider a second cat the first one's pet. However, some of the medical advice is scary, like suggesting you drug your cat with Valium, or even giving her chamomile (cats can be allergic to that, too).I would hope a new cat owner would look elsewhere for advice, especially introducing a new cat to your other cats. The SPCA as well as others will give free advice, and your own vet, preferably one who treats cats only, should know enough about behavior and modern medical techniques to answer any questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this book because I expected more substance on how to cure cat behavioral problems. Most of what was presented in the book was common sense. The book also doesn't offer any in-depth case histories and therapy plans for cats with particular problems.I feel this book would be useful for someone who knows little about cats. However, if you are familar with cats and their basic needs, this book doesn't offer much more insight than most people would know.

I refer to it when I have basic animal care questions as well as major animal behavioral concerns.Carole's guidance was very helpful when I brought a new kitten into my home. Tending to the older cat and letting him bond with the kitten is very valuable information and leads to a more adjusted animal pairing.I have a very anxious cat who was resistant to any treatment from a few vets or previous animal behaviorist.

When I read the information inside the box on how to take these pills I realized that Green Tea Diet Pills were a joke. The info said to take the pills three times a day (hard to remember right before my meal), eat a 1500 calorie diet and exercise for 45 minutes/6 days a week. Based on the information, I was wondering why take the pills? Anyone can lose weight on 1500 calories a day without exercise!I did not lose any weight on the Shiff Green Tea pills.

But the book covers a lot of grounds about what is a bond , how to calculate yield , what is yield to maturity, what are mortgage backed bonds etc but no specific strategy. Also this book has to be updated with the cost information. For example the book advises against buying Treasury bonds in secondary markets because costs are high. They were high but many brokerages like ETRADE now do not charge a commission for buying TReasury bonds in secondary market.I was dissappointed.

Don't even get me started on Pigman! Or I Am the Cheese!

This is an intense story, where the characters are far from perfect but very human. I thought that the relationship between Meg and her husband was shocking sometimes, but awfully true. Heidi Boehringer does a good job at not being patronising or leading us to judge her characters, even when they're pushed to the edge. In this story you'll be taken on a ride through what remains of Meg's life, her guilt, fears, attempts at reconstructing her life. It's a really good story and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected.","review":"Given that this is the author's first novel and the only review I could find was by her former mentor, I was very surprised and delighted to find this was a real page turner.

I have lower back problems from artritis. I was desperate for relief from the pain. I bought this support and within days of wearing it, the pain began to go bye bye! I am a small woman, and tried several back braces I purchased at the drug store. They were all too big and offered little support because there was no way to accomodate for my waist. In other words, no way to snug the brace to a firm fit around my waist, thus to support my lower back. This brace can be adjusted to a firm fit that supports the lower back.

The book and the cards really go together, and you will be missing important points if you don't have them both. I found that some of the cards had instructions, some didn't. Some of the cards had the purpose, some didn't. None of the cards that I could see had contraindications (and there are some).

Salamon failed to do complete research and ended up painting a one-sided picture, omitting so many facts and so much information that it is impossible to glean any real understanding of the people involved in this story. What I find even worse, though, is that this book is marketed to families of medically involved children thanks to its handy premise that the stress of raising such a child can cause an otherwise good man to snap, with tragic results. What an exploitative way to make a few bucks (and, hopefully, just a few)! Nobody---least of all the author---seems to know what was wrong with Bob Rowe. Was he schizophrenic? Bi-polar? A sociopath? Whatever his malady, I am quite sure it was not the stress of raising a disabled son that propelled him into homicidal mania. Yikes. Shame on Salamon, and the New York Times Book Review, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Half Excellent...Second Half Tedious","review":"Let me say I adore Julie Salamon's writing. The Devil's Candy was an awesome book.And I adored the first half of this book which was engagingly written and exhaustively researched. The stories of the women in the group and their children were touching.But something happens after the deaths of the Rowe family. The book becomes a compendium of Robert Rowe's attempts to become a lawyer again...and the whole Colleen section was just maddening. She comes off as completely unlikeable and we're never quite clear what she sees in this man who took out his whole family.This book is a mess...and not worth recommending at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the book, didn't like that this guy got away with murder","review":"The book, \\"Facing the Wind\\", is the true story of Robert Rowe who, in 1977, murdered his wife and 3 children. The story itself is interesting: Rowe is a lawyer who had a lot of issues with his mom (who doesn't? - my kids do too), had a handicapped son, then lost his job. The most interesting part was he was able to convince himself and his doctors that the murders weren't his fault - that he was mentally ill at the time. So he did get off after a short stint in a mental hospital, went on to marry a younger woman and have another child. So I guess I didn't like the book because the man got away with murder. But that is not the author's fault. She wrote an interesting book. I would never read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Paying for the Hard Back","review":"I borrowed this book from the library because I didn't want to pay the hard-back price for a book I might not like. This is such an excellent book, I know now that I wouldn't have minded paying for it. I highly recommend it. And, believe me, I'm very hard to please. That's why I usually get books from the library.I'm sorry the author hasn't written other books like this one. After I read it, I got another nonfiction book she's written, and it bored me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't they ask the surviving Rowes????","review":"I was horrified to hear this true story book was taken without taken the facts from the Rowe family who had to witness and bear this tradegy. This book should have a disclaimer stating this is an interpretation of the author and not a credible historical account. Authors should not needlessly display a family's personal life without consulting them for facts. That is very irresponsible to the feelings of the surviving Rowe Family who have to relive the dug up remains of their past. This book reeks of one sided journalism and lost its luster in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I felt little knowledge and insight into the killer's mind. Many people have medically involved children and do not commit such horrific acts. The bludgeoning of his family had to some from a source of fierce anger and the cause of that wasn't explained at all . His attitude towards the crime was totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"facing the wind","review":"Insulting.

One would be dead wrong. I've been had! What an unforgivable mess was made of an essentially provocative and dramatic human tragedy - Facing the Wind was so poorly written and excecuted that I couldn't even bring myself to care for the victims. That is the real tragedy. I think the reading public has been had by insider nepotism. As a writer for the Times, Julie Salamon enjoyed more than her fair share of exposure. This book and their susquent review does not bode well at all for my future readership or their claims of independent and fair criticism. If Facing the Wind served any purpose at all, it is to expose to ridicule the practices of favoritism that litter the literary scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i got into the 7th chapter of this book and i did'nt find it the least bit interesting what so ever.so i put it down,maybe it would have gotten better but as far as i got i was board out of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Drivel","review":"I waited a year before I could voice my opinion on this book.

Colleens past (obviously messed up)? His manipulative behavior which was obviously the one constant in his miserable life?).

All you are missing is an audience whooping and yelling throughout the story, which is well written overwise. It introduces a vulgarly horrific tale and then attempts to soften the image of the protagonist. I guess a Nightmare on Elm Street can have a meaningful and spritually uplifting twist to it too, if written correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the Wind","review":"This book especially touched me. I have been a wife/mother in a similar support group and was also seen as a shining example of \\"handling it\\" so well when, in fact, my husband wasn't coping well at all and the outside world only saw the thin veneer he chose to show them. Eventually I left that husband and focused on keeping my children hopeful and stable. This book brought back so many feelings and made me revisit the \\"secret\\" lives of those who live with the tragedies of their childrens problems. This is a true account of what goes on inside the homes of too many families facing the unending grief of making their child's life worth living while trying to cope with the torments of inner and outer life day-to-day.

If you like travel journals and interviews with selected artists, this has some value, but Farr's reluctance or disinterest in fully contextualizing the artists being interviewed is puzzling.

Read by some vapid, arch young woman who doesn't get sarcasm or irony. In that marvelous scene early on in which M'Turk sees the keeper poaching a vixen in cubbing season, goes all feudal and Irish, and confronts the landowner, the silly besom reads it as if it's Eeyore confronting Piglet. That scene was funny to me when I was 7 and I didn't even understand most of it. And she's American. I am actually going to trash the tape to the publisher. Regardless of non PC stuff, I love Kipling, especially Stalky, Kim, and Puck. Every summer holidays since I was quite young, I began ceremoniously by reading Stalky , Kim, and The Sword in the Stone.

Pathetic.You can't really blame the director or actors because they can only work with what was written in the first place.

After watching it for myself, I can tell you that the 1 star reviews are by far the most accurate. The action scenes are horribly choreographed. The dialogue in the script was stolen form other better movies and re-assembled by a hack. The acting was wooden. The actor playing Wallace, who has played this role multiple times in other films, was the only actor who held up his end. Mickey Rourke is terrible and un-watchable.It is really not worth watching.

Horror and darkfantasy stories have always been of keen interest tome, ever since reading \\"The Shining\\" by Stephen King.They are the kind of books that I just can't seem toput down. And, \\"Trysts\\" is no exception.The thirteen stories in this collection take thereader from a session with a ouija board to the dark,back alleys of New Orleans, from the grotesqueries ofan artists' studio to a \\"Fallen Area\\" where nothing iswhat it seems anymore. Each story has greatcharacters and is visually appealing and imaginative.(Just thinking about the statues in \\"Cries Beneath thePlaster\\" makes me shiver.) Some horror/dark fantasyhas a tendency to get stale, with the same types ofcharacters being overused, but Berman's have just theright amount of uniqueness to make them stand out.A must-read for any fan of horror/dark fantasy and agreat addition to gay fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful","review":"With tales ranging from the magical to the eerie to the macabre, Trysts always keeps you guessing and always keeps you interested. The characters along with their feelings and dilemmas just seem so real that you can't help but to empathize with them. Keeping true to realism and avoiding the classic \\"happy endings\\", Trysts will never leave you successfully predicting a story's ending half way through the pages. Each story is a beautiful work on it's own, but when all thirteen are taken together it makes for one of the best literary works I've ever read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Bedside Companion","review":"Berman's Trysts is an excellent effort. After picking up the book, I had a hard time putting it down. Though some of the stories are brief, you get a clear sense of the environments and of who the characters are - something often hard to do in a short story. The characters offer a dark sexuality that appeals to this reader.Trysts compairs favorably to the Bending The Landscape series, and like Bending the Landscape was nominated for 2 Spectrum Awards. Trysts should have a home on your book self, if not your bedside table."},{"rating":"2","title":"scury stuff","review":"You want a fantastical journey into lust and the possibility of romance?

Each story is filled with passion and compelling characters, and yet the book is so tiny! Only a truly gifted writer could achieve what Steve Berman has done in this book.

This is an interesting CD due to Rezor's genius with electronic, thrash, music, but the half-hearted lyrical tones are covered by noisy music that doesn't match the crispness of KK and Glen of J.Priest. How can Halford actually like what he is doing? It's pretty funny that this album has a single already released called DEEP IN THE GROUND that will make Halford more money than he's seen in 10 years.JUST A THOUGHT: I think Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson, and Geoff Tate should get together and do a \\"Three Tenors\\" of Heavy Metal.

This effort is not worthy of Halford. In fact, why not do an Industrial album...great idea, but does that mean you leave the trade-mark vocal genius behind? If it was classic Halford singing with range and dynamics over Industrial textures, that might have been cool and innovative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beers, Steers and...","review":"Anyone who didn't know Halford was gay even when he was still with Priest needs to get glasses. You can only wear so much leather and police paraphernalia and not be gay. Never a fan but respect the guy for finally being himself.That said, this album is terrible. The lyrics are amateur and juvenile to the point of embarrassment even though he's got Reznor(NIN!) and Ogilvie(Skinny Puppy!) helping him crank out riffs that would make Korn blush.

There is a bibliography at the end of this book, but no footnotes or backup for any specific claims of the narrative.

But, after I'd purchased the Ultimate Flint Collection and finally watched In Like Flint, I understood perfectly well. The movie is terrible. It's boring, corny, nonsensical and amateurish.

I'm wondering, what happened? Eric used to be such an engaging storyteller. I loved his earlier work. \\"Chasing Destiny\\" was one of the worst works of fiction that I have ever read. Ever. All of the characters are either weak, mentally unstable, morally corrupt, or just plain crazy. The heroine of the book is trifling, rude, uncouth. I had to literally force myself to continue reading until I finished the book....that's how bad it was. The story was all over the place and so unbelievable. Again I ask......what happened? Eric went from a Zora Neal Hurston type of literary writer (who was a SUPERB storyteller) to a Harlequin Romance type of writer.Yes, the book is REALLY that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric does it again.","review":"Eric continues to evolve as a writer.

I will admit, I did laugh out loud at some of the dialogue at the beginning, but as I read further, laughter turned into frowns and I just wanted to finish this.

It was to jumpy and the plot of the story wasn't really all that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"It is a page turner. I was worried about reading this book because IMO \\"Genevieve\\" was a terrible book with a good ending and was hoping that this was not going to be the same. To my luck it wasn't. This book was chock full of events. The title of the book was a play on words. It could be looked at literally as Keith chasing his daughter or the actual phrase \\"Chasing Destiny\\". It had a valuable lesson to it and I was very happy with the choice that Billy made at the end and was not burdened down with Keith and his problems.It was interesting seeing EJD write for a 15yr old girl. At times she seemed to be an 8yr old. EJD needs to leave the teenage lingo for the teenagers. I know that 15yr olds are young but he made her seem like a baby when she had conversations with her Dad. Overall, I was very impressed with the book. The span of the book was over a couple of days which I thought would annoy me but it didn't. I would definitely recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"EJD is out of his slump!!!!","review":"I tell you, I was a little hesitant to purchase this book.

Looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!!","review":"I can't quite understand why there are so many negative reviews on this book from \\"so-called EJD fans\\". Part of being a fan of someone's writing is allowing them to evolve as a writer and following them faithfully down the paths they choose to travel. I enjoyed this book tremendously. The characters were dramatic, well-developed and very real. I particularly liked the way the characters' lives all intertwined...it is a small world. The ending was classic and not typical. I hope this is not the last we read of Destiny, Billie, and Carmen.

A true page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner!","review":"I have to say that Eric Jerome Dickey has done it again. Just when I thought that he couldn't top his last book, he does. Chasing Destiiny brings us back to Cali, with the tale of a group people who lives are connected, by the actions of some. As soon as you start reading, you get sucked in to the intrigue. Eric has this way of adding bits and pieces of former books to his new book. We one of the main characters mention the billboard that's asking for information on the murderer of Lisa Wolf, you instantly get a flashback to Drive me Crazy. I absolutely loved this book. I would encourage any reader who is a lover of EJD's book to pick this one up.

It is brilliant, actually, and as others have written, once I got caught up in the story, I literally could not put the book down.Mr. Dickey continues to perfect his craft and each book shows new facets of his development as a writer. I appreciate that this book has been \\"on the shelf\\" for years, and has been a work in progress. The writing is tight and expressive, and he is able to capture the essence of each generation. It's just plain good!I look forward to the next installment.

Then there were parts when things would happen that were so unrealistic it was a shame. Lastly the little girl Destiny go ton my LAST NERVE to say the least.

The suspense and the way that all of the characters lives overlapped and intertwined kept wrapped up in the story for hours.I must admit that I haven't read one of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels in years.

You can write your own HTML if you are so inclined in the HTML editor, and you can modify pages directly online (although MS advises not to). FP2000 does have a bug though, it will delete information in the shared borders if you attempt to use the \\"Find\\" feature - definitely a new bug not found in FP98. The FP extensions are great - just make sure your ISP has them installed properly, otherwise forms, counters and searches, etc. won't work properly.We maintain a 453 page e-commerce site that is well over 30 MB, and for a small employee base (4), it doesn't take us long to modify our site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the 40 dollar rebate !!!","review":"When a company offers a \\"rebate\\" for buying their product, they should mean just that...REBATE....no strings attached (except proof of purchase, of course).Some marketing genius at Microsoft has devised a way not to pay the rebate unless you have documentation and bar codes from other MS products books & boxes from years ago.

I have made a few great sites with it. My friend even designed a site for me and with my Frontpage program I was able to edit with Microsoft Frontpage to keep updating the site.

He makes her a fabulous cook, but when cooking her feelings goes into the food.

This sounds like a great idea for a movie (try \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\") but this is not a great movie. Were it not for the slightly adult themes, this could be a Children's Special.

There is one scene almost IDENTICAL (a tear in the food causes everyone to cry). I thought about whether it was a homage or a rip-off, and decided it was a rip-off. That movie used magic realism; this one simply uses magic. And not that the magic makes any sense. Where'd it come from? Who knows? There's this cute wittle crab that serves no purpose. The romance is contrived and rather unoriginal. It doesn't offer too much in the way of entertainment. At least by the end of the movie, I had stopped seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar solely as Buffy (she is very Buffylike in the beginning). There is also a very sweet camera shot involving lots of mirrors that is the best shot in the entire movie. Overall, a mediocre movie that doesn't ever rise above...anything.

Ms. Gellar shows us all that you CAN be the sweet and well mannered girl next door and still be very much attractive(and down right sexy). It was also refreshing to see real emotions, like nervousness and uncertenty, when her character was faced with some pretty overwhelming situations. Nobody is totally self assured and in charge of their emotions all the time. I was nice to see something real for a change.

She's a talented actress who surpasses the limitations of her role in this film. But the movie isn't about her--it's about Gellar, Flannery, and the magic of a crab (a _crab_? what were the writers thinking?). If that crab was powerful enough to make Gellar's character a better cook, why couldn't it make Gellar herself a better actress, or Mark Tarlov a better director?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Park your body and put your brain in neutral.....","review":"My husband and I were on vacation. We were tired and hungry from a mall outing, and decided to go where it was cool, and rest and snack on popcorn. WELL, that was the only reason that we stuck it out in this movie. Dumb and corny; the jokes weren't even funny. In fact, while the credits at the beginning were still coming on, we knew we were in trouble. But what the hay, we got to rest for an hour. I wouldn't waste my time on watching it again at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine movie","review":"I rented this movie recently and I thought it was enjoyable.

I am so glad it never became popular and flopped because it deserved to. After I saw it on HBO, all I could think about was \\"What the hell was that?\\" I have liked some bad movies before and I usually don't hate a movie, but this is truely aweful. Only see it if you are a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, even then I think you should skip it for fear of hating her for making such a terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed so hard.....at how bad it was!","review":"Sorry to those who liked it,but I (a TOTAL romantic comedy lover) thought this was the STUPIDEST plot for a movie. A movie about a magical crab???? Was this serious? I honestly could not get passed the crab to even attempt to take the rest of the movie seriously. The actors were good, as they usually are in their roles, but this crab just made it laughable. I am actually shocked at how many people liked it. Not being sarcastic, just really surprised. My sister and I rented it and were just belly laughing through the whole thing about the crab. We still joke about it as the worst movie we have ever seen. She's a total independent and foreign film junkie. I am a romantic comedy/ big american production type fan. Both of us agreed on this. It was just a really bad premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply another picture","review":"It's okay, but I wouldn't see it twice.

It had ideas and jokes intended to make an elementary schooler laugh. (some things are said in this movie thought that are not at all appropriate for a person of that age) The acting was not great, and the mood was what you would call weird. It was not funny or entertaining but it had a one or two okay parts. I would not recommend this movie if you like movies with an intense plot, edge -of-your-seet drama or good acting. Watch this movie ONLY if you have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't watch this!","review":"even if you like farie tales, this may test your threshold for pain; a horrible fantasy that rips off \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" and feels like a lead weight after ingestion; very cloying and devoid of much-needed whimsy, it's like watching a clown trying to dance with cement shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone please kill me.","review":"That's exactly what my friends and I were saying while viewing this movie, trapped inside the movie theater. Gellar finds a magical crab who makes her able to cook. Then a guy loves the food.

Amanda cannot cook to save her life, but with the help of a fairy godmother-type, she is able to serve delectable dishes, winning over the hearts of the public as well as a handsome restauranteur played by Sean Patrick Flannery.

So, we've been trying the Celtic Sea Salt out for the past few months.Celtic Sea Salt has kind of a sticky texture, so it doesn't come out of a shaker as naturally as Real Salt (or other salts).To me, I think it has kind of a bland flavor.

Thank you, Peter O'Donnell, for Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin (my thanks are late but heartfelt, nonetheless). My life is much the richer for your work.This film, however, is a travesty. Modesty Blaise could have been, should have been, bigger and better than James Bond.Originally, I felt that the folks that made this film should be [fired]. However, I have entertained a more appropriate condemnation:They should be required to view their abomination repetitively ad infinatum."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad film in a disappointing genera: really no stars","review":"It's too bad that spoofs of the James Bond films tend to be so very bad. Both print and television have done quite well making hip fun of Bond and his imitators, but movies made with the same idea consistantly come up short. Some of them are a lot of fun, even if they don't hold together. Some are completely unwatchable. Modesty Blaise comes somewhere in the middle. It isn't actually revolting, but it's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.Fans of the Modesty Blaise comic strip and novels should avoid this film like the plague. This isn't Modesty, or Willie, any more than the Matt Helm films are adaptations of the Matt Helm books. People unfamilliar with the other Modesty material may find this film mildly enjoyable, but would be better off with the Flint movies, which come as close as anything ever done to making a success of this idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did it inspire Austin P?","review":"I first saw this movie during its original release. All these years later, my memories were positive enough for me to buy it. Oh dear! Memories have a habit of being selective. Even though its a satire and by no means to be taken seriously, its so high camp that it just loses you. It doesn't really entertain at any level. The only positive was the thought that maybe it had sown the seed for the far more enjoyable and also-camp-but-not-so-pre-occupied-with-itself Austin Powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new standard of awfulness","review":"I bought this DVD knowing it was bad, but I was interested in the psychedelic aspects of it. I thought maybe it would have a campy \\"Batman\\" feel to it, being made in the same great year of '66. I was not prepared for how terrible it really is. It's so abysmal that I couldn't finish it. The acting is nauseatingly bad, the script is pathetic, and the actor's voices appear to have been dubbed (badly). I found no kitsch or camp value in it whatsoever - it's just plain awful. In fact, the back cover of the DVD pretty much admits that: the only positive thing they can say is that the movie has \\"psychedelic wallpaper\\". Yes, it sure does, some very groovy designs indeed, but I need more than wallpaper in a movie to keep me interested. This is one of the worst movies I ever tried to watch. It was put on DVD purely because of the then-current Austin Powers/60's fad. Although I love the sixties, I think all copies of this movie should be burned, and the DVDs made into coasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is truly awful - both in and of itself and especially in comparison with the assured and sophisticated novels. Modesty Blaze is here played as a silly vain woman, not as a world-wise leader of men, her side-kick looks too weak to lift his own luggage and their government contact is a twit. It's intended to be hip, 60's pop-adelic 'like wow man' but it is simply a reminder of how self-indulgent and lame most of that was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modesty Bad!","review":"About a long while ago I saw on my digital cable that \\"Modesty Blaise\\" was going to be on the Fox Movie Channel so I taped it since that I was going to see another movie. When I watched the film later on, I couldn't believe how bad it was. For those that are thinking about buying this movie on DVD, DON'T! It is as of now the worst 60's movie that I have ever seen and there are enough holes to fill swiss cheese. The thing that really kills me is that Monica Vitti (an Italian actress who-hello!-is playing a British spy) changes her hair from black to blond and back again; as if we have two Modesty Blaises. Also of note I couldn't see most of the opening credits as it surrounded by a pop title song! (that seems to be modeled later by \\"Barbarella\\" which was based on a comic book like this one) The movie may be 119 minutes long but it drags on and on. In conclusion, this is one that you shouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 DVDs in 1 package-low price!","review":"What a great product: 2 regular-length Wiggles' DVDs in one package for a lower price than 2 DVDs on their own.

The switch would click but the white light LEDs would either not turn at all or would light at a fraction of their full brightness after knocking the light against the base of my palm a few times (and some times that wouldn't even work). I switched out the batteries three times with different rechargeables and alkalines and it was the same problem. I had not abused or dropped the light beforehand--this was produced just by playing around in my dark apartment. I'll be sticking with other brands (such as Streamlight and Fenix) in the future. Not only have my flashlights from these brands proved dependable but they also produce better light, have better battery life and light output for the same number of batteries (or even fewer batteries). To make matters worse the Smith and Wesson was also more bulky than these lights. For me this light was a real loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice flashlight for pilots.","review":"This is a very useful flashlight for a pilot. It has separate on/off buttons for white and red LEDs.

But it is great for close work in a small area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pilots","review":"I needed a new flashlight for my flight bag. I wanted something small and had white and red light for night flying. The white light is almost as bright as my Maglite. The red light is perfect for viewing charts at night while flying.

I taught it cool to have the pouch for the extra batteries. The switches are in the right place for one hand operations. The red light feels adequate. The biggest let down with this light is the LED white light. It is white alright but not bright. I read somewhere it is only 20 Lumen, that is not bright for a high priced LED flash light. There is another comparable LED flashlight Coleman Cree XLamp XR-E LED Multi-Color Flashlight, 3 \\"AAA\\" that comes stocked with 115 Lumens for cheaper and also has an extra green light for map reading. so you get more for less price.

Like the other multi-LED lights of its era (yes, this design is ancient at this point) the Galaxy is too bulky to carry in your front pocket, hence the included belt pouch. The array of white LED's emits a nice flood pattern that is as good, or better, than an old-fashioned 2-D light with a krypton bulb and a good reflector, so it's not a powerhouse like newer LED flashlights, but fine for general use. Build quality is great; the end cap screws on smoothy and was oiled at the factory. I would have no problem taking this light out in a downpour for several hours or dropping it in a puddle. The only real drawback this design has is the lack of a lanyard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent light for night flying","review":"Purchased this flashlight for night flying and it has been very useful. Sturdy design. LED's provide plenty of light with low battery consumption. Separate switches for white and red light makes sure you do not accidently destroy your night vision.I took one star away because you could accidently press the buttons while stowing the flashlight away.

After saying that I have to point out that the size and weight are ridiculously big for a flashlight powered by 3 AAA batteries. The diameter of flashlight's body looks like you could fit a D cell in there or at least couple of AA's.... AAA batteries for something this big is just a wrong choice. Position of switches on a side of lamp is really convenient if you want to play with them, once you have the lamp in your hand. Otherwise, their position is a poor choice, and they can easily be accidentally turned on while lamp is in it's carrying pouch or in a bag.Overall: It has some nice features but it just seems like it was designedby a person who never ever used and had to carry a flashlight outside of his home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flashlight.

The S&W LED exceeded my hopes. Separate switches insure that white light will not accidentally be triggered when only red light is desired to preserve night vision. Chart reading is still possible (yes, some boaters still use charts in addition to GPS!), consulting notes, managing cockpit activities are all possible because of the brilliance of the LED's. The unit is attractive, strong, well machined, and of high quality (it IS Smith & Wesson, after all!). Great accessory for boating, hunting, camping, etc. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"A vividly bright white and red light is what this flashlight projected the first night and a half of its use. On the second day both lights began to fade from dim to bright at random and periodically the buttons would not work.

The S&W; Galaxy is a real must have!Powered by 3 AAA Batteries it beams a bright white light out that can be seen for hundrets of yards and the red light function is perfect at night. The price is hardly beatable, unless someone wants to spend 300 bucks for a flashlight (vortex luxeon).I hve been a fan of Mag Lights for years, which cost the same as this one but I had to alter my opinion.

I swapped out batteries, nothing. Only the red light works. Hopefully I can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too freaking bright!","review":"I purchased this flash light to use as a night vision light while flying.

I do not like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves it!!! A great gift for any man!","review":"My husband had been looking for an LED flashlight that has red bulbs (for fishing at night), but they were hard to find under $35-40 at our local stores. I found this one and it seemed to be a good quality light at good price - and it IS! He actually uses the red light more often than he thought he would - since it doesn't disturb your night vision. When using the traditional white lights, the flashlight is super bright. It's also a nice size - not too big and not too small. It seems as water-resistant as any flashlight could get. It being made of aluminum is great, too, as it shouldn't rust. A great gift for any guy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"Very nice flashlight, that is very well made. The red LED works very well to save your night vision. I have purchased 3 of these flashlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like versatile quality","review":"LED will never wear out. It is plenty bright and gives the option of red/white or both which is nice. The red option is why I bought this for my cat-burglar business, j/k, but when at a campsite or emergency situation where you need illumination and don't need attention, the red LED is optimal as an option at the click of a button. Beautiful belt sheath, with a compartment for extra batteries. It also comes with 3 AAA batteries for ready use, so A-plus on that as well. For a powerful, practical standard flashlight that's gonna last, $25 is all you need to spend.

It tells the tale of a Rabbi, who despite his heart condition risked his life to save many Jews from the gas chambers. He worked tirelessly on a plan to bomb the train tracks that lead to Auschwitz, but President Roosevelt unfortunately nixed this plan. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the Holocaust. It is well written and well researched.

Though our kids are nearly grown and gone and our lives are quieting down some, this book has made a huge difference in my life in an unexpected way. Three days after following the Hebrew Day Planner that Randy recommends, my diabetes, which had been out of control, fell within normal ranges and has remained there without the assistance of insulin. I highly recommend the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor text for a 100 level course","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. I was panic stricken when I received this textbook as I was fully prepared to fail this class. However, the professor I had did an excellent job of taking a poorly written, overly complex text and turning the material into easy to understand concepts. The only redeeming factor in this text is the abundance of graphs, maps, etc. Those we used very extensively in class and they did help to clarify the material. Of course, if your professor chooses this text for your class, you need to purchase it. Overall I'm glad I did purchase the text because the graphs, maps, etc were helpful and also required for reference in several exercises we did in this class. I'm also glad to be able to sell it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense reading","review":"This book could have been written and organized a lot better.

This book combines tax/IRS info with a terrible story about a tax agent. There is no depth to any of the characters. After one of his informants is killed right in front of him, the main character mostly just shrugs and moves on with his life. The plot isn't even interesting. If you want to get some of the basics about tax at the sacrifice of a plot, buy this book. I guess it IS better than a dry textbook with small type and two inches of material, but not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Rip-off","review":"This book is aptly titled.

Charlie was my grandmother first cousin. His grandfather and grandmother was Flynt and Sally Hill Lawson. I do not appreciate the incest that was told in this book. I feel our family has been insulted by lies and not taking the time to get the facts. THe Lawson family is a very good family. Charlie hit his self in the head with a mattock when he was building his basement.

In other words, although the blade seems very sharp, it often doesn't give me a clean cut.I also don't like that the top bar is shorter than the bottom one. It makes for an odd grip. No built-in file is really strange, too - that should be a given. And finally, the two slits at the bottom seem to be decorative only - I can't imagine a practical purpose for them.Vastly overpriced, and not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Heavy Feel, Sharp Clip","review":"This clipper is much heavier with a smoother finish than the standard clipper and feels good in your hand.

I waited a long time to get them because of the cost--and replaced 6 other cheap ones that kept breaking or dulling to non-use status in the meantime. These stay sharp and get the job done. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is because they don't have the nail file thingy that you can clean under nails with(a must with 4 kids, lots of dirt and dirty nails).They're rather large (larger than the little cheapy ones you can buy in the store), which makes for a better gripping surface, but kind of big to be cutting nails on little kids.

I was just lucky I didn't lose an eye to one of those things.As for the Seki clippers, the nails are just cut and they fall down. I'm not sure what they did different than the other manufactures but it's a huge difference in performance. I bought a set of tweezerman clippers at the same time as these and there is still no comparison. These clippers out perform every other clipper I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these clippers","review":"These clippers are great. I purchased a pair about 2 years ago and they are just as sharp today as the day I bought them. I like them so much that I sent a pair to my father and he loves them as well.

The only thing I'd change is to make a \\"catcher\\" for the nail clippings, as some clippers have, but it's no big deal. A bit expensive for a nail clipper, but worth so much more than the throw-away clippers you get in sets, or simply have laying around.I am happy with this, and would buy it again no contest."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I thought this nail clipper was going to be much better quality than the typical clippers you can buy in the drug store.

I can understand some of the comments people make about having to file your nails after. The clippers make such a clean cut that the edge is sharp.

Even my daughter's nails (age 4) were sharp after cutting with the clippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive","review":"The cut is not as smooth as it should be.

It the It works great. It feels good in your hand and it exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"These are expensive, perhaps 10 to 20 times the cost of drug store clippers. They are worth it, at least to me. Here's why:The bottom handle part is longer and wider so the clipper doesn't twist and jump out your hands.The blade is much sharper so it snaps when it cuts.The jaws of the clipper are open wider at rest so it's easier to insert your nails.The spring action is much stronger so each cut is more purposeful, it should last longer.I bought a Brookstone clipper set that cost about four times as much. This clipper is better than the one in that set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper","review":"Get excited about nail clippers? Really?? Surprisingly, yes. Sharp as can be, and nice and heavy, while also being comfortable to use, with a nice, wide, ergonomic lever. My one complaint is that the lever moves so smoothly that it takes a few tries to get the correct grip down, to keep the lever centered, especially when using your non-dominant hand. I really like that the cutting edge isn't curved quite as much as other clippers, and that allows me to flush off cuticles. By the way, I'm a shipfitter/welder, not some GQ type, and my hands take a beating at work; I needed a real tool keep my claws trimmed, not some chintzy little fru-fru device, and this does just fits the bill - and, just like any quality tool, it's well worth the extra expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fingernail clippers ever!","review":"Simply put, these are the best fingernail clippers I've ever bought. Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn't nearly as good. This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it's completely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels cheap, but works well.","review":"As with many of my Amazon purchases, this was based on the highest ratings. I usually like all things Japanese-manufactured, so I thought, \\"It's the highest-rated and Japanese? Sure, I'll try it!\\"When I received it the material felt cheap. I'm sure I'm just being picky, but for $15+ clippers (which don't include a file) I expected something more solid. Nevertheless, I tried them out and they certainly cut better than my previous Revlons.So far so good. But for the price I expected, as mentioned, something more solid, and with at least a bonus file, even if that wasn't the best built-in file in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book for the real beginner","review":"Maybe this is a good book for people who have already learned Spanish. I don't think that it really starts at \\"the beginning\\". I'm afraid that I will have to look for a more basic text and return to this one at some later point. Absoultely no grammar, just moves straight into dialogues and exercies."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may feel cheated","review":"This book claims to be a complete course and a teach yourself one. Well, it's neither. This is no more than a feeble introduction to the language. Claiming that it is a complete course is misleading. For a teach yourself book it does not give you enough support. I had to buy a dictionary because the vocabulary is only part explained. I had to buy a grammar because the language explanations are unclear, to say the least. I had to pay a native speaker to help and pronounce the words because the recordings are too fast. The native speaker disagrees with most of the book, she says that this is not Brazilian Portuguese, is foreign Portuguese. Buying this course has been a frustrating experience and money badly spent. I feel positively cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for what you can get out of it!","review":"The audio is too fast for any beginner to follow. The dialogues may have some useful vocabulary but the vocabulary is not explained properly. Nothing is explained properly really! The whole thing is rushed through. You just get the language as it comes. There is no grading, no teaching step by step, as you find in a good course. Actually I have found one. If you want a good teach yourself portuguese course, get Manuela Cook's instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a complete course","review":"I bought BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE A COMPLETE COURSE FOR BEGINNERS and was rather disappointed when I found out that this is hardly a complete course.This is no more than an introduction to the language and not a very good one. The dialogues are very much the same as in any other language course, but the language explanations are too limited. You are left without enough information to make your own sentences adapting the dialogues to your own circumstances. The exercises have lots of pictures, almost like a book for children, but they are superficial, like the language explanations. At the end of the book the imperfect of verbs is explained with a scrolling line. Is this meant to be a joke?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for the self-taught learner","review":"In addition to the tapes being too fast, for a teach-yourself course this book should explain things better. In the first unit you come across 'como se escreve?' The translation in the vocabulary box is 'how do you write it?' The grammar pages give 'voce / tu /o senhor / a senhora' for 'you', no mention to 'se'. 'Se' crops up again in the second unit for 'como se chama?' 'what is your name?' The grammar pages show 'se' meaning 'his / her / yourself'. Still no explanation for 'como se escreve?' 'how do you write it?'. The whole course is written in this style. Everything is rushed through and some of it does not seem to make much sense. Very frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be much better","review":"The whole course lacks in structure. Vocabulary covers different useful areas, but there is not a graded progression in the way the language is introduced. It all seems to be at random. The tapes are too fast. As a whole, the course is not user friendly for the very beginner and it does not offer enough to be a refresher course. I would recommend another course instead. Prista's Say it in Portuguese would be a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless w/o cassette","review":"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Brazil. I also bought Pimsleur's Quick and Simple Brazilian Protuguese (audio CD's). While Sue Tyson-Ward's book contains lots of information, it should not be sold without the matching audio portion.

Not a happy story. I cannot recommend this course at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited and misleading","review":"This is advertised as a complete course but gives you only the basics and not very clearly explained.

Nine Black Alps are clearly informed by punk and metal riffs, without being held prisoner by them. The songs are intelligent, catchy, and contain many subtleties which seem to get better with repeated listenings. The vocals may recall Joe Strummer of the Clash, but this band owes nothing to anyone. Every song on this album is easily catchy and memorable, and other than the two slow songs, the record rocks from start to finish. Fuzz guitar riffs seem to remind one of the great punk songs of old, yet this band sounds as fresh as today's news. I am as impressed by this album as I was the first time I heard the Ramones' first album, or Nirvana's \\"Nevermind.\\" Although this band has its own sound and doesn't sound like those two albums, it's easy to see why the sticker on the cover proclaims that this may be the band that saves rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"This cd is magical!

I was impressed by the sound, very grunge and still relevant, much like the rock revolution that occured around 2003 or 2004 (namely the Hives, Vines, Strokes etc). \\"Cosmopolitan\\" is the best track, and although it gets repeditive at times, it's a solid record. \\"Behind Your Eyes\\" and \\"Intermission\\" are two folkier acoustic tracks and this band makes them work. The lyrics are well written and socially insightful at times. Worth checking out if you're into Nirvana or the Vines.

Though you may be taken aback by the 'thinness' of his left arm in themodel, you can adjust the arm so that this 'flaw' in the design will be minimized.

There was one pivitol moment when a frustrated wife reveals the deep-seated root of her anger at her husband--he didn't accompany her to the doctor when she had a breast cancer scare the year before. However, the author dropped it after the revelation. You also have to suspend disbelief. Didn't any of the \\"unaffected\\" people of Rio Verde think the black church was odd? Why were some affected and others not? Was it some character flaw on their part? A husband notices his wife acting oddly, but doesn't protect his daughter. Finally, very little explanation was given about creature itself. Where did it come from? Why Rio Verde? Was there a link between it and the Wing family, or was it coincidence? I came away from this story with more questions than answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Little: Excellent 'til the End","review":"I say 'typical' simply because the two Little novels I've read ended, thematically at least, similarly: very unsatisfying after the great buildup. This book is an over-the-top example of this. 520 pages of really interesting, really intriguing buildup, then 10 pages of climax, in which a character dies for a pretty unclear reason. Bentley Little is a great writer, but it just seems like, at the end of every novel, he runs out of steam and just wants the damned thing to be overwith. But the first 520/540ths of the book is definitely worth it. Fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Summoning, Bently Little","review":"Currently reading Bently Little collection. I have enjoyed all that I have read. This one was great.

The Summoning is about a group of people who have to save their town from a Cup-hu-girngsi a chinese vampire (and it sure is weird). Some weak story transitions and simplistic writing are sometimes distracting and annoying, but I was so fascinated by the evil characters especially the wicked priest and his black church, I just couldn't put the book down. The heroes are pretty laughable and corny, I couldn't wait for them to die horrifically. Mr. Little's writing reads like a teenager's work in creative writing class, The story seems like it was thrown together in a few days, need's to be fine tuned, some passages rewritten. This is a pretty scary read, pretty gruesome in some part's, (no one is safe in this book [especially children]) most horror fan's will enjoy it.

Not a big rockabilly fan, neither country. But after reading some reviews got Liquor and Holy Roller. I actually like the mish mash of rockabilly, rock and punk influence. This album is more rock - which some people don't like.

As I am in the investment industry, the real estate market has concerned me for sometime. If the business side of the economy doesn't recover before the consumer side losses its steam, we could really be in trouble.I share the authors concerns about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Hopefully, the Treasury will oversee these two institutions soon so we might see some progress in getting these two goliaths under control.I would have found it helpful if the author spent some more time drawing contrast to some of the previous real estate bubbles that we have seen around the globe. Japan and Hong Kong are two recent examples of what can go wrong when the bubble bursts. As well, it would have been nice to see data prior to 1968. Thirty-five years is still a relatively short period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Like other first-time buyers, I'm trying to figure out whether I should buy now or wait. But this book gave me virtually no practical advice about how to judge my local market (except to compare average home prices to average incomes--which is a nearly meaningless statistic for projecting price increases or decreases). He defines \\"crash\\" as a 10-20% price drop, but offers no real time line.

Above anything I think the author is simply saying you should run your numbers VERY closely before buying residential real estate.* I laugh at those idiots who, in claiming the book's premise is false, do little more than stating the author is a LOSER and then go on to point out that since prices have continued to rise over the past six months a crash will not happen. That shred of evidence is then invoked to counter all the author's claims. Do these people really READ these books????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with no solid theory","review":"This title had a great catching phrase. But once I read the book I came to a conclusion that the author had no solid understanding of the present market. He came up with a great idea but spent all his energy getting his book out to publisher without the proper theories. Also he claims to take the responsibility to start the wave of the modern day real estate crash. In his book he refers to some stock exchange crashes and compares them with real estate. What is he thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doom & Gloom book","review":"This is just another doom and gloom book. Since it's publication in July, 2003 property values in San Diego have risen another 20% and continue to rise. The author doesn't discuss the principle of supply and demand and why prices are rising - Lack of supply of land and enormous demand for housing. And the author doesn't touch on the many people who move to the high demand areas of California like San Francisco and San Diego - They come here with money and don't have to necessary rely on a mortgage. Will values decline? Probably. How much? Somewhat. When? No one knows; certainly more than two years from now. In the meantime those who have waited to buy are now facing an average median price of San Diego housing of $444,000; $575,000 to get a decent home.

I went to the local Barnes and Noble to arm myself with yes men and how to make more money off of real estate. John's book caught my eye, I put my other books away and bought this one. I'm glad I did. Because of it, I will make more money than all the yes men. It takes guts to write a book like this, and it takes guts to do what I have to do to protect my family.

This gives me time to get experience and training in buying foreclosures and REO's. If what the author says/predicts comes true there will never be a better time to buy properties at a bigger discount (less than wholesale) and rents should actaully stay the same or go higher because the people that just had their house forclosed upon have to live somewhere, ie rentals. Keep it positive by paying down the mortgage take profits later.Biggest thing I learned was to be smart about your debt and debt leverage. Pay down the mortgage as much as you can.

This is the same author who wrote I was Amelia Earhart??? How is that possible? If you like books about female middle-aged vampires preying on virginal but menstruating girls for their blood, you will love this one! I did finish it, but only because I had agreed to read. If you don't believe me, read the hilarious short review in the New Yorker, last week in August. A terrible book, one I wished I had never read. It is allegorical and that is the only reason to read it. Other than that, it reads like the movie treatment (and a bad one at that) that it was to begin with. Beware second novels...especially ones that had been earlier regected. There is probably a reason why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Innocence","review":"First and foremost, I disliked this book by the choppy one paragraph and 3 spaces approach to the writing. One page chapters along with the choppy writing style made everything feel short and forced. The story itself was dramatically bland. Nothing held my attention and it the plot never flowed well. The characters were not well rounded and I was left with really only knowing the main character, Beckett. By the end of the book I was so irritated by the lack of details and explanations with things that I almost put it down. I guess I probably should of because the end fell short of all expectations I might have had. Also, drinking tea made out of tampon teabags was super gross and made the whole thing even weirder and less enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought the different writing style was interesting and might add an extra dimension to the book. Yet, besides having to decipher the conversations taking place in the book, since no punctuation was used, about 3/4 through the book I realized I knew nothing about the main character. I reread the jacket of the book, which boasted a \\"heroin you won't soon forget\\" and almost laughed out loud. I made myself finish the book, hoping it would redeem itself, and I was greatly disappointed at the end. It seemed like lazy writing, and it left no lasting effect with me, like good writing should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and not even good fluff at that","review":"One of the most inane books I have ever read. About the only positive thing I can say is that it took only 3 hours to finish.

I thought I saw early potential a few times so I stuck with it, however the farther into this story I got, the more I read just to laugh at the story line. Really bad.

I looked forward to the release of this book. I read it in one night and returned it the next day. I just didn't want this drivel on my shelf and couldn't imagine passing it on to anyone else. Yes, Yes, it is a deep allegory about how we treat girls in our society. Maybe I am horrifically bourgeois for not leaping to my feet and praising this quasi-feminist rant, but regardless of the symbolism, tea made of tampons is just too much for me. Let us hope it is merely a sophmore slump for Ms. Mendelsohn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Those Poor Trees!","review":"This book is one of the worst that I've ever read in life. It doesn't have any person that you want to learn more about, in fact, by the end of this novel, you'll be glad Beckett finally shut-up. The novel seems to be writen in some horrible attempt at poetry at points and lacks a plot. In fact, it is not until near the end of the novel do we learn anything about the storyline. For a book that seemed to gain praise from many, it makes me sad that the trees, that were used to make this book died in vien. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. I'm just glad I only paid a doller for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one should pay for this book!","review":"I will not repeat what others have written here about this book... but I've really got to say it. THIS BOOK IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and captivating","review":"Little Willow recommended this book to me..Oh, and in simple words, it is FABULOUS. Mendelson uses analogies to omnipotent Final Girl of horror fame, and Alice in Wonderland to convey a dark and deep feeling, so that the reader really is with Beckett. The words employed by Jane bring vivid pictures, making you want to devour it within seconds. A delicious coming of age with a unique twist, this no ordinary tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Own \\"Innocence\\"","review":"This is a one-sitting read.

The narrative is purposely disjointed, supposedly to mirror the mixed up state of mind of our narrator. Unfortunately, it's hard to feel very sorry for her since she doesn't seem to have it so bad. She's haunted by visions of bad slasher films with blood, bats, gore, ketchup, and has to be put on medication to get by day to day. Getting her period only seems to make things worse. There's a slight love interest with Toby, but there's so little character development that it's hard to care what happens. Overall, this book was tiresome to read and depressing as well. I did not think the writing was very noteworthy either. The only good thing is that it's not very long. Other than that, I can't think of much to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, that was awful","review":"This is maybe the worst book I've ever read. It was horrible, trite, and totally unredeeming. Please don't make the same mistake I did by wasting money and time on this book.If the author was trying to make some impossibly deep statement on young girls in society today, she should have picked some other vehicle than this silly, stupid tale of vampires. I don't care if they're real, or in the head of the protagonist. It all ends up with the same conclusion - this book is awful and so silly in the worst way.Every page found me stunned that it could get worse. But get worse it did. If I have to read the phrase \\"menstrual blood\\" that many times again in a book, then ...And for the love of Pete, stop comparing this book and Beckett to Holden Caulfield. To compare this writing \\"style\\", and this book to J.D. Salinger's masterpiece of how it feels to be adolescent and alone is incredibly far off base. Sure, they're both written in English, but any similarity ends there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling!","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Innocence.

Set in New York City and ultimately Eugene, Oregon (author Carola Dunn's current home) the book is a hodgepodge. The identity of the murder victim, the \\"Murdered Muckraker\\" of the title, is vague. He was a muckraker? The plot is weak and the book is overloaded with characters of little interest. Daisy's new husband, Alec, appears briefly at the end of the book. Overall, this is a disasterous potboiler just barely keeping the series alive.

A++ I would recommend it to any Jeep enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find better ones","review":"Not a good book, not specialized in anything, when it actualy get to the poind of the explanation/suggestion it direct you to a local dealer (well thanks a lot)try the \\"The Jeep Bible\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice clock, annoying voice and method of announcing time","review":"The good features of this clock outweigh the annoying, but...all my life, I have heard the time announced with the hour first, followed by minutes, as in: \\"The time is 10:25 PM\\" Perhaps it is the British method, but this clock is programmed to announce: \\"The time is 25 minutes past 10:00 PM.\\" Worse than that is when the voice says, \\"The time is 12 minutes before 11:00 PM\\" Believe it or not, I picture an actual clock in my mind when I hear the time and this way seems bass-ackwards to me. I have to turn the words around in my head to get it straight. Maybe I'll get used to it. I like the features of the clock such as date and day of the week, and the atomic timekeeping is wonderful. If an American version was available, I'd definitely buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"talking clock","review":"I ordered this for my grandmother. This clock would be great if it was louder. My grandmother has both hearing and vision problems. She stated it was not loud enough for her to hear. If the person using this did not have hearing issues I would give it 5 stars. It works great except for the volume issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"As someone who has been collecting Carmen McRae albums for thirty years, I find this production a welcome addition to my shelves. I have to say the first impression that hit me was the stunning sound. \\"Clear as a bell\\" and \\"sharp as a tack\\" are two hackneyed phrases that are fairly accurate in this case. It's hard to believe this album was recorded back in the late 1950's. Whoever did the digital remastering of the material certainly knew their business.With these songs you get a Carmen McCrae who is very much in her prime and absolutely in control of her voice. Both her singing and her backup instrumentals are right on target. The songs are \\"musical\\" in every sense of the word.I share these thoughts with you as someone who has admired Miss McRae's work for several decades. In all honesty, for those who are just becoming acquainted with her, there may be other albums to try first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many birds","review":"This is the first Carmen McRae CD that I have bought. Initially, I liked the idea of a theme CD where all the songs are about something. However, after listening to it, I find that there is a real \\"so what\\" quality about it. So they're birds. Big deal. There's nothing here that really stirs the emotions. And Carmen's voice lacks depth, although she has a good range."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good, but not...","review":"If you are looking for do-it-yourself abortion information like I was, this is not a good book for that. It is a history book. It's good, but not an abortionary (abortion dictionary)."},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps C$C's finest","review":"It's a toss-up in my mind whether Release or the sadly out-of-print White Noise is Cop Shoot Cop's best album. Of the two, Release is certainly the more accessible, though an accessible C$C album is by no means easy listening. The band infamous for their no-guitar approach bring in a guitarist for their final outing, as well as other incongruous instruments such as harmonica or trumpet. Also, Jim Coleman plays the piano a lot more on this album than in previous ones. However, Cop Shoot Cop's sound is still basically the same: dual bass attack, harsh banging drums, unsettling samples and gritty lyrics sung gruff. This is the easiest album of the band's to find, so by all means pick it up. Also, consider checking out the band members' disparate new projects: Firewater, Here, Phylr and Red Expendables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ on a crutch (too late, too much)!","review":"Ironically, my first introduction to Tod Ashley's music was through his current klezrock incarnation, Firewater. What immediately grabbed me was his incredible voice, followed quickly by his lyrics and songwriting. Eventually, I followed the trail of dried blood back to this album - the absolute pinnacle of No-Wave. Sure, people will drop names like Arto Lindsay's DNA, or Lydia Lunch's Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, but Cop Shoot Cop were never, ever surpassed, and this is their finest moment. Every single song is a brooding, jagged mess of bass-heavy songwriting and percussive stomp (\\"Ambulance Song\\" in particular has an absolutely AWESOME drum part), but the ones that stick out most are \\"It Only Hurts When I Breathe,\\" \\"Two At A Time,\\" \\"Any Day Now,\\" and especially \\"Ambulance Song.\\" Blow your brains out, baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crikey, It's Funky!","review":"This is brilliant stuff. There is good reason why Scott was \\"discovered\\" after playing on Scott Henderson's 1992 Tribal Tech romp \\"Illicit\\", and named Keyboard Magazine's \\"Best New Talent\\" for that year. You can hear the deep channelling of Herbie and Zawinul, and so much more. There are songs on this disc that are so deeply funky. . . we're talking Headhunters funky here. . . I have not heard anything quite like this in a long, long time! Scott's voicings and layers are so rich, and his vocoder stylings are so much more expressive and \\"human\\" than mere synth patches.

You are better off with a book from Aran Ashe or Jaid Black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light Reading","review":"I call this great LIGHT reading because the format makes it very easy to read for only a couple minutes here & there. (I read it all during 20-30 min lunch breaks.)It was sad and funny, and I appreciated that the main character (Olivia, the letter writer) wasn't perfect. We see everything from her point of view, but she's not a great hero. She's just a regular woman, like you or me, who makes mistakes and mis-prioritizes.It wasn't really heart-breaking until the very end. I just now finished the last few pages with tears streaming down my cheeks, and a book hasn't done this to me in a long time.If you have a sister, if you enjoy writing/receiving letters, if you have experienced the pain of cancer in your family, if you enjoy Hollywood/celebrity life, it's a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters","review":"What an amazing reading adventure. It's hard to believe with the number of books out there that an author could come up with such an original touching tale of two sisters. I laughed until I cried. Hurray for Elisabeth Robinson for capturing all of the incredible feelings; good, bad and everything else, between siblings. I put this book right up next to I Know This Much Is True by Wally Lamb. For those of us with siblings, we know that only real life is more amazing than these stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juat plain bad....it obviously pays to have famous friends..","review":"I had very high hopes for this book, especially with all the great reviews it has received. It began with promise, but quickly plummeted into a book so dull, that I found myself skimming through paragraphs just to get through the page. It just seems that this book may not have even been published had it not been for the author's connections. Save yourselves some money and read something more fulfilling....like your phonebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Loved This Book","review":"A friend suggested I read this book and against my better judgment, I did. What a great mistake that was. I loved the Adventures of the Hunt Sisters. Written as a series of letters, it smartly draws readers in until they are hooked. When I was done reading the book, I wanted to write the author my own letter. It also inspired me to begin writing my friends and family pen and paper letters. They are so much more personal than email. The author has been silent since Hunt Sisters. I hope she reconsiders and writes again. She really is a great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I could not relate to Olivia, the main character, at all. She came across very one-dimensional and shallow. She is extremely self-centered and the author presents very little balance to that.Am I supposed to feel sorry for her when she has no where to live as she carries her $700 pair of shoes?I just cannot get behind a story with seemingly no moral, no point, very little plotline who highlights a superficial woman that bemoans her life for trivial reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"inappropriate review","review":"I haven't read Elisabeth Robinson's book and unlike the reviewer beneath from Big City USA I've never met her, but I still take exception to the highly inappropriate review. It's personal, offensive and I suspect libellous. It's simply not constructive to other readers to hear personal opinions of the author which have no bearing on the book whatsoever. This is not a messageboard for gossip, it's supposed to inform other customers in their choice. Personal vendettas have no place. Happily for Elisabeth Robinson I'm sure she has much more interesting and important things to do now than worry about such petty bitching. Unlike the author of the review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is horrible. It obnoxious, trite, predictable and the embodiment of Lifetime television for women. For.The.Love.Of.God. The letter format is lazy writing. It is also incredibly unrealistic in today's text messaging, cell phones, etc. I was very dissapointed by the boring, sappy story. All in all, this was Danielle Steel material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and unique!","review":"This is a wonderful book of two sisters and life's adventures. Grab a box of kleenex because it will make you laugh and cry! I loved the writing style, made the book just fly by.Olivia and Maddie are two sisters, drawn together by leukemia and it is all Olivia's faxes and letters to important people in her life or various people she is venting to that we read and get our story from. A beautiful book with depth, although I felt like there was a curtain that some of the characters were hiding behind at times.You won't be sorry to pick up this book and won't be able to put it down! This is an author to keep your eye on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cherished Read","review":"A truly cherished story of sisters and the love and life they share. The story is told through letters that Olivia writes in airplanes, on movie sets or in the hospital visiting her sister. I laughed in places and cried in places. Who could have believed that writing via letters you would get to know the characters. Elizabeth Robinson has produced a great read and a memorable one at that. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I got suckered in by this book by the praise on the cover. I hate when that happens. It fell far short of expectation and I quit halfway in. It's very one sided, written in one voice in one letter after another. The problem: I never once believed this character would in a jabillion years go to the trouble to do anything as old-fashioned as writing long detailed sing songy letters. Tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very engaging","review":"First of all the letters format was just ok but I really found it boring to always hear it from Olivia's point of view and it was never in real time. Everything was always being dictated to you after the fact. Second I never really connected with the characters. They were quite dull. Even having a younger sister myself did not give this plot more emotion. I was quite glad to get through with it and move on to something better. I was hoping it would be a book to recommend to girlfriends and my sister but I doubt they would like it. Basically it was not uplifting or depressing, sad or happy, just neutral."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read until the end","review":"This book is extremely successful in merging comedy, cynicism, illness, family love and the struggle for meaning in life. The characters are full of flaws and struggles, just like we all are. That is why everyone is so likeable. It is very rare to find women characters in modern ficition that are strong without being obnoxious or unlikeable. The description of Maddie's illness and treatment is so palpable and realistic it is hard not to think about it constantly. Few books can merge so much successfully. However, I feel the book was just cut short at the end and finished too abruptly. I am not sure what I was expecting but I was hoping for a more conclusive ending given the tone and pace set early in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journal format","review":"I did not like the format this book was written in. I found it very boring. In fact it's the first book I haven't finished in TEARS! I gave it to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Humanist Novel","review":"4.5 stars. While I may have liked a little less name-dropping, overall I thought the book and its characters were true to life. I kept waiting for the miracle, the happy ending, the finding of god. But no, only a deepening of understanding about what it means to be human, that stuff happens, that people love each other and that life goes on. Oh, and you should take the risk, have faith in yourself and follow your dreams, because this is the only life you get, and you can't know what will happen until it happens. I enjoyed it. I even had some LOL moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Winded-Boring","review":"The book contained so much ranting. Does not keep you involved in the story. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Beyond Belief","review":"I can hardly believe someone actually advocated the publishing of this novel. It's simply not worth the paper it is printed on. Transparently, it is the author's story, slightly fictionalized and wrapped in a pretty package. The writing and form are terrible. Please skip it and choose something worthy instead. Perhaps Adam Langer's \\"Crossing California,\\" Dan Chaon's \\"You Remind Me of Me\\" or Tom Perrotta's \\"Little Children.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, interesting characters...","review":"I thought this was a great beach/summer book that was easy to read and had interesting characters. I didn't know how much really went into movie making and budgets, etc. Maddie's illness made me so sad....The problem I have is that Olivia didn't seem at the end to very much care about Maddie's death ie. it ended too soon after her death to let the reader get a feeling for what Olivia thought...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindbendingly Mediocre","review":"This is the story ( told in typical chic-lit conventions) about a creepy movie producer feeling guilt after the loss of a sister who she treated badly for years. The writing has quite a bit of nastiness and is mocking towards others, and is filled with second-rate plays at poetic metaphor. The format of presenting the book by way of one letter after another letter after another letter after another letter (all by the same person, by the way, and all with the same one-sided misery and sarcasm) finally wears one down. Most likely what we have here are a group of Robinson's actual journal entries, and/or copies of late night emails and letters she wrote during a period of upset, anger, and guilt-- now pasted together and rehashed as a \\"book.\\" The best part of the book was the marketing. Second best part -- the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to hype","review":"I was anxious to read this book. Loved the cover, title and hype, but the book was dull. I stopped reading 20 pages before the end. I didn't care about the characters, the plot was so-so and the prose humdrum. It's a wonder how the author garnered so much prepub publicity. It's hard to believe it had had anything to do with the quality of the book, which was a midlist title at best.Want to read a book that lives up to some of the buzz? Try GOOD GRIEF by Lolly Winston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to this book - but to be honest (and I feel a little guilty saying this, since it was a moving topic), I was bored to pieces. The part about the sister battling cancer and her families' reaction was interesting, especially the reactions to the various doctors and hospitals - but even that - especially about the alcoholic father, was formulaic. The part about Hollywood, the letters to the boyfriend, etc, were just plain boring. I ended up skimming much of the book, and was not moved, even at the ending. What is going on with literature lately - poor writing and emotionally manipulative books seem to get this incredible publicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Helps When The Publisher Pours All Its Money Into Your PR","review":"For all the hype the publisher paid into and the sentimentalized reviews of \\"you'll laugh, you'll cry\\"... when it comes down to it, the writing is hackneyed and amateurish. Quick fast sentences. Cynical nasty comments. A personal bravado about the main character's (ie, the author's) brilliance. This is most definitely no example of great literature. The letter format is also not as unique as the reviewers are attempting to pretend. It's been done in a more striking and literary way in other books-- as, for example, in The Color Purple. Last year's Ella Minnow Pea also gave the form some excitement. This is EZ reading and EZ writing. There is a show-offy quality to the author's name dropping of celebrities and a paint by numbers use of plot. Yes, you can read the book in a day. But the same can be true of People Magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I knew what the end would be and it still made me cry when I got there. The novel is gripping, funny, and wrenching all at the same time. It is extremely well-written and the device of using letters to tell the story is innovative. You feel like Olivia is writing these letters to you. I can't say enough nice things about this book. It really is one of the best things I've read lately. I lost a beloved cousin to diabetes last year. She was like a sister to me and her struggle against her disease reminded me so much of what Maddie goes through in her struggle with Leukemia. At times it was just painful to read sections of this book because I identified so intensely with the characters and what they were going through. Elisabeth Robinson has obviously spent some serious time in hospitals and knows what it's like to deal with doctors who are less than caring and the frustration of not being able to do more for someone you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing beginning","review":"I expected to like this, but couldn't get past the depressing beginning. Letters from a depressed person who is contemplating suicide, who then finds out her sister has leukemia, goes home to a family where no one will talk about anything,,,,,,,,,just didn't seem worth continuing.

From my dim and distant recollection of my university days, a novel consisted of character development, plot arcs, dynamic dialogue and storytelling.

I, on the other hand, have a hard time believing that this tired collections of self-absorbed ruminations in the form of heart-wrenching and mundane letters really appeals to anyone's sense of what makes a good book.

Early in the book, Tichy seems to say something important, and I read with great interest. Quickly my enthusiasm waned, as I realized that many of those he cites as exemplary, such as Eckhard Pfeiffer at Compaq and Dick Notebaert at Ameritech, are not the great success stories he makes them out to be. Pfeiffer was booted out of Compaq and Ameritech is now merging with SBC.

The new regulators are a problem for everyone, but apparently other brands of camping stoves are no better unless you want to spend about $500 and have a heavy, bulky stove.

Don't misunderstand me, I am on the consumer's side. The problem with this book is that doesn't really tell the consumer the most important things about interest rates. Credit cards aren't about interest rates. There are more twist and turns a company can use to make money on you besides the interest rate or finance charges. This book barely touched this subject, and actually encouraged the reader to look for the lowest rate card instead of saying,\\"Don't worry about the rate, you shouldn't carry a balance anyway!\\" Its a good book for understanding your rights as far as disputing credit card charges and understanding credit law.

This of course is the case with many bands from Australia and New Zealand.Musically speaking The Angels are a pretty straightforward 2 guitar band and wear their late 70s roots on their sleeves.A sort of new-waveish, more melodic version of AC/DC, frontman Doc Neeson does a nice line in dementia, and the original Australian Face to Face included \\"Live It Up\\" a track that reminded one of 70s pub blues bands such as Dr. Feelgood.Lyrically, The Angels can get quite poetic (as in \\"Am I Ever Going To See Your Face Again\\") and usually manage to avoid rock-pig cliche'.Although this album does NOT contain the original track list, it does not contain filler either. This is a good introduction to a band whose contradictions make it truly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Butt Kickin Rock","review":"I had not heard this in well over 20 years.

It is not enough to satisfy my own desire for historical information.The book also presents a nice overlay map of historic Fort Stockton and its present location in the present-day Fort Stockton, Texas.I would also like to state that however disappointing the book was to me from my own historical scholar's viewpoint, \\"An Illustrated History of Texas Forts\\" would be nice reading for those who are interested in a less-detailed history of the state's forts.

Getting beyond Madsen's overwhelming display of technical proficiency, I found each track deeply musical to the point of being hypnotic - and always true to Monk's original concept.The recording is A+ from the perspective of sound fidelity, too. The listener is placed in perfect proximity to the piano, which is perfectly in tune and sounds like it must be the world's finest instrument.With \\"Sphere Essence,\\" Madsen has raised the bar on Monk interpretations so high that they are likely never to be equaled, nor the attempt made to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great children's book","review":"The basic writing style and simplistic plot in this small to medium sized book was perfect for my two children, ages 5 and 9, to comprehend.

Full of trite lyrics, thinly disguised samples, a couple of choice words snuck in here and there and near-zero vocal prowess. Even though some of the ballads have nicely arranged backgrounds, they're not much better than anything else on the album.

Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book if you are looking for color pictures.","review":"I'm very disappointed with this book. I will keep the book for its maps, but I don't believe it will be at all useful to identify the birds that visit my yard in the winter. The only color picture this book contains is on the cover. There are a very few photographs (black and white) and a very few drawings (also black and white). The maps may be helpful, but only when used together with some other book with color pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lead Up To Infinite Crisis","review":"I haven't read the other tie in books to countdown to infinite crisis but they actually seem like tie ins to this event. This book has the main part of the other story where Superman and Wonder Woman fight. They mention the other books like the war with thangar and the society of villains but they aren't expanded on. I enjoyed the book a lot and my only real problem with it is that I don't understand why Batman was keeping track of the other heroes, even though I don't know a lot about him I really liked Blue Beetle and surprisingly Booster Gold (The only other story I read with him was 52 where he was a jerk) Another problem is that the little intro makes it seemed like you missed something important like you walk in a hour to a movie and you kind of have to catch up to what has happened. This is a very thick book and despite my nitpicks its really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap fun with the tick tock","review":"This little percussion instrument makes a resounding TICK-TOCK when hit on each side. This is a great idea for participatory play. Put on a cd or play a song about clocks (My Grandfather's Clock is one) and have the children keep time or put in the Tick Tock at the right time in the song. Engaging the senses in learning makes kids learn better and faster. Fun for the entire family. Great for home schooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Graphics! But not for sim fans!!","review":"This game has excellent graphics on a Good end AGP. As mentioned in previous reviews, there is a bug in the name selection. The length is also fixed. You can't even enter \\"SCHUMACHER\\". You'll have to enter it as \\"SHUMAKER\\" in order to fit it in. More importantly, this game doesn't give you full control over the front wheels. It tends to keep you on track which is not a good sign for a simulation fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIQUE RESOURCE FOR YOUTH MARKETERS!","review":"Now THIS is the kind of book I've been looking for. Something written with businesspeople in mind. Well organized, full of case studies, just the right mix of stats. Not only is this the only book of its kind, trust me -- I've been looking for this type of book everywhere! -- it even has a stamp of approval from top execs at General Motors, Best Buy, Sony Music, etc. Fascinating book that is both highly educational as well as a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Industry Bible For College Marketers (Five Stars)","review":"Finally there's a book for college marketers! Morrison does a fantastic job in streamlining the statistics while pumping his book full of real-life case studies, helpful hints, and amazing insights. This industry pro clearly knows his stuff and his vast experience is evident on every page. (Small wonder that the book has been featured on NPR, \\"Advertising Age\\", \\"Chicago Tribune\\", \\"LA Times\\", et al.) The book's an easy read, well indexed, and quite witty at times. I'm keeping mine on my desk as a reference book for all future decision-making as it relates to the student market. Fully recommend this book -- five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon versus Xerox","review":"When you gotta have it, you gotta have it. However, we found it cheaper directly from Xerox.Please recycle - the manufacturer makes it easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosing civility","review":"This book is excellent. It isn't just about having good manners. It is about living a good life and how to share your life civilly with others. If we all acted like this man suggest there would be so much less hurt and more love in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone.","review":"While this book might identify behaviors you have been using since childhood, it may open your eyes to some of the more inconsiderate conduct that goes on in your life. It not only explains how one should act, it discusses how you can deal with the conduct of others, and how to encourage civility all around you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed expectations","review":"I bought the book because of the back cover promise of \\"a beautiful book that lifts the spirit,\\" written by a professor of Italian fiction and poetry at Johns Hopkins. What is M. Scott Peck doing as the authority on page 4? The renunciation of Dante comes on page 7, \\"One day, while lecturing on the Divine Comedy, I looked at my students and realized that I wanted them to be kind human beings more than I wanted them to know about Dante.\\" If the book had been written as an essay for the etiquette section of a men's magazine, my opinion may have been positive, but I was simply not expecting a lightweight book of dos-and-donts.According to the forward, \\"Civility is a wonderfully effective tool to enhance the quality of our lives.\\" If you are looking for life quality enhancement tools, this book may be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ode to 'better angels of our nature'","review":"Candidly, reading such a sneaky and seductive little book as Choosing Civility (sneaky and seductive because, as the boss used to say, 'he puts into words stuff you already know' and thus sort of tricks you into coming to grips with deeper ideas) reminds me of where I'm not exactly being the best I can be. Just from Chapter 1: Pay Attention, on more than a handful of occasions I don't really pay attention to people, to what they're telling me, to their body language, to their tone of voice. Even if I can respond logically to their words, I can be oblivious to the subtext and context.Then going down the list by reading through the book, sure, I can be a whole lot better. Not to pick on myself exclusively here, I'll bet the great majority of people can move forward in these civility categories, too....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not your mother's book on manners","review":"Calling this an etiquette book is misleading; it's a guide to living morally in increasingly me-me times. Forni's advice-ranging from how to make guests feel included to how to apologize to how to assert yourself-all hinges around one all-important ideal: recognizing yourself as part of a larger community. To that end, the basis of civility and the 25 tips are all about learning to recognize how our actions affect others and ultimately come back to impact ourselves. Forni makes a strong case that civility is an ethical code, and it's obvious by his warm, humanist take (there's no doctrinaire rules-issuing here) that he practices what he preaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fresh read on a timely social subject","review":"This is a wonderfully compact and concise volume that constructively considers the reasons behind contemporary society's loss of civility, chronicles the reasons for and benefits of adopting a more civil code of behavior, and offers twenty-five sensible rules of well-mannered and thoughtful conduct. I have met and corresponded with the author, a humanities professor at Johns Hopkins University, on a few occasions, and he is most definitely a gentleman in the the most civilized definition of the word. Put this useful and well-written book on your shelf next to those time-honored Post, Martin, and Vanderbilt tomes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosing Civility","review":"This book was an awesome read. It helps one become aware of how to act in society. It covers the obivous and the subtle rules of civility. The best part of reading this book is seeing where you are in civility. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on increasing civility","review":"This is an excellent book on courtesy in our everyday interactions. I think if everyone practiced Forni's 25 suggestions, both public and private life would go more smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love these words, this book , and how the Author delivers many messages....","review":"In the beginning I was not sure how this book would be, but as the Author explains different situations, and talks on ethics and civility, I could not turn away. Everyone should have the opportunity to read this book, maybe it would change many minds in our world today to be kind, considerate and to think about how they act, offend and hurt others just by simply words or choices. I highly recommend this 5 star plus book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosing Civility is an option that I was taught in youth.","review":"Friends and I read the book and I thought that this is one I would like to own. The truth is that civility is something that seems to be lacking in the present world much too often. Not that it is dead; just not always observed and lived as a principle. I sometimes slip too and thought this would be a good book to dip into often. It is now by my bedside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a movie, or a PETA commercial?","review":"This entire movie seems to be orchestrated by someone with EXTREME environmental views.

Most of the scenes where him and animals were talking were taken separately, sometimes using a double. And that really showed, his acting was just not convincing.His lack of affection to the animals was just so obvious. Remember the scene when Eddie throws out the Rats? Those hands that holding them rats weren't even Eddie, that was a double.Why are the animals so human?? How come they never fight with other animals ? Also, so much ANIMAL-STEREO-TYPES. That was a FERRET, yeah I know that Ferrets are in the weasel Family but, you don't call animals by the specie....Its rude to Ferrets and Ferret owners. They should've called them ferrets. You don't say \\"My canine Jack is bla blabla.....\\"Stupid dumb movie for simple-minded.

Eddie Murphey at his best!","review":"Eddie Murphey is truly the doctor, the doctor of comedy that is! This is the series to see if you need to laugh, if you love to laugh even! I was watching these because I like Raven-Symone (she plays one of his daughters). Raven-Symone is from Disney Channel's \\"That's So Raven\\". Also, the animal voices, many of them are very familiar (like Chris Rock and Cedric the Entertainer). If you like one and two, then you might want to check out \\"Dr. Doolittle 3\\". No, it does not feature Eddie Murphey unfortunately. However, this movie is the doctor for your comedy ills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining.","review":"This is another Family friendly movie, that my 3 littlest ones just didn't take to. About have way through, 2 of the 3 were asking to put on Homeward bound instead. There was a lot I liked about this movie, but my family voted with their feet and remote control. They are 6 to 10 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN","review":"I loved this movie. The animation was great. The scenes were so well done and so funny that I immediately bought copies for family members (adult). There are few movies that are not offensive for older adults and they really enjoyed this one. Eddie is good in his role, but the animals are the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I enjoyed this very much. It shows you exactly how many times the word appears in the NIV and KJV and how it looks in the original Hebrew/Aramaic. Exhaustive doesn't even begin to describe this book. The only problem with this book is the blatent disregard for the Divine Name, Yahweh, which is just translated as \\"the LORD.\\" Nevertheless, it is an important part of any Bible reader's library.I originally thought this was an interlinear, so don't make my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"My bedroom is Winnie the Pooh Theme so I was really excited to purchase this art print by Peter Ellenshaw. The colors are beautiful and you feel like you could just step in the picture and join Pooh on the bridge.

Sings most stupid songs among modern Russian mass culture (if it's culture!) singers. I'm trembling hearing his voice and all these rubbish texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Overdue","review":"Finally, Delbert's many fans get a glimpse of his seminal,just left Texas for L.A.,pre-roadhose big horn section,brand of music. Delbert's fine voice and his unique grasp of R&B is here but it's displayed using songs he crafted,showing a gift for lyrics that he all but abandoned as he became more successful.Though Delbert has always been able to \\"Soulify\\" any song,his interpretation of his own material is special. This CD is also an excellent introduction to another great R&B voice,Glen Clark. Though not as well known as Delbert, Clark also has a natural and soulful grasp of R&B. He creates gospel laced rock and blues that stirs your feet as well as your soul. This CD is long overdue and will hopefully spawn another generation of Delbert and Glen fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have available on CD finally","review":"I saw these guys play in 1972 or 1973 opening for John Mayall. I had never heard of them and became a life long fan. Great live act. I have had my vinyl copies since then and given many cassettes to friends hoping to get them on the D&G band wagon. While these are must have items for Delbert McClinton fans they have a broader appeal and are worthy of a place in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lale Anderson CD","review":"A nice selection by the German Singer from WWII days.

Sugarcult rocks onstage and on their albums..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok i suppose","review":"Being a huge fan of Sugarcult in the past, I find this cd very disappointing. They've gotten out of their sort of edgy style and gone for a much more pop punk sound. This cd is too sell-outish for me to really enjoy it and I really hope I don't start hearing all the little 13 year old girls that \\"looooooove Simple Plan soooo much\\" obsessing over Sugarcult as their new sell-out band of the month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy","review":"This CD is pretty good. It has a lot of catchy tunes, however some of them sound the same. I also own Start Static and you can tell these guys are growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Start Static, but Awesome Nonetheless","review":"Sugarcult's new album is, as most sophomore albums are, not as great as their first. While everything on their previous album seemed fresh, new, and exciting, Palm Trees and Powerlines recycles some of those elements to form songs that are good, but not awesome. Still, PT&P has definitely been long-awaited and shows a lot of effort. The hauntingly depressing track \\"Counting Stars\\" is only outdone by the melancholy final track, \\"Sign Off.\\" \\"What You Say\\" is a punk-hand salute to all that is rock concerts; it makes me feel like I'm at one without leaving my bedroom. \\"Memory\\" sounds great but it was better acoustic (on the compilation Punk Goes Acoustic). Go buy the album, if for no other reason than to support Tim's ecclectic wardrobe and hotness fund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugarcult is the band to watch!","review":"Let me just say that I absolutely LOVE this album, I have their debut and had convinced myself that the band's second would sound manufactured and unlike themselves. I had to buy it anyways because that is what a true fan does, and I was not dissappointed AT ALL!!! I heard Memory, the first single off of this cd, for the first time off of an acoustic cd that I bought and now I see the actual version on TV all of the time!! I just cant get enough of these guys, I know we will be hearing a lot from them soon!!!
