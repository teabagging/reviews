This book had Noras sister calling her \\"dumb\\" several times. It was hard to skip.The parents are busy and keep ignoring Nora. We ALL get busy. It just did not seem like her parents were very engaged with Nora. So Nora acted out, like most preschoolers. I just felt this was the wrong message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice of wording.","review":"If it weren't for the use of the word \\"dumb\\" in this book, I would give it 5 stars.My son loves this books and picks it out at the library, and asks me to get it for him. The story has a wonderful playful rhythm to it as it is read aloud, and this makes it quite fun to read, but thanks to this book, my son is now familiar with name-calling and the word \\"dumb\\". Very disappointing. I have tried to substitute the word with something else, but know my son knows it too well. I explain to him that we don't use this word in our family and that it is a bad word to use, and he seems to understand that, but how sad to learn name-calling in a children's book. Although Rosemary Wells may have thought that kids learn to say these things anyhow from other kids, why help perpetuate it? Because the word \\"dumb\\" is part of the rhyming nature of the book, it is hard to come up with a substitute, and I can't help but wonder why the Wells didn't use the word \\"glum\\" or something else less hurtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible message","review":"bought for our daughter \\"nora\\" w/o having read the book. didn't realize that the older sister tells \\"nora\\" multiple times that she's dumb. not something i really want to read to our 2 year old. planning on returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone has a nora","review":"All my children love this book.

It has many nice features, bells and whistles as they say, but the picture quality is not there, it is soft. It doesn't have the sharpness, saturation, and contrast (even when the mode is set on hard in the menu) that I want in a picture. It might pass on the monitor or TV but not anything larger than 6 x 4 in. in print. My first digital camera, Olympus C-4000 4.0 mp ($600) and my small Concord 3340z 3.1 mp ($99) which is strapped to my belt like a cell phone, outperforms this digital camera as far as image quality, sad to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality Control","review":"I've used Fuji digital cameras since they were first introduced and have been thrilled with the images they produce. Excellent color, easy-to-use controls. I decided to get this camera for a specific art project. The first unit I received had a scratched lens. I exchanged it for another unit. The second unit didn't have a USB cable to download the images. I found one around the house, downloaded the images, and discovered a cluster of dead pixels. Needless to say, I decided not to exchange it for a third.I was planning on buying the Fuji S5 Pro to replace my old Contax G2 film camera, but now I'll go for a Canon or Nikon. Clearly Fuji has given up on their quality control. It's a shame, too. Their color rendition is fantastic. Oh well!I should say, too, that the images were not as high quality as those from my little Fuji F11. They were oversharpened straight from the camera and there was a lot of noise in areas of flat color (like a blue sky)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAMERA","review":"This camera is awesome.

It takes wonderful photos if you take time to read the manual throughly. Do not buy this camera if you simply want a point and shoot. This is meant to give you all the nice features of a DSLR with a reasonable price tag attached. The only con with this camera is picture noise when using a higher ISO. If you primarily want to take indoor photos then I suggest buying an external flash such as the Sunpak 383 to go with it.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RETURNED IT... LCD/Viewfinder are inadequate","review":"For non-DSLR goodness, just buy the Sony Alpha or R1 family cameras. I like Fujicons a great bit too, so this unit just offended me.

I bought this camera thinking it would be a more up to date camera, and more like a DSLR. Unfortunately, I have taken about 500 photos with this camera, and the quality of the photos is not as good as my S7000 that I had to sell to buy this one. In fact every other Fujifilm camera I have takes clearer pics than this one. The pics that I took with this camera are dark, and grainy with noise in all modes. The viewfinder on this camera is almost useless, unless you are close to what you are shooting. However, the manual lense is a nice touch. The auto focus on the otherhand is terrible. The best part of the whole camera is that it has a really nice LCD display. It is very sharp, and can move into several different positions. Sadly, I wish I had my S7000 back. From now on, I think I will consider moving up to a DSLR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Point and Shoot, Relatively Low Noise, Horrible Customer Service","review":"The Fuji 9000 family is a great camera for individuals looking for \\"near\\" entry level SLR performance with a great fixed lens along with decent movie capability. The SuperCCD offers excellent well balanced images and the manual focus ring is extremely responsive.Just pray that nothing goes wrong with camera, Fuji doesn't stand behind their product or warranty. I had a knob break off from the camera during normal use (switching from between modes). I had used the camera almost daily for 4 months and the unit was still under warranty.After shipping the unit back to Fuji I recieved a bill several weeks later stating the fault was caused by impact damage (load of c%*p) and I had to pay $120 to get my camera back.This is in stark contrast to my experience with Panasonic customer service, where I've recieved a replacement camera in as little as 5 days from them under their warranty policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fujifilm Finepix S9100","review":"I really like this camera.

The roots of Sufism go back to canonical sources of Islam: The Qur'an and prophetic tradition. However, through centuries many deviant paths have developed that call themselves sufi while failing to observe basic principles of Islam. This book does an excellent job of tracing the essential concepts and practices of Sufism to their original sources, defining them in a systematic fashion and putting every one in the context of a comprehensive system of soul training and spiritual improvement. The author's deep knowledge of the topic and his sincere belief in its significance shines through the pages. This is the ultimate reference for any serious student of the Sufi path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Cronica... instead","review":"This book started off great.

Heavy rock was just hitting its stride in 1972, and Quo abandoned their lightweight, twangy pop, bought distortion pedals and let rip. And what songs! Paper Plane, Big Fat Mama and Don't Waste my Time are pedigree up-tempo rockers that really satisfy (Paper Plane was a hit single). Even the ballads are bluesy and highly listenable. The only really weak track here is the cover of Doors' Roadhouse Blues. Power-boogie has never been as good as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Remaster of a Great Rock Album","review":"I grew up with Status Quo being my number 1 band. Their music encouraged me to learn to play guitar. They were just one heck of an energetic melodic rock and roll band.I had all the records and as time rolled on and i got older i moved on to other things musically.Recently i saw this remaster and thought id buy it for old times sake and to remember my younger years and what a great move that was. This remaster rocks and they sound absolutely as exciting and fresh today as they did then.I challenge anyone to find a better boogie R&R; album than this and the ones Status Quo released in this part of their career.Its just an awesome sounding CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Work","review":"PileDriver for me represents the best of their work. Apparently recorded virtually live in the studio in just a few days, this album really contrasts the range of style that Quo are capable of. Rossi's lead guitar is just incredible and when combined with Parfit's vocals you have an awesome combo. Shame they went kinda pop a couple of albums later...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks best kept Secret","review":"I think the problem with the public perception of Status Quo contribution & place in the history rock music, is that their just seen as a greatest hits act, with the hit single normally being the most commercial track on the record. But I always suspected that there were a little more the three chord mavericks.I was correct, there's strong musicianship, original songwriting, diversity, it's like a completely different band that opened Live Aid.You even get a great version of Road House Blues (it gives The Door recording of the song a run for its money)So if you a big fan of 70's rock, then this must be a essential purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!","review":"I might as well throw out the rest of my cookbooks, because this is the one I use 99.99% of the time.

Using this classification method as well as the picture really helps you figure out if this recipe is going to work for the people you are going to serve.

However, it turned into a realistic story of a young man's life and feelings during a war that did more than wound his soul. Written like an autobiography during the 1940's, this book has the true innocence of youth; not some modern fabrications. It does have the horrors of war violence, but there are also pieces of everyday life which make us all human.

The first two songs on this album are really, really good. I was delighted that this album could perhaps be a new favorite. Then, tracks 3-8 hit me with the fetid sound of boring, familiar music. Really horrible. The female voices (Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey, among possible others) were all out of place and annoying. The songs were predictable and had choruses that repeated about 12 times too many. After somehow staying awake through tracks 3-8, track 9 brought back the feeling of the first two. Track 10 is better than 3-8, but still nothing too great. The good songs on this album are interesting stories with dark and appropriate music. While I really do like tracks 1, 2, and 9, the album is far from an \\"enjoyable album experience,\\" which is what I usually look for in music. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated","review":"If Metallica's beer-drinking lead singer called this one of his favorite albums because of its \\"gory details\\", then you know something must be wrong.This is one of Mr.Cave's weakest albums not only because some of the lyrics are simply too cheesy to take them seriously(unless you're a goth teenager), but also because Cave made this record just to have fun with his buddies and girlfriends. The band never went on tour to support this album; they were exhausted after the Lollapalooza and Henry's Dream tours. They needed to relax. And that is exactly what they did in \\"Murder Ballads\\".The only good thing about this album was the fact that Mr.Cave and his Seeds got a wider exposure here in the U.S. without having to sell out.If I'm giving \\"Murder Ballads\\" two stars is simply because \\"Stagger Lee\\" is way too cool. Specially live.Check out Your Funeral, My Trial, Tender Prey, or The Good Son if you really want to know what made Nick Cave and the Bad Seed legends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Nick Cave.","review":"Kylie Minogue is God-awful.

It demostrates true human kind. Henry Lee is one the best songs. It includes great Harmony and Melody. Also the back ground music is truely beatiful.

I think there are a few tracks that fall short of greatness, and the album DOES feature a good amount of (presumably intentional) self-parody, but in parts, it's absolutely incredible. I tend to prefer the less aggressive tracks (Henry Lee, WTWRG, and my favourite, Lovely Creature) over the more vicious ones, but Stagger Lee is nonetheless a great song, and almost single-handedly earned the album that morally objectionable \\"parental advisory\\" warning.

David decided to go solo and ended up putting out 4 albums before turning to producing. Surrender Absolute is a great album that shows off his obvious music talent to go with his talented guitar playing. The highlights on this album are both instrumentals: Silas and Sirai as well as Attitude. The rest of the songs end up, in my opinion, to be the supporting cast of these two instrumentals. Keeping this album from getting a rating of 5 stars is the fact that none of the other songs really jump out at me. They're very strong but none seem to grab you or stick in your head hours later. Overall, however, don't let that stop you from picking up this great album - it's worth the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend?","review":"Look Who's Talking Too is a pretty bad sequel to the hit film, Look Who's Talking.

But this one is pretty good too.

Oh, wait...","review":"The first LOOK WHO'S TALKING movie wasn't much of a movie. It was a one-joke premise stretched to ninety minutes. It was only occasionally funny.But yet, we have a sequel. Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) now has a baby sister, Julie (voice by Roseanne). Same jokes, kids. Only with potty training thrown into the mix.Some inspired casting using Mel Brooks as the voice of Mr. Toilet Man and Gilbert Gottfried as a kids' gym instructor, but it's still a pitiful film.The worst part is that there's a third one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first one is the best!","review":"This sequel was really dumb it was much like the first one except now Mikey has a sister, and it also shows a scene where Mikey is talking to a toilet that talks.

However, he goes down fighting, kicking, and screaming. Mariah loses heart when he doubts that the baby she carries is his and decides to make him believe her.

The acting is decent, and the film generally looks good considering its low budget. The film is actually more loyal to the original story than most Lovecraft adaptions, though there have been signifigant changes. New characters have been added, others dropped, and the storyline has been altered and simplified. Few of the changes do much good, most are negative.The film moves very slowly towards it's conclusion, as the story is a bit thin for a feature length film. Once Wilbur and Sandra Dee get together in the first twenty minutes, the film plods along until it's time for the climactic ending. Much of the runtime is filled with a lot of 60's psychedelic effects, long dull conversations and occult mumbo jumbo.For diehard Lovecraft or AIP fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I am a long time classic horror fan, and H. P. Lovecraft is one of my favorite authors. This film was a bad adaptation of a great story and didn't come close to doing it justice.

Coupled with poor editing and bad acting the result is disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than two stars is definitely suspending my disbelief!","review":"This movie is the best adaptation of any of the Lovecraft stories. I am glad that the creators of this movie didn't put Lovecraft's name on it like so many others who try to cash in on one of horror's greatest authors.

Okay, maybe it strayed from the story a bit, by taking a nine-foot tall alien freak and turning him into Dean Stockwell, and by adding a very hot Sandra Dee, but they at least tried. This is the only instance of movie exploitation, I think, that wouldn't have cause H.P. Lovecraft to roll over in his grave. And maybe Wilbur's star-spawned twin brother was a little goofy, but I thought it had that kind of rubber-suit-monster Night Stalker charm. Overall, the movie had a kind of narcotic gloss that aided well in the suspension of disbelief. I recommend this movie highly---both to Lovecraft fans and to ordinary horror buffs. It's cool, and even if this movie did damage Sandra Dee's career, she was hot. After all, monsters, even the slimy ones from outer space, need love too.

This thing charges fast, allows for the simultaneous charging of two batteries and a light indicator lets you know when the batteries are fully charged. Now this may be a plus or a minus depending on who you talk to, but it plugs in to a wall outlet and not the USB slot on the console. I look at that as a plus as I have many near by wall outlets and like to leave my USB ports open for other possible peripheral. That said, the product comes with the cord, charging station and a spare battery for under $30. It's a great deal.**UPDATE - So after about 1 year of owning this thing and maybe using it two dozen times, it has shorted out. I'd like to lower the rating to 2 stars, simply because Microsoft has produced yet another shoddy product in my eyes.

Turner so nicely pointed out to all of you, why would you want to buy this when you could spend 1/2 the money on a regular charger, and more batteries, that don't just go in your 360 controller? I have a quick charger that charges 4 AA batteries in less then 1/2 hour. The quick charge kit takes 4 hours to do basically the same thing. But wait, I can also use my batteries in my Television Remote, or my digital camera flash. Just make sure you get one with a fan on it so the batteries don't swell up from overheating. If you want to give MS more money, get the play and charge kit, as that sort of serves a purpose. You can have a wireless and wired controller in one. It also does charge when the 360 is off, like most people don't know. You just have to have the controller plugged in when you turn off the power. You're also not limited to only using the 360.

With the price of this product I wouldn't even bother looking at generics or non-MS brands, often you get lower quality batteries with poor fitment for only a marginal savings.My only gripe is that this really should come with two batteries(for higher cost of course) but a second one is purchased easily enough for under $10 which is great considering most specialized rechargable batteries like this cost a small fortune."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more dead/dying batteries","review":"So you get an extra battery and get to charge your battery without the cord.

In my case that is not a big deal at all, but if you want to just game all the time, I could see where this could cut into your game time by like 30 seconds or longer if you don't have a back up charging.

Costa Rica is known for NOT marking streets and NOT marking forks in the road. This map is very accurate when marking all paved/unpaved roads...we did not travel any seasonal roads. We traveled successfully from the airport in San Jose to Montezuma (Nicoya Peninsula), Montezuma to Monteverde, Monteverde to Volcano Arenal and Arenal to Alajuela via the Poas Volcano. Some roads were parked unpaved but have since been paved, which was a nice (although rare)surprise. Every fork we came to was on the map, although sometimes it was hard to determine if we were at a fork in the road or if one of the options was just a long driveway. Use your guide books for city maps, as this map will not allow you to navigate cities like Alajuela."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly out of date but very good","review":"This is an excellent map for travel and became indispensable heading to Arenal and Monteverde. It folds easily, is smaller than the gigantic maps other companies make, and has a great feature of showing on the map many tourist attractions that you'd like to go to such as canopy tours or surfing. The roads are accurate but not entirely correct - there has been paving in a couple places that the map does not reflect. The whole country is on one side of the map, and there is very little wasted space on ocean - the Osa Peninsula is put on a separate cut out making flipping unnecessary.It would be nice to have slightly better understandings of speeds of travel on the roads and an updated version should be coming out shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I needed, excellent","review":"map is very good, has all of the roads necessary, unfortunately none of the roads are named but it really doesn't matter because when you get to country, there are no signs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive up to date map","review":"I've used several Costa Rica maps over the last few years and found this one to be extremely user friendly and up to date.

We rented a car for our one-week honeymoon in Costa Rica and the map provided by our rental car company was laughable. We did not rent a GPS, but used this map exclusively. We can not imagine what our trip would have been like without it. Our hotels were shown on the map and all of the sightseeing highlights we wanted to visit were on the map also. Even one of our hotel owners commented that it was a very good map. Driving in Costa Rica is a little bit of an adventure since there are very few signs and road names.

The text includes a great number of screen shots and many excercises to guide one through most of the significant functions of the software. There also seemed to be fairly few typos.

The Atomic Tommy is another mid 80's era with the underrated classic Misdemeanor. The Laurence Archer era of UFO is finely represented in this collection. Not only do you get the entire studio album, High Stakes and Dangerous Men album, you get a live collection of 70's era Chapman and 90's era Archer. What would have been nice, and warrant 5 stars for this release, is the inclusion of the entire Lights Out in Tokyo live album featuring Archer.

The dialogues between Donald Pleasance and Francoise Dorleac are primitive. And the two gangsters behave like amateurs. \\"Repulsion\\" is a fantastic movie and Catherine Deneuve is just outstanding.One star because I have to give something.

Buy it... join the Straight Spouse Network... take charge of your life again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offers no hope","review":"This book is so negative. The main message is that the marriage is doomed and that the straight spouse has to suffer while a dysfunctional bi/gay partner makes up his/her mind about where he wants to go. It also offers all sorts of solutions involving sex arrangements with spouses and gay partners - an anathema to most straight spouses. The book convinced me that I must leave my straight wife, because there was no way I could save my marriage. I went as far as putting our house up for sale and making financial arrangements. Then I realized the book was wrong. Over the years I had lost my ability to think with my heart. I had become depressed and used gay sex for comfort. I am trying to save my marriage, no thanks to the book. The book is useful to those couples who maybe didn't have real love there in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed","review":"As a friend, I know that Jennifer left a LOT out of her book. Like, the fact that their marriage broke up before her husband came out of the closet. She never mentions the Mormon Church, yet they were very active in it; her husband decided to leave the Church, and that was when they separated. While they were separated, they BOTH started dating. Then, her ex admitted that he was dating a man.I'm very disappointed, Jenni, in a book that calls itself \\"brutally honest\\". What else did you leave out?!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this!","review":"Sheralyn Pratt is a refreshing new LDS fiction writer, and has great promise!

The major difference between this movie and gum; There's a brief moment where I enjoy the chewing gum.I first watched \\"Lisa and the Devil\\" and it was your typical B Movie from the 70's. I then watched \\"The House of Exorcism\\", which is pretty much \\"Lisa and the Devil\\", with deleted scenes thrown in to make it a tale of exorcism as a post-thought. If you're looking for a thriller that somehow missed MST3K's radar, you're in the right place. I'm giving this movie two-stars, because watching Telly Savalas offer a grown woman a lollipop is one of the creepiest things to come out of the 70's (aside from Pasolini)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Historians Need This Book!","review":"I have been an avid genealogist and family historian for almost twenty years, and this book added a whole new dimension to my favorite hobby.

I was looking for creativity and new layout ideas and this book did not have it. The layouts in this book were extremly plain, unattractive, and does not attract the eye. If you are an experienced genealogist or scrapbooker, you will be disappointed. Lame info is given: 'include personal stories' and 'pictures of family members with names and relations to you' and 'album should have a sturdy binding'. Well, duh. Then this book doesn't even give creative ideas. If I could give this book less than one star, I would. If you like plain layouts and want an unattractive album, this is for you I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed by this book.

Bud Phillips really grew to love the area and has truly captured so much history, the good and the bad and the sometimes funny, and color of the region. It (the book) may not interest someone from another area but the thing to remember is every area has a colorful history like Bristol, and after reading this book someone may want to know the history of their area, maybe in the process even spawning some new researchers and authors.

The film is slow and lumbering and it's missing all of the charm of the television series. Most of the characters you've grown to love are merely wall paper in the movie. They are replaced with a new group of Joes that are completely flat and hokey. The new Cobra characters are just as lifeless and poorly conceived. The sense of humor and cleverness that colored the original TV series is also missing. The positives, and I can think of only one: The background music is much richer in the movie than in the TV series. So that is pretty good. But if you're not a Joe fanatic, take a pass on this movie.

Snakes Don't Work For Free.","review":"This movie is synonymous with excellence to anyone who was a fan of the cartoon and toy. If you never liked it, you just won't get Cobra Commander's incessant whining, the odd sexual tension between Falcon and Jynx, the wisecrackings of Tunnel Rat, the megalomaniacal ravings of Serpentor, the patriotic 'tude of Sergeant Slaughter, and the classic melodious ramblings of Roadblock. This movie really is about the underlying battle of good vs. evil, pertinent more today because of the terrorist threats that abound in our own world. The score is amazing, and the plot is actually quite complex. (I mean, the writers of this movie predicted the oncoming threat of mass biological/chemical warfare, the importance of satellites in today's information age, and the first real proponents against cloning DNA (Serpentor anyone?)) I recommend this movie strongly. It was light years ahead of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"This movie does what Transformers - The Movie did. It takes a good series with a lot of characters, and extends it to nearly two hours. In the process, it allows access to many MORE characters at the same time, a more involved plot, a larger geographic scale, some history, and an overall mature feel. There were personal tragedies, character flaws, and even a court martial. I enjoyed this movie because it took a familiar series and said \\"ok, what if we want to make something just a LITTLE more serious?\\" For those who are worried by this review, also be assured that their are MANY homages to the familiar series, that will satisfy even the most seasoned viewer (like me.) Oh, and the producers did not shirk on the all-star voices, either. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"G.I.

Joe was at its best before they got into all that stuff about Serpentor and Cobra-La. While this movie does bring back old memories of playing with the Hasbro toys, the plot is somewhat lacking. I would much rather have seen no-name actors as the voices of the characters. Don Johnson--come on!!! Burgess Meredith was cool, but the movie seems to rely on big name talent instead of a good script."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cobra La-La-La-La-LAME!!!\\"","review":"You have gotta be kidding, this movie utterly sucks. As every Joe-Head knows, G.I. Joe jumped the shark upon the inclusion of Serpentor, and this \\"movie\\" aired long after that, when the entire property was in its final death throes. It was supposed to be released in theaters but after Transformers: The Movie bombed at the box office (it staged a posthumous comeback on video years later) Hasbro decided to yank the theatrical release and relegated it to TV, which was more than it deserved.

This put Alex Ross on the map.","review":"During the summer of 1997 I was walking through my comic shop looking at all the comics that came out that day, and my eyes caught a glimps of Kingdom Come #1. I couldn't believe how amazing the artwork was on this book and how it looked so real. I purchased it and instantly read it once I got home. Up to that point nothing had thrilled me as much as that story had (except for Knightfall, Reign of the Supermen).As the years have gone by people still talk about this story and hold it on a pedistal all by itself. Kingdom Come will be remembered and enjoyed by many generations to come. If you haven't read it get a copy now. The absolute Edition came out last month and comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great masterpiece","review":"The story sets in the future where Superman has been betrayed by the people he protected, Wonder Woman outcast by the Amazon, the Green Lantern looks like a tortise and have lost touch with Earth, Batman is old and in need machine support. Earth is filled with a new breed of super heros causing chaos to the world.It is an interesting protray of the future, which seems to shine on the negative aspect of the human behaviour.The story is not the only thing that I enjoyed while reading. I am also impressed with the art work and wonderful use of colors. The figures look realistic and alive. The only flip side of this is the use of water colors, no matter how you try, it always give a softer feeling, therefore it is difficult to give a strong impact to the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it! Buy it!","review":"I have not much to say about this book, that has not already been said. The story is very good, but the best part are the visuals. Alex Ross' paintings are brilliant, and make the art of my other comic books (including Batman: The Killing Joke and Todd McFarlane's work) look very poor compared to this one. It simply is one of the best comic-books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not usually a DC guy. This was sweet!","review":"I love Marvel. It is the best. No better. This is an awesome comic!!!! I bought it because of Mark Waid. I was reading Irredeemable and wanted to branch out to his other works. This was what I tried, and I'm happy I did. An aging Justice League must find a way to teach a new generation not to abuse their power. More, it is a story about what happens to a world where people let super hero's become irresponsible, and a justice system that does not bend to the spirit of the Law, only the letter. A world where, somehow, superman loses in court!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME G-NOVEL - GOT ME BACK INTO DC COMICS!","review":"If you love Elseworld plots, tons of characters new and old, end of the world stories, Justice League, and the Superman vs Captain Marvel battle, this novel is one of the finest ever written. Each page is a work of art, the story is geared towards older readers, set in a near future anti-utopian world. I was pretty much done with comics after college, so I shifted to graphic novels thanks to Miller's Dark Knight Returns, read tons of G-Novels, and then started to put them down for good. Picked up Kingdom Come and now I'm back in love with DC...this is one of my top G-Novels of all times! Thanks and keep dreaming. John Dae"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's the end of the world as we know it..........\\"","review":"An absolutely fatastic read. Mark Waid's story, even if it is about a superhuman conflict, has some very interesting applications to today's world. Alex Ross' artwork could hardly be better. And the parralels to the book of Revelation are sufficently eerie. Bottom Line:If you have ever ead a comic, read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This graphic novel is, quite simply, one of the best I've ever read and undoubtedly one of the best ever made. Stunning artwork and a gripping story truly make this graphic novel a must read. I could try to explain the story, but I would be doing an injustice to the great depth of Kingdom Come. Buy it if you're a fan of anything DC, and especially if you're a fan of Alex Ross and I guarantee you will not be disappointed with your decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Waid's Kingdom Come","review":"This is certainly one of the best graphic novels I have ever read.

I have nothing but good things to say about this comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own","review":"This is the best graphic novel ever. The art is amazing. I became an instant fan of Alex Ross.

The story of all the heroes' alternate futures is amazing. I loved it! I would recommend it to anyone who liked comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"format issues","review":"1st off this is a very good if not great graphic novel. It is the kindle format that is faulty. I downloaded a sample. All they did is just copy the pages. While this might work for regular books (although people with seeing problems might not agree) it doesn't for graphic novels. Since there is no zoom facility you can't focus in on the panels or smaller text. Some of the text in the 1st part of this book are so small you cannot read it. It also doesn't have the panel by panel format as I have seen used in some graphic novels. Kindle needs to use the same format as Graphicly or the one included on the Kindle Fire (I haven't used it so I can't really confirm this) for all graphic novels as well as comics. Until then it is better to get a hard copy. This is also true of any book with pages of maps or graphs. A really good example is the format used for the Economist. It has both a zoom feature and a optional article feature. I hope the publishers pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"Kingdom Come disappointed me to no end. The characterization is bland, the artwork is cramped, and the plot is weak weak WEAK. You'd expect a story about Armageddon to have some more emotional weight to it, but all we get are vague philosophical homilies about humans and superheroes and who should decide the future or something. I'm having a hard time remembering exactly what the point of this story was.If you want a story that doesn't put you to sleep, read Watchmen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story had me at a total loss","review":"Reading other reviews, it seems like I'm the exception for not liking this story. When I began to read this story, I saw immediately how different the comic art was compared to other books I've read. I did not like the realness of the artwork, but I still decided to give it a chance. From the very beginning, there was alot of biblical context in this story and that was also a turn off for me. 40 pages in, I still had no idea what was going on because I had trouble identifying the characters because of the realistic artwork. Enough was enough for me because I couldn't follow this story anymore. I'm not saying that I didn't like Kingdom Come, but it was very difficult for me to follow who was who and what exactly was going on. I know this was supposed to be in the DC Universe future, but maybe because of the other stories I'm currently reading, this one made no sense. Overall, I would not try to read this story again until I got some more DC knowledge under my belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read!","review":"This is a rather good product. The detail of the painting on each panel can def still be viewed on the kindle. Also the smart panel choices are really clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome graphic novel","review":"I'm not a comic book reader per se, but I enjoyed this one. It was recommended by a co-worker and I'm glad I read it. I love the artwork and the dramatic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kingdom Boredom","review":"I have to say that the only thing I like about this book is the cool green cover. This book is really boring and kind of hard to follow. I bought this book because a lot of the reviews say it's great, but it is not. A lot of them say the art is great, but it is horrible, never seen a superman graphic novel look like this, reminds me of the art from the book \\"The Polar Express\\" when I was a little kid. I wouldn't recommend buying this, save your money and check it out at the library and see how bad it is yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic books are awful on the kindle app","review":"I purchased this to see how comic books read on the kindle app for my asus tablet and the experience is terrible, I couldn't pinch to zoom and the predetermined zooms for the word balloons didn't include much of the art, also the app didn't allow for screen rotation. All in all very counterintuitive, its a shame too because the prices for some of these trades are very fair.

The artwork is wonderful and the story idea that superheroes' values have changed over time with those of society is very thought-provoking.I'd highly recommend this one, especially for someone who maybe isn't normally into comix."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine piece of comic art","review":"For one, it must be said upfront that Alex Ross is an incredible artist. Every single page in this book begs to be looked at in detail. The way this man plays with shadows and lighting coupled with the way that he transforms characters into mature versions of themselves and makes them into people that look like people you see pass you by in the street every day is just astounding.The story is excellent, depicting a world that is near self destruction because of the balance between humans, superheroes and meta-humans. I don't want to talk too much about the story for fear of ruining it but it's definitely worth a read, as Mark Waid has managed to create a storyline that is entertaining not only to the comic book junkies and purists but to your everyday casual reader. Paired with Alex Ross's artwork, the story becomes a frightening tale of morality that bears an uncanny resemblance to our less fantastical times in more ways than one.Strongly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A common misconception...","review":"...seems to be that Kingdom Come was the brainchild of Mark Waid when, in fact, it's Alex Ross's baby. In fact, Mark Waid was hired as scripter only after James Robinson declined. The basic plot was his and all the new characters seen were conceived and designed by him. Of course, this is completely understandable since the credits do not even list Alex Ross as co-plotter and list Mark Waid first, for reasons I can't fathom. Anyway, just thought I'd try and clear up this misconception.Oh, about the book, I agree that it's a visually stunning piece of work that's perhaps a notch above Ross's previous major work, Marvels, but I can't say I'm the biggest fan of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"what would happen if Superman abandoned Earth","review":"the title explains it all. Kingdom Come is a story about what would happen to Earth if Superman had abandoned it. the results were not pretty. Following through the story by the witness who recieved his visions from the dying Sandman he is taking The Spector to the time of Judgement. In the mean time we see the return of the JLA, Batmans unlikely alliance, and War amongst the Metahumans.this is a powerful tale. Very dark and brooding, with an allstar cast of DC characters. Each playing a key role in this tale.This is a tale worth owning. I first read this and vowed to buy it. It is truely worth owning one way or another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on the kindle","review":"Don't be fooled by the title (Kindle Edition). It doesn't work on the regular Kindle- nor would it open in Kindle for PC. I'm sure it's a good comic, but wouldn't know as I can't read it. Hopefully Amazon will rectify this problem soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Plot, No Characters","review":"Maybe I'm the wrong audience for this book. I consider myself not a fan of comics, after all, but a fan of literature in whatever form it presents itself. Watchmen? Dark Knight Returns? Both brilliant stories, drawn with style, and told in a way that welcomes both the fanboy and the neophyte. Kingdom Come, however? Blech. Though its artwork is fantastic, beyond all reproach, its story boils down ultimately to a superhero name-dropper's wet dream, a procession of DC cameos and self-references. I felt like an idiot every time a Darkseid got mentioned, a Spectre got revealed, a John Constantine fluttered by without an explanation. This book might be heaven for the Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons. To the casual reader, though, Norman McKay seems to be merely preaching to the choir."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It","review":"I thought Kindom Come was the best comic story that I have read to date.

If you're looking for a good read to pass the time, I'd say look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Stuff Man","review":"As a Christian, I just don't relish in the fact that they used the book of Revelation for a basis for this story. I mean it's a great story and all. But they did not need that to make it a good one. I guess it pressed a nerve or two, and for that it loses a star. That aside,absolutely everything else is top-star, two-thumbs up quality. Not to mention it is one HUGE graphic novel.Alex Ross is the man. I repeat THE MAN. His art is fantastic. Definately pick it up. Maybe not a must have, but just for the art alone I think it is worth it. Once again, they really didn't need Revelation for this novel, but everything else makes it definately worth it. Batman as always is great. Superman...well, is Superman as always. The love triangle with him and Wonder Woman Played real well and...e'hem...the baby. Nuff said. Pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good","review":"Beautiful art but the story and particularly the dialogue are weak. Alan Moore set the benchmark for this kind of thing years ago and Kingdom Come does not measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible story and artwork","review":"I love Alex Ross' artwork. It is the reason I decided to read this book. The story is incredible, with the grand battle of ideals as well as heroes. A lot of reviews of this book say you need to be real familiar with the DC universe, but I disagree. While I had seen a few tv shows and cartoons, I never read any comics. I knew only a basic idea of the major characters and their powers, and the story was perfectly clear to me. I think what the people who say you need to know the characters well to understand this book see is that there seems to be a lot of inside details that you will appreciate if you know the DC world well, but they are mostly not crucial to appreciating the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for fans or Alex Ross, Superman and epic stories","review":"Amazing life-like artwork - it's really worth to read this one just because of the art. I'm not going to review it, because if you already know Alex Ross's style, you don't need further recommendations, and if you don't - well, you don't know what you're missing out.The story is very interesting too, and as this is an Elseworlds tale, and as such not an actual end to the DC universe, but only a possible ending, so the writers were free to have established characters die or otherwise change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for those who haven't read a comic in years","review":"This graphic novel is possibly the best I've read. The storyline is fantastic and brings up ideas about super heroes we never thought about as kids, or adults, for that matter. Best of all there is great interplay between characters, showing that not everyone, even superheroes, would see things the same way. There is plenty of humor and the dialogue seems realistic. There's plenty of little details for hardcore comics fans too. The illustration, which is as much painted as drawn, is amazing--Alex Ross created a masterpiece. I'd recommend this to anyone with any interest or experience with DC comics at any time in there life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comics ever","review":"If you are a fan of heroes then you'll like this book. The best part was the interaction between the heroes. They spoke to each other like any of us would to a lifelong friend. They seemed almost real rather than characters on a page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Cultural Cross-Section","review":"The beauty of this book is how the author captures not only the aspects of top-tier professional drifting, but also how the sport has maintained a close connection to the people that love it. Unlike most forms of motorsport drifting is still accessible on a spectator level and to those who want to participate. Alvendia captures these many facets of drifting in one impressive package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"I guess i was impress or going off of what other people were saying about how great this book was. I was expecting in detail how to drift, what i needed to do, and so forth. But it wasnt, it was more or less the history of drifting and how it came from Japan to America as the New car craze. It has how to drift, but very limited. This book should not be confused with a How To. book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying again!","review":"I first received this some years ago as a gift.I have had many compliments on it.It is also something that I can deal withmyself. I do not like most perfumes orcologne. It's just the right smell and itwill last all day with a couple doses.This is my 4th batch and you can't findit in most places. Of course you canfind it here.

It has also made me realize that I have been beaten down by clients over the years, and now am just spitting out whatever they say, and yet at the same time am losing business.Mr. Aldrich has reminded me to lead. He has also given me the specifics to lead effectively. I am enjoying talking to perspectives for the first time in years. I care about what my shop is producing again. That is why I gave the book five stars.I should probably mention that my brother who teaches computer game design is also contemplating using this as the primary textbook in his class."},{"rating":"2","title":"what it takes","review":"This book is really a case study of creating developing and working through the giant project of making a true simulation game where the gamer can be in control of who things go.

As an elearning developer, I wanted general information on the art of creating simulations. After reading the introduction, I thought that I would get this general information interspersed with examples from the development of Virtual Leader. What followed was the story Aldrich's development experience, leaving the creation of additional simulations as an exercise for the reader. As much of the book was dedicated to leadership content that would find its way into Virtual Leader as was dedicated to information on simulations. Not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!!","review":"I realli like this CD.

Sad to discover this comeback effort isn't that good. It is noted somewhere that 'Second Bite' is supposed to be the UK progressive trio's never-released title to their self-titled and 'It'll All Work Out in Boomland' albums (see my reviews of both). Nonetheless, there are several re-workings of previously released songs like \\"Questions And Answers\\", \\"Careful Sam\\" and \\"Mistrel\\" along with some unreleased material. For completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to get a smile...","review":"We received this book as a baby gift from a thoughtful friend. We started reading it at bedtime (and now anytime) to our newborn and she just loves it. It is guaranteed to get a big smile from her. She's 6 months old now and gets a story or two every night before bed. Who's Peeking is definitely one of her favorites. She loves playing Peekaboo, so this book is great fun. The colorful pictures and simple text are great for little babies who don't have the patience for longer books. Yes, her little hands can't open the pages yet, but she's at a stage where she doesn't mind if Mommy or Daddy does all the work. We plan to give this as a gift to a friend's new baby.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"Very cute book, but one of the pages fell apart and now it doesn't work properly.

My only \\"complaint\\" is that she piqued my interest so many times, I kept getting distracted, only to find myself delving deeper into DMX's many features and capabilities. Needless to say, I certainly did not manage to finish in the allotted 15 hours! I sure wish some of the more advanced tutorials were as effectively written and stayed on-topic as well as this one did. A small but very helpful feature was her including a PDF version of the book on the CD. How much more comfortable it was not to have to juggle a book while working! This feature should be a STANDARD.

I refuse to give credit to this man for \\"gracefully failing.\\" If he were truly so civicly minded, I must ask, why has he not donated a vast majority of his fortune to charity? Why did he spend his career in publishing, and not in the non-profit area? He's the editor of a magazine on charity, for god's sake. Is there any more useless postion in the world?

What is this, 1983? You would think that a game on the PS2 would allow you to control the movement of the pitch.Batting is boring, the batter can't even move around in the batter's box!

The mouse works with Windows 7. This mouse is intended for old laptops that come with the PCIM slot. Most new laptops don't have this feature. I have a Lenovo R 500 that has the slot. It charges well and seems to hold the charge. The Bluetooth connects quickly and the mouse sleeps after 10 minutes to save power. I got this mouse through Amazon for 20 dollars including shipping. Unlike most newer mice you must use a mouse pad for smooth operation.After having this mouse for a extended period I have for the most part stopped using it. I purchased a Microsoft Arch and it is far superior to this product. It is not Bluetooth but comes with micro receiver. Stay away from this product and avoid its aged abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work. Fails to remain paired.","review":"When you buy from Tiger Direct, if you find the item just doesn't work with your computer (but may work with some other computer that you don't have), then you are stuck. Unless the manufacturer agrees that the item you bought is defective (meaning it doesn't work at all for anyone), no refund.So I suggest not buying this mouse from Tiger Direct. As you can see from the feedback, for many people it just doesn't work. It doesn't mean it is defective necessarily, because perhaps it works with some computers. But Dell laptops seem to have an especially hard time remaining paired with it, making it useless to me. Badly designed not to work more generally, and a bad seller for not accepting returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"Awesome idea, just a bad interpretation of it. Tracking precision was TERRIBLE. I tried it on a few different Dell Latitude notebooks, all with the same result. Didn't matter if a mouse pad was used, or just a table top. It was OK (barely) just with clicking on hyperlinks, closing apps, etc. But if you want to highlight anything or get better than 1/8\\" accuracy forget it - you'll pull your hair out trying. I wish I could return it... but it was only twenty bucks. Its now sitting in my drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a useful item!","review":"After looking around for a mouse to go with my laptop (my wrists were hurting with using the trackpad too much), I decided to try a mogo. I don't like cords or the idea of carrying around extra junk, so the idea that it was stored in the pc slot was great for me. Now the thing is pretty expensive new, but I bought a used one with a lower battery life for cheaper from amazon to give it a try. I am sure the thing took a lot of abuse, but man, it is still a very good item. Ok, so the battery charge won't hold for more than, oh, 2-3 hours for me, but it was a used one in the first place so I can hardly dock it much for that. What I really like is that the design makes me hold my wrist up properly, rather than being lazy and resting it on the mouse, so I really notice less wrist strain with it. The one thing I don't like is that with the triangle type design I can see the laser underneath sometimes, and I'm not sure that's great for the eyes, but really that's just a small detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was GIVEN one and I want my money back","review":"I got one of these for speaking at a convention and I hate it rather incredibly. It doesn't hold a charge for squat. It doesn't find the bluetooth adapter half the time. The software it comes with is screamingly unfriendly. The manual is poorly written. The utter lack of spontaneity in being able to just turn on your laptop and start going is frustrating. The lack of a scroll wheel (all it would take is a touch strip in the center) is bewildering. And a regular old USB mouse ALWAYS works.$60.00 for this thing? Anyone who pays anything for this item, deserves to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mojo Cool","review":"I really like this.

The unique name attracted me and then the picture - how can that work? I asked myself. I read more about it, and I decided to see for myself. When you first use it, it will be awkward, especially if you use it on a less than ideal surface. But when used in most places, and after you get used to it, it can easily replace your primary. It is so light weight and accurate, and surprisingly controllable, that it is more pleasant to use than a normal mouse. A normal mouse seems cumbersome and not that more ergonomic after using this mouse. The fact that you never need to charge is ingenious."},{"rating":"1","title":"MoGo Mouse - didn't deliver...","review":"I'm a bit disappointed with this BlueTooth wireless PCMCIA mouse as the cursor is not steady and quite jittery when I use it.

Installation was easy, and tracking performance is great on all surfaces I've used it on. I travel for work and often have to work remotely, and the mouse is always conveniently within my reach.

The Bluetooth MoGo mouse fits perfectly in the PCI slot for your laptops (well, unless you don't have one).

The computer perfectly syncs with bluetooth and responds well with little to no lag. It's not as exact or sensitive as a laser mouse, but it's still good.Overall, I like the product and my brother likes it more, since it's his now. I'd recommend it for someone using it for laptop uses. It's more for navigation then gaming and photoshop, so don't expect stellar performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to see it to believe it!","review":"I just purchased a MoGo mouse, and I'm *amazed* at how usable it is. I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is. The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of \\"scroll-wheel\\" technology. That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse.That said, there are always trade-offs, but in this case that's the only one.

It's not in any sense groundbreaking, it doesn't offer a novel view point, and it doesn't develop the characters to any great degree. Everything's spelled out in captions, thought balloons, and comic-book dialog, with little subtext.

Full Of It falls into this final category. While the movie does have it's moments of clever fun, the whole thing is ruined by a young and talented actor (Pinkston) who injects way too much slapstickiness into his role.

The camera angels give you limited viewing and moving Alyssa around is jolty and a bit out of control. The boss fights are either too easy or too hard and there wasn't a challenging puzzle, and did I mention the game takes about 3 hours to win? I would have enjoyed this game about 4 years ago before I knew what an adventure game could really be like. Coming from Fatal Frame to this is a joke, and Beyond Good and Evil isn't scary but at least it's fun and Primal really stretches you for figuring out environmental puzzels and you care about the hero's.

It is fun if you are planning on breaking your PS2, because this game will make you do just that. The game is impossible to beat and you can't take five steps before you hear the creepy music, which means a monster is nearby and is looking for you. amd when they are gone you will see them disappear through a blue portal that came out of nowhere.Though the game is fun, rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love You Phillip Morris","review":"Great read, this intriguing story unfolds in a clever way.

His second weakness is that he became personally involved in the case and focused a good part of the book on himself, rather than on the central story.For those interested in this case, you might want to visit [the ruby mccollum web site]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Bad plastic.

Three guys making the motions whilst a CD is playing in the background is hardly fair to fans who appreciate real music played on real instruments by real people. I know a lot of fans will jump on me hard for this but I consider it an abomination for an artist who has yet been spoiled by the trappings of the plastic pop world to produce such an effort. I only hope it was an oversight and will never happen again. Over the video release the DVD does have the added optional feature of Vai's commentry over the tracks which is sometimes insightful, but overall you are really not getting more than the CD (which, by the way, is great)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good God.....He's only making a video","review":"No its not a live performance...but looking at most of these reviews would make you think Steve Via is the only musician on the planet that shouldnt be able to do a video!!..Remember, he was in whitesnake, and david lee roth, and alcatraz..its not like he's never been on the mtv production bandwagon...so give him a break...its a good dvd that wasnt expensive and gives you a glimps into his thought prosess while making a music production...what the [heck] more do you want.,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Toy","review":"This was a nice toy for my nephew.

THE COMIC STRIPS WERE VERY DISTRACTING AND THE STORYLINE WEAK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is just an awful effort. I have enjoyed some of Picoult's other books so I automatically bought this one. After reading 100 pages, I thought the book was so terrible I decided to look at these reviews to see if it was just me. The story line is not credible, and there is not one believable character -- in fact I found them all so annoying and narcissistic that I didn't want anyone to have a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed...","review":"I've read two other books by the author, My Sister's Keeper (utterly fabulous) and The Pact (Amazing)... so I was thrilled to spot this one in the library. In my humble opinion, it is not nearly as good as the two I've read by her. Some parts just drug on and on and I found myself skipping pages of it or skimming through parts because they were just so boring and I didn't have to do that with either one of the other titles. To me the story line was just too confusing and like she was trying to cram like 5 different life stories into one novel and it was just... too much. And very few of the characters were people you became interested in.. they were all just static characters for me.. trixie was the only interesting one. I'll read others by her but this one is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but..","review":"I love Jodi Picoult and I loved this book. My mother gave it to me (\\"it's more for younger people\\") and it pulled at my heart strings, made me cry, and, most importantly, it made me feel.I wasn't real into the comics, but aside from that, I thought it was all great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, just not great.","review":"I should say this is the first book by this offer I've read. I liked the concept of the story, following along Dantes Inferno, and for the most part it was a good read. I disagree with some of the other people that said it was unbelievable - I think that was the point of the story. How far do we go to believe and believe in the people we love? And she's incredibly creative and descriptive, which was good at the beginning, but then it started to get a little ridiculous. There were some parts that were just plain overly poetic trying to describe a simple task or feeling. The characters were also quite reflective, which bogged down the pace of the story. I found myself skipping paragraphs sometimes, especially at the end, because I just wanted to get back to the story. But otherwise, it was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give her a couple of points for trying something different...","review":"I tend to enjoy Picoult's novels--they're usually an effortless read, an interesting premise, kind of like a nice light custard. This one is different, much darker and not very original in terms of basic plot. It made for a boring read. However, I did appreciate her building upon the comic book idea, a distinctly masculine element (although the \\"hidden message\\" was hokey), and incorporating Dante's circles of hell into the scheme of her story. The latter was food for thought--is there a hierarchy of sin?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Enjoyable","review":"First off I must say, I love the cover! Isn't it intriguing? Well the book does not let you down either! I finished this book in 3 days. It was fast paced and had its expected ups and downs that we all love in our books. However I only gave it a 4 because two thirds of the way through and the whole Alaska thing kinda bogged it down a bit. I didn't really find that situation to be very beleivable considering she is only 14 years old. But overall a good easy read and I would reccommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far out","review":"I have enjoyed Jodi Picoult's other books that I have read, but this one was too odd for me. I didn't like trying to figure out what was going on in the beginning. Just not enjoyable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I've read most of Jodi Picoult's books and have enjoyed them thoroughly but this one really missed the mark. I found the 3 members of this family so dreadful that I had no sympathy for any of them. Trixie was so contrived and I found her whole situation unbeleivable and found that I was actually sympathizing with Jason! Then this wretched family goes and murders him! Neither Trixie, Laura nor Daniel had ANY redeeming characteristics. Life in this family would truly be hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I had bought this book for a future vacation because I generally really like Picoult's books. During a bout of flu, I gave in and started to read it. It's too full of gimmicks, the research for background is too obvious and takes over the story (why Alaska?).The Dante references are much too heavy-handed - we're not complete idiots. I kept waiting for it all to be pulled together but it never happened. I had the definite feeling that Picoult has become bored with what she's doing and tried to make it more interesting, perhaps not for the readers, but for herself. It didn't work for me - I hope it did for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"I couldn't finish it. Full of tired cliches and two-dimensional characters, worn scenarios, and even that notorious parent-freak-out myth, the \\"rainbow party\\" -- an urban legend so thoroughly debunked that it's mentioned in the Museum of Hoaxes. Picoult clearly doesn't have a foot in reality and I'm sorry I wasted my money on this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and muddled","review":"Not impressed by this effort from Picoult, who tackles quite a few topics against the theme of Dante's Inferno. When 14-year-old Trixie Stone is allegedly raped by a popular school athlete, the Stone family crumbles. Dad has a dark secret in his past, mum is having an affair with a questionable sort and Trixie is a cutter, going so far as to engage in the destructive behavior even at school when her stresses seem insurmountable. Making matters worse for the family, the alleged rapist ends up dead and naturally eyes turn toward the Stones.Every subplot is nicely tied up by the end of the book but the journey from here to there seems labored by the weight of tying events to Dante's Inferno. The resolution was telegraphed early on so the truth of what happened to Jason is no surprise. Picoult is a fine storyteller but this one did not appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like alot of other reviewers of this book, I've read everything Jodi Picoult has written. I absolutely loved The Pact, My Sister's Keeper, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, and Second Glance. I've hated Perfect Match, Picture Perfect, Vanishing Acts, and now this, The Tenth Circle. Okay, maybe hate is too strong a word for this one. The first two thirds were well-written and made sense (for the most part.) The last third was a complete mess. I really wish Jodi would stop the gimmicks, like going to Alaska (why???) and just tell the damn story. By the end I honestly didn't care what happened, I just wanted it to be over. It was too convoluted and over-the-top. It's too bad, but I think quality has been sacrificed for quantity. Maybe it's not possible to write great books if you're cranking them out once a year. I don't know. It's a shame, because some of her books are so great. But this one... if you're going to read it, check it out from the library, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex, a good read, but a little trendy","review":"I had a hard time putting the book down. I think Picoult's work is wonderful and this was a good read. My favorite of hers remains My Sister's Keeper.10th Circle brought a lot of complex issues into play, however, I think it handled SOME (not all) of them either a little too dramatically or casually. I felt that the drugs and the on-going character lies were too far over the top to be totally believable. A few plot twists were a little hard to swallow.Overall, a good read, but nowhere near what My Sister's Keeper is."},{"rating":"1","title":"a family of sociopaths","review":"Are readers meant to sympathize with this family of sociopaths who feel justified in saying or doing anything in the name of family, love, or personal freedom? Picoult's characters' sloppy morals are as bad as her own sloppy grammer. Amusingly, after a discussion of the French subjunctive early in the book, she fails to use the subjunctive case herself throughout the book (i.e. \\"she wished she was\\" rather than \\"she wished she were\\"). Readers who like rigorous thinking will not care for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a disclaimer","review":"The publisher should state that this is a novel for adolescents. As a Dante scholar, I thought that either the content or form of this work would benefit from the work of the master. However, the prose is so pedestrian and the content so boring that I gave up on about page 60.What's all the hoopla about--marketing skills?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I didn't like. It seemed far fetched and strained. How a young, very protected kid could navigate and survive in the Alaskan wilderness was too much of a stretch. I also didn't think the comics added anything to the book. I think this must have been a 'filler' book - something put together when the author had no good ideas going. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again brilliant from Jodi Picoult","review":"Jodi Picoults ability to intertwine different worlds and different lives never ceases to amaze me... Thought provoking, conscious examining and on your toes throughout - another brilliant journey"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT author's best work","review":"I love Jodi Picoult, but if this were the first book I'd read by her, I'd never read another. The main character's actions were not believable.To make matters worse, the \\"mystery\\" was so transparent that a beginning reader could guess the end. This book does not come near the quality of Jodi Picoult's other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"the tenth circle by jodi picoult","review":"This book, like everything I've read by Picoult, does not disappoint. I love her style of writing. Very good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tenth Circle rates Dante's Inferno","review":"The Tenth Circle is a deliberately manipulative story meant to play on the reader's emotions. The blurred genre text of graphic novel and primary plot doesn't play well and causes the primary plot to feel stilted and flat. The implausible Alaskan connection of the end doesn't ring true and is so far beyond my willing suspension of disbelief that I ended up hating the entire story. It is the worst book I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Had this not been our monthly book club selection, I never would have bothered to finish The Tenth Circle. Picoult's usage of Dante's Inferno (an excellent read) and comic book illustrations provide hope for a unique tale of a teenage girl, her family, and their personal journey of hell on earth. Instead, we are left with a predictable plot, an abundance of cliches, and a series of characters that elicit no sympathy from the reader. While Picoult's writing style contains enough momentum to carry a reader through, I still found myself sighing with relief when this one came to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Bewildering","review":"While I usually enjoy Jodi Picoult's books, this one I didn't get. There was something mystical about it... something not quite properly believable. Now, others of her books also bear a sense of unreality, and yet I was able to love them (the one with the Lia... I forget the title... is a great example), but this one somehow missed artfulness and fell into wispiness. It reminded me on some level of the end of Tess of the D'Urbervilles in, its attempt to be impressive, to be tragic, to be significant. Maybe Ms. Picoult had to finish it for a deadline? But as she did so, her heart wasn't in it; her audience moreso endures it to the end rather than joining her in a cathartic finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I really didn't love this one for some reason. I kind of found myself just kind of drifting in and out of this story. Usually I find her books to be page turners but for some reason this one I struggled to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Characters","review":"I have read two books by Jodi Picoult, The Tenth Circle and Nineteen Minutes, and I don't plan to read any more of them. In both books, the characters seem exaggerated to the point of being caricatures. They're just not believable as real people. Also, in both books, there is a plot twist at the end which I found completely out-of-character and unrealistic, with very little explanation given by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Jodi Picoult, but not this book!!","review":"I began reading this and called a few friends to recommend it. It started out great. Picoult did a great job of introducing us to the characters. I couldn't put the book down for the first half. Once I got close to the end I couldn't believe how twisted and boring it got. I'm still not really sure what happened!! It was almost as if Picoult had to rush to get the book to the publisher so she just threw something together. I've never been disappointed with her until this book came along. Usually after I read her books it takes me a week or two before I stop thinking about the book that I just read. This book was very forgettable. I've heard great things about Nineteen Minutes but this book was so bad that I'm not sure I want to waste anytime trying it out.Jodi Picoult is a great author, but I highly recommend skipping this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it. Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Ms. Picoult's other novels.","review":"I have read several of Jodi Picoult's novels and this is certainly not as good as some of her others. At first the story line was interesting and held my attention however the last 1/3 of the book was predictable and drawn out. I will say however, that the inclusion and description of native Alaskan culture is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a struggle to finish","review":"I was not impressed with this book. I just didn't believe in the characters, wasn't invested in the characters... I would not recommend it to a friend. I only have so much time to read, this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book","review":"I like most of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was the worse one I have ever read. The story line was ridiculous and unbelievable. The main character in the book, Trixie, is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this. They go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions. The drawings in the book were distracting and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I was so excited at having another Jodi Picoult book to read but, Boy! was I disappointed. It's hard to believe that the same person who wrote such wonderful other books wrote The Tenth Circle. Disjointed, strange, confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizaar!","review":"I'm a huge Jodi Picoult fan, believe she is a genious writer with a knack for captivating a reader from page one to the end. However, this book was simply too bizaar for me. I found the comic page interruptions to be distracting, actually taking away from the story rather than enhancing it. This was the only book by this magnificent author that I felt compelled to toss before finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great...","review":"I enjoyed this only because Picoult wrote it and I like her writing style. Other than that, it's just a book...another story. I didn't find her normal \\"shock\\" like her other books...and I really waited for it! She has wrote other wonderful books, I suppose they all can't be \\"amazing.\\" But if your new to Picoult, she offers many other great page turners...just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"I read the back of this book and thought, \\"sounds interesting\\" but eh...It was good in parts a bit overdramatic and other parts just lagged.

The book is better than the movie but still... eh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I liked this book. The only thing that was hard for me to follow was the comic book part of it. That is why I only give it 4 stars instead of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I absolutely love Jodi Picoult and her books, but this one stumped me. I quit reading after about the first 100 pages, when I realized that I was resisting the urge to throw the book at something.I know others have read it and loved it, and I totally respect their opinion!! For me, though, this wasn't a winner -- or a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Riveting","review":"Do you know what your teenager is doing? When a 14-year-old girl is date raped, her father cannot suppress his rage, which is born of a violent past. Soon, their family is thrust into a downward spiral that can only end in disaster.A master of interpersonal drama, Picoult writes with startling insight about secrets, emotions and desires. Oddly punctuated with pages from the father's comic books, as well as a strange detour up north to Alaska, this novel is nevertheless reminiscent of Picoult's best works, with compelling imagery throughout. Disturbing yet riveting, and marked by Picoult's as-always brilliant prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated with the ending","review":"I've read a number of books that grab my attention and keep me going, but then drop me flat at the conclusion. It is almost as if the author got tired of the book and quickly tied up the loose ends with one big band-aid, just to get it over with. The Tenth Circle was that way for me. Like other reviewers, I felt a lot of the high school angst was overdone, the sex-drugs-mean girls stuff portrayed the teen environment in the small town as a real awful place to grow up. I liked Daniel, but never found out if he finished his work on time for the publisher, wanted to shake some sense in Trixie, and found the involvement of Laura with the hockey player's demise very contrived. I've liked other Picoult books but this one made me glad when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed the writing style but weak story....","review":"I enjoyed the style of writing but was disappointed with the weak story. It was very predictable and needed some substance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words, lots of words","review":"I tried hard to get into this book for my Book Club. The meeting is tomorrow, and I still haven't been able to read the book. I struggled and forced my way through reading the first 30 pages. Then I speed-read some more pages. Then I browsed some more pages. Even after I read the last few pages, I still don't know what this story is really about. When the story isn't confusing and disjointed, it's dark and depressing. It seems like a young adult novel for very dramatic, angsty teenage girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Target","review":"I hated this book. I love most of Picoult's other novels, especially The Pact and Harvesting the Heart.This book had many possibilities, but none panned out. If the plot had stayed in Alaska, that would have been preferable.The comic book stuff really annoyed me. I first started this book in June, ran into the comic pages and gave up. Then I read it all during the last week, and though I did finish it, I just did not believe in the mom, Laura, or in Zephyr--even her name made me think \\"contrived.\\"This author is capable of fine work. Tenth Circle seems as if it was simply a way to show off some knowledge about Dante and the Inuit culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"I think this novel is best for younger readers. I found it a little cheesy. I stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Glance by Jodi Picoult","review":"I am now on a mission to read all of Jodi's books. They touch you and your not the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possible the worst book I've ever read.","review":"Oh Lord, this book was awful. Let me \\"spoil\\" it for you: this \\"terrible\\" event that happens is a rape. A rape of a girl. By her boyfriend. Whom she has had sex with numerous times before. Whom she is desperately trying to win back by coming on to him. By playing Rainbow and giving oral sex to anyone who asks for it. And all of this is so emotionally devastating to this \\"poor\\" girl that she resorts to cutting herself and attempting suicide. This eventually leads to the boy's suicide. This is an absolute pathetic attempt at a novel and if I could rate it in negative stars I would. I can't believe it was even published and I am furious with the author for wasting several days of my life. I didn't even finish the thing--it was that mind-numbingly stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I'm not 13 anymore!","review":"This is my second Picoult book that I have read. The first was \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", I loved her writing style so much I had to buy another. I decided to read \\"The Tenth Circle\\". I really liked this book, it only took me a day and a half to finish. Although I can't relate to anyone in the story, I learned more than I bargained for. I couldn't believe that teenagers these days are really doing the things she wrote about. This was the first time I was exposed to settings in Alaska and I was thrilled to learn so much in a short amount of time. I wished the ending went further instead of stopping while both mother and daughter were in jail. Overall I really enjoyed escaping into Alaska, I can't wait to read another book by Jodi Picoult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Dante Instead","review":"Reading this book was the tenth circle of hell. And I'm a fan of Jodi Picoult! The characters were unsympathetic, especially Trixie (the aptly named 14 year old). The plot was unbelievable and the inclusion of comic book illustrations was a distraction. Finally, the ending was the worst ever and Picoult is not exactly known for her happily-ever-afters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time Reading \\"The Tenth Circle\\"","review":"I am actually embarrassed that I stuck it out and finished reading this book.

Entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first book!","review":"This is the first book I read from Jodi Picoult. I found it interesting but as a parent, found difficult to believe some of the things Trixie parents did. I will recomended non the less.Ahhh... and to the comment to one of the reviews: 14 year olds DO indeed date 17 year olds...is not abnormal. Quite the oposite if you think that girls mature faster than boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Picoult","review":"I could not wait to read this novel, since I loved others by this author. The first few chapters were interesting, but as the novel continued, I found myself wanting to edit a lot of it. The Alaska information was not relevant and seemed to be a chance for the author to show how much research she had done on that culture. It just did not ring true to me. And this is a family who needs a serious few years in marital and family counseling.I read other reviews and was so relieved to see that I am not the only disappointed Picoult fan. As the plot winds down, I find myself praying that they find some redemption, but I have read enough reviews to learn they don't. That was my one reason for sticking with this novel. I have had enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done before","review":"Very disappointed in Jodi's newest book. I have loved her others, and My Sister's Keeper is one of my all time favorite books. But I felt like she ran out of ideas in this one, and pulled in old ones from her previous books -- the Eskimo segment especially reminded me of the Pine Ridge Indian reservation bit in an earlier book. And of course I hate the new trend in graphics, so the inclusion of that didn't help any. Everyone is entitled to a lemon now and then -- hope this is hers and that her next will be back to her usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a hit","review":"It's always a toss up when I buy a Jodi Picoult novel. I know from the onset that her books will either hit or miss. It's the chance I take. This one was a miss. It was predictable and oh so many themes. Parts were just not believable. And the comics? What an annoying distraction. When she writes another will I buy it? Sure, why not. She's had her hits as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it.","review":"I read it in two days. And I really enjoyed it. I hated the ending. I had just finished reading The Pact (which was also good) and these books seemed very similiar. But still overall a good read, it kept me interested.

I am not a fast reader so this really kept my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tenth Circle, by Jodi Picoult","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I am an omnivorous reader and plow through 3 - 7 books every week. \\"The Tenth Circle\\" was a beautifully written story and Picoult makes it possible for a reader to understand the emotions and thoughts of persons who have suffered a tragedy that the reader has not. She shows how a harm to a child affects the life, not only of that child, but of his parents and close relatives. What I prize above all in a writer is the ability to tell a story and teach me something I didn't know before. Picoult accomplished this in spades in \\"The Tenth Circle\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster","review":"this is definitely not one of Picoult's best efforts. The story drags and seems very contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best book.","review":"(MAY contain some spoiler information...)I only finished reading this book because once I start a book I feel bad putting it down without at least knowing how it ends. At the end of the book I wanted to throw it against the wall. Not because it had such a cliffhanger ending or a depressing ending as is common with her books. Because I couldn't stand the main character or her family and I couldn't stand how things were handled through out the book. The book was made to inform about rape and how women have to fight as the victim, however in the end she makes a mockery of the rave \\"victim\\" if she can even be called that by the end. I feel that she went into it very well and the first 1/2 did go into good information about rape and what it does to women, however by the end I began to side with the boy! I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"This book was a little too weird and over the top for me. There was some good issues in the book but it didn't pull together. It was just strange. However, she writes some wonderful books. Don't let this one be your first read by this author or you may not go back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good representation of Jodi Picout's work","review":"I honestly haven't read any of her other books, so this was kind of like the introduction to her world of similar plot.I really liked how she added the comics at the end of every chapter that went along wth the plot well. Alsom I thought her character developement was good. She introduced each characters by focusing on one character at a time. The book is told through thrid person point of view, but revolves around diff. character every few paragraphs.What I dind't like about the book was that it got little too dramatic at some scenes and the ending was inexpected but not strong. It was more of \\"um ok..\\" ending then \\"WOAH didn't expect THAT to happen\\" ending.But, overall, I think the book was raelly good page-turner.I literally couldn't stop reading once I began. I'm really looking forward to reading her newest book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jodi Picoult books","review":"I have recently read several books written by Jodi Picoult, every book is more compelling and engaging than the next. I recommend \\"The Tenth Circle\\" to parents with an open mind. I purchased this \\"used\\" book through Amazon and was very pleased with the condition and speed in which I received the book.

Things unravel for the young girl and we find out about her father - Daniel, a comic book artist - being arrested when was 18 yrs old. Her mother is having an affair, which she does not try to conceal. A death brings this story together and things unfold, revealing a twisted life for one family."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of her books...","review":"This book disappointed me so much the first time that I read it. Since I felt similarly about some of Picoult's other books (Mercy,Salem FallsandVanishing Acts: A Novel), I decided to give it another try. Unfortunately, I still did not enjoy it. Often, Picoult writes with a hint of magic, but this book is just bleak and the characters are much less sympathetic than in her other books. It also leaves the ending rather unfinished. The \\"twist\\" to the plot is just... lame and while it doesn't follow her courtroom formula, the book still has a formulaic feel.The comic book sections were entertaining enough, but the game with the hidden letters was more distracting than enriching. Inspired by Dante, this just isn't an example of Picoult's best work, and is probably my least favorite of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read...","review":"I tell you, with Jodi Picoult, I can't even wait for the books to come out in paperback. She is an amazing storyteller. Read her books with a confidence that you will love them. She is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too miserable. I Ditched it.","review":"Like a lot of the others here, I normally love Jodi Picoult's books. She's a great writer and while I think she did an excellent job \\"painting the picture in my mind\\" in The Tenth Circle, the content was disturbing. I rarely ditch a book but aside from this disturbed teenager being an aggrivating character, her behavior at a party caused me to shut the book and instantly decide to stop reading it. It's just too much and NOT AT ALL what I was expecting from a Jodi Picoult book. I'll still read her books, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Picoult","review":"I really enjoy Jodi Picoult stories and this one was right up there with the others.

It was the first book I ever read from her. maybe that's why i like it more than other people. maybe the others are better. but i liked it. I think alot of people possibly don't undetstand the book. They've never had anything mess with their head so badly they can relate to the girl. the book made me really like Jodi Picoult and now I am reading \\"my sisters keeper\\" which I am almost finished with and love it and I reccomend it to anyone who hasn't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan","review":"I had never read any books buy Jodi before and found it quite interesting. Tackling the topic of rape and making the emtions and anger come through are not easy. The comic book aspect was a little annoying, although I do understand the premise behind including it. How the book was tied into Dante's Inferno made for a thought provoking spin. She has found a new fan in me and I look forward to reading more of her efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck Yuck Yuck","review":"She never has an appropriate ending.

The plot was ok, but I never felt like I knew the characters and, therefore, couldn't really sympathize or empathize with any of them. I also found a lot of the links from one character to another distant and unrealistic. Definitely not my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As always, I had been looking forward to Jodi Picoult's new book. I have read almost all of Picoult's books and have enjoyed most of them. She certainly missed the mark on this one! I felt she tried to insert too many themes (ie. date rape,infidelity,drugs,cultural themes to name a few)into the story. Too many themes and what's with the comics throughout the book.......Seems to me that Ms. Picoult is loosing her touch and is now becoming very commercialized in her writing and forsaking quality and good story lines for something as ridiculous as this book is! I will think twice before running out to buy her books and this Tenth Circle book I am too embarrassed to even give it to a friend to read! Shame on you Jodi for writing such a bad story line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh..Not my cup of tea.","review":"Well, since this is a more recent book from Jodi Picoult, I pressed purchase before I ever read the storyline. I thought it would be interesting because the subject is a teen, and I'm a teen so I thought that I would be able to relate to the book.I started reading it and found it a bit boring, but as the story went on, it got more interesting. Then, the story started to drag; I felt like the fact that the mom having an affair with her student was too far fetched. I also found all the comics annoying as I'm trying to read a book about a teen and her struggle with being raped, not reading an action comic book. So, I just skipped over those parts of the book.I found the ending to be a big let down, but at least we know what happened in the end.I wouldn't read it again, but I might consider suggesting it to one of my teen friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works better than a sleeping pill.","review":"I have read everything that Jodi Picoult has written and have loved many of them and felt sorry that a tree was killed to print others. This book falls into the latter category. First I do have trouble relating to characters with names like Trixie, Dutch and Zephyr. But more importantly the story seesaws back and forth so rapidly not only between characters but between the present and the past that is hard to know who you are reading about and if it their present or their past! And finally you simply begin to not care. And the comic book insets did nothing to enhance the story line as far as I can see.Hard to believe this book was written by the same person as Second Glance and Salems Falls. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tenth Circle Tries to Do Too Much and Does It Predictably","review":"I am an avid reader of Picoult's books, but this one was a disappointment. The plot tries to cover too many diverse topics (young love, rape, self-mutilation, suicide, murder, adultery, graphic novels, and Dante's Inferno just to name a few!) Much of what happens is either totally predictable or totally implausible; not a good combination for contemporary fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dysfunctional Family...","review":"East, West, Muslim or Christian, this book proves the rule that the majority of abusive-slash-dysfunctional families are basically the same. While Living in Hell rides on the recent wave of first person accounts of Iran written by women, it falls far short of their benchmark.Mildly sensationalist, most of the book is one, (yawn) long, intensely detailed, lament about an abusive and deprived childhood and young adulthood, exacerbated by repressive cultural conditions. It is, however, interspersed with occassional interesting and colorful bits about Persian history, folklore, costume and architecture. Unfortunately, this book is dominated by the author's extremely narrow social outlook (which living in Canada has not overcome) and completely subjective view of her country and history.Possibly good reading for college level, social studies students. Or for those who enjoy long, rambling, weepy stories.As a counterpoint I highly recommend reading Lipstick Jihad instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"jazz shoes","review":"uncomfortably tight. even after several wears and has stretched with regular, normal use . i suggest buing a size up from the/your normal street size."},{"rating":"2","title":"What EVERY Collection Should Be","review":"Each track is great on its own and everything works in context on this CD whether you play it straight or shuffle.This CD takes you on a righteous trip hop trek through the dance music landscape from trip hop to folktronica to chill to rock to acid jazz - and everything just grooves.This CD is not just great fun but great music that will expand your mind, your dancefloor and soon - your CD collection as you will be introduced to some great artists.If you're not looking for the same-old, this is definitely a CD to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Tools for Self Exploration","review":"I read this book 5 years ago.

It seemed to me to be more of a story about the author overcoming challenging obstacles (which I applaud her for)and how she used her intuition to do it. The exercises are too much for me. It may be good for a beginner trying to \\"tap in\\" but I think I'm more advanced intuitively than this book and was looking for something different.

A long-time counselor andpsychotherapist, Naparstek is able to discuss these topics from apsychological, spiritual, and scientific perspective. What I foundespecially useful for myself was discerning experience from intuition,and intuition from psychic knowing. She discusses how one can maximizethese levels of awareness in one's work and life. I was amazed at herability to present the work of David Bohm and Itzhak Bentov when explainingthe science, especially quantum physics, that underlies psi, intuition,and why imagery works.Naparstek includes the scripts for imagery exercises to helpincrease ones sixth sense.This book has a wealth of helpful and useful information for anyone whoworks with people in the healing arts, or anyone who is curious aboutthese topics.

I would recommend the book for any parents who are interested in helping kids learn how to think. We live in a very religiously conservative area, and this book already has been and likely will continue to be very helpful with my attempts to balance my humanism with the hyper-religious culture here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Critical Thinking Guide for Kids ages 8-10","review":"This book follows a skeptical child through claims of a haunted house. It then goes on to explain the scientific method in very simple yet effective terms.I particularly like the emphasis on saying \\"Maybe yes, maybe no\\" when one has not investigated a claim or cannot verify something yet. This is an intellectually honest starting point for critical thinking.The book also very lightly touches on certain paranormal claims such as UFO's, dowsing, psychics, religion (you betchya!) and the like. It gives kids an idea what type of beliefs they will come across in the future, and even explains why people tell these stories and why others believe them, even in the face of evidence proving them false.It is a light read, and merely an introduction to critical thinking, but it does a great job with the scientific method.I highly recommend this book. I would have given it five stars if it delved a little deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This is the best game of 2002-2003. I love the cartoonish cell-shading look, the Ridge Racer 5 handling, and the GT3 type customization. I have no gripes with this game. I love the car selection, and the colors and looks for the cars. The selection, to elaborate, is just huge. Mostly Japanese (who doesn't like Japanese cars?), and a few U.S., this is the game for the power/customization enthusiast. They have some really slow cars, but find the fastest one of the C-class, and you will win, because all the other cars will be C-class, too. I love the fact that you have to earn the parts in races, and can use them for every car. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE racing game","review":"Yeah... I dont like racing games. Generally. Then I went to my friend's house, played the game, and could not take my eyes off the screen for 10 hours. It didnt get boring either...

I am one of the biggest gearheads in my neighborhood (and I am only 12), and I totally went out and rented this game. A day later I returned it because it was that bad. After playing for about 2 minutes and beating it in a extra hour and 30 minutes that I will never get back in my life, I cried for the rest of the night. I also had nightmares japanese-anime looking Dodge viper GTS concept cars hitting me. Please save yourself and your leisure time from this terrible game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Its so hard to handle your car that you lose every race.

You can beat the game in 2-5 hours,But the Online play Lasts along time. You can get trophies for winning, and tons of upgradable parts. You get to choose your Turbine, Brakes, design and color of your car,and much more. When you win races you can uprade your Engine witch makes it faster, and just bedder. The Online play is Perty good, But if you don't Have the Capobility to play this game Online I wouldn't get it unleess you are a Hardcore racing fan. Overall this game is really good, and has good online play."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a cartoon gran turismo 3.","review":"-Auto Modellista is not what I thought it would be. Whenever I asked anyone about it they said \\"oh! yea that, its like a cartoon gran turismo 3\\". it's not.-It's a very short game with awful physics and the most number of laps in a race is like 4 around a short track. I beat this game in 3 days. only playing for 45-75 minutes a day.-Most of your time though is spent customising your cars which is awsome because of the good variety of cars and the variety of parts. The customazation of cars is the best part of the game. That is why I gave it 2 stars.-The online mode is fun if you can find someone to play whith but the online racing isn't as fun as midnight club II (niether is the game)-The multi player is fun if you can find someone at your skill level.---thats all now go buy Gran Turismo 3 or Mightnight club II---"},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto LodaSh**sa","review":"Sorry, don't buy this game! The idea of a cell shaded racre is cool, all the hype, the pictures and the new challenger to Gran tourismo are completely false. You have zero control of your car around corners, braking sends your car into some crazy wobble across the track until you slow down enough to go straight (with added SFX of something reminisent of opening the door to your home on a very windy day and not closing it right!)I was stupid - i bought it full price when it came out and hated it the second i got going. Music sucks, tracks suck, sound sucks - cars look cool but overall - IT SUCKS!Don't waste $1 let alone $50 on this heap of steaming stuff!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Greatest Racing Game :(","review":"Ya, this game is not the greatest racing game I've played...I mean, even Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero is better than this. The only thing I like about this game is there is a lot of cars to choose from, it doesn't cost to get parts, and you can decorate your garage. Decorating your garage is the coolest thing. You can put any kind of posters you win up, and you can put all the other things you win. To me, thats probably the best part of the game. The racing looks so kiddyish, and the turning is kind of wierd. I havent played online yet so maybe that might be better than the single-player. Im gonna go play Counter-Strike...Im out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to make gore lovely...a guidebook","review":"I really loved this book. First off I am always disapointed by what is actually marketed as 'horror' or even worse as 'splatterpunk' but isn't. This is a beautiful book, everything is grotesque and there is nothing safe. Jacobs makes monstrosity twistedly lovely with her unflinching and poetic prose. It is a real accomplishment in a genre that is 1. a boys club and 2. too tame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Message","review":"Of all the books and audios I have read or heard from the Hicks, this one is the best.

I have read a few books by Abraham-Hicks, but never seen anything on video. Maybe it's just me but I find that the message that Abraham tells us is much more powerful when you watch it rather than read it. I also found each person who was helped had a question which I myself was thinking. I thought that was a strange coincidence. Normally when I watch something like this, I only watch it once. However, this is something I would love to see again and again. I am looking forward to seeing more videos from Abraham-Hicks. It is a very powerful message and this is a great way to receive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmo Beauty Finally Crowned","review":"Despite the editorial review and the two customer reviews, The Last Dance is NOT the 8th DVD of Battle Athletes: Victory. I was shocked to read some of the spoilers. As you can see, the product description is about the NEXT TO LAST volume.Anyway, this DVD is rather anti-climactic. I think we all know who the Cosmo Beauty will be. And the fact that she runs it with her best friend in a kind of love fest, rather than competition, makes it lack the suberb athletic competition and tension we have seen in the series.However, the last few seconds of the DVD are completely unexpected - and a literal - cliffhanger. I can't wait to see the 8th volume - even though I read spoilers! Grr!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this probably won't be too helpful.","review":"The three episodes contained on this volume are the only ones of this particular series I have seen, but they were quite interesting. The Japanese version was nice and the dubbed version was above average. There wasn't much in the way of extra DVD stuff to look at other than previews for other series, but the three episodes themselves were plenty good for the moola spent. As for the show itself, the characters were somewhat intriguing, and the plot was appropriately silly while at the same time having a good deal of the sort of character interaction that results in a bit of drama and I myself was looking forward to the future developments, which I cannot comment upon at present due to the fact that I have not seen the following three final episodes. I would imagine that the rest of the series is worth a look and if you already do like the series then this volume is probably one of the best due to the intense rivalries that pop up in these very episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Box 3 Review","review":"Order was on time and in good condition. This series is a must for any DBZ fan, particularly those who enjoy the original Japanese release/music score. I specifically like the options to choose the original Japanese language with English subtitles. Since this box set is a release of the original DBZ episodes, there is more graphic material than what is released in the more contemporary versions available. I have also purchased Boxes 1,2, and 4 and those are just as enjoyable as this set. Once the four sets are placed side by side, the sleeves form a connected picture, which is a nice touch, if you want to complete the sets. I am happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected","review":"It is great to have the whole season in one box. And each box adds together with the other season to create a great picture that looks nice on a shelf. The price was great and it got to us very quickly.

Now we're on the 3rd and still nothing. Shame on you Funimation for being so greedy! You know full well you won't include it because sales will go down on the orange box sets if you do. You want to keep marketing it as something different from the orange sets so people will keep buying both. Greed will ultimately be the downfall of your company.... Not to say that it can go that further down. None of your titles really sell except Dragonball stuff. haha"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give zero stars..........","review":"I bought this swing in June of this year and it's already not working....company says to ship it back and they'll replace it so that means what?.......I'll have no swing for a month???.......not to mention I will have to take the whole stupid thing apart to be able to stick it back in the box????.........WTF!!!.......anyone who has a baby knows that use of a swing is a short period of time as it is..........ugh...........I thought Amazon would back me up some but see nowhere to even be able to complain to them and I give them A LOT of BUSINESS...........I am so pissed needless to say........anyhow don't bother on this piece of...............you know what..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor died after a month.","review":"Bad buy. It claims it comes with a power adapter, which it didn't. The motor died just after one month of use. Avoid this product and go for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete POS","review":"My daughter didn't like swinging so the swing got very little use. Even so, the motor stopped working after after 9 months. It would just make a clunking sound. Even when it did work, the buttons were flaky. I would have to push the buttons just right, too hard or too long and the swing would turn on and back off again. When it was running it made excessive noise.For $40 Greco sold me another motor section, but by the time it arrived, my daughter had outgrown the swing so I never used it! I put the swing in storage. Now I have another baby so I got the swing out and found it doesn't work. The motor makes the same clunking noise as the old broken one."},{"rating":"1","title":"motor broke after 2 months","review":"My baby enjoyed this while it lasted... but the quality is substandard.Save your money and look for a different brand.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"motor burnt out","review":"I thought this swing was a gift from heaven. My daughter loved it. For 3 weeks she loved it and then the motor blew out. After looking online I found this was a common problem. I guess you can call Graco and they'll send you a new motor but who has time to deal with that? And that motor will probably burn out quickly. Luckily we were able to return it. It would have been a very expensive thing to own that only worked for 3 weeks. So beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor stops working after a few weeks","review":"This swing would be great if the motor worked. On the swing levels 1 and 2 it has issues, will stop working and slows down. We called customer service and they sent us a new motor. That one worked fine for awhile but now it is having the same problem. Guess I will make a second call to them...how frustrating. SO overall this swing works fine for awhile but will most likely have motor problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motors Died, Annoying Assembly","review":"I liked the design and color of this Graco swing, however the motor ceased working about two weeks after assembly. I should have know when the floor model at Baby's R Us was also not working.Hopefully other buyers have better luck, but this swing seemed cheap from the start and lived up to my initial impression.I replaced it with a Fischer-Price, which was only slightly more expensive. The Fischer-PriceFisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing - Starlight Purpleis easier to assemble, more reliable, provides much plusher padding in the seat, an automated mobile, and multiple swinging directions. I initially preferred the Graco for it's AC operation, but I'll happily buy the batteries for the Fischer-Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor unit constantly breaks","review":"I would not recommend this swing. The motor unit constantly breaks and I am currently waiting on my 3rd motor from Graco Support. The first time the motor started making strange noises and the music stopped working, the second motor just stopped working altogether.

So, the swing must be pushed manually with no \\"auto power\\" function at all due to terrible motor .. I am disappointed ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a swing without batteries!","review":"My daughter loves a swing. We burned out 2 other swings (same model) before wising up and getting a plug in! Saved us a ton on batteries ($30+ a month).

Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the sixth new motor...","review":"We've gone through literally six \\"NEW\\" motors now. They may last a few weeks and then the swing stops completely or only works occasionally/rarely. This problem began within a few months of use and when my son was WELL under the 30 lb. weight limit. Graco's happy to keep sending new motors because they must surely know they won't work very long. Why buy a product that only works 50% of the time or where you're constantly having to get replacement parts because the originals (and then replacements) are faulty? I do not recommend this swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Swing","review":"We love this swing and so does our son!PROS: Easy in/out, varying swing speeds, sounds are very soothing, timer (This is possibly the best feature!)CONS:Uses up batteries quickly.

I ordered this swing because it had mostly good reviews although many said the motors stopped working. I chose to take my chances with it. After just 5 months of use the motor burned out. The reviews weren't dramatic, it really did stop working and not because of misuse or a heavy baby. We use the swing pretty often and my baby is only 16 lbs.I did contact Graco and they are willing to send out replacement parts but we are stuck without a swing until they show up.As far as the correct product and shipping time, I was completely happy with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"does NOT vibrate","review":"We purchased this swing because it vibrated for our daughter.

The music sounded more like errie music in a bad movie -- not at all what you want a new born baby to listen to!!! It was supposed to be 'classical' but it was just BAD!!

The instructions were completely inadequate. I am moderately mechanically inclined and it took more than one hour from opening the box to plugging the swing in. While it may not sound like a long time, the main body of the swing is constructed from fifteen pieces. All of the pieces snap together with the exception of three pieces which were screwed into the frame.I certaintly hope the functionality of the swing surpasses the \\"ease\\" of construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor stops working!!","review":"Horrible swing!

This was a good game. Not too hard to learn. Not too long to play. Gives some practice in addition. The only thing that would improve the game is if the coins would be metal instead of cardboard. Also more than 20 coins would be good as sometimes you are supposed to get a coin and the chest is empty so you get nothing.

It doesn't know the difference, whether what you tell your mind is true or false. Your mind will simply make your reality match your thoughts. This amazing ability has been proven in my life, as well as the lives of many other people.

In time I adjusted to his style and have been able to apply these principles in my own life. Now I am collecting as many of his writings as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the book, the CD is ok","review":"I absolutely recommend the book version of it. It gives good and practical information about how to use your subconscious mind in every area of your life. The CD is only a super fast (seriously) summary of the main points of the chapters. It is spoken at the speed of light. I am used to a more detail CD of a book where the reader speaks calmly and more slowly so you can actually get the information. It sounds like a an option sale to the highest bidder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and True Power","review":"This book is truly a must read. If you want to truly take over your life and get off auto pilot please purchase this book. There's no way of explaining how this book can adjust someone spirit, and direct them to God through the subconscious mind. The stories inside the masterpiece are inspiring, especially after researching some of them and finding out that the stories are true.The secret to everything is your subconscious point blank. Just have to learn or understand how to impress it through thoughts, in which this book explains. All in all, this book in awesome!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious propaganda disguised as psychology","review":"Here is the summary of this book; religious faith is at the heart of our subconscious and prayer is the way to wealth. Okay, I just hate it when people use faith as a tool to get material wealth in this world. It's just hypocrisy of it that disgusts me. Don't get this book if you're looking for a scientific and empirical method to empower your subconscious. This is a religious propaganda wrapped up in the cover of psychology. It quotes the New testament throughout the book trying to convert you to his faith. I'm not an atheists but I hate to get tricked in to buying a book that's supposed to be about empowering your mind then turns out to be some religious propaganda trying desperately preaching the power of religious faith. He site no evidence for his claims and the miracles that supposed to have happened. There is no scientific evidence for any of this. This book is a JOKE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a good book on parapsychics and our own powers","review":"I've always have been attracted to parapsychic stuffs and mysteries but I always hated that misleading, evolution restraining attitude to have \\"faith in someone all powerfull\\" for everyting we don't understand. This book have a good, scientific approach about \\"miracles\\". Believe some, disbelieve some. You have the choice. It did change somethings in my own life. Particularly the self-suggestion. It confirmed what I had always believed before. WE have the power to change things, and we are not linked to an already written future or any non-existent super-being. Some good exemples of psychic powers to try at home, a great listing and descriptions of lots of psychic powers. Really a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"The power of Your Subconscious Mind Audio CD","review":"This CD is dreadful. The man who is reading the text has an absolutely horrid reading voice.

It's a cheap watered down carbon copy that even occassionally plagarizes the original. If you want to read the best book ever written about the subconscious mind and circumvent all of the silly new age garbage (I.E. This book claims that the Biblical term \\"LORD\\" is actually referring to our subconscious mind.?) then pickup a copy of PsychoCybernetics. It is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind","review":"This book, along with The Law of Attraction, will set you on a wonderful path in life. You will be aware of how you attract things and people in your life without consciously realizig it. Your conscious and subconscious minds will start to work together and reveal things to you and help you to rechannel those things. Our choices in life are just that, our choices. We can make those changes at any time and at any age. We are \\"the Captain of our destiny and the Captain of our soul.\\" We are responsible for our happiness or unhappiness; good health or bad health; fortune or misfortune; good relationships or bad relationships; and most importantly, strong faith or no faith. If you want to change for the positive, then read these books and apply it to your daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind","review":"It is a must read for anyone seeking success in the many spheres of human life. The pages of this book are filled with valuable concepts, ideas and examples of how we can program ourselves painlessly and effectively to achieve our objective in life.I recommend this book to any student of life. Young and old. To read these pages not once but many times. Because many of the ideas are hidden and do not reveal themselves to the reader on the first read, reading it more than once becomes the gift that keeps on giving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the religious!","review":"If you can ignore the typos, which I did considering how good this book was, I do believe this book has the power to change your life. Contrary to one negative review, this book is not just written for the religious. Granted, I will say that if you have a religious upbringing like myself, but do not adhere to an organized religion, this book may especially speak to you. Whoever said that misunderstood what God is defined as, though it is hard to define it at all. The divine within, my friends. If you believe it is there, then you have all that you need. Buy the book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An advice manual for a road to better times","review":"This book is simple and I am applying its techniques. The author describes when happens with our mind, with our inner voice, with the need to pray.

Its short and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind","review":"This is an oldie, but a goodie. This book is amazing, very interesting and inspirational, and makes a lot of sense. I think anyone who needs help controlling their negative thoughts, or understanding how thoughts affects us should read this book. Originally published in the 60's these things still hold true today. If your interested in this type of stuff, be sure to check out a movie called \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\" Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the Meaning of life, that there is no meaning.","review":"I now feel an inner peace after reading this book.

Life has no meaning, it just is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovered something real","review":"I was recommended this book buy an older man. Didn't think much of, but took his advice, and read it. It's a broad wall to look at Life. In my opinion it's a manual for your life, or another way to look at Life. The author, a doctor, is the founder of the subconscious mind movement, it all starts here. I just liked this book so much I have to write about it. Its a treasure in the attic because it's so old. If you read it I just hope you to come to understand it the way I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing subconscious secrets","review":"Joseph Murphy writes plainly, and simply, but that's a good thing: you cannot misunderstand him.

But boy was I wrong (and boy should I have read those reviews first). Although the main take-aways of this book have some value (believe in yourself and others will too, put an idea in your mind and your subconscious mind will encourage you to act on it), there is too much processed bologny in the form of religious anecdotes, the idea that you can will anything to happen (i.e., believe enough that you will be a millionaire and magically you'll be a millionaire), and extravagant claims of success of countless individuals without one proper reference to back up the claims. This book is not even remotely credible and not worth reading in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This book isn't really what I thought it was going to be. I'm not a religious person and that's basically all this book is about. Referring to God a lot and praying and all that fun stuff.

I first picked it up in my friends bathroom and the words immediately spoke to me. If you believe in the Power of Attraction, or THE SECRET- this is the book for you. It actually explains WHY those things work. As soon as I began practicing the principles in this book, amazing things started to manifest in my life. I never knew how much power I had to control my own destiny!

One was Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualization and the second was Joseph Murphy's The Power of Your Subconscious Mind. My best friend had recommended both books to me during a difficult period, when I was recuperating from surgery. To this day, I practice the teachings in both books, and the affirmations that I've composed for myself, based on my needs and goals, have never failed to lift my spirits, or put me in a better frame of mind, as well as lighten my physical & emotional load. I truly subscribe to the belief that as you think, so you are...and Murphy's teachings have helped me to channel my negative, defeatist, pessimistic thoughts into positive and empowering thoughts & actions. To fully reap the benefits of this book, one does need to have an open mind. I hope many more people benefit from this book as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Nonreligious","review":"This book is written by an author who assumes the reader is religious and wants to do lots of praying. It is filled with biblical quotations. A much better book on this subject is \\"The Genie Within\\" by Harry W. Carpenter. Carpenter does mention prayer in his book, but does not use it as the main methodology as Murphy does. If you are very religious and want to do lots of praying, buy the Murphy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of your Subconscious Mind","review":"The books covers how your subconscious mind controls your thoughts. One can manifest wealth, good health, etc., by the data it unconsciously feeds its brain. There is power in the thoughts we feed ourselves. Its great to go beyond the mind to your subconscious mind and finally realize that you are not your mind. You can be the master of our mind or the slave. Mentally step back and observe your thoughts as an outsider, this will calm your mind. The mine cannot observe its self and have thoughts, it will become quite.

I have a well worn underlined edition that I use. Gwenn"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This book was suggested by my counselor.

I had ordered two -- one for me and one for a friend, and we were both uncomfortable with the type face. There was no selection with a larger type."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Your Brain on Science","review":"Enjoyed it once I got beyond some of the outdated references. I often wonder, with the incredible mass of information in this field, why people are not more deliberate about feeding their brain and deliberately brain washing themselves. I know I do not do what I can to feed my head. It is easier to sit in front of the tube or sit around soaking up the gas from underachieving buddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"He hooked me with the first few chapters but the more I read the more I got upset. He blames all lifes ailment on negitive thinking so if you were hit by a bus for example you must not have good thoughts in your subconscience. if you get cancer or a cold it is your own fault. if you are laid off from work, it is your own fault. if a terorist runs a plane into your building then it is your fault. he concludes that ANYTHING is posible if you wish it so (i.e if you truly believe your bullit proof and put a gun to your head and pull the trigger if will magically bounce off, if you have any doubt then well, you die.) the beauty of this logic is that if something does not go your way for any reason or your prayers are not answered then you must not wanted it bad enough. it is your fault, not his flawed logic. I do believe that the mind and the power of suggestion is powerful but telling my subconscience till i am blue in the face that i can fly will not make it so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of examples but no convincing arguments","review":"This book is full of repeated sayings but actually after having read more than half of it, I stoped.

Wow, really!!! I couldn't read anymore after that. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!! Complete ripoff. Thought it might have been a power of positive thinking book, not pray for it and you will get it.

However, the typesize used throughout is 10 point Times Roman, single-spaced. If you print a few paragraphs in this typesize on your printer you will have a good idea of how easy - or not - it will be to read. This is the second book I have come across in 1 day where the publisher is trying to cram as much information into as few pages as possible.

This is too much akin to wishful thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a great book for anyone who belives in Santa Clauss","review":"It's a garbage. This book is a example of pseudoscience knowledge. There are only points of view that are not suported by the science. If you want to buy illusions, buy it. Otherwise, I recommend \\"The Demon-Haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark\\" by Carl Sagan. \\"While he touches on various sorts of pseudoscience and antiscience, including repressed memories of all sorts, creationism, belief in miracles and, to his credit, the claims of tobacco companies that cigarettes have not been shown to be harmful, Mr. Sagan's primary target is the widespread belief in alien abductions . . . he is seldom wrong . . .

Since then, I have gone on to read many of his books. I am not easily impressed by positive thinking books. Many of them appeal to other readers but are not sensible enough for my taste. Joseph Murphy's books are practical and straight-forward. His nondenominational approach is very refreshing and scientific. The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is for everyone. It is much more understandable and usable than Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, so if you liked that book, you will want to get this as well. Joseph Murphy does not try to be mysterious. He gives very practical advice. And, moreover, his advice works. He explains that, like chemistry or math, the law of creation can be used more effectively by anyone who knows how it functions. He teaches you methods you can use -- all of them effective, simple, and easy. This is one book worth reading and even rereading (not something I say about most books.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good...but it repeats the same idea over and over.","review":"I can tell you in few words what the book is about: you just have to believe something and repeat an idea many times a day. By doing this, you are ordering your subconscious mind to do something for you (for example: repeat to yourself \\"I will get the job\\", or \\"I do not want to smoke\\"). If you think negative ideas, your subconscious mind will believe they are true and all this negative ideas will actually happen. Well, that's it. The book repeats this same idea over and over. If you still want to buy the book, go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and rambling at best","review":"Got about a third through and perseved a couple more times but got very frustrated with the ridiculous claims of what the subconscious mind can do and control.

But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' by Dr Peter Strong, an in-depth exploration of mindfulness meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book.","review":"This is one of the greatest books ever written.

Joseph Murphy uses case and metaphor to make his point of what is possible with the subconcious. The assumption is that we are having negative experiences that need changing. Sounds like a winner well maybe a page or two and after that you start looking for the possitive. I found it to be a rambling presentation and after having it in the house for a week will recycle it to a free bin.

Maybe you can improve your health, wealth, ability etc. etc., but meaningful life comes from something higher (or deeper).

Wow.... Look, there are no notes nor sources nor references whatsoever, not even a bio on this Murphy chap... there are 270 pages and over 250 chapters! That's right, mini-rants for mini attention-spans....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of your subconscious mind","review":"Great book, but substantially repetitive in places.The religious aspect of it is not for me. I liked the interpretation of 'faith'...faith in ourselves rather than 'faith' in some myth or fairy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind","review":"When I received this book the printing is so small that you need amagnifying glass to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind","review":"Religious propaganda! Not the psychological enlightenment I thought I was getting. As an atheist, I found this book to unhelpful and down right irritating. I did not receive a scientific book about the brain and it's workings. The book is an advertisement for Christianity and nothing more. I prefer not having religion shoved at me needlessly. It will do nothing to sway my mind. Save yourself the money and do not purchase this book. The author has made way more than he should have off of this piece of propaganda trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious, not very scientific","review":"I was looking for an educated book on the subconscious and I purchased this one based on the great reviews. The reasons for it's success are beyond my understanding. The book is too religious that is actually distracting. Just in it's second page, it asks the reader \\"do you know how to pray effectively?\\", the word \\"God\\" is used everywhere and each chapter contains at least one quote from the Bible. The book would make more sense if it were entitled \\"The Power of Your Prayers\\". With a title like that, the book would be decent. But I'm not concern about praying, I wanted to learn about the subconscious and I feel completely mislead with this book and it's title. I honestly feel like giving the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"great subject but a dissapointing approach","review":"This book was great at the start. It promised to be really fascinating material, and there is some really eye opening information presented. But to any one who has read the bible thoughtfully, Dr Murphy's interpretation and presentation of scripture is erroneous. I know that concrete results are presented, but the conclusions - where the bible is concerned - are more accurately termed as Dr Murphy's opinions.The subject of the subconscious mind fascinates me, but I would rather get my facts from another source. I personally find the mixture of religions with facts a little off putting. For example, if the bible, which I am familiar with is misquoted, what about the sources that I am not familiar with?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sham","review":"I bought this work because of the reviews, and I am baffled that so many thought so highly of it. To me, it fails to provide anything more than a call to prayer, which I find anachronistic at best and offensive to a thoughtful person."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bilingual General Dictionary in English and Spanish","review":"This Oxford Dictionary is a true gem.

The story is a thrilling adventure that's hard to put down; plan on pulling an all-nighter when you read it. In one year, Kenn Kaufman traveled 80,000 miles, saw over 600 species of birds, and spent less than $1000 in doing so. I'm more of an armchair birder myself, content to see the world's birds in books, and I loved being taken along on this amazing journey without having to leave the comfort of my own home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This book will make you wish you had never started a \\"life list.\\" I found the endless \\"I went here and saw such and such\\" really tiresome.

It made me realize I was not the one with the problem. I was being controlled by power over reality not mutuality and respect. My only negetive comment about the book is the author assumes verbal abuse is a men\`s issue.....This is so very untrue.Many of us male and female grow up in power over homes only to choose mates in that likeness!Everyone should read this book to gain knowledge of this type of abuse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Identifying and Dealing with the Problem","review":"I will add my \\"This book saved my life\\" to all the others who have said it before. The author's clear examples of verbal abuse are right on target. Using incidents from real life, she is able to show you what you may have never seen or understood before. I have a master's degree and did not get married until well into my 30s. I was not afraid of being alone, but I wouldn't leave him until I understood the damage being done to my soul, spirit and mind. This book gave me that understanding.

Oh PUH-LEEEASE!!! If you internalize all the listed \\"forms\\" of verbal abuse mentioned in this book, then just about any kind of discussion or minor argument could be perceived as being verbally abusive.

Definitely worth the money spent. Very biased in favor of the women studied. I liked the book a lot because it raises awareness for verbal abuse and what it is, though the book has two shortcomings. It makes the abuser out to be an evil individual (almost always men) who will stop at nothing to harm their partner. It doesn't try to understand why an abuser might be drawn to abuse, and it doesn't ever explain what responsibility the abusee may play. NO ONE deserves to be abused, but it takes two to tango. The author never mentions any interaction with the abusing partner in the case studies, only the women being abused. I believe a book that analyzes both sides of the abuse would better serve the reader in learning about verbal abuse and how to avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my soul","review":"Verbal abuse kills your soul one word at a time. This book helped me realize that no amount of explaining on my part would ever get through to my husband how his words damaged me and others. After 20 years, it hit me that he will never change. Please realize that verbal abusers can be women as well as men (the author doesn't emphasize this enough). All in all, this is the most helpful book I have ever read. It saved my life and my soul.Too Good for Her Own Good: Searching for Self and Intimacy in Important Relationships"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book!","review":"If you are on this page, considering whether or not you really need to read a book about verbal abuse, let me encourage you to take the leap. I was where you now sit not long ago, and this book opened my eyes. When I realized that I was afraid to have it delivered to our home, I realized how critical it was that I get the help it offers. If you have read the excerpts online and concluded that you might be in or know of a verbally abusive relationship, please consider what Evans has to say. She makes sense out of a non-sensical situation. It's a pretty easy read and well worth the time. If you think you might be in a verbally abusive relationship, there's a really good chance that you are correct. If so, read this book. It may save your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't Finished this, but so far, it's really accurate!","review":"Hi. Bought this on recommendation of someone who has read it.

Reading her book was a \\"water-shed\\" experience for me. The information she presented helped me to begin to deal with the effects of an abusive marriage. Prior to reading her book, I was experiencing severe post-traumatic stress reaction and was having great difficulty functioning emotionally. I could not grasp what was happening to me and why. I was in a nightmare that did not end. As I read her book, I felt a door of knowledge and hope open. The information helped me to begin a journey of healing. I have also been able to share this knowledge and book with other women (and men) who are suffering abuse. Her book is a life-saver, and a profound work.

She gives no indication of a professional standing in psychotherapy.2.) She does not appear to provide any scientific studies to support her thesis.3.) Her idea of a \\"survivor\\" appears to be a divorced family. Statistics show these are not healthy environments.4.) No professional organization appears to have backed her work.5.) All of her accounts are of one side of an abusive relationship.6.) She claims psychotherapy is patriarchal, without backing it up. Yet we are to believe her non scientific work is valid.7.) She runs a horrible bulletin board were the blind are doing eye surgery on themselves. Dissenters, no matter how nice, are not allowed and are removed.8.)

What I found out was that *I* was actually the victim of a severe verbal abuser. EVERY aspect of verbal abuse described in this book has been used on me by this man, and I thought that I was the one with the problem - he convinced me of that - it's part of the abuse, as you will be able to understand after reading this book. I left him, and life has never been better for me. I have a long way to go in recovery emotionally, physically, and financially, but by eliminating the abuse from my life, I finally have the confidence I need to heal.

This book gave me the words and the validation I needed..I would like to remind the author that women are not the only ones who can suffer verbal abuse, which can be subtle and insidious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try! - Your relationship should = The Earth & Squirrels","review":"Patricia Evans tries to tie all of \\"her\\" universal beliefs to individual relationships. She equates forces of nature and the relationship between earth and its inhabitants with the relationship between two individuals that can communicate.Her book only addresses one scenario (abusive husband, abused wife) in only one context (Reality I vs. Reality II)While I will agree that an abusive person does not just wake up one day and say, \\"oh my, see what I have done, I want to change.\\" I think you have to say a person does not wake up one day and say \\"I want to be verbally abusive starting today!\\"I think if your life falls into the narrow scenario presented in this book, you can find value in reading it. If your scenario is at all different, then this book is a real stretch and most likely interesting but irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is AWFUL!","review":"This is a very important topic, and one that I have taken very seriously. However the author has done a terrible job of addressing the issue. While there are some great points in this book, they are lost in the horrible atmosphere she has created. My wife and I have read this book at the suggestion of our counselor. Our home has become a living hell! Every sentence uttered is disected. Even the most caring and innocent attempts at communication are now suspect. In painting only men as the issue, and in casting a net so large that ANYTHING a man says to a woman can be called abusive, this author has DAMAGED my marriage more than helped it.Do yourself a favor. Find a book that addresses the issue in a more balanced way. It will take months, if not years, to undo the damage this book has caused in our lives..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Evans is a quack!","review":"This book is the most biased thing on the planet! Mrs. Evans, in this book, all she talks about is hating men! That is the most UNHELPFUL attitude on the planet! I agreed with another reviewer that said that all the book does is teach how to hate, and than escalate it. Another reason why I hated this book is the one-sidedness-there is NOTHING negative about a female in this book, when they can do it just as much as a male could! Mrs. Evans should do something constructive with her life, like open a Abused Women's Clinic instead of writing this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A DOCTOR","review":"The author is not a doctor and has no formal training in verbal abuse.

It shead light on to the major problem of our relationship and help me realize that I wasn't crazy. I don't think there would have been much hope in saving our relationship if I hadn't found this book.Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, but needs to be more expansive","review":"As I read this book, I grew more and more amazed at how accurately Ms. Evans described the relationship between the abuser and his partner. I would recommend this to everyone who thinks they're in such a relationship or knows someone who is. It's an excellent starting point to recovering from an abusive relationship.One word of caution, though, and the reason I only gave this book four stars. Ms. Evans concentrates almost exclusively on heterosexual relationships where men are the abusers and women the victims of the abuse. In my case, the abuser was a friend, and while I was able to extrapolate what I needed, others may feel like the scope of the book is too narrow. Perhaps a third edition of the book that includes other types of relationships might be in order?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Increased understanding","review":"This book is a great start for someone trying to understand what verbal abuse is about and why it happens. After being in a 10 year relationship and not being able to figure out why it wasn't working - this book helped to explain a lot.It is written in a way that easy to read and understand - gradually introducing terms and phrases that are used throughout the book.It has not only helped for me to understand a past relationship but will help for me to recognize verbally abusive characteristics in people that I may meet in the future.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too biased","review":"This author words Things in such a way that every person who reads it Will convince themselves that they are being abused"},{"rating":"2","title":"lucky36@earthlink.net","review":"I have been in this type of relationship since the day I was born. You get so used to a way of life you don't reconize it as abusive. This book, really helped me focus on what the most smallest form verbal abuse is. It also helped with the emotional abuse. I find it very enlighting and helpful, especially on how to deal with it. It's your choice to say \\"Stop it\\", I will not accept this. The book really helps identify the abuse. I also recommend all of Iyanla Vanzant's books, and tapes. Very uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you found this book and are considering reading, you must!","review":"This book is critical in uncovering emotional and verbal abuse that you may not know is occuring or has occured. Often the abuse builds over several years and a person looses sense of self so it becomes so challenging to define. The most important thing I heard that helped me understand how a person can continue in an abusive relationship is the frog in the frying pan. If you put a frog in a boiling pan he will jump right out but if you put him in the pan and turn the heat on slowly he will sit there until his feet burn... moral being that this type of abuse is so insidious that you may not know it is happening. Read this book and you will know immediately and don't doubt your instints. Most importantly, learn as much as you can to understand what is going on, recover your boundaries and seek help."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is 'The Bible' !","review":"After 23 years of every kind of abuse imaginable and finally an impending divorce a therapist at the center for abused women recommended this book. I'd read all the others - ALL of them - and this book absolutely nailed the reasons for the abuse, the various subtle things he was doing I couldn't explain to friends, the reason the prior therapists had led us astray and made me feel dignified again. And here is the kicker: my almost -ex husband read it and said, \\"This is the first book that's told me what's wrong with me.\\" Wish we'd found this sooner! It might have saved our marriage! Hope it saves someone else's..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an answer!","review":"This book has had such a tremendous impact on me; like no other. I was involved with a man for 8 months. I could never figure out how to conquer the constant accusation by him that I was \\"too sensitive\\" when I got bothered by his subtle criticisms. I read all the books on how to change ME. Reading \\"Loving Him without Losing You\\" briefly discussed verbal abuse but it caught my eye. I broke off the relationship prior to reading this book, knowing these comments weren't \\"right\\". But what a relief to finally understand the WHY, instead of thinking it was me. Thank goodness for all these self-help books. If I didn't have the self-esteem I have fought to get back after having it knocked down as a child, I could have been a victim for a much longer time. ...This book should be mandatory for high school students. A must for every man and woman; heterosexual or homosexual. Patricia Evans should be commended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe responses for unsafe situations","review":"Excellent resource especially if you have to stay with your abuser for now or think that s/he could learn to respect you. The book gives good ideas about what to say when you're being verbally abused, as well as cautions you to follow your instincts before uttering any response. Sometimes the best option for your safety is to sit still and be quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men are bad bad baddies and women are good good goodies","review":"It's a shame the author presents a sexist one sided treatise on verbal abuse. If Ms. Evans is anything she is consistent in her diatribe against men. Having lived in a relationship where verbal abuse exists on both sides, I find it incredulous that in this enlightened age the author could be so ignorant when it comes to gender issues.Men if you see your female partner reading this book, head for the hills. You are being unfairly maligned by the female equivalent of a Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard spewing hatred against men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chunk this book and start acting like a lady","review":"Ms. Evans makes an observation that the verbally abusive relationship lacks characteristics of mutuality and respect. This being true, I submit that a woman in such relationship is engaging in disrespectful behavior. Be it premarital sex, doing more than one's share of chores, serving to please the man, enabling his bad behavior, allowing the abuse, a man will treat a woman the way she \\"asks\\" to be treated. In the perpetrator-victim-rescuer triangle, Ms Evans will serve as your favorite rescuer if you wish to stay stuck. Otherwise... chunk this book, start acting like a lady, serve God and God alone, and your man may very well surprise you. Maria S. Atlanta, GA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudice against men","review":"This book was the worst book I have ever read. It is totally biased against men. It basically states this in the foreword, and succeeds in carrying the basic premise that woman can only be victims of verbal abuse throughout the entire book. One problem with this premise is that men who are victims of verbal abuse won't talk about it. But with today's woman are victims culture, men are the scapegoat. This book continues this scapegoat premise. I just ended a 25+ year relationship with a borderline personality disorder ex-wife, and I will tell you now that I was the victim of manipulation and verbal abuse. And every example Patricia sites, fits my relationship, only I was the receiver of the abuse. But there is no way I ever would have admitted it before now. Through counseling, I realized just how bad she was to me, and just how lopsided the outside view of this problem is. This book should be removed from print until it can be written in amore balanced presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man-Hater","review":"This book seems to be written by a woman with a chip on her shoulder after talking to 40 other women. From the opening premise that most verbal abuse comes from men, the tone was clear. Further, her premise leaves one to conclude that if accused one must be guilty. Since in the authors view verbal abusers typical deny it, and avoidance of discussion is verbal abuse, one is guilty whether one disagrees, doesn't discuss the topic, or agrees. The author describes male communication patterns of sharing information as abuse versus female patterns of sharing emotions as healthy. There is no recognition of legitimate gender differences which have been recognized and celebrated by so many other authors. While there is a willing audience out there to eat up this drivel, it seems to be the makings for the next Jerry Springer show."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read.","review":"Although I knew I was in a verbally abusive relationship, this book help me to articulate the words to describe what is clearly abuse.This book is one of the most powerful books I have ever read and one I fully connected too.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wonders if their relationship is abusive.Simple, easy to read and understand.A must for women in abusive relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me from marrying the wrong man!","review":"This might not be the most profound review, but the result of reading this book is!

I'm not crazy!!!Being an intelligent woman who has learned \\"so much\\" about relationships and yada yada... I have been so confused and doubting my own sanity to the point of severe depression. I mean, he never calls me names like so many websites insist has to happen for a person to be abusive. He doesn't hit me.

Evans' book validated my situation in a major way, because for years I had been told that I was the crazy one who imagined the mistreatment.I was alone in my reality and the ones who lorded over me defined my life and experiences for me, entertaining the idea that everything was normal and I was the one who wasn't normal.Having been abused during my childhood in more ways than one, I was socially conditioned to accept all types of abuse: physical, verbal, psychological etc. Having ended up in an abusive relationship that was so unrecognized as such made it very difficult for me to even seek help or receive validation that I was indeed being abused.Thank you Ms. Evans for this book that shed light in my life at a very crucial time.When I began to heal and I found this book, it helped me tremendously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have recommended this book to so many people","review":"I got this book 6 years ago and woke up!

Evans illustrates her ignorance into the basic differences between men and women that any PSY101 student or reader of men are from mars...knows.

I will admit some observations had merit, but by and large this book is a crock! In the old days, we would say that it is defense for the verbally unprepared and poorly trained. But in this era of the Universal Victim, there MUST be a reason for every outcome.If the author turned around her argument to say that women are poorly prepared to defend against verbal attack and to use their verbal skills more accurately and intelligently, she would get sued!

This is a lopsided, bigoted, biased diatribe, penned by an obviously predjudiced person, totally without objective method or purpose. As Warren points out, the author shows absolutely no scientific or even non-scientific evidence to support her ludicrous proposition that men are biologically or socially disposed to be the abuser in relationships. Thank God I didn't let my abusive spouse see this (which I had bought with hopes she might read it and see her behavior). Unfortunately, I didn't do my homework before the purchase. I read the intro, and then threw it in the trash.Of course, other reviewers who may agree with the author's bias, either haven't read the book, or are themselves bigoted. From my experience, woman are far superior to men in the \\"skills\\" of verbal dominance and abuse. Just ask Dr. Laura!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frighteningly inaccurate premises, some helpful techniques","review":"As a licensed counselor who specializes in violent relationships and women's issues, I was frankly horrified by the unprofessionally simplistic, Evil-Abuser-Innocent-Victim mentality upon which Ms. Evans' work is built. She would have done abused women a better service by leaving out the first seven chapters and sticking strictly to the communication aspects of abusive relationships. Her specific techniques for responding to verbal inappropriateness are helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!!! Priceless information.","review":"I read this book in two days and have given it to my spouse to read. This is what we have been looking for to help heal our relationship. Very good people can be effected by verbal abuse either through their own use or anothers. It can really damage a relationship. I purchased another copy for a friend. Prior to giving it to her I loaned the copy to my mother. She returned it the next day because it was so interesting she bought one for herself. I highly recommend this book. It was a very easy read with priceless information and insight. Patricia Evans really connected and put it on paper. Thank you! Thank you! I also recommend Why Does He Do That? by Lundry Bancroft."},{"rating":"2","title":"More appropriately titled \\"The Verbally Abusive Male\\"","review":"Although the content and dynamics of verbal abuse are described in clear, interesting, useful ways, the anti-male slant of this book is irritating. The author's data is based on personal experiences counseling women (and very few men) and on 40 intensive interviews with women. The author's conclusion, therefore, that men are for more likely to be verbally abusive is simply a logical, methodological tautology. This analysis is a very good example of selection bias posing as objective data collection. Worth reading because of the useful typology of verbal abuse and strategies for dealing with this abuse. However, the men-as-abusers complemented by the women-as-victims orientation simply adds further support for the unsuppored Men are From Mars, Women Are From Venus Misconception. (This review is written by a professor of communication studies who has taught intimacy and interpersonal communication for nearly three decades.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Important, but biased.","review":"First of all, I did read the book from the first to the very last page. Unfortunantely I have to agree with some other reviewers, that in contrast to the title, it's more about the verbally abused women. So yes, the book did help me to realize, that I have been verbally abused. But I also have to admit that I all this blaming men for all the abuse on the planet and totally blanking out the fact that there is also a lot of verbal and emotional abuse of women towards men did leave me a bit disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Eye Opener","review":"This book told me about how two people can live under the same roof and have two sets of realities and expetations.

About two months ago, I pulled the book out of the drawer and took another look. I guess I had to \\"hit bottom\\".

It has given me fresh hope, and a new perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has saved my soul... seriously.","review":"Before I read this book, I didn't know there was a name for what I was going through. Once I started reading I was in shock. I was reading about myself. It was unreal. I was ready to go before this book but this book enlighetened me to a point that I finally understood what was happening in my life and I then felt a little more empowered and educated. I now no longer question the decisions that I have to make because I understand why I am making them and why things are the way they are. I've never written a review before but I felt compelled to do so after reading this.

He challenges formal leaders to identify the values underpinning their leadership, to be explicit about their goals, intentions and strategies, and to truly collaborate with others to create new solutions. And he encourages those without formal authority to find their own leaderful voice.This book has the added advantage of including a brief self-assessment and then being structured such that you can easily find what you think will be of greatest value to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"IME415 Sbrown Deming","review":"This book is well written and illustrates what a system is and how to optimize the whole system.

And the book inside of it is definately a collectable, and it's filled with alot of great information.

And Robert Smith's voice is just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cure Strikes Gold!!!!!","review":"I have been a fan of The Cure since 1984 and have hoped this release would see the light of day. It was a blessing when Bob said he would put this together for his fans and he did one heck of a job.... The sound, pictures, booklet, artwork, etc are all top notch quality .... It is what a Cure fan expects from Bob and he delivered again.... Lament(flexipop version), Twilight Garden, Chain Of Flowers, More Than This, and I'm Cold are some of the standout tracks and there are many.....70 tracks in all and the color booklet has 75 pages with great detail about EVERY song in the set( comments from Robert and Simon)....Rare cuts such as Lost Wishes ep, Carnage Visors, Pirate Ships, etc all will be on the 2 cd remaster sets that will be starting in April 2004..... All hail The Cure and bow down at the alter of Mad Bob and his band of mood music makers....

This box set brings all of their b-sides and some odds and ends together for the first time. Much of the material making it's cd debut. Some of the best of these lost songs include \\"I'm Cold\\", \\"A Chain of Flowers\\", \\"This Twilight Garden\\", \\"2 Late\\", \\"Pillbox Tales\\" and \\"To the Sky\\". Sure there are some things missing....the \\"Cult Hero\\" single, \\"Carnage Visors\\", the long instrumental originally on the Faith cassette and the \\"Curiosity\\" live tracks, but this is still a long overdue and excellent collection.

There was no real passion or heat to any of the sex scenes. All the actors lacked acting ability and most of them would only rate about a 2 or 3 on the attractiveness scale. The storyline would have been passable had it been developed a bit more and better actors used. The overall look to the movie came across as very cheaply made and amateurish. If you're the kind of person that enjoys hot, steamy, passionate sex, then this is the wrong movie for you. Your money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Yugo of Snow Tubes","review":"The first time I used this tube, it got a small hole on the seam. I was able to fix it. The second time I used the tube, it split a crack about two inches long. Because of the cold, the material became brittle, causing the crack.

I will not keep this book as it would have to ad lib through much of the content to make up for lack of information and misleading words. I am unable to regift it as I do not endorse the book.An example of incorrect infomation- The African flag is described to explain the colors of the candles used in celebrating Kwanza. There is no African flag....there are flags of the African countries and each has it's own color scheme.Yule is written in past tense as if this holiday is no longer celebrated. The name used to describe the people, Pagan, is not defined.Winter Solstice is used again and again but never explained as a holiday of Light but as a way to describe Yule.I am now suspect of all of the other information as misleading. I will not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!!!! I love the pictures and the stories!","review":"Finally here is a book that explores the Holidays for all cultures, all people.

While it manages to name most of the winter holidays and many different cultures, it contains grammatical errors and factual errors. The illustrations are horrendous.

Exercise 2 references 1. 3 references 1. 4 references 2. 4 references 1. 5 reference 4 AND 2. When I was doing exercise 5 it took me 15 minutes to figure out just what it was asking, and I'm still not sure that I got it right. I've never seen any other book chain reference like that before. In my opinion, referencing should make you look at no more than one other contiguous and non-further-referencing block of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book (I borrowed it, thank God). It is sparse on several subjects, exercises lacks answers and the book is in general poorly written.

Topics are presented very briefly with poor examples. Only a very small number of the questions have solutions, none of which are in the book. They are only available on the author's web site and some of them are wrong. The author really doesn't present his algorithms in a stepwise bulleted manner, even though most of them are well suited to that type of display. He chooses instead to bury algorithms in blocks of text, which makes it very difficult to use this book as a reference for assignments. His terminology is also very unclear. Unless you are already an expert, you will find yourself rereading sections four and five times before realizing that they are just plain inscrutable without some large body of prior knowledge.

For a guy who used to complain that a half-hour newscast wasn't long enough to adequately convey news, it's disappointing to see so many interesting moments in time (Walter's role in covering the Apollo 11 moon landing is a good example) get such short shrift.This book reads like it was dictated into a tape recorder. There's a continual \\"then there was the time I...\\" approach to introducing the various anecodtes, and while I suppose a straight chronological approach might not have worked, it's jarring to read about LBJ's reaction to the Kennedy assassination several chapters BEFORE Cronkite recalls the assassination itself.It'll be up to someone else to do the definitive Cronkite biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cronkite Got Into Everything...","review":"Had I read this when I was taking journalism classes in secondary school, I probably would've pursued that career instead of what I chose.

In the days of WWII, he was a courageous man who flew bombing missions,risking his life with the soldiers of the AAF. In the early days of TV news he helped define the style of TV news. But in the years hence he has become yet another pompous, self-important hack. His criticisms are shallow, and his ego inflated.

He uses words well and tells a very interesting history of his time as a reporter. He seems to have been a very adventurous man and never passed up a chance to attempt something new, though dangerous. He is humorous, accurate and, seemingly, modest. If you lived your life during the period he tells about you will feel a great amount of nostalgia. Mr. Cronkite met and interviewed, or just talked with, many people whose names you will recognize: LBJ, JFK, Harry Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR, Anwar Sadat, Jimmy Carter and more.

This CD could have been amazing, but quite frankly, the WAY-overused female vocals messed the whole thing up. This truly is the only thing I am complaining about on this album but it is an EXTREME flaw. This music is not trance anymore, it is regular-sung songs with an occasion tranced out instrumental here and there.

This author continually referenced authors by name throughout the book and if they are as boring as he was then I'll never know what they wrote about.This is a very boring book to read and I wouldn't suggest anyone pay retail for it.

If your playstation is model 1000-3000's then its going to crash at a certain part. I am literally stuck at a spot and I cannot move forward in the game because my PS2 model is outdated.Apparently, it has something to do with the DVD layering and it causes the outdated PS2's to simply hang, stall, and in my case simply crash. I am going back to Electronic Boutique to get an exchange for something else.Like I said, I really enjoyed what I played so far, but I couldn't begin to give it five stars for only completing half of the game.P.S The cut scenes were a bit too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy or hard?","review":"Xenosaga was a good game,but not the greatest game.It was full of mini games that were very much entertaining.It had a great combat system.There was a good story and good music,though at times sounded err.....quewr and the charecters looked a bit childish,but in the end i thought it was worth it.I liked other rpg's better like Xenogears.If you don't like ahh, games that are in a series then dont buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Game!","review":"I wasn't sure if I'd like this game, but I'm glad I took that risk! It does have long movies in between, but it gets you into the story. The only thing negative about this game (I think) is that the battles are too easy. There's a lot of walking around and exploring to do. This game will keep you really busy. The graphics are awesome, and this game can last up to 80 hours. So it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Epic game","review":"This game has an extremely engrossing story that involves a great amount of biblical and theological references. There is also so much detail in character development, we see why characters are the way they are, what events led them to walk the path they did. The graphics are anime style but are so smooth and look great. This review is short, but if you are very much satisfied by an in depth, well written, epic storyline with excellent character development, xenosaga must be given a chance by you. Although episode 2 does stumble and seems to step back a notch in story, the whole series, Episode 1-3, is of the most unique gaming experiences out there. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start- but a breathtaking finish","review":"I've played a lot of RPGs... and have been into robot anime since GUNDAM series. Xenosaga slaps all this together and adds a healthy dose of existential philosophy which is gently sugar coated so it doesn't get too thick. I have to admit the game has a VERY slow start and I almost put it aside running around the simulation level at the beginning since the between-combat movement seemed so poor (fixed camera etc). But slowly more characters join and one gets a hang of the complex 'experience' points (three types, Ether/magic. Skill and Tech-by far the most precious) and combat system. Close to the end, (not 80 hours as advertised but more like 40-50) I was hoping the game would last twice as long. So, just have patience with the first part (Woglinde) and things will get interesting very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: \\"Awesome\\"","review":"It's a very good game, if you are a true RPG gamer.Very good graphics & Sound.

Watching cinematric scenes up 45 minutes in places. Even though this is a downfall there is still the awsome graphics to look at. The mini-games are interesting to explore. I spent 20 hours alone just playing them. While blowing up crates can get boring after awhile it nver gets old. The Tech Attacks take forever to level up. The same can be said for the skills and ether. When you get the chance raise your attributes it will help a lot.

Xenogears fans- you will NOT be disappointed. Namco has started a masterpiece! Everything about the game: musical score, environmental detail, characters, plot, voice talent, seamless cinematics, and much more will win the tastes of the most cynical gamer.At first, after hearing Squaresoft appointed Namco to put together Xenosaga, I was bitter about it and thought it would be lame. I was very much mistaken. Put simply, Xenosaga is the \\"Xenogears\\" of 2003 so to speak.Graphic, vivid content in the cinematics makes the turn of events even more real and sucks in the gamer's attention immediately. I was only 30 hours into the game and already I couldn't wait for Episode Two! This game is a must-have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmmm im not quite sure","review":"Anybody who plays this and has never played xenogears it's a lot better. unfourtionitly i played xenogears first and it's just not up to fei and elly's standards.

Sure there is the creepy relationship between Jr and Momo, but that's just not good enough.

How in god's name did you all give this game a 5?? You want a good game that's similart to this, Get shadow hearts (preferably 2) it's a THOUSAND times better.

I was thouroughly impressed by the graphics and story line. Though confusing at first, the story sort of developed it self quite quickly. I enjoy this game, I recommend this to people who liked games like Chrono Trigger and/or Cross, FF X, and Kingdom Hearts. Though it has a tough time competing with games like .hack, it is worth the money. If you don't like dialogue heavy games, then don't get this one.

I was extremely wrong.The game has terrible play with a very dull, very long story. It takes around 10 hours just to get INTO the game, and to be able to actually DO anything. Some may say just to buy it to see a great \\"movie-game\\", but it would not even qualify for that. The \\"cutescenes\\" are non-cinematic and are much too long to keep your interest.The only thing GOOD I would say about the game is the fact that it keeps stupid gamers busy playing it while the more sophisticated, real gamers are talking about (and playing) the REAL games."},{"rating":"1","title":"All it did was freeze","review":"I heard that this game was good so I rented it at Blockbuster. When I put the disk in it froze when I hit \\"New Game\\" on the menu. I tried to do this may times and shut off my PS2 twice, but it still froze.

It kept doing this as soon as the music started, so I returned t and got my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda like a movie","review":"hmm.this i a great game, But it takes patience getting into.the cinematics in this game are a big part of what makes it so enjoyable.I'd say, at times it's kinda like playing thorought a movie. the battle system in the game is quite good, and it's rather inovative as well.Overall, the game was heavily story based and less game-play oriented.there is hardly a wrong way to do anything in the game, it's very straightforward.So, if you are looking for a really good story to play through, pick this game up, it's great. =]"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY GOOD GAME","review":"I absolutely LOVE this game. However, you are FORCED to read the text being displayed on the screen as the characters speak during cutscenes.

If you lie on the floor and place it between you and the floor you are quite likely to be injured, if not from the device directly from the muscle strain to hold a part of your back so high off the floor, while the rest of your back has no support.The instructions clearly state that this should not be rolled on the back (which is one way I expected to use it) and that lying on top of it is the only acceptable use. I will be returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"The first thing I noticed when I tried out the Maxi Backsie was that it pressed hard against my spine, which I consider very bad, esp. for the lower spine. I wouldn't want to whittle it down, either, because there would not be enough wood to withstand much weight and it's made of two pieces. I'm quite thin; maybe a fat man wouldn't mind the pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't match picture","review":"The item I received did not match the picture shown on the site at the time I ordered (and the time of this review). The item pictured has rubber rings on the ends of the roller and smooth, angled slopes from edge to inner track. The item I received had no rubber rings and a ridged flat slope from edge to inner track. Consequently, the roller I received slipped easily and after several uses the ridged portion began to cut my back. Home Naturals Inc.'s customer service rep was polite, but not terribly helpful. Amazon's customer service rep was fantastic though and resolved things to my satisfaction. I subsequently ordered theBody Back Company Back Rollersold through Amazon directly (which has the exact same item pictured for a couple of bucks more - unsurprisingly Amazon actually sent the item pictured instead of a poor substitute ;-) which I've found to work very nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil Laws , Their Effect on History","review":"This is an excellent book concerning civil laws in war time, everyone should read it, most especially those who believe that we have \\"lost\\" our civil liberties during the past several years.

I just received this book, and I have not even begun to read it, but it is very poorly binded. The edges of the pages are different sizes and it appears zig-zagged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, but unsatisfying","review":"While a surprisingly engaging descriptive story of Civil War, World War I and II vignettes, this book was far from the \\"major contributor to our understanding of the great American experiment\\" that the dust jacket proclaims. Mr. Rehnquist is adequate in his historical background, and obviously enjoys explaining the history of the Supreme Court. I voraciously read the entertaining beginning chapters, expecting them to be a prelude to incisive commentary and analysis, only to find that the shallow descriptive text was all there was. By the final, repetitive chapter, I was left wondering what the point of the book was. While I appreciated the books accessiblity to the non-lawyer, more critical thinking would have been appropriate from the Chief Justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tune Belt","review":"This is great---if I can get the extender to connect it will be terrific.

Definately not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I admit that I bought this CD because it was cheap and I wanted the \\"free-over-$25 shipping\\". I wish there had been sample soundtracks, but I figured the songs could be horrible and I wouldn't regret having spent $1.75. I have been pleasantly surprised! The tunes are catchy, the lyrics original (gotta love \\"I Love Mud,\\" \\"I'm Not Tired\\" or \\"Multiple Mom,\\" a child acknowledging her multi-tasking mom and vowing to help her out!), and my 4 year old son plays it repeatedly (and I'm not completely sick of it yet!).

Thank goodness I was armed with a general knowledge of REALbasic before I started trying to use this. In addition, explanations are thin, and helpful tips (like cutting and pasting repetitious code) and almost non-existent. The projects are worthwhile, though, if you can get past the poor production of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I had anticipated this book for a while, and unfortunately it was quite disappointing. Like the previous comment, I had noticed a section where the sample code was a duplicate of the previous chapter. That's an error too large to miss during editing. Another error I noticed was that one of the shortcut keys listed was incorrect. I couldn't figure out why something wasn't working out correctly, until I happened to try using different key combinations. The author had printed control, when he meant the command key.Also, the sample applications listed were a bit too rudimentary. I felt the author had good intentions, but the applications could have been a little more robust. It truly seems like the book was rushed to print. Sadly, ended up returning the book, because it's definitely not worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly helpful","review":"I would steer clear of this book. I bought it on a whim at a brick and mortar store, because it was the only bok on REALbasic they had. Caveat Emptor.

The predominant view has proven once again to be justified. I'm sorry I let my optimism lead me to purchase this book to find out. It really is a badly edited collection of unexplained and useless gimmicks. If there is a concept presented that has any worth in learning to write your own code, than it is extremely well hidden among the error laden examples.I have every book on RealBasic available now, and the O'Reilly book is the only one that truly helps one learn the product AND programming. On the other hand, Eric's book is good to build confidence without much lasting programming value. This book cannot claim to teach or build confidence - although I found it an interesting exercise debugging and proofreading the text and code - representing perhaps the only real experience to be gained through the use of this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Paper its printed on","review":"This book is poorly written. It is hard to follow along and reproduce the examples. Worse still, some examples do not work as shown. Plus, the book is way out of date.

I liked this book, it shows how to flex SOME of the muscle of the RealBasic engine in smart and informative ways. I would say the cover price is a little much. That's why used book stores do business with Amazon. If you are new to RealBasic, I would say get the book, but not for $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This book is far from its promises. Big fonts and a lot of images... No contents. How to throw away [money]. I did it :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the dark emotions","review":"I couldn't find any romance in this book. There were too many ill-feelings, hate, misunderstandings and animosity between the two characters. Very disappointed even with the quick ending how both characters resolved their anger and discovered that they loved each other only lasted a couple of paragraphs. It was such a downer and nothing in the book brought any positive feelings. I enjoy other Marton books, but please remember that these are \\"romance books\\" not \\"negative, I hate you\\" that went on during the majority of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good dance dvd to watch & learn from","review":"This is a great video for dancers! All the dancers have beautiful costumes and look professional, and the sets are nice without interfering with the enjoyment of the dance. Some of my favorite dancers are on this DVD: Zaheea and Sandra! I also learned about some new dancers that are now on my list to watch. The music was well-selected and there wasn't a single performance that made me cringe (cannot say the same for some other recent releases). Because the videography was geared towards making the dance easy to watch, it was very easy to take in the whole performance. The camera did not linger on the face or just one part of the body, but instead showed the whole body. At the same time, perspectives did change to make it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"It was a complete waste of money for me. I was very dissapointed.

Some of the biographies could qualify for an entry to the wikipedia- others barely merit an entry in a bibliography...for a high school term paper. The illustrations are inked by the same undistinctive hand- which is rather sad and occasionally pathetic. The absence of context- the absence of variety, the absence of flavor all make for a very dull and uniforming \\"encyclopedia\\" indeed.

In fact, I have been trying to get rid of these allergies for 13 years. Now that I have bought this book and checked with an actual NAET practitioner for the causes of these allergies, I have not had symptoms even though I have been exposed to the same causes. It is AMAZING! My allergic rashes have been eliminated for good it seems. I never thought this would be possible. Thank you Dr. Nambudripad! Oh and everyone who is suffering from allergies should ABSOLUTELY check this book out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for allergy patients","review":"As soon as I bought this book, I was intrigued by the possibilities it offered compared to traditional medicine with the only possibility of avoidance or desensitization with injections. This new treatment that Dr. Nambudripad offers seems to be non-invasive and safe. However, the results sold me on the idea. I visited an NAET practitioner in Vancouver and was delighted by the whole protocol of the treatment. It doesn't hurt and can definitely stop allergies, like my cat hair allergy.

The book helped me to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to have if you are receiving treatments","review":"I have been having treatments since June of 2012.

None of the women got completely nude in their teases and the music was terrible and I know DJ Vlad is better than that! I would not recommend this DVD to guys (and/or women) who want to see beautiful brazilian babes mixed with great music, if you want that then get HIP HOP BADGIRLS and HIP HOP HONEYS: BRAZIL BOOM BOOM, those are great DVDs. This DVD boast a beautiful brazil babe named BABALU (who,like most brailian babes in these type of dvds, is a pornstar) and even she didn't get completely nude. The music was horrible compared to the dvds I mentioned, I know DJ Vlad can do better, lets hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffett In Beantown","review":"Jimmy Buffett has released numerous live albums in his career, but what makes Live At Fenway Park interesting is that it contains a DVD of part of the performance.

There are four songs off his last studio effort, Licensed To Chill, that make their live album debuts and some nice Buffett chestnuts that don't get a lot of attention like the masterful \\"The Great Filling Station Hold-Up\\" & \\"Cuban Crime Of Passion\\". There are the familiar covers, \\"Southern Cross\\", \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" and two very interesting ones, a version of the Grateful Dead's \\"Scarlet Begonias\\" and a rousing go at \\"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\\" which Mr. Buffett sings with glee. The real bonus for Parrotheads is the DVD that shows a small portion of the historic show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Dissapointment","review":"This is a very disappointing album from a talented artist. The set includes two CDs and a poorly edited DVD. For the most part, I doubt that the producers put a whole lot of effort into making this set. The DVD does not include his most popular songs and looks very amateurish. It needs a real editor.The CDs are at least as bad. The instruments override the vocals on most numbers and there is too much verbiage. I got sick of Buffett telling us how much he loves Boston; sing for God's sake...don't talk. Also the electronic tags which identify the song to the track number were mostly wrong...100% wrong on the second CD and partially wrong for the songs at the end of the first CD. When I click on the track showing \\"Margaritaville\\", I want to hear that song, not \\"Respect\\" (arguably the best song on the album) instead.A previous reviewer commented that Buffett appeared tired and bored. A close look at the band's demeanor in the DVD verifies it.Overall, a major disappointment.Tom"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been sooooo much better","review":"These CDs say they take the feed straight from the sound board, and therefore you get what you get or what actually happened. That's completely true. So when the performance is flat, that's what you get. Buy the Hawaii album. It's much better, and there is energy in the performance. I think the \\"Ike Turner\\" review above was a little harsh, but they hit the nail on the head with the comment about emphasizing the last word in each verse. That's overused on this album.

Please just give it up and spend your twilight years listening to musicians who still care about what they do like your pal Bill Jabanoski.

Each of these events caused a financial crisis for us, a crisis because, in part, we did not know and do what this book teaches.The major points of this book are presented in diagrams and this was critical to us, because, like most people, much of our family can't make sense of numbers and time. Just like the author, we learned from our educated parents what to NOT do financially, because what we learned was what worked in the 1950's and 1960's.

I have observed the self-destructive behaviors that Kiyosaki describes in the people around me, as well as some of the wealth-building behaviors. This book helps to understand how these behaviors were learned, and how to begin to unlearn them. He does a great job of presenting simple criteria to judge assets vs. liabilities (and it's more refined and useful than the definition most people use). I already had faith that understanding basic concepts about money is essential for everyone who handles it, so I can without reservation say that everyone who is responsible for their own money should read this.

Well it takes a non-stop up-market to do this. The author seems to say that his 'Dad' is a loser- [I take off 2 points for this-- we should not dishonor Dads like this and this particular 'Dad' seems to be merely a literary device-- not a real person.The author seems to say that only suckers and losers invest in 401k funds.

However, the only advice I received from this book was that I needed to become financially educated and that I should read more books.

I can read a million books about finances and if they have as much sound advice as this book did, I will die a very poor man.If you want an entertaining book, this is the book for you.

I loved that this book emphasized the principles of finance and investing in a simple, clear-cut way, which made it very easily understood.Kiyosaki really went above and beyond in writing this book, and is very inspirational and informative in his writing style. My only complaint is that the book was published in 1997 when the market was more optimistic to growth; therefore you must reevaluate the information presented to concur with the present state of the U.S economy.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a solid understanding of business fundamentals and wishes to gain knowledge of assets vs. liabilities in regard to Investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I like Rich Dad Poor Dad?

Mr.Kiyosaki lays out how wealthy people think and why its easy for them to make money constantly and consistently, where even the most educated of us struggle needlessly.This book is transformative in the easy way it makes you come around to its way of thinking. Because of this book I ended up writing three books of my own, all of them available on amazon.comWith all of the books shortcomings you can tell that Kiyosaki is interested in one thing and one thing only, your well being. He is sincere about his four pillars of success and in that sincerity you want to change.This is a powerful book and sits in my top ten lists of motivatioinal books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich","review":"The book illustrated a lot of points.

If that ever stopped, you'd see the demand for housing dry up in a hurry.The best investment is an investment in YOU. Education, education, education. That will matter the most in the long run.

While this book did have some interesting insights and tips, it left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to advocate being rather cut-throat to get what you want. I guess if you don't mind walking on the poor and middle classes, then this is your way to wealth. I get the whole point of not living in fear, but does that mean you must intimidate others? I guess I'm one of those people who value honesty and decency over mounds of money. Who wouldn't want to be rich? But I'm not willing to sell my soul to get there.

Mostly just buzz words being thrown around.Don't get me wrong, this is an easy read and somewhat motivational but I would not purchase this book thinking you are getting any real investment ideas. The book talks of \\"Rich Dad's\\" success but there is no real rich dad. When Kiyosaki was asked if rich dad was real he compared to rich dad to Harry Potter.Before taking any of his ideas seriously, please enter his name on wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book should certainly be in your library. I did not give it 5 stars because he does get a little overboard on the self promotion in a few chapters, which as a reader was a bit of a turn off, however I felt like my money was well invested.I would highly recommend this book to those looking to move forward in their financial goals in life, and also to 18 or so year olds who are trying to understand the meaning of money and how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Author -> Rich Author","review":"In 2004, Mr. Kiyosaki made lecture tours in Asia. In Hong Kong, thousands attended his lecture. The ticket price for the event was a toweing 2500 Chinese dollars, which was the equivalent of 250 US Dollars! The audience came out of the lecture largely disappointed. Most claimed it was a superficial event, in which Mr. Kiyosaki bragged about his own success as an author and povided almost no valuable insight into anything else.While we are enjoying the book Rich Dad, Poor dad. Mr. Kiyosaki is certainly enjoying his climb to the top with outrageously priced worthless lectures...The guy deserves a hand of applause"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must for parents and teachers.","review":"As a Business person and high school teacher I've found it perplexing as to how to explain to the present generation in our schools what is happening to the world of work and money. The author makes it all so very clear. Three of my senior business maths class have ordered the book - with me having read a just a few paragraphs to them from it - they say they have learned more in the last few lessons about money than in their whole school career so far. I wish some enlightened teacher had read it when I was at school. Get it yourself and a copy for your school library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!!","review":"I read this book for my Economics class and I hated it! The author said whatever he said on the book simply because he is rich. If he were poor, then he would've said something completely different. I think only rich people can relate to this book, which is weird because this book was written for poor people who want to be rich. Next, the author keeps talking about the same idea over and over again. It is so boring!! This book is also making it seems like education is not as important as it really is. I found this book really disturbing and reprehensible. DO NOT buy this book! [The price] may not seem a lot, but believe me, for this book, that amount seems TOO MUCH! If you are really financially literate\\" like the author thinks all rich people are, you will get smart and spend your money on something else. Whatever it is, trust me, it's wayyy better worth spending than this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale","review":"This is a good fairy tale, nothing in this book is true. I will agree that after reading the book you will be motivated and encourage to do many things.Haven't you ever heard, that if anything is to good to be true, than it probably is) Kiyosaki is rich, however only by us the consumer buying his fairy tale books.I would recommend that you go to the library and check the book out instead of buying it. I would rate this book higher, but after reading and looking for information, Kiyosaki does not have any facts to go with his information about the book.Amway is one of his major assests/backing. Did you know that he will give free speeches for Amway, however charges everyone else a fee.If you look in the Smart Money Magazine, Feb 2003, they will tell you the same thing I trying to tell you. Kiyosaki is using someone else story and making money off of it.No facts to back up his ventures, which is a big downer, ( I thought this guy was the real deal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I can't understand the popularity of this book, and the string of exploitative titles that came after it. The so-called financial advice is simplistic and obvious, presented in poor to average writing and laughably unconvincing anecdotes.I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Paper","review":"This book will not make you rich. This guy made a bunch of money in real estate by buying properties that increased in value, but he hints that many of those opportunities are gone or difficult to find. He says that you should own a business instead of working for someone else. This is good advice, but not worth buying the book. He says that you should not borrow heavily (home, auto, etc) since you're throwing money away. Again, good advice, but not worth buying the book. Beyond these, the book doesn't say much. It's a waste of paper, with a catchy title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I don't understand why people recommend this book. It is filled with useless information.

All in all, the book wont really teach you much.

I can thank this book for steering me away from it!*ASSET vs LIABILITY awsome thing to keep in your head at all times when your in a spendy mood!All in all it was a pretty good book for me for just those two reasons. Unfortunately I cannot give it more than 2 stars for the simple fact that most of the book lives a lie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"Some interesting philosophies. I couldn't agree more that people live beyond their means by adjusting their spending to their income. Basically we do not save enough in an effort to keep up with the Joneses. I am not sure I needed a book to tell me that.As far as his advice, I felt like I was reading an infomercial about buying and leveraging real estate. Works if you know that you are doing and the timing is right, but taking your savings and leveraging it into a downpayment on a distressed piece of real estate is marginal investment advice at best. In the next downturn many foreclosure companies are bound to make a mint if people follow this advice. It is kind of like doubling your bet everytime you win in Vegas. It can make you tremendously wealthy until the inevitable time when you lose and there is nothing left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, hyperbole only","review":"Kiyosaki presents nothing new that our grandparents knew about - honest living, not making wild claims or dreams, and live reasonably. Many of his works are repetitive and dreary, with no real breakthroughs, and advocating the haphazard things like MLM, which aren't exactly cutting-edge or sure thing. Stay away from hyperbole like this, and perhaps, if you read the likes of \\"The Art of Happiness at work\\", or even \\"Dot Zen\\" by a bunch of new Asian authors, you might learn something new. Oh yes, Tuesdays with Morrie works for me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If there is any good information in tis book it is over 40 pages till you get to it. So far after reading the first 40 pages the only thing I learned to make me richer is don't buy this book.

Co-writer Sharon Lechter did a good job placing the story in the setting of two kids growing up. It makes the simple content digestible.But then out of the blue Mr. Kiyosaki takes the word and it feels like the editor didn't have the time to finish her job. It is embarrassing to see K. showing off and telling us how he made his fortune being a real estate speculant.Regards,Norbert"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book for learning about money","review":"I found this book to be extremely inspirational. I am a college graduate, work in corporate America, and I've recently started my 401K without really understanding what it was about.

Kiyosaki lays out the mental, emotional, and real world business model for actually getting ahead and building a legacy of financial independence for yourself and your family. People always say they want the time and money to really enjoy life but few are willing to pay the price. Kiyosaki shows how you can get out of the \\"rat race\\" and make financial independence happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense and lack of applicability","review":"This book beats common sense issues to a bloody pulp causing the reader to want to pull his or her hair out. I read through this entire book just because I bought it and didn't want to waste my money. He has a lot of beneficial things that should be done if one wants to become financially secure. Some of the main things that ruined the book for me was him saying how he turned $5000 into a million dollars extremely easy and in a very short time. He also puffs seminars and other things that people like him profit off of. This book is probably good for someone in middle school that needs to get topics pounded into their heads.

Get out of the rat race: Stop working for money, and make money work for you.2. Invest in yourself: Learn about the investment vehicles available, so you can make the right decisions (Some of Kiyosaki's examples are too complex/outlandish for me at this point, but the idea is that its not so simple, so spend the time to learn)3.

However, Kiyosaki cannot support any of the claims he has made.

Or better yet, go to www.johntreed.com and look at his analysis of the book. He's done all the work for you! It is extremely interesting, especially after you've read the book!For anyone who is interested in financial freedom, I recommend researching authors before their buying books and then decide who you believe is crediable.

The simplicity of the examples in the book blew me away. I have never read a financial book that made so much sense. The concepts were so clear and I totally agree with them. I just wish I could have read it 40 years ago so I wouldn't have had to learn the hard way.I do agree with other reviewers that this book will probably not win any prizes for writing style, but the information is priceless.

It is amazing, and not a little sobering, that Kiyosaki's book which champions some of the worst traits in human nature, should be so popular.Kiyosaki worships greed, meanness, cunning, shrewdness and lack of compassion. It really is difficult to see how this man could say ANYTHING of value. His real dad may have been poor, but his real failure was in failing to teaching K. to be a full human being capable of intimacy and love. Instead what we see is a pushy and insecure consumer boasting of his Lamborghini's and Rolex's but unable to relate to other humans with decency and respect (unless they are rich).

To have spent his life working hard and sacrificing for his family, and the people of Hawaii, only to have his greatest notoriety come from his son writing about him so disrespectfully, broke my heart. Kiyosaki is simply a con man, exploiting people's hopes and dreams for his own gain and offering them nothing in return. He has no concept of what makes a person truly rich. He's a shallow, sad little man. Follow his advice and you'll end up the same - and you still won't have any money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiyosaki is a genius","review":"This is not the type of book I would read.

There's probably only about 35 pages of real content here, and an overabundance of fill and repetition make up the rest. In addition, the format of comaring Rich Dad and Poor Dad leaves a sour taste in this reader's mouth; I am uncomfortable with the aparent disdain the author has for his biological father. He may not actually feel this way (I certainly hope not!), but that is the impression one comes away with.In short, there are some very important lessons in this book, and it is worthwhile to extract these lessons, however distasteful some of the writing may appear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Dad, Self Absorbed Dad","review":"The basic gyst of this book is \\"find a way to get money to work for you,\\" i.e. invest it in something. The author is so self righteous and equates being rich with being and doing what's right.He gives a very weak defense about screwing other people to get there. Sure, there are lots of ways to get rich, but none of the ones he has listed will actually do anything good for society- his fortune was made almost completely off jacking up the price of real estate...not exactly something that I'd be proud of telling my kids about."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluff piece","review":"Like many other books in this genre,Rich Dad Poor Dad is heavy on potatoes,light on meat.Many of the \\"teachings\\" are basic and generic.There is no real teachings of money and/or investing.It seemed like an infomercial in text form.The book reminds me of an Amway rah rah session,but if this inspires one to delve deeper in a quest for money knowledge, then I suppose it would be money well spent. If you think that this book alone will answer your questions,look elsewhere.I have read this book twice ,on orders from my wife,and came away less impressed the second time. It is very quip heavy,I guess this style is supposed to motivate you to buy more of Mr. Kiyosaki's goods,but again its missing all the meat of money matters.There are many other books and videos that give a person more details and less antecdotes.Mr Kiyosaki seems to be more impressed in boasting of what he did instead of explaining WHAT he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel good book with no financial wisdom","review":"This is a great motivational book for the financial neophyte that wants to take charge of their life. That being said, there is NO information in this book to do just that! Robert T.

As I was reading this book I was waiting for the details, instructions, SOMETHING to point me in the direction to financial freedom that Robert T. Kiyosaki was talking about, but NOTHING!

Using his definitions of \\"assets\\" and \\"liabilities\\", he teaches the reader to use their money to invest in assets (thing that create money) and not liabilities (things that dont create money). The rest of the book is little stories and antidotes supporting this concept.I give it a 1 because there is little or no real world practical advice on how to actually do anything. Extensive research on the author reveals that his knowledge of things financial is virtually non existant. He is making all his money off of the sales of these books which started by selling them to Amway representitives at conventions...I love truth, I hate Liers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true story","review":"The idea that this book is a true story has been debunked many times, in most detail by John T. Reed. And it's unclear the Kiyosaki made any money investing in real estate, it seems much more likely his wealth stems from these books and the multi-level marketing schemes that helped make them successful.The book itself can be inspirational, but his specific advice is silly and wrong headed. Setup a corporation to get rich? Sure if you want to pay extra fees to lawyers and accounts and higher taxes. Deduct personal expenditures like watches and vacations from your taxes using your corporation? Sure if you want to commit tax fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock of .........","review":"The book begins by indicating Robert has two dads.

The only reason Kirosaki has best-selling books is because Amway leaders (mostly Dex Yager) pushed this book. Has dangerous advice (get rid of 401k, mutual funds bad) and give no specifics - mostly anecdotes and quick drawings - just like an Amway/Quixtar meeting. I should know, I was in the \\"business\\" for 4 years and when the leaders tell you to buy a book, the minions follow.My former upline has tried to push this book on me many times, calling it \\"revolutionary\\". I say check out John T.

It flashed upon me that I had been programmed from birth to not be rich just because of the things taught by parents, the school system and other non-rich friends and media.This books delves into the mindset of the rich, and hence by applying these principles in our lives, we should be able to change our whole logic and understand money better. It all makes sense now, the main idea to learn is \\"Don't work for money, make money work for you\\".Hey, I always thought my house was my biggest asset until I read this, and I now realise that is not so, and I agree with him too.

It's not very good although it may have some financial advice buried in it somewhere. The book was hard to read - Kiyosaku is not a professional writer and it shows.

The one good but certainly not ORIGINAL idea is that you shouldn't work for money but let your money work for you. And that's true, if you have any savings, it's folly to leave them earn 2% somewhere and then be taxed on that \\"income.\\" Anyway, the tone of the book is most irritating and condescending, but there is one part that is extremely telling, when he advises an author to take a sales course if she wants to sell her books. She gets annoyed at him for suggesting such a thing to a litterata, but that's exactly what Kiyosaki has done with his books, he's SOLD them well despite all the drivel.

He tends to say the same thing over and over again page after page. He goes on about assets vs liabilities for about 15 pages in one part.

However, I think that the biggest issue of this book not the advices themselves, but a promotion of sponger way of living. He clearly tells to take money from people without giving anything at all in exchange. He discourages readers to open their own companies stating that they cannot succeed, discourages to get education and do work which is useful to society. Or, to invest in third-party companies (well, he does tell to buy stocks, but only to sell it very soon for higher price). He never tell his readers to think what useful they can do. He brags how he deceives people, but this is not what somebody should be proud of.Also, the author's statement that everyone can make money this way apparently is not true. A society can bear only a small percentage of such spongers. Others have to produce values the spongers speculate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most awesome book that I have ever red.","review":"This book is pratical and chuck full of advice on how to correctly handle your money.

I now look at my possessions in a different light, that is worthless devaluing pieces of junk. Robert not only tells the reader what he/she should be spending their hard earned cash on but how to do it. The book is very user friendly. I felt as if I was talking to Robert on a one to one basis.

Build your asset column until it equals or surpasses your liabilities (or expenses), and you will have a sound base toward becoming rich. And he's absolutely right, provided you get your assets to that point.Otherwise he hints at a few pieces of asset-building ventures which I believe are best left to upper middle-class and wealthy folks (1031s, etc).His greatest point: THE NEED TO TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT FINANCIAL COMPETENCE AT AN EARLY AGE. Nothing more can be stressed except that, I'd say. He said it right...just because you're highly educated doesn't mean you'll be rich.

Rich Dad was a guru and the kids were his believers who were touched by an all knowing, all seeing all money-making spirit.There is nothing wrong about learning how to manage your money and keeping some of it away from predators, but he oversimplified the basic reality of our economic culture and really, I believe, insulted many people who work for a living. And what's with the charts anyway. Try giving the charts to a low income inner city single mother and see how she manages with your philosophy.

Kiyosaki knocks one out of the park with this stellar book about how we think about money. While many of Mr. Kiyosaki's ideas have been around for a while (Ayn Rand is the first one to come to mind), this is the most readable and actionable format I have seen.In short, the author takes us through the thoughts and actions of two men of influence in his early development. One (his father) is a well educated man who struggles to make and keep money. The second (his friends father) is a moderately educated man who understands money. As we watch the lessons from both father's we see ourselves and our potential.I found that this book has a number of life applications.

Soon after finishing the book, I started watching real estate sales and paying more attention to stocks and bonds. When starting the book, I had nothing invested and less then a few hundred saved. Remembering I've only had 3 months since the book reading, I now have $500 in stocks and bonds and have made an unspeakable ammount from real estate purchase and reselling.

And his book offer NONE....The whole thing is we are part of one of his other formulas to make money..I think the best books are people who truly write to contribute their knowledge, but not thinking about typing something up and seeing if they can make it big...as this book does...if your skeptical buy it, read it, then return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the IRS","review":"Didn't care for this book, for all the reasons listed here and more. His advice is spotty at best, and at often times crosses into the illegal category.

Nothing wrong with this, except be prepared to prove that those expenses are for the business and not personal use.

Specifically if you haven't already started bad habits you can really learn a lot from this book. Kiyosoki is very thick in his conclusions, meaning he takes a long while to reach his point. I would recommend this book to any young person or even mid-age investors. It will not give you specifics put it will begin to bring things together and put it all in perspective once and for all.

I am also an entrepreneur. I have read many self-help books. I find most of them kind of silly and useless. However, Rich Dad Poor Dad is inspiring.In this book, Robert Kiyosaki tells the story of two fathers, a poor teacher who is highly educated, and a rich, self taught millionaire with no college degree. He tells about how the rich man teaches him life lessons by driving the values of hard work and acquiring assets into his head. Kiyosaki is a superstar when it comes to motivational thought, so there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said; except for the fact that I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who hopes to improve his financial station in life.Hope this helps.-Craig Nybo, co-author ofTotal Human: The Complete Strength Training System"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book is definitely a start to creating financial intelligence.

It is full of contradictions, and the deals discussed in this book never happened. Why should you trust what he says about getting rich when he is dishonest and hasn't done those very things? The good part about the book is that it gets you thinking about the fact that there is a way to be rich and it isn't the way of the middle class- but you had better search for other reading on the subject to find realistic and practical ways for you to get there.P.S. There is no real \\"Rich Dad\\" as the book leads on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average guy or girl","review":"After getting through all the fluff Rich Dad is basically for people who want to embark in a career in real estate or their own business. It can work, but it is not a realistic approach for the average guy or girl who want's to have more money over time. This is more like a get rich quick idea then common sense on living below your means and investing small amounts over time. He kind of looks down on us regular folks who don't want to flip houses or take those kind of risks in real estate. Their are some good ideas in this book and some motivational stories too, but as a realistic approach on retiring with dignity, don't bother. If you want to go out on your own and take a chance, then it will be a worth while read, but if you want a common sense approach on investing, buy the Automatic Millionaire instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too elementary for this reader...","review":"This book seems to written with a dictaphone some laxy evening after the author had a couple of stiff drinks. The only challege he undertook was to write a book with no research and no guidance for the wanting reader. The book seriously lacks any statistical or quantitative facts and instead opts to focus on a rambling storytelling nature of stories that are based much more on fiction than fact. I would recommend that the author sober up and write something with some utility. The problem with the book is that it has an illuminating title.

Make your money work. That is how the rich got rich, and the poor are poor. Because the rich make their money work. Get the idea???

Evidently, to learn some ways you can accumulate all those assets you have to buy his OTHER books!!!Although he mentions that the rich incorporate themselves, he does not go into how one does this, why, what it does for you, & any reasons why you should not.This book is like 1 of those TV get-rich infomercials where they keep saying \\"this system will get you rich\\". We watch the whole thing because we keep thinking they will mention HOW.

I appreciate his style and purpose of teaching readers the differences between an asset and a liability. And even more his teachings of what he classifies as the four quadrants E (Employee)/S (Self employed or Small business)/B (Big Business)/I (Investor).

The average working way to think about making money. This book tells you how to think differently about whole the idea of making money. This book won't tell you how to make a single cent, but rather how to notice opportunities and strike when the average person would stand back and say \\"you're crazy for doing this\\".

This is the most poorly written book I have read in a long time! It contains nothing but the author's self serving stories and few really bad pieces of advice. Seriously, I don't see how this book can have such a high rating unless Kyosaki is rating his own book under false names.If you are serious about investing and about achieving financial independence, save your money and read a SERIOUS book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"What a useless piece of junk. Filled with platitudes, generalizations and repeats the same nonsense over and over. The straw was at the end where the author tries to sell the reader a bunch of his way overpriced books and games.No wonder this guy is rich. He basically steals your money by writing hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"real eye opener","review":"This book is a real eye opener for. How a book so poorly written, lack of substance and specific could be on the best seller list?! I bought the book after reading some pages on chapter one that seem to be a good introduction to more good advices to come. The problem is that the whole book IS the introduction! Mr. Kiyosaki is the true master of the art of talking-for-hours-without-telling-you-anything. I should have listened to those 1-star reviewers.For those of you who found this book useful please seek professional advice before spending more money on more books, seminor or games from this guy. It's a SCAM."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much value","review":"I fail to understand all the praise for this book. All of his books make just one basic point \\"you should let your money work for you by investing wisely, don't just rely on your salary\\". Do you need to read 200 page books to understand this point? There is no practical actionable advice for the novice investor, just oft repeated principles reiterated many times using his rich dad.Another thing that is irritating is the fact that he keeps repeating one and the same thing like going to school is not very useful etc.You wil learn a lot more about investing from other more focused books and websites like motley fool, morning star etc. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the best example of the worst of this genre!","review":"The most disturbing thing about this book was what appeared to me to be a spirit of meanness and an attitude of downright contempt toward his real father for being poor. In addition, I don't think the useful concepts are well explained or in other cases completely explained. Overall, I think this book is a poor oversimplification of the wealth process that has probably done more harm than good. If you want something that is more edifying, but still fairly simple with some useful straightforward advice try \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\" by Eker. I'm also sure you will find many other useful titles scattered throughout other reviews of this book. I actually got a bit physically ill when I read this book, which sums up my overall opinion of this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another scam","review":"Delusional hypnosis is what Mr. Kiyosaki's using to sell his book. The only thing that he taught me was how to sell nothing, his book that is, at a profit, my money that is. Save yourselves money and time and don't buy this book, it's dangerous. People like Mr. Kiyosaki have mastered the art of getting people exited and nothing else, and that's the brutal truth. If you want to be your own boss go franchise and work your butt off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I buy this book as gifts!","review":"I buy this book as gifts for the kids of my poor relatives. There's little hope for them becoming wealthy because they are democrats, but their kids still have time to become successful. A lot of things in the book do not fit the world view of their parents and it's obvious that their parents are financially illiterate. All the kids need are better ideas for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book!","review":"The book took about 3 weeks to get here and when it finally arrived, it wasn't even the right order.

If the author really cared about the financial responsibility of readers he would reccomend for them to save their money and not buy his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Dr. Stanley instead","review":"This book is almost an entire contrast to the MUCH BETTER BOOK The Millionaire Next Door by Tom Stanley. How on earth can Mr. Kiyosaki imply that people should wait to buy a house until they can pay cash?? Who can actually do this? Also, he implies that a college education is not important in order to achieve wealth. Does he know that Dr. Stanley has done the research and has shown that less than 25% of all millionaires in the U.S. do not have 4 year degrees? The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because I agreed with him on the importance of cashflow from investments. Stick to Stanley, he has actually done the research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Moly! Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.","review":"This book passes off boring stories of flipping property and investing in mutual funds as investment advice. I think his approach is shallow and borderline reckless. I am an entrepeneur on my 2nd business so I understand risk. Risk is calculated and based on knowledge. This book does a poor job of laying out a responsible way to deal with money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been said in 20 pages","review":"Several hundred pages of 'Buy assets. Don't buy liabilities. Go look for good investments rather than sitting around and drinking beer all the time.

It has some useful info, but no more than 20 pages worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"This book left me frustrated. It tells all about what you *should* do and *should* get in order to have a cycle of passive income, but does not tell you HOW!Anyone with an interest in finances already knows what they should do and should have. What's the \\"down & dirty\\" of HOW?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I Have Read","review":"\\"Rich Dad\\" is one of the worst books I have ever read. If you are not a member of the Kyosaki cult and care to know why, read on.My beef with this book is that it doesn't do what it claims to do. There is very little advice and information in this book. It does NOT tell you what the \\"rich tell their kids\\", it does not give you a roadmap or even well structured ideas as to what you need to do to put yourself on the road to financial well being. All I was able to get out of the book are some general statements that things will go well if I invest. Invest in what? Invest how? Kyosaki's boastful stories, which are liberally used throughout the book, do very little to provide any real information.This is not the book that I was looking for, and I suspect that it is not the one you want either.Try instead \\"Smart Couples Finish Rich\\". Now that's a book that has something real to say. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder people get schlacked by hucksters...","review":"This book is garbage, psycho babble. I am a financial planner, CFP, MBA. I had clients keep referring to this book, so I had to read it. Just garbage. Orman, Edelman, and now this guy. Slick psycho babble devoid of substance. Notice none of these guys have any education or substantial credentials. I feel sorry for people who waste their money on this stuff. Read \\"Financial Planning for Dummies\\" and \\"The only investment guide you'll ever need\\" by Tobias. Also, read \\"the wealthy barber.\\" Those are great book with substance. Tobias is a little glib, but I have never been able to find fault with his advice.By the way, don't be too impressed by the CFP credential. Its amazingly easy to get. Look for MBA's with finance backgrounds and financial planning training. CFP's with English majors don't really understand finance.But be leary of this book. Its very thin on substantive advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no secret formula to wealth.","review":"There is no secret formula to wealth, but that's what the author implies. I have a JD/MBA and I am an entrepreneur owning several businesses. Obviously, i have learned a great deal from books, but this book is an outrage. From its offensive title to the insipid dribble he feeds us for 200 pgs, Kiyosaki fails to say anything. He has become fabulously wealthy by duping us into spending $12 of our hard-earned cash to tell us things that are trite (most of the book), misleading (our house is not an asset), or wrong (taxes punishes the wealthy). Howard Schulz, Jack Welsh, and Sam Walton all had poor dads who taught them one thing-- hard work, dedication, and passion are the keys to success. Please, if you want to read this book, CHECK IT OUT FROM THE LIBRARY!!!! and read it critically. Don't let him fool you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"repulsive","review":"What a waste of time. This book is suggested by Quixstar/Amway types, need I say more. Kiosaki does not give any relevant information at all. This book will be viewed as great by people that mindlessly go about reading and are not too astute on business and the economy. His one sentence advice (buy low sell high type stuff) is thoughtless and he seems like a shady type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Kiyosaki is rich b/c of his books, not b/c of his wisdom","review":"Worst financial book I have ever read. This book should be used for HS kids. I found it funny how Mr Kiyosaki claims he paid 3.5 million for his house...yet the tax records show it was nearly 1/3 of that. You would be better to buy 1 share of stock...at least you have potential to get your money back. HAHA! Seriously...Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Paradigm Shift for Most People","review":"Robert Kiyosaki's thinking, and this book in particular, helped me make an immense paradigm shift. Prior to reading this book, I had goals of a certain income or having a certain amount of money. This book changed everything and got me to focus on passive income and having money work for me! It only took me six months to fully apply Kiyosaki's principles to the extent that I would never have to work again. As a result, I can easily say that this is perhaps the most valuable book I have ever read about money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic ideas","review":"If you have no idea of any socioeconomics trends today (=the rich get richer), you should check out this book. However, if you want to save yourself some valuable time, the main idea in this book is that you should invest in long-term assets that create a constant cashflow. This way, you will have cash in the short-term while the underlying asset may appreciate so you can get a capital gain on it(i.e. a stock, or in his case, real estate). This book could've gotten the point across in 10 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I saw Oprah pushing this book on her show so I decided to check it out. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Kiyosaki spends the first third of the book explaining the difference between an asset and a debit. At 40+ years old, I don't need that explained to me. Then the author went on and on about how he worked for his \\"rich dad\\" for free and the valuable lessons he learned about commitment and hard work. Finally we get to read Kiyosaki's real financial advice. At one point he relates how he helped his friend finance his childrens' college education. Kiyosaki advised him to sell his business and then he could further the kids' education.I'm sorry - I got absolutely nothing out of this book. I was very disappointed and truthfully feel a little ripped-off. I'd give it zero stars, if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Avoided At All Costs","review":"I will not waste more space on this work except to say that the review by John Reed at http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html sums up everything I might have said. Vague or false statements, espousing the view that the chief goal of education is the amassing of wealth, advocating possibly illegal practices such as insider trading, and contradictory statements sometimes on the same page all point to one conclusion: do not bother with this book or this man's views in any way, shape, or form. There is very sound and intelligent real estate investment advice to be had.....elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Overview of the Philosophy of Personal Finance","review":"I found this book to be a very good introduction into the philosophy of personal finance. The author, through an exploration of his experiences with his two dads, provides an excellent discourse on the logic of intelligent personal finance.This book does not attempt to peddle a system of \\"striking it rich overnight\\". But instead explains the importance of intelligent money usage. My personal favorite was the comparison roughly stating that income is equal to employees, and they can work either for you or against you. I'd recommend this book to anyone wishing to increase their financial security and/or buying power through intelligent money management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad only makes Dad rich","review":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad has a catchy title and a compelling premise, but it is one of the most poorly written manuscripts I've ever seen published. It is replete with page after page of grammatical errors that good high school students would be embarrassed to make. (See page 59 for instance.) It desperately needs an editor to tame the rambling prose. Mr. Kiyosaki advises his readers--when they wade into areas where they are uninformed--to hire competent professionals. He should have taken his own advice and paid someone to edit his work. I returned this book in disgust after reading 60 pages. Don't contribute to making Mr. Kiyosaki a Rich Dad. He hasn't earned either your attention or your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny how many people react to this book!!","review":"I find it very funny how many people react to this book (based on a couple of the reviews I read). There is nothing on the book's cover that says buy this book and become rich. I think the purpose of this book, which does pretty effectively, is to give you a mind set for financial freedom, not to give you a plugin formula that will make you rich in 3 days. I liked the book and gives you a different perspective to achieving financial freedom. If you are looking for a book with a step by step to becoming rich, look elsewhere and if you find it, I want to be the firt one to hear about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For most people, there are better places to spend your money","review":"I received this book as a (wanted) gift. The anecdotal writing style was enjoyable at first but became a little tiresome when stories and ideas were repeated. Although it claims to be written to help most people get out of the \\"poor\\" person's mentality, it won't really provide the drive, methods, and information people would need over the long term.If you have the type of personality that has an abundance of initiative, fearlessness, ambition and focus, this book provides some philosophical--and fewer practical--points to incorporate into your climb to the top. It is never stated outright, but this book is definitely geared toward those in society who equate success with money and power; the best thing a dad can do for his son is to be rich.Bottom line: better to rent (from the library) than to own"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad","review":"The author explains his topics in a way that is very easy to understand. This book is a real eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio version better than the book","review":"I first started out reading the book, but I got frustrated because the author did not get to the points fast enough. Not wanting to waste my time, I rented the audio version of this book. What a relief. I enjoyed much more listening to Rich Dad, Poor Dad than reading it. The book is really a story that can be listened to during your commute. At this point, I will use the book as a reference book for review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book for Beginners","review":"This is a great beginners book, it provides the groundwork, but it doesn't go deep enough.

Still good information and great insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on","review":"You'll never learn how to get rich from reading this book. Truth be told, you'll really just be a little poorer for wasting your time and money on it. Much of Kiyosaki's advice is just plain horrible. He actually has the nerve to tell people that going to college is a waste of money. Then, he states that everyone should just invest in real estate to get rich (only, he never tells us how to do that--go figure). If you really want something inspirational to read, try the Motley Fool books. The authors really know how to invest, and give you a lot of good advice about getting your finances in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book teahches you ONE valuable concept....","review":"This book teaches you ONE and only ONE valuable concept about wealth, the rest of the book and all subsequent Rich Dad books, seminars, courses, or whatever is complete and total fluff. The one concept you need to know is \\"An asset is something that puts money into your pocket.\\" Plain and simple. A gumball machine is an asset, Trump Tower is an asset, a room you may rent in your house is an asset, and Kiyosaki's fluff-filled book is an asset. His book started me on the road to seeking assets but the rest was useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've certainly read better","review":"The author states in the book that he's a terrible writer, but he sells a lot of books. He's quite correct, unfortunately. This book takes about 160 pages to say what could be summarized in a few paragraphs. Save money, try to stay out of debt, invest your savings for the long run in assets that will appreciate in value and eventually generate income for you. All good advice, but The Millionaire Next Door was much more readable and practical. I also like Eight Steps to Seven Figures. For that matter the Motley Fool website is outstanding for common sense personal finance. All would be better uses of your time than reading this. This book gives no hands on advice about anything. For example, let's say you have no assets, a pile of debt etc. How do you change that? This book says \\"use your mind\\". That's nice but some real solid advice would certainly be preferable in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quixtar/Amway/BWW Propoganda","review":"Im a finance major, and I work for a leading investment broker. I would like to think I know a little about financial management. Some stranger came up to me in a bookstore and was telling me about this book. Long story short, he was with some Quixtar/Amway variation. This book is motivational fluff. In Kiyosaki's other book, Prophecy, he states that 401(k)'s are a scam and some idiotic stock market crash is coming to wipe out everyone's retirement. Funny how none of my finance professors ever heard of this. If you want to beleive this nonsense, go ahead. You deserve whatever happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"a friend of mine gave this book to me as a loaner. he said it was interesting and that i might learn a lot from it. well sadly i did learn a lot about it. i learned that by manipulating people into thinking they will make millions, you can sell a ton of books.this book is written TERRIBLY. it has no flow, no sentence structure, honestly a 5th grade teacher would give this book an F if it was turned in as an english report.he repeats himself 1000000000 times, and seems to be miling the pages to make it seem like the book has more content.honestly, his book can be summarized into the following points.-Buy assets, not liabilities-learn how money, and finances work-school is a waste of time, dont bother to go unless you take accounting-i am so great bow before me.blech, i cant stand this book, please dont waste your money on this, it is like purchasing a liability instead of an asset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"this book is way over-rated. most words in the book are fillers that most people would be aware of. there's one interesting lesson i've learnt from this book tho: A book without any substance, like this one, made quite a fortune for its author. how did this happen?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Dad has rich lessons","review":"I thought this book had great lessons for those of us who don't properly understand money.

This was the first book I ever read on investing, at about 16 years of age, and I have to tell you, go read something else.

I can say this book does open my eyes and my view on how money was handled and managed differently between my dad and my mom. I notice some differences as well.All I can say is read the book yourself and be your own judge in your own experience, be an observance, watch and listen what your feelings tell about your own world.

The author boasts of investing in small speculative stocks, the types of investments that have cost American investors trillions of dollars in capital losses from the recent stock market secular bear market we find ourselves in.Following this type of investment advice in the current economic environment might take you out of the middle class and on to the welfare line. Maybe pick it up again in 10 years when it will be safe again to invest in securities and probably deflated real estate environment.The most interesting tidbit from the book is the authors point of view that buying an expensive home that's beyond ones means is a liability rather than an asset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"But of course, even after reading the book, we find those that focused on the \\"words\\" and not the \\"story\\" behind it. There is a very simplistic yet valuable lesson to be learned here which is priceless - do yourself a favor, keep an open mind, read the book, learn the lesson.

The book mentions how you need to have more assets than liabilities, how the rich don't work for money, the rich invent money, the power of corporations and so on. This book has changed my way of thinking about money - I have now decided I do not want to live life just on a \\"pay check\\" and be an employee for ever, trying to make some one else rich - I want to be a business owner and have multiple sources of income, like from real-estate if your in the right place with a good market for your benefit.The book was also a very easy and simple read, another must read book!

The language is simple and effective. A must buy book. However... If you truly aim for financial independence, this book works only as a motivational starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not received","review":"I have yet to receive the book. Please help me get this book in my hands since I've already paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple explanation of how to make your money work for you","review":"This is not a get rich quick type book but it does help teach you ways to let your money work for you in simple terms. Things like why mutual funds are better than savings accounts, etc. It goes back and forth from telling stories to giving advice which is a nice change from your standard boring money books.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but read with scepticism","review":"I'm a sceptical reader. There are details that I suspect are embellished here, a few mistakes, and there is some vagueness in the recommendations in the last half of the book, but the first half of the book is inspirational and the second half at least provides enough hints to give you ideas to investigate yourself. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty good book. I've bought copies for many of my friends while warning to maintain their scepticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading that was worth the 16 bucks","review":"Robert does a good job of presenting common sense solutions to escaping the rat race. While his exact methods may be out of date, the idea of generating income outside of your job is sound. He also stresses the negative impact of spending on credit and buying liabilities (toys) with earned income. Even though the repetative stories detract from the message, the book is extremely easy to read and provides focus on important concepts that aren't being taught in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarmist, but informative","review":"An interesting book that educates and helps people view money (saving, investing, passive cashflow, etc) more accurately.Kiyosaki seminars are over-priced, especially if they only repeat what is already said in the books. However, the books themselves contain more than enough information on their own, anyway.Unless you are a person like the many who've reviewed this book just to tell everyone you \\"already know\\" everything Kiyosaki explains, this book is worth reading.He IS educational, unless you already knew it all, of course....I personally find the writing style a bit 'alarmist' in nature - something no other reviewer has commented on, interestingly - but if Kiyosaki genuinely thinks that's what the future holds, he should say so.For me the best points were \\"Let 'em Scream\\" (ie, pay yourself first) and Kiyosaki's paradigm-busting views on your house being an 'asset'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know the secrets !","review":"I read this in Korean Edition.

After having read \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", I realized that the one subject I never taught my children was about money; mostly because I was a living example of complete money ignorance. Suffice it to say that I immediately sent a copy to my otherwise-very-successful college daughter and have permanently appended a recommendation for this book to every email I send.Unless money causes you no concern whatsoever, you simply must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but unreal on some topic","review":"This book is indeed very good and useful one. Investments principles of rich people are very good described for anyone to understand. What bothers me is confusing description of average rich man asset investments - as source of his/her income. Mr. Kyosaki for example advices reader to invest in stocks, luring him/her into thinking that this is path to secure gains. Truth is (I am long term trader/instructor) that only tiny percentage of traders earn money by trading stocks. So this is bad (if not dissastrous) advice for 95% of readers population. Another, same goes for company ownership. Over 95% of new companies face bankruptcy. Conclusion is, while his core principes are valid, Mr. Kyosaki advices re. investment vehicles (as foundations of person's future wealth) are elusive and pretty unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all..","review":"This book is full of stories that tell you the same message, over and over again. We get the point, give us some practical tips and steps to achieve the goals. I did not find the book helpful at all, I learned very little in terms of practical financial knowlege. The first chapter got the message across, the rest are just fillers. I found David Bach's Automatic Millioniare and other books in his series much more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many people who actually read this book become rich?","review":"While I found the stories appealing at first, if you dig deeper into the book the message becomes evident: \\"You too can become rich with these simple techniques.\\" In this sense it is no better than a get rich quick infomercial. The sad truth if there was such a simple formula to making money, everyone would do it. Just keep this in mind while reading or considering the purchase of these types of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book, Boring Book","review":"First I hate people who are taken with themselves...I felt like I was watching an infomercial at 11pm when I read this. You know, the guy who talks too fast, too loud and sounds like he's 'gonna make ya swim wid da fishes' if you don't do what he says.Very contradictory with his opinions on education. On one page he says its no good and he has no use for it and on the next he says how important it is.In summary this is a book that spouts real estate leveraging. Nothing more. It is a simple concept but not for everyone. I get the feeling that if I don't make millions the way this guy did I should resign as a respectable human and eat my meals out of a dumpster.Don't waste your money. Lucky it was 30% off. At least that made me feel like I was buying into this guys mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with all the Rich Dad's Series ...","review":"Mr.Kiyosaki's books are really piece of cashing on people'saspirations for success/money, gullible nature with a spiral web of nonsense.It does not give you any guidance - not even a decent framework.

Just cashing onaverage person's psyche ... with mere fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book basically tells you to invest in rental property with no real explanation, just buy several houses and rent them out for instant income. Nothing in life is that easy, especially when it comes to making money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiyosaki takes advantage of the gullible","review":"Books like this bother me, because individuals like Kiyosaki make their money off of convincing anyone that he/she has the ability to become rich through some relatively simple actions and decisions. All that is necessarily to topple the house of cards, however, is to be aware of the fact that most people in society will always need to work jobs that cause them to be in the poor/middle class.Another element that is very deceptive is Kiyosaki's investment advice. Anyone who actually knows about finance also knows that there's no easy way to make money in the market; if there was, 99.9% of the time it would have been traded away by investors and institutions with access to far more resources than yourself.As is the case in many aspects of life, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Instead of listening to charlatans like Kiyosaki, learn a useful skill and read some actual textbooks about finance/investing."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another pep talk","review":"This book is very overrated! Kiyosaki briefly mentions things like investing in tax liens, but he doesn't say how to do it. The book is 99% pep talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting and at times funny. I did not want to put it down. However, if you are looking for a get rich quick idea or scheme, it is not in this book. Also, if you are not interested in real estate, you may not like this book, because that is most of the author's story. When I heard about this book, I thought it would show me how to get rich. The book does not show you how to get rich, it tells the story. If you want to get rich you only need do one thing, MAKE MONEY. I know it sounds stupid, but my uncle told me, \\"if you want to make big money, you have to do things in a big way.\\" You can get rich by going to school, or by working in a restaurant, or by selling cars, getting rich is up to you. Just turn on the tv and you will see lots of rich people who did lots of different things to get rich. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so so book would not recommend","review":"I found this book very negative and not helpful. He talks about how going to school and working hard being a waste of time. What about those people who enjoy the possibility of a career and being a master in their field? Yes, many of us want to be rich, but please do not bash those who went to school and are very proud of their accomplishments. The author's dad was a teacher, a very honored career, yet he bashes his real dad constantly through the book. I had a migraine half way through the book and could not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"False hopes","review":"The book does inspire, but much of it is just fantasy.

Assets are all those things that make money. Expenses are all those things that cost money. Your car is not an asset, it's a money pit. Your house may be an asset or may not. The rental house you bought, now that's an asset. Poor people don't know the power of assets, and don't know how to tell an asset from a liability.

What schools DON'T teach","review":"Your kids may learn how to read and write in school but one thing they will never learn at school is how to become financially secure. This is perhaps the most important lesson of all and one that they WILL learn from this book. I highly recommend that you buy this book and start teaching your kids how to be financially secure.

These are really good lessons, becuase they teach you things that happen in the real world.

You will walk away from this book a bit poorer in both time and money. If you're needing concrete investment strategy and facts, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like an infomercial.","review":"While the author of this book is obviously very well informed and experienced, I had a very hard time finishing the book. I feel that it reads like an infomercial for his board game, and is very self-praising. There are many very good lessons to learn, and I appreciate his effort to teach them in an easy manner. Rather than purchasing this book, I strongly recommend that you buy \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", I found that one more pleasurable a read, without the hints to purchase other products peppered through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk - not enough facts","review":"I normally try to be positive and find the best in things. But this book is a waste of time, considering the many good investment books out there. It has a few valuable points, but they could be stated on one page. To the authors defence, I am in favor of books that cut to the bone and I really hate having to read hundreds of pages of nothing, to get his point.If you are a first time reader of this kind of topic, the book is okay. As long as you understand that it will wont give you any tools - just rough guidelines.I, unfortunately, also listen to the audiotape.

If you must read it, borrow it from your local library. Kiyosaki doesn't have much to say, contrary to what his proponents write. His main message, be financially smart and pay attention to how you spend your money, is simply common sense and not a great revelation. Beyond that, the book is vague and somewhat suspicious. His tale of the rich dad makes one think that it is a fabrication. Kiyosaki writes about the rich dad in such a formless manner that it seems plausible that the rich dad is purely imaginary. The book just isn't worth the time it takes to read it, definitely not worth the praise some people have heaped upon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new. Don't waste your time.","review":"The book has some good ideas but they won't make you rich. It seems that the best thing to do is what author is doing: put many half truth - sweet sounding ideas together and sell them to people who want to get rich fast and easy (and that's everyone).You want to do what author was doing: investing in small companies stocks? Good luck.He may have made good mony in buying foreclousers when no one was doing that. But you try it now when millions are probably trying to do the same thing. Good luck again.What author is doing is selling you ideas that used to work for him some times ago, but not anymore.Author is saying: don't work, don't run your business. Own business and let other people work. I agree that it sounds great. But is this reality.Why didn't Kiyosaki retire already?"},{"rating":"1","title":"God awfully repetitive dribble","review":"Very disappointed in this book after it was recommended by 2 friends, or should I say *dreamers*. I got the audio version free from my local library's eBook service, and I got about 1/2 way through before I had to stop.Too much of the book is like a motivational speaker's book or speech. That's helpful for people not used to getting out and doing things, but it can make people take stupid risks. I know more people financially well-off that went to college and got a decent job than people who play the games. If you're looking for motivation, there's better authors out there.The thing about buying properties and such that these people don't mention are the practicals of buying, selling and renting. They make it sound so easy and it's not on the practical level. This book reminds me of the times I had to fake an essay question part of a test in grade school. That is, taking something small and dragging it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I had to read this book for a personal finance class. Most of the book is written as a dialog between the author and the rich dad. Reading this got old fast and I kept thinking to myself.. \\"get to the point already!\\" The impression I got from the author is that he is arrogant as he seems to talk himself and \\"rich dad\\" up a lot. There are six lessons that are presented and I didn't feel that they were valuble or really practical to the everyday person - maybe if you are a real estate tycoon they would have value. Thankfully this book was cheap so I didn't waste too much money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who took my money, Robert K. did!!","review":"This is a an interesting read but do not pay a penny for it. This falls under the category of info-tainment, but does have valuable information if taken lightly. I would hate to think of all the people that failed trying his knuckle head antics. The failure rate I am sure is high, but who's real problem is that anyway!!If indeed any of his quaint stories are factual, he is not a normal person, and probably exagerates his business success greatly prior to these books. I would probably be right making even stronger statements.It does not take a genious to make great real estate investments in a booming aloha land.

I agree that a house is not an investment, but it is an asset. He could have made the point without the confusing move of redefining an asset.2.

It was a new way of looking at money for me. This book narrated by Robert Kiyosaki tells the story of Robert's real father and his best friends dad. His real dad, \\"poor dad\\", worked for his money, while his \\"rich dad\\" had his money work for him.Kiyosaki explains even a person with a lot of money in the bank can be poor, though they have financial wealth in the bank, they are still poor mentally as now they are afraid they are going to lose all their money.I loved that Kiyosaki says \\"It's not what you make, it's what you keep\\" If you make $100K and spend $125k you are poor. \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" teaches you to act like, be like and think like a Rich person instead of a poor person.Another transformational book I really enjoyed was Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel & Shya Kane. It is a book of short stories that are inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"General and mean.","review":"The advice in the book seemed very general; save money, create assests, avoid overspending, etc. There were few specific lines of advice, but perhaps that wasn't the intent of the book. I kept waiting for the author to start explaining real ways to start investing, etc. He gave no starting points for someone actually looking to change their financial path. Either need to be rich already or be really young.The author also portrays his education-career \\"poor dad\\" in a very weak light. Mainly because he's a school teacher and seems family and people centered. Of course, I'd like to be a millionaire, but not at the cost of kindness, my family, and the use of intimidation. The \\"rich dad\\" seemed very jerkish.On the other hand, the book is quite inspirational and does a good job of getting the blood moving.

The lessons are oversimplified and the stories are awful combination of overly exaggerated while still excruciatingly boring. I would hate to have to sit through a lecture or a meal with this guy. From reading the book, I get the impression that it would be like watching a stupid old man lecture an little kid about how his education is useless and how smart people learn financial awareness and get rich, while all the while the kid knows the old man just got rich on a stroke of luck and then rode it out the rest of his life.

But,the book seems more reared toward children age 8-17 that any adult. Yet, im sure many adults could learn from this book. overall this book was a little boring; and seems very fabricated at times. I probably could have written a better book about money over a bathroom break. The book seems to stress that education is not very important, entrepreneurs are rich, and everyone is poor and useless. I disagree! Being a budding entrepreneur myself i see the benefit of a formal education on a daily basis. The networking, social skills, and basics in all aspects of business(which every entrepreneur should know...accounting finance etc.) are gained from formal education. Sure, common sense is not.

You should also know that it is mostly fiction. Kiyosaki admitted he made up the character of the Rich Dad and likely exagerrated or fabricated his own success story. Don't take my word for it; read John Reed's thorough research on Kiyosaki's claims at www.johntreed.com. Finally, is is disturbing that this book remains on the NYT best-selling \\"Paperback Advice\\" rather than \\"Paperback Fiction\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate book for beginners","review":"Kiyosaki provides some helpful information in this book. However, he could have summarized the information much more concisely. He spends a considerable amount of time focusing on a few key instructions: acquire assets and not liabilites, make money work for you, don't get caught up in the \\"rat race,\\" don't waste your time on traditional education, and become financially literate. He does not go in depth with any of these ideas; if you're looking for a how-to book, this one is not for you. Additionally, he supports his ideas about financial success with only moderately interesting and not at all engaging stories from his childhood.Kiyosaki repeats a few select, vague ideas over and over again. For that reason, I cannot recommend the book. It's only redeeming quality is that it does teach something about economics. If you're looking for a general, base-line instruction on how to be rich, this book would be worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild ideas and ambitions.","review":"This book has some radical new ideas that may lift a person's motivation but overall I didn't learn anything that is practical and most important financially sound. Taking risk is emphasized and investing in real estate is his main source of income but I think the numbers and stories are exagerated to increase its efficacy. I really didn't enjoy the book and besides there were some bad rumours about this author's honesty circulating the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"A excellent book with some eye opening teachings about money and the way he defines what an asset and liability really are is superb. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"This book is purely motivational in nature. It will get you thinking about what you money is or is not doing for you. You'll want to invest before the book is through. The first chapter is somewhat slow, but the rest of the book keeps your interest and will run your highliter dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to get my hands on this book to find out what this guy was up to.","review":"The class paranoid title alone moves units and is an indicator of what exactly this guy is selling. I've tried paying attention to him when he and his wife appeared on public television but I just don't get it. I didn't finish the book because his real estate advice leaves out too many variables. I get the feeling that he impresses people who have no business experience and those people have reason to fear their own ignorance so he's got them on the hook. I'm writing this review because I read that he has contacted Casey Serin - the wet behind the ears disaster flipper - to get acquainted AND he is partnering up with Donald Trump. I think this guy is selling the emperor's clothes I really do. Lesson One: He's not mentoring future moguls for the price of this paperback. This book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, but condescending!","review":"Although there were some good things in the book (enouh to fill a page or two...) the overall attitude departed by the author was one of contempt for the middle class. What a jerk! He continually blasts the middle class for the way they live. What he fails to realize is that they live the way they do because they really aren't trying to be rich, just comfortable. It was extremely hard to get past his attitude and absorb the information he gives. But to summarize the bulk of the worthwhile info he does give:1) An asses is soemthing that yields revenue. Your home costs money and is not truly an asset.2) Earn the money to buy a desire, don't just go out and borrow money to buy it. If you don't have cash then don't buy it.3) Don't waste your money buying this book. Just get it from the library or bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on specifics...","review":"I really wanted to like this book but after reading it again and again I find two things: 1) He doesn't tell you any exact steps of what you should be doing in order to be rich 2) He never seems to get to the point. He continues to ramble on about why financial security is important but it basically just stops there. Let me ask you, who out there doesn't want to be rich?. Or be free and independent from the jobs they hate?. I think that's all of us but he's got to deliver better and more concrete action steps than this. Though in truth teaching people to be rich is hard, because everybody wants to make their millions using skills they love to use in the field that they like. Such skills aren't taught anywhere, they come only from experience. All he teaches in here is how to do real estate, which may not be right for the person who wants to get ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"First off, Kiyosaki was a financial failure who made his money writing this book and endorsing get-rich-quick pyramid schemes like quixtar (a warmed over version of Amway.)This book wasn't worth the money I paid for it, much less the time it took to read it. It contains no good advice that couldn't be summed up in two paragraphs and plenty of bad advice and worthless filler.You will be dumber for having read it and may God have mercy on your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"rich dad poor dad BULLSHIT","review":"Everyone has a long review, but I'll keep this one short...Robert Kiyosaki made his money from this one book because he was on the Oprah show.If it wasnt for that, he would'nt be rich as he is today. Oprah made him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable advice","review":"I will keep this short. I felt uncomfortable with the advice Robert was giving. He basically dissed his own father and loved and respected his pretend rich father. I can see gleening advice from someone who is business smart, but some of it just morally seemed wrong to me. He is basically saying your are not going to get anywhere by working for other people and we are saps for doing so. So, get your own business where other people work for you, don't pay them well, and rake in the cash. Sorry, couldn't do that if I wanted to, which I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good easy to read","review":"I read this book in 2 days and I'm not a strong reader. It is a good intro book to the topic of investing in your future. He explains ideas very plainly and emphasizes his own interests and that they are just that, his own. Wish I had read this 30 years ago..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good and bad","review":"notice ites a miniature versionC but I like it not really worthy the price thoughCbut it s a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road to financial freedom","review":"This book does a good job detailing Robert T. Kiyosaki's childhood inspiration. Like the Donald Trump books before Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not intended as a financial guide. Mr.Kiyosaki raises the possibilities of real estate as a means to achieving millions; the gist remains his childhood experiences which can be worth untold millions. A great mixture of inspiration and un-common financial sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally BS","review":"I'd not give it a star at all if the system allows me to. Read on and you will find out: he became rich by telling people and making them believe HE can make them rich. What a cheat!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for understanding the basics in financing","review":"If you lack knowledge in financial literacy, you would want to read this book. Gives an insight on how to manage money. Also, gives positive advice on how to make money work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Peasy","review":"This is the way to read a book...have someone else read for you! Actually, I am on the road a lot and miss the chance to sit down and be able to devote to the written word. This was a good story of the life of a young boy gone right. It's not a get rich quick scheme but the message is simple and it's there for the ambitious and committed. I recommend this to young and old alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for people with no investing background","review":"This book focuses on having people change the way they think about managing their money. It is very useful for those that are stuck in the typical go to work, get money, spend money, go back to work and start all over again. This book provides a new outlook for those people and does list some available resources to expand your knowledge about the more specific details to investments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"The book does a good job of stressing that one should use their money to make money and not fall into the trap that most people do. However, it is way, way to wordy. It could be pared down substantially. It also does not give any specific strategies for creating wealth. It is very vague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very skeptical of this author","review":"A lot of rah-rah, not a lot of substance.I give it 2 stars only because I think it may have some motivational value. In terms of practical advice its value is minimal.You should also be aware that there is a lot of skepticism about this author and the claims he makes. Do some investigation and you'll likely be unsettled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infomercial Huckster","review":"Robert Kiyosaki is a great marketeer. This is his latest product--a book that has one good idea (buy income generating assets) and repeats it over and over. Kiyosaki's real genius is using this book to push the other products he sells.Here's a free income generating tip from me to all you readers. Write a simplistic book about getting rich and hire Kiyosaki to market it for you. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Solid","review":"If I had only one \\"money\\" book I could recommend to someone, it would be this book. It's advice is rock solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is that simple","review":"Having had the pleasure of hearing Robert speak on numerous occasions, I was a little disappointed that his eloquent style was not forthcoming in this book. That aside, the information contained within is first class. As one who has been applying these principles for several years now, it really works. Congratulations Robert for using the leverage of books to reach a broader audience with your excellent material. I'll have to place my order for CASHLOW asap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful.","review":"The concepts in this book are very good and easy to understand. I've read two other books by Robert Kiyosaki that also provide a solid foundation for investing. Be careful about investing in his coaching services, they aim to make Robert richer at the buyer's expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"its easy to make money selling books about common sense","review":"The book was interesting story about his life but thats all it seem to be about. There was only one thing I learned from this book. All you have to do is tell people how rich you supposedly are, and how you want to help them. Forget any original ideas, just repeat the same general ideas over and over again and people will buy it. The one thing I like about this author is how he can turn a couple well known ideas that would take a paragraph or two to explain, and turn it into 200 pages is amazing. So I probably will never get rich off of his general and vague financial advice, but I now know how to become a best selling author."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT the way to wealth","review":"Mr. Kiyosaki runs down the one sure way to make more moneyduring one's life, that is \\"MORE EDUCATION\\"! One can get quitea feel for Mr. Kiyosaki's agenda by reading John T. Reed'sanalysis of him (and many other so-called 'gurus') Questionablefacts, and questionable biographical details...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I was looking for some sound advice on how to make the most of my finances, but I sure didn't find it here. It is just a compilation of boring anecdotes and over-simplifications. Do not contribute to this author's fame or fortune by buying this book - it is useless!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad, great read","review":"I received this book as a gift not too long ago and had expected a way to get rich or something similar. It was a shock to me how it was not what i expected. This book was a great read teaching not just about money but also about life lessons. Teaching me how fear and emotions can control decisions and keep you in the \\"rat race.\\" This book opened my eyes and changed my perspective on life. It is helping me focus and work everyday for my goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Easy way to figure out your lifes work","review":"I am 16 years old and just bought this book yesterday evening. Today, I am almost finished with it. I cannot put it down. I am simply amazed how simple Robert Kiyosaki can put finances. I have realized how much of a joy reading this book was. I have been contemplating what field to go into in college. Now I know that Business Finance is my route. This book teaches you everything you need to know and then some. It's not a \\"tech\\" book that just uses finance jargon used only by CPAs and the IRS. It is simply and easy to understand. It gives you inspiration that owning your own company can happen, not only in your dreams. I recommend this book to any one of any age who wants to know how to manage their finances or simply would like to see if they know as much as they claim they do in the world of financing. Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm giving this book to all my kids...","review":"I should have started 30 years ago with this newfound knowledge...It's not too late for me but I would like my kids to start building thier income producing assets earlier in life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had money","review":"I read the book and invested in Content Management Stock.

Learn (and think) for yourself: http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"It can change your life","review":"My Dad told me about this book, and for a good reason. I'm 33, divorced, and have not a thing to show for it. After reading Robert T. Kiyosaki's book, I have made drastic changes in the way I think and feel about money, work, time-management, and my dad. This book hits things right on the \\"money\\", and opens your eyes so that you can see the bigger picture and begin to make serious changes. The book is extremely easy to read and follow. And if you have an open mind, you can allow it to transform your way of thinking to start you on the track toward financial success. I highly recommend it to anyone who is ready to hear and to believe that the old ways are out and it's time for a new way of teaching, learning and living with money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"System\\" that Made Mr. Kiyosaki Rich","review":"If you carefully read \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" you will find the system that made the author a rich man.The system is NOT wise investments or low liabilities and high assests, nor is it business acumen or investing wisdom.No, his system was the writing of a book (this one) that is repetitious, low on substance and factual content, but which promises the reader that they too can be as successful as the author.The trouble is Mr. K presents NO proof whatsoever of his own success. He toots his own horn a lot. But there's not much behind the noise.There have been a number of exposes written about Kiyosaki. A little research and you'll find them easily. If you're interested in knowing what this author is really about, do a little homework, then, if you're still interested, buy the book.Reviewer: L. Painchaud"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motivation (Hype?) but nothing else....","review":"This book opens your mind to the educational system flaws and other norms regarding career paths. This book also gets you excited about working for yourself and the \\"ownership society\\". But I'm afraid it does little else. It provides a lot of hype and tells no details of how to accomplish anything. Stories of making thousands of dollars off forclosures in only hours. Buying luxury cars after purchasing your first rental income property. This sounds more like an infomercial than learning material. If you read this book I recommend you immediately read The Millionaire Mind and The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing. These two books will take your head out of the clouds and give you some good instruction on making money in real estate. Also stop buying books here and get them at your local library. All the new releases are there for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start for most anyone","review":"In college I studied biology and psychology. I have no background in business and/or investing. I have developed an incurable interest in learning about this facet of life though. I found this book very enjoyable. Although what the author has to offer the reader is not rocket science...deep down I think we all know everything that he has to say BUT...the book is a fabulous summary. It provides easy and entertaining reading. It serves well as a \\"pep rally\\" to get yourself in line for a beginning in investments. Although I am sure I will never be the multimillionaire that the author is, it is refreshing to be reminded that we all have the potential and being ready for an opportunity is what makes the difference. Live within your means and invest a little bit at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explanation of our success!","review":"Mr Kiyosaki goes a long way to explaining why we have more money while sailing around the world on our yacht (not working) than we did with combined salaries of over $150K/year as employees!We started out 6 years ago with enough money to live for 2 years and now have enough that we may never work again. All by doing what \\"seemed right at the time\\".Getting here was largely luck and hard work, keeping \\"the good times rolling\\" will take some knowledge about money as he points out.The book is not an ending, but a beginning.I am logged on right now specifically to buy a copy of this book for my son back home in Phoenix AZ.In reading the other reviews I notice several who totally miss the point of the book. This book is NOT about investment \\"tips\\" or even about investing, rather it is about ways to train YOURSELF to invest successfully! This is done very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing your entire mindset","review":"I would give this book ten stars if I could. Buy it and also Cashflow Quadrant. These two books don't give you a lot of practical tips on how to make money quickly. But they will change completely--I mean thoroughly--the way you look at money. I am getting a PhD, but I've never been taught to look at money this way. My wife and I used to get mad at each other--even with mutual threats of divorce--about money. But after reading just Rich Dad, Poor Dad, I've stopped arguing with her, and our relationship has improved significantly. Buy it as well as Cashflow Quadrant now. Don't wait any longer. You don't need to read any more reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairy tale","review":"I agree with the reader from Iowa - September 23, 1999. Not only that, I watched my father, a property investor and developer, for over two decades and I have been a property attorney for over two decades. I can tell you that these sweet property deals do NOT fall into your lap (just two weeks of looking! huh) as implied by the book. You need to be looking for them all day every day like a bloodhound and you need to cultivate the bank officials and realtors, etc and BRIBE them for every such property that they might put your way. Not only that, dozens (if not hundreds) of others in property are competing with you to bribe these same officials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Advice, Bad Book","review":"I have to agree with the negative reviews. I read a few chapters in this book before I got bored and gave up. One funny thing the author says is NOT to buy a home. Geez, I guess all of those homeowners must be stupid then, buying a home and seeing the value rise so fast, especially in the recent housing boom.Kiyosaki has now teamed with Trump, an egotistical guy who thinks he knows business and such. Please save your money and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Maker","review":"I see this book as nothing more than a good money maker for the author. He appeals to peoples emotions and is very repeatitive about the same principles. This book will give you more entertainment than practical investing knowledge.

We try so hard every day to improve our business or careers, only to get home and throw our hard-earned nett-money into products that only cost money.

The author many times uses the phrase \\"make your money work for you,\\" and while this book does not give you exact strategies for making this happen (he provides examples of how he personally uses his funds, mainly in real estate; don't confuse this with a strategy, as he warns numerous times), he gives a simple set of rules to help you analyze and think about what your money is doing and how to utilize it best.I recommend this to a person looking who wants to probe learning about their personal finances.

Save yourself many hours of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts ok...then gets bad","review":"I found the first half of this book ok, but the book gets worse and worse as you read it. Nothing in the book is concrete its all rather vague, I think there is a good reason for that. A lot of the things mentioned sound like tax evasion, \\"Pay yourself first\\" he says. He also pretends that corporations are these clever things that allow you to avoid taxes and fails to mention that for many people involved in business it can actually cost them more to incorporate. All the half-truths and vagueness make the book fairly worthless.If this guy is good at anything its marketing and selling books, not investment or business."},{"rating":"1","title":"More philosophy than manual","review":"I found this book to be a nice pep talk, but it didn't have much concrete information in it. I would recommend the book to people who are looking to convert from consumer to investor, but this book will be mundane for anyone who has taken the first step towards being an investor.Because the book is an easy read (thank God, since it is verbose), I gave it 2 stars.

Regardless of how you choose to make money, Rich Dad Poor Dad explains the importance of managing your money and spending wisely. If more people would define assets and liabilities the way Robert Kiyosaki does, the world would be much more financially secure. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially young people who are learning how to manage their money. Regardless of how much money you have or make, this book will change your outlook on how you spend and invest it.

I can't understand why the book is so popular...The book's main premise seems to be that one should invest only in income generating activities (author calls these \\"assets\\") and avoid any expense related activities (\\"liabilities\\"). Lot of what was said in the first 90 pages was commonsense and so repetitive that I started skipping sentences, paragraphs and then even pages without missing out much. I shouldn't have bought this one...I would not add this book to my \\"asset\\" column. For those who have already bought this book, I recommend that they follow the author's advice about \\"assets\\" and \\"liabilities\\" - and sell this book :-) I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I was enlightened about the differences between how the rich and middle class view assets versus liabilities.

This book has certainly inspired me to look for new ways to make money. I like his concept of making more--money--while working less.As the title indicates, this book's only objective is to teach you to look at money from the other side, the rich side.

Upon completing the book I learned that I should have started investing 10 years ago when the market went kaput. He was lucky to start off at that time when the market went down, and then picked up soon after, so all of his 'assets' were worth 200% more than what he got it for. I knew about it then but I was only in high school and as a high schooler I didn't have 20k to invest. But if I did, I would be filthy rich as well. And I definitely agree about the comment made in an above entry that he downgrades his real dad in the entire book. Who gave you food and clothes Robert? Think about that!

After the first few pages, I became a little bored. The book appeared to be more along the lines of what a motivational speaker would present to people who pay ridiculous amounts for the obvious. There may be something in it for someone, but for me, I didn't find anything that I didn't learn (just about on my own) through general life experiences.

Kyosaki is superficial, repetitive and provides absolutely no useful information. The book is full of spelling mistakes, the diagrams in it are meaningless, and the writing is awful.More importantly, the content itself is useless. I can only assume that Kyosaki hopes that by repeating the same meaningless stories over and over, they will somehow become true.The best single word I can find to describe this book is: useless.

What I got instead were some stories my 3 year old would not believe. This was not worth the $3 I spent to buy it at the used book store.

Understanding money and how to make it is key to financial independence and Kiyosaki's advice is very valuable. However, hanging onto it once made is just as serious a business. Kiyosaki (and others) seem blind to the INEVITABLE massive depression looming just a few years down the line that is going to blindside so many and rob them of their money and assets. Read THE GREAT BUST AHEAD by Daniel Arnold too (still an Amazon strong seller for over a year it seems - a book's best recommendation), and marry this with Kiyosaki's advice.

While it wasn't horrible, I couldn't get past how many times the author restated the same thing. He gets stuck on a topic and won't move on. I got it the third time you said it. I also thought his financial examples left out many important items. He talks about making money out of no money. How can that be? His example states that he bought a $75,000 house for $20,000. In the end, he sold the house for $60,000 so he said he made $40,000 out of nothing. In the end, he might have made out but for some period of time he was out 20 grand. Am I missing something here?I wish I had checked this book out from the library. There's some fundamental principles we can all follow but it's not worth a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","review":"Like many supposed finance and business books of this ilk,the prose takes 10 times as much space as it needs. Given its size, this means that the book could be about 10 pages andstill be as effective.The book is high on inspiration and low on skill building.Any of the \\"For Dummies\\" or \\"Complete Idiot\\" guides on financewould be superior. For those looking to found their own businessto achieve independence, \\"Business Plans that Win $\\" is muchmore bang for the buck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack substance, long-winded","review":"If you are looking for specifics on how to make money, you will be disappointed. This book tells you what to do, rather than how to go about doing it. Few of us need to be told that in order to become rich, we have to cultivate our \`Financial IQ' and invest wisely, etc, etc. This amounts to plain rhetoric, although the author is without doubt a brilliant marketeer who expertly packaged his otherwise commonsensical ideas and made use of a catchy title. I find it rather irritating to see the same few ideas being repeated so many times throughout the book, as if the readers are so dumb that they need reinforcements. I am amazed that such a hollow topic can take up close to 200 pages! Don't waste your time on this book. To me, this whole thing is just another fad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hated someone and wanted to make them poor I'd give them this.","review":"Robert Kiyosaki has made a fortune from his books. After reading this I doubt he has made much money from any of his investments. The stories are suspiciously vague and even the title is misleading. Anybody thinking that the authors have done any research with lots of wealthy people to find out how they teach their kids about money will be disappointed. Most of the financial advice give here is general, off the cuff and toxic; basically real estate and stock speculation. The authors also encourage financing this through debt. The only other bit of advice is to incorporate to avoid taxes. Anybody who follows this advice is just gambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not a instruction book","review":"This book is pretty good because the basics it mentions are fairly good.Its true that 90% of America does not know the different between a true asset and a liability. Financial money management is missing from most of education. If you listen to Dave Ramsey, he says many of the same things.As for the tax advice and deferrments in this book, I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Yes, things like 1031 do exist but some of the advice like buying a corporate car with a personal corporation is illegal(although the accounting advisor at H&R; block did inform me last year before I read the book that deducting mileage and gas on my car was a legal option). You can defer taxes forever on a few things, but not many of them and overall, taxes in America are progressive, not regressive as the author claims.I did learn and was reminded of many important principles by this book and book series, but I'd take a much closer look at tax law before deducting anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and lacking in real get rich methods","review":"This book is very simplistic. It would be like getting a book on how to become a brain surgeon that tells you to go to college and major in pre-med then go to medical school and then specialize in surgery.It is not offensive but it is too lacking in real information to be helpful. There are no secrets methods to get rich in this book.I doubt that rich people are reading books on how to get rich.I think they are busy doing what it takes to get rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the buzz about?","review":"I like to read good financial books and this book kept getting a lot of buzz, so I finally got around to reading it? I just don't understand why so many people rave about this book.Instead of giving you tools, this book is about changing your thinking process.In essence, I'll sum up the lessons here:1. He redefines assets and liabilities. Assets put money in your pocket, liabilities cost you money. Thus your home is probably a liability while you live in it. Of course, you have to live somewhere, right?2. Educate yourself about financial matters. No actual education given in this book.3. Try and be of a mindset to spot and take advantage of opportunities, where ever they may be.4. Instead of just assuming you can or cannot do something, ask yourself why you can or can't. Put some thought and analysis into it, instead of letting your emotions rule your decisions.Sorry, I expect a lot more from a book that gets this many rave reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing book","review":"This book will give you the perspective everyone should have on almost anything financial.How you see your finances will determine how long they will last and how much you will make.Great Book, you wont regret the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great to read before building assets","review":"great book and simple to read Robert knows what he is talking about and really inspiring in becoming rich. if you want to be rich and really want to be rich read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"If you are seriously considering buying this book, take a few minutes to consider carefully why you are about to do so. If you are looking for financial advice, I suggest you look elsewhere. Not only did I find Kiyosaki's book vague and repetitive, but I also seriously questioned some of the advice he gives. At one point in the book (that is if he is telling the truth), Kiyosaki admits to insider trading. If you know anything about the stock market, you know that this is TOTALLY ILLEGAL! After seeing this, I decided to llok up some information about Kiyosaki online. The results were not good. ... Good luck in your financial future. I hope you can find a better book to guide you."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've been suckered into reading an Infomercial!","review":"This book is redundant, overly simplified, and worse yet, offers no useful knowledge other than explaining basic accounting principals that most people already understand. His relentless advocation to invest in real estate offers nothing more than those get-rich-quick real estate infomercials; thus spawning the ever expanding library of Rich Dad books so he can claim royalties, which will one day result in a Rich Dad guide to earning royalties. If you have this book, I can teach you a system that will make you a fortune by selling his library to other people just like you with the use of a simple classified add, seen by hundreds of people looking to waste their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom is the principle thing!!!","review":"This is a book of wisdom from a layman perspective. Write the vision make it plan. This is what Mr. Kiyosaki instructs us to do. Also, to apply God's principle to your vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never let my schooling interfere with my education","review":"RDPD, provides a good dose of financial reality to tyro investors. Kiyosaki's successful personal experiences help the reader understand the relevance of removing oneself from the \\"rat race\\" of working for money to spend, but to have money work for oneself. RDPD serves as a feel good book that makes any reader come to the conclusion that school is not life, and will not help financially. It is a good book for any high school student interested in beginning to develop a trained investor mind, however, do read it like a novel; if any part is boring skip over it and don't simply read over the life lessons and not actually think about them. Kiyosaki accurately depicts the hidden factors of the successful financial sphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah--what did happen to the five star reviews???","review":"(...)Regarding Rich Dad Poor Dad....a new and different philosphy that actually works. (...)buy this book. More importantly, apply the concepts(...)Why read and follow Kiyosaki? There is a philosophy that I believe in; if you keep on doing what you have always done you will keep on getting what you have always got. The traditional ways of doing things does not work. (...) for those of us who are more ethical and believe in the American Free Enterprise system, Kiyoaski offers another, better, more ethical way...and it really works.Ask the 13 year old who bought a 3/2 rental or the 65 year who with no retirement left, created a retirement income in record time.Also recommend Rich Dad's Success Stories(...)Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki!Thank you Rich Dad!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most successful financial book of all time!","review":"Rich Dad Poor Dad has become the single most successful-best selling financial book ever---and for good reason; the advice works. It tells people not what they want to hear, but they need to hear.I also recommend Rich Dad's Guide to Investing which offers better investing strategies than just blindly buying mutual funds or listening to your broker without rhyme or reason.I wish you continued success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a best seller for a reason...IT WORKS!","review":"For a book to stay on the best seller lists as long as Rich Dad Poor Dad has is ample proof that the information is for real. What some of these 1 star reviewers hope you never realize is that word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising in the world. If in fact this book was as bad as they (or is that he??) would like you to believe, don't you think the people who actually bought and read the book would have communicated that to everyone they know.This book works for those who are willing to use it. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT--Read Rich Dad's Success Stories for real life true stories on how Rich Dad and RTK's philosophy has positively impacted the lives of so many people.Great book. But only for winners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of Your Financial Success!","review":"Kiyosaki illustrates the pointlessness of living in the never ending rat-race of life. By giving a metaphorical example of the teachings of his \\"rich dad and poor dad\\" He shows a sure way to keep ahead of the rest by using simple financial know-how and terms that even a beginner could understand. The authors approach to financial topics I had never heard of before was calming and made reading this book an enjoyable experience. This book is by no means an answer to all money problems, but is a great starting point towards taking control of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The first couple chapters of this book have some good ideas, but after that, I'll save you some time and a little money. Here's what the rich teach their kids: Start saving early, preserve principal, don't get into debt, pay yourself first, invest aggressively. That's it. He's got some questionable advice, too. The author made a lot of his money by investing in penny stocks. What he doesn't tell you is that 85% of penny stocks fail. Tax lien certificates are another favorite of his. Other than that, there are no specifics in the book. If you want to learn what the wealthy know about money, read \\"Millionaire Next Door\\". If you want investing specifics, try the Motley Fool Books (\\"The Foolish Four\\" is good). If you're burried in debt, Suze Orman has some good stuff (9 Steps To Financial Freedom). If you've read all those, go ahead and send this guy $. Or better yet, invest it in penny stocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will make you understand how successful people think","review":"Kiyosaki is very successful at demonstrating the difference between how most people look at making money versus how the rich do. He stresses income generating assets, self-reliance, risk taking and taking responsibility for your own success rather than relying on a company, pension, government or other handout.The only thing that annoyed me about the book was that he repeats himself a lot even for a self-help book & he pushes real estate as if it was the only way to make money.Still if you are looking for a pep talk to get your engerized to invest more agressively then this is a good bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book.","review":"A dynamite book. This book should be read by everyone. It can change your financial life for the better.

You determine.","review":"The raving reviews from friends compelled me to read this book. It's an interesting book, to say the least. Below I listed the pros and cons:-- Easy-to-read, but poor writer-- Motivational speaker, but book has little substance-- Interesting story, but not factual-- Teaches about success, but he himself lack credentials-- Provides real estate investing examples that are enticing, but does not mentions it's feasibilityMy advice is: Buys this book if you enjoy reading fictious stories about finance and want to contribute to Kiyosaki's ONLY source of wealth. If you prefer a nonfictional and practical book about finance, make sure you research the author's background."},{"rating":"1","title":"A readable first investment-book for teen's","review":"This book gets five stars for readability. The style is conversational so fits people who dislike lectures.Not a recipe book. rather this is meant as the first of a series of books by the same author.

This book should be a mandatory purchase as you can learn alot from it and use it in your every day life. I highly recommend buying this book, Cashflow Quadrant, Guide to Investing, and Rich Kid, Smart Kid. I have read them all in that order. They are also know as Rich Dad 1 through 4. They seem to gel together as one big book split into 4. Buy them all, you won't regret The books make perfect sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't reality, it's one man's opinion","review":"The book is not based on reality. If it was based on reality it would be published by a university press and based on empirical studies. Instead this is one man's opinion intended to sell, not educate. Do yourself a favor and stop shopping / reading books from the self-help section. Check the author's credentials every time. If they are trying to sell you health advice, then they better have a PhD from an Ivy League University, be affiliated with a prestigious hospital, and have years of clinical medical experience.

He tells you, over and over, how rich he is and how smart he is, but he never tells you anything you can use. I suspect he got rich by selling these books, which tell you how to get rich, supposedly.

His friend's father taught him and his friend the way of making money work for them. First he did not understand all of it but continued to work and learn. His book explains how the rich acquire their money and how to maintain one's wealth.Many people do not know that money can work for them and many are afraid of handling or loosing money. They do not know how to save it and do not believe that it is important to know about financial literacy. Therefore they believe that only lucky people get rich and do not try to think about their finances. I thought that it is important to see the difference of how the rich manage their money and how the poor manage theirs. It was interesting that it seems easier to teach children, than adults. Children are still learning and most adults do not consider another opinion or they rather believe warnings than go take risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love it, it was a great investment its more than what I was even expecting it to be, I think I read this book more than I even watch tv"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for new investors","review":"Great stories, interesting and educational.

In addition, Kiyosaki's chest pounding touting his success is too much to stomach. Add to this his marketing of his board game, and you get the whole picture.

It's also interesting to me that no one has been able to find kiyosaki's \\"rich dad\\" anywhere. Does this guy even exist? Also what business did he sell to retire at age 47?

Basically he says, buy assets and don't buy liabilities. and don't spend money on unnecessary luxuries before your cash flow can cover for these luxuries. how do you create these excess cash flows? by real estate and stocks and mutual funds. for an average middle class 9 to 5 worker, he basically says, stay in your job and buy real estate on the side and he adds, don't forget to look for IPO opportunities because that's where he made money along with his real estate business.This is the whole argument kiyosaki presents but he spends a whole book repeating this point over and over and over again.Book is terribly written -- many spelling errors (which are really annoying to me) and grammar mistakes. and the kiyosaki's insights are pretty lame and dull and pretty obvious.don't waste time reading this book and look for better, insightful books -- i am sure there are many!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired me to start my own business","review":"I read this book in college and loved it. It is not the best book for business tac-tic and business strategy, but if you are looking for some inspiration to start your business this is the book for you.He shows you the many benefits of starting your own company while giving some really good examples as to why having a job isn't necessarily the best thing for you.Thanks to Robert Kiyosaki I started a window cleaning company in college and made a lot more then my peers and enjoyed my job a lot more. It didn't produce enough money to replace a professional job when I finished my college education, but I continue to keep my eyes out for entrepreneurial opportunities.I think if you use some common sense when reading this book, it will help give you that extra push you need to start a business.Don't take all of his suggestions to the extreme or you will end up like he was (living in a car with his wife)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inetereting thoughts","review":"Okay, so i have no knowledge of investing.

If not? i work and use the excess for myself or invest until it becomes enough to cover those payments.I feel this book as definetly opened my eyes towards investing and therefore would recommend this book to most people i know, because most know absolutely nothing about investing (which is what this book says) and this would at the least help them start on their journey to figuring out how to make their money work for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this!","review":"Great book!

Here are the lessons I learned from this book.1. Asset is something that puts money in your pocket every month and it does not occupy all your time, otherwise it becomes a job.2. Liability is something that takes money out of your pocket every month.3. Spend less than you make.4. Buy assets with your savings. (Poor and middle class people tend to buy liabilities their whole lives - huge house to live in, expensive car, boats, etc.)5. When you have enough assets that generate enough monthly income that cover all your expenses, then you move into the wealthy category.You can start applying the principles in this book at any stage of your life. However, if you start early (20s-early 30s) you have a bigger chance of becoming rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned a lot","review":"The author has presented the income-expenses-assets-liabilities personal finance structure, which is really accurate. There are many really good points made - about learning, work and the way people live.I find some of the examples a bit strange though. For example I don't agree that buying and selling real estate makes passive income, it requires studying the market constantly. If you buy real estate and rent it out - now that's passive income.Anyway, anyone can learn a lot from this book, no matter what they do for a living."},{"rating":"1","title":"$20 in the trash","review":"This book is the all-time winner for the worst book - of any kind - I've ever read. Kiyosaki has provided nearly 200 pages of repetitive, contradictory, meaningless pandering pap. The best thing that can be said about this book is, congratulations to him for marketing an ages-old scam approach based on unprovable fables and dreamy wishful thinking. There are absolutely no specifics and several tactics he does provide are literally illegal.Want success? Just quit your job, get smarter people than you to work for you, make insulting and ridiculous offers for real estate, break the IRS and SEC laws and spend $3000 on a Kiyosaki seminar.If you want details before you buy or even touch this book, read the excellent expose at johntreed.com.

I enjoy how the author, Robert Kiyosaki, shows the reader the steps and lessons that he learned while growing up to become rich.

While growing up Robert though about the both ways and combined the ways of the two father. I agree with the fact that you can't rely on schools to teach you everything about money and economy.

If you want someone to blame for all those foreclosures and subprime disasters, Kiyosaki is your best bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Within the first few chapters, I was intrigued but then the book went too much into having to own your own business/be your own boss to be successful. I understand that thinking but don't have the want or ambition to own my own company, even with the tax savings involved. This book helped to change my thinking about liabilities and assets, which was the biggest asset of the book! The essence of the book is to concentrate on accumulating assets (that which puts money in your pocket, money-earning; stocks, bonds, etc) instead of concentrating on accumulating liabilities which are non-money earning material items (car, house, electronics, etc). As quoted in the book, \\"Keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid assets.\\" If you want a better financial guide suggestion, read Smart Couples Finish Rich by David Bach which gives much better guidance on investing and managing your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contempt for the poor and working class","review":"And so starts the moral and fiscal indoctrination of the ruling class... which is what this book (for me, on tape) espouses. It preaches exploitation and contempt for workers, underpaying them and pointing out the unfortunate fools to nine-year-old boys who are being groomed to carry on this shameful business.A thoroughly distasteful premise, reinforced by the daily revelations of corporate malfeasance.As a fellow former citizen of Hawaii, I say, \\"Eh, brah? What? No shame?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad","review":"This is one of those books that you can read over and over. He goes into details but keeps it simple.

It did not present a balanced views of the risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"I really liked this book. One of the the things that struck me most was how the authors described one's house as a liability, not an asset. Their point of view is simply that anything you own that takes money out of your pocket is a liability. That goes against everything I've ever heard about houses being most people's biggest asset. A slightly different way of looking at something can have a profound impact.There is another book that looks at life in an unconventional manner that has also had a deep effect on my life. \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\", by Ariel and Shya Kane, uses the authors' definition of awareness, which they define as a non-judgmental eeing of what is, to shed new light on how we operate in our lives.

At first it offended me, but the longer I read on the more I understand. Damn! Can it be that simple and my conclusion is yes it is. My whole mindset has changed to the point where I cringe when I talk to a person who lives above their means and I listen as they complain.

The way this guy is really making money is with all his best selling books (with spelling errors). I would recommend multiple streams of income by Robert Allen, at least he admitted to making millions off a book.

You do not listen too much to others who gave their negatives comments. Kiyosaki has shared his story and vision to others to learn.

He takes you all the way back to his childhood, and its like a walk down memory lane.Half way through the book I realized he had only made a few points, though still taking you through the memory walk.

As at the time of writing this review, Kiyosaki's book has received 290 reviews here. This must surely be testimony of the impact of Rich Dad Poor Dad. If you have not read this book, for your own sake and that of your children's, go get the book the now!Kiyosaki's concepts are simple, yet profound. It makes you wonder if it was so commmonsensical, why didn't you think of it earlier. But I like books like Kiyosaki's. These books have a way of crystallising simple truths and principles which the reader would otherwise have missed.Kiyosaki's concepts on wealth, what constitutes an asset and liability, how one's balance sheet interacts with the income statement, are all so powerful. If you are serious in achieving financial independence, get this book and read. And re-read it again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped","review":"There is a line in this book where the author says he never said he wanted to be the \\"best\\" author. He says he wants to be the \\"best-selling\\" author. That should tell you something about this \\"financial\\" book.Be warned...there is nothing here but common sense and an endless stream of stories that start to repeat themselves.Buyer beware. This guy has made a fortune off of pretending to know something you don't. And if he were so successful and rich to begin with, why does he spend all of his time on the road doing \\"seminars\\"? He should retire to one of the islands he owns.All it takes is common sense...there is no big secret...just a really slick sales and marketing job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"I love financial literacy books, and I had to try Rich Dad Poor Dad. In general the book is like most finincial help books, repetitive and vague. Nothing was even suggested to the reader to try until half way through the book. All the tactics the author suggests are high risk, which I don't have a problem with, except for the fact that he claims with financial education these tactics become low risk? The odds of you winning the lottery do not increase with practice... Overall the author comes off as arrogant and obnoxious. The book puts a fun twist on the idea of a day job and the concept of money, but overall this book is a waste of paper that makes this arrogant author more obnoxiously wealthy.

It is just an over hyped and marketed book filled with fluff and talk that can easily be summarised into one page in point form. No how-to, simply talk and useless repetitive anecdotes.I do not even want to place it anywhere near my collection, neither am I keen to resell it, its the first book I have ever ever tossed into the bin.For teenagers and young adults, read \\"Get your asset in gear instead.\\" Good, useful and quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I read this book many years ago and I can agree with some of the concepts he teaches... However, buyer beware that this book is little more than the same kind of gimmick that lures people into multi-level marketing schemes all the time - it promises to teach you how to get rich without working a job the rest of your life. The truth is that it is a gateway into sucking you into buying more and more and more of the author's products and services. Just like multi-level marketing, most of the money to be made is the money made by those peddling the products promising to teach you how to get rich quick. Don't buy into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"I found this book to very resourceful and to the point. It was brief, concise and used laymen's terms while providing real-life examples and simple diagrams. This resource will not give you much in the way of step-by-step instruction on how to attain your financial goals, but is definitely useful as an eye-opening inspirational guide that will allow one to soul-search and face the truth as to why he/she is not excelling financially. At the very least, it provides a foundation on how to teach our youth the value and power of achieving wealth - the honest way. I intend on pursuing more in this excellent series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I have not finished this book yet but I am very involved in it, and hope to learn a lot from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't receive the book until now","review":"I feel disappointed.

It is one of the truly life changing books you will find. Buy a case and give them as gifts! The best part for us is that we found a way to implement what Robert has to say in our very own business.

Mr Kiyosaki's teachings in this book are very simple and insightful in how to understand money, what it can do for you and how an individual should not become a slave to working for money.

It teaches about ways to make your money work for you. It is a useful book with lots of practical advice that make a lot of sense and is also a very enjoyable book to read. In a way this book worked for me, it gave me insights about my attitudes towards money and my patterns of spending which were not working for me! And although I did not become a millionaire (yet!), I handle my finances in a much better way. If you don't know ways to save and invest your money, or you're afraid to start, this book will be very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding","review":"I gave this 2 stars because the only reason to read it is to read the in depth analysis found on John T.

If it was as easy as this guy says, wouldn't everyone do it? The book was written to sell to people looking to get rich who probably are far from it, and judging from the reviews on this website the brainwashing has apparently worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","review":"Overall, I thought that Rich Dad, Poor Dad was not so rich in content, and rather poor in writing. The author of this book did not do a good job of putting all of his thoughts together in this badly written book. One thought seemed to jump from the next without any connection. Furthermore, the ideas and lessons presented in this book seemed rather obvious to me, and it was hard to understand why someone would need to read such a book at all, for everything in it seemed to be nothing more than common sense. I do not reccomend this book to anyone who truley wants to learn how to manage their finances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought the CD version of the book. Overall, it was disappointing. Too many cliches. Too redundant. Parts of stories and examples did not seem to tie together. He made it seem like it was noble to go bankrupt and sleep in a car. However, it was not fully explained how he went bankrupt in the first place. If he had been following his \\"Rich Dad's\\" advice since he was 9 years old, what happened? I started to replay the CD to gather examples of the excessive use of cliches, but decided it was not worth my time to listen to the CD again. To be fair, I have been told that the book is better than the CD. Maybe the CD left out some parts that would have made the book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad Review","review":"I found this book ver interesting. It gave me a new prespective on making money. He contrasts the differences in economic strategies between \\"Rich Dads\\" and \\"Poor Dads\\" and they generally depict the pros and cons of economic decisions typically made by entrepreneurs in contemporary society. I found the charts informative and easy to follow and I highly recommend this book to all interested in business and those who want to be successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Changing","review":"This book did to me what a good book should do - it changed my live and thinking pattern - specially about money - how to invest and how to think in the Information Age - after all, your thoughts direct your ACTIONS!As a novice it directed my thoughts towards investment - I do however believe that this book is mind-changing but does not cover ALL the aspects of investing. I think it is absolutely important to further your studies in investing before embarking on this route."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This book will change the way you think about money...for the better!

Especially at the 40% off Amazon is currently offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Be Rich, Too","review":"This book really struck a chord with me. It totally changed the way I think about money and work. Most of the concepts were new to me at the time and I read it in one sitting. Since reading it, I have learned that many of the financial details are wrong. Accountants and bankers hate the book. So what if there are better accounting books on the market? None of that changes the impact that the book had on my life. I think of it as a catalyst to futher reading and education that I may never have done. I am so very glad I read it, but with inaccurate details I give it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"This is the best book I've ever read on investing, and all without being given even one stock tip. The message is to invest in yourself--change your outdated ideas about money and investing, provide yourself constant educational opportunities, and stop making excuses for being broke!! Mr. Kiyosaki has a conversational style that Ms. Lechter captured, which makes the book an easy read. The messages are simple; most of us know them already, but we need to be reminded. What a new way to look at investing in my future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeptical","review":"I had heard great things about this book, and I was very disappointed when I read it. I have serious doubts about the credibility of Robert Kiyosaki. I don't think he made money in real estate, he made money by selling get rich books.Half of the book is empty advice filled with cliche stories. I think he made most of it up. The rest of the text is a sales pitch for his board game and seminars.There is no secret to getting rich. It just takes discipline."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time.","review":"The author states that time is your most valuable asset and I feel indignant that he wasted mine. He states a few common sense points about wealth accumulation and spends the rest of the time boasting of his wealth and suggesting HIGHLY speculative investments for his readers. I think the man was just lucky and would certainly NOT advocate following his advice on buying penny stocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"High on hype, short on details.","review":"There is an article in SmartMoney's February 2003 edition that has shed some light on this \\"Karma Chameleon\\". That is not an easy feat as very little that Kiyosaki claims to have achieved in his books can be verified. Before buying any of his books, it may be wise to read the SmartMoney article and this online analysis of Kiyosaki. The Rich Dad in his books may not even exist. This was his response in the SmartMoney article, \\"Is Harry Potter real? Why don't you let Rich Dad be a myth, like Harry Potter?\\". His books may get you thinking about your finances but without any concrete advice to guide you, the only person you are making wealthy is Robert Kiyosaki."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money is free.....or, is it?","review":"This is probably the worst personal finance book I have ever read. I almost gave up after page 20. The style and flow is horribly kindergarten and the ideas so rudimentary that it's hard to believe anyone agreed to print it.RDPD contains a very basic thread which tells you to maximise your asset growth to cover your outgoings (duh!) and then goes on to tell you something about how Kiyosaki became a millionaire. Exactly what is true and how one should start geting rich is pretty hazy. Financial details are thin and his methods vague at best.It's more of a motivational perk-me-up than a useful guide to making money and achieving financial independence. If there is something positive to come out of the book, it's Kiyosaki's constant preaching that a house is just as much a liability as an asset and buying the family home early on in life can seriously impede your ability to achieve financial independence through leveraging your balance sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of motivation, almost no practical advice","review":"Take a look at the wide range of reviews here.. lots of fives, and lots of ones. The fives are high on the motivation from the book. The ones were looking for practical advice, and found none. This book WILL motivate you to improve your financial situation, but it will probably leave you wondering where to start. You should really only buy one of the books in his series if you are really interested. It doesn't matter which, because they all keep repeating the same things over and over. He will probably be pumping out books full of filler information until he dies.You will also notice at the beginning of all of his books \\"Although based on a true story, certain events in the book have been fictionalized for educational content and impact.\\" So, in other words, he makes up nonsense stories to try to sell you his ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seminar fluff, a whole lot of nothing","review":"This book is nonsense. The \\"tone\\" of the writing is condescending and repetitive. It's like reading a motivational speech at one of those money-making scam seminars. As others have mentioned, the author's veracity is in question regarding the facts of his life. I do not believe there is a \\"Rich Dad\\", personally. I don't think we should line the pockets of this guy. I STRONGLY urge you to do a search on the author's name on Google or any good search engine, and maybe add in the modifier \\"criticism\\" or \\"MLM\\". If I could save just one person from wasting their money on this book, I'll be pleased. Oh, and telling people not to bother with an education? Pinhead advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"It's all in the packaging. The author even admitted that he wasn't a very good writer, but knew how to sell a product. He gave an example of another book which sold millions because it had a provocative title. I find this out halfway through this book with a provocative title! In other words, I just helped him make more money, but I learned nothing. Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable and Dangerous","review":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad is both valuable and dangerous. It was valuable to me because the book itself provides some very useful concepts (including the philosophy that I try to live my life by every day - I do not work for money; I work to learn) around matters of personal finance. The idea that we are all working for ourselves is probably the central and most important point. However, some of the investment advice (including the some of the highly leveraged real estate techniques) are very dangerous and were the same techniques that wiped out many people during this last real estate bubble. I highly recommend this book as a good overall framework on how you should guide your career and financial life; but don't get bogged down by some of the specific investment strategies. You could be very sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its so tiny","review":"This particular book is no bigger than your palm. I wish they would have given the dimensions for the actual size of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Kiyosaki, Poor Advice","review":"It has always amazed and eluded me to see many of the worst books on the market for Real Estate and other forms of investing are \\"best sellers\\". Kiyosaki like Donald Trump are both examples of good marketing and motivational self professed guru's that offer poor advice. In this book, Kiyosaki's attempts to pass off his fictitious life story of lessons learned as a work of non-fiction. To add insult to injury, he gives financial advice throughout the book that is ridiculous and in some cases criminal.Everyone who gave 5 stars to this book either has a financial incentive to do so, or has no clue that they have been duped by another B.S. artist. I highly recommend searching for John T. Reed's review of Rich Dad, Poor Dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"redundant fluff that is redundant and fluffy","review":"Here's the substance of the entire book:1. Be smart about investing and keep looking for better opportunities for your money.2. Take advantage of the power of compound interest.3. Learn elsewhere how to make clever business decisions.4. Follow these simple rules, and \\"you too\\" can become rich without working hard.Open the book, read the first or last 10 pages and put it back on the shelf. From there, you'll be motivated to learn about finance without wasting your time reading the same stuff twenty times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"You will not get rich in one night, but you will learn how money works, the easy way. I found it useful because I learned how to see money with a different type of glasses. I began to change the way I invested my savings, no matter the economic times.

Save your money. Invest it in assets. Do not spend more than you have. Duh.The potential knowledge you could derive from this book would be less than that of a typical high school education.

It was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think it is.","review":"This book is the most repetitive, meandering scribble I have ever read.

This is not a how-to book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good thing","review":"Overall this book left a bad taste in my mouth. The childhood story is obviously untrue. I unfortunately did research on Kiyosaki and his book after I bought it.There are much finer books about becoming financially independant out there. Your Money or Your Life is a fine example. I would give it the lowest rating of one star except that he does make a point that your house/mortgage is a liability which I highly agree with.Most of what he writes about is covered in other books which are written MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Every now and then I buy one of these \\"...everyone is talking about it !\\" books. They are all the same: \\"Want to get rich ? find someone desperate selling real estate, buy it cheap (no money down if you can), and wait. Dont get into consumer debt.\\" etc. You do not need a book to tell you that and there is nothing new about real estate (or other financial) speculation. Some people get rich because they work hard, others because they are smart and many because they get lucky. Read it if you want but do not count on it to change your life. By the way, if you can become half the salesman that Kiyosaki is then you can count on becoming rich !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money to buy this book","review":"This is a book that makes only a few points and takes forever to get to those points. Totally unnecessary long worded stories, lots of page-filling graphs and attempts to bash the rich. This books seems to be targeted to people wanting to be rich but hating the already rich. There are many other, better books out there that provide sound financial advice, don't waste your money with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generalities, but no specific info","review":"Dissappointed in this book.......it was highly recommended, but I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much space between the covers","review":"This book is the perfect example of one that should have been an article. An editing fiasco. There are interesting ideas presented, but the personal anecdotes take up the majority of the space and have truly no pedagogical value. Most are barely coherent and hardly interesting. Plus, for all his statements on how important it is to develop financial intelligence, he does a poor job explaining how to do it, and provides no fundamental knowledge for the reading of valuable texts like, for example, the Wall Street Journal. Save yourself the money--borrow it from the library, or skip it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"morally repugnant","review":"this book makes me want to vomit. from the beginning of the book, you get to hear the story of this guy's dad, and how wise he was to not pay someone any more money than they asked for, because they deserved to be poor. that's right, guys! according to this book, the poor deserve to be poor! i suggest the author take a trip to some place like africa, and visit any of the MILLIONS of poor people on this planet (after all, us well-off americans are the vast minority) and tell them to their face that it's their fault. hey, maybe it's God's plan! after all, this is a CHRISTIAN book, right? gee, i thought God was supposed to be against greed, and for treating people right. guess i was wrong. a great primer on how to treat people like dogs and have a heart of pure stone. Godly? HA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke","review":"This book is a joke. It does provide a \\"revolutionary\\" idea that is just what many people want to hear, i.e. \\"don't work for your money.\\" This is highly useful for the author in that it gets people to buy the book and buy copies for their friends. (afterall *he* certainly is not working for his money)The truth is, his line of self help personal finance junk is just a small step up from the trinkets he was selling before- he is merely capitalizing on another fad.Everyone wants to believe that there are some \\"secrets\\" that the rich must know, and this provides a nearly irresistable urge to read the book. Resist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Infomercial instead","review":"This book was not only poorly written and edited, but there was no real content. This was a typical infomercial, with the caveat that you buy his $200.00 game board -- that's what is really disturbing. Atleast Robbins and Ziglar are upfront with their stories. I would not waste the money on this book. Read anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much philosophy","review":"Surely not a \\"how to\\" book. Author bombards you with stories on how he struck it rich, but never gives you more than philoshophy on how to do it yourself. Unlike other titles similar to this one (ex. The millionaire next door, The Motley Fool Series etc.), this book offered nothing concrete by which you could go by or start off with. If you are looking for a lecture, buy this book. If you want a title that gets you on your way to a secure financial future, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of the Obvious","review":"Like others have said, the author simply lists logical steps to becoming wealthy that might as well be common sense to most people, such as saving more than you spend. He takes a couple of simple ideas and keeps on talking about them throughout the length of the book, without any real content...he seems to just be talking for the sake of talking. I tried to read as much as I could but simply could not swallow all the drivel.As for Kiyosaki himself, you need simply go to these websites and learn a bit more about him before you pluck down your hard-earned money to buy this book.http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.htmlhttp://slate.msn.com/?id=2067175"},{"rating":"1","title":"there are far better books","review":"A long time ago I read the great short book, How to Get Rich and Stay Rich by Fred Young.

It's not nearly as easy as this author implies. There are many good books and authors to guide you. Peter Lynch, John Swenson, and yes, John Reed, if you are willing to WORK at the real estate BUSINESS. And it's not an easy business.This guy is just the latest \\"it's easy to be rich\\" guy.

That's it.There is nothing more in this book than common sense financial advice that we have all heard before. \\"If you want to become wealthy, you have to own your own business\\".

I found nothing in this book to be of any real value - all you get from Kyosaki is a lot of chest beating and tall talk, but you get little to no actual INFORMATION.This is one of those inspirational \\"you can do it if you decide to do it\\" books, which is big on promises but is very short on real advice that can be followed.I am actually pretty surprised by the number of positive comments. I can only surmise that (a) we were each reading a different book; or (b) that some of these positive reviews were not written by actual readers.Do yourself a favor: if you want to get rich, start by doing some real research.

This goes against the hypothises of this not-very-convincing book. I have since found out that the author fictionalized much of his story (I should have read the fine print).

I also read \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\". \\"Millionaire\\" is a much better book than \\"Dad\\". It has most of the information that \\"Dad\\" has minus those long and repeated lines. I also agree that Robert is more trying to \\"sell himself\\". His \\"rich dad poor dad\\" approach starts to annoy me after I went through about a quarter of the book.Read \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", I liked it so much that I sent it to my father in Malaysia after finished reading it.

The price estimates were extremely over-inflated (a welcome surprise), and the maps didn't help at all.

At least half of the book is devoted to Hurnard's belief. This is what I hate about born again people, they feel they have all the answers and the rest of us are pagans. Hurnard writes very little about what happened to her during the siege. She recounts stories about the shells and bombings of her neighborhood, but other than that, not much else.The reader interested in the birth of Israel should avoid this book.

It can even be stood up vertically like a book and stored on a bookshelf, and with its labeled splines, finding the pictures you are searching for is easier than ever. So, in this age of digital photos, there are fewer and fewer of us who are having pictures developed. But, if you're like me, then you want the ones you already have to last.

On the other hand, I agree with reviewer Tom Donadio,that Dawn of the 21st Century is a much better photographic essay of the new millennium. It shows people celebrating the new millennium as well as gorgeous once in a lifetime fireworks pictures. There is a broader range of pictures also, and comprises over 500 pictures from over 300 photographers, both pro and amateur.

(I read it as the choice of another member of my book group.) Although I'm a voracious reader, I found \\"Finches,\\" like many ersatz 20th-century \\"Victorian\\" novels, way too long--and I was able to foresee at least one crucial development of the plot long before it was revealed. The author at times has a rather clipped style and uses words in what at best might be considered an unusual or \\"fresh\\" way, but I often had to reread her sentences to figure out their meaning. The two lead characters especially were unappealing and the ostentatious description of their ostentatious wealth was boring. Unless you live in Oregon and are a committed devotee of its history, don't waste your time on this one.

Mr. Orr has taken Christianity and removed the things he doesn't like about it and compounded upon the things he does like, and this is his synopsis. Since I believe Christianity is another religious myth like the many others that have come before it, I found his insistence that one must invoke the Christian God's name daily as part of one path to immortality as silly and a bit hypocritical. If you are a Christian with an open mind, then you might enjoy this book.

Still, it's beautifully filmed, heart-warming, and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this version; get the original Disney movie version","review":"The original Greyfriar's Bobby movie from Disney is one of my favorite movies... and my wife's absolute favorite. I was excited to see a new movie with a Westie in the title role. This latest version is a travesty! It strays from the original true story to put in a predictable and 100% fictitious story line involving a wicked mill owner (dirty capitalist!) who is bound to murder Bobby so his oppressed workers might not be distracted by the dog. What tripe! The original Greyfriar's Bobby story is true and the 1961 Disney sticks basically to the actual story. The actual story is truly remarkable! Why the makers of this latest version felt the need to \\"spice it up\\" I will never know. Their additions, including Bobby being a psychic and a dramatic performer of pantomime, are laughable for the wrong reasons and detract from the actual true story. Do your family a favor and buy the 1961 version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute Dog Movie","review":"Based on a true story that took place in Scotland in the 18th or 19th century( I can't remember which), this movie is about a terrier who is so loyal to his master that he insists on sleeping on his master's grave after the man dies from tuberculosis. However, dogs are not allowed in the cemetery. The movie's plot revolves around how Bobby (the terrier) and his human friends try to work around the silly cemetery rules. Sounds like a thin plot, but the dog (a West Highland White Terrier) is so darn cute and the Scottish accents (of the humans) are so, well, SCOTTISH,it makes for an entertaining movie. The fact that it's based on a true story also helps. (They actually have a monument to Bobby in this town in Scotland.) Don't miss the song at the end of the movie, \\"Here Inside,\\" which is the most beautiful and moving song I've ever heard about missing someone who has passed away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays For A Non-play Reader","review":"I rarely read plays (not counting Mr. S.) and rarely read poetry. I'm glad I broke with tradition and read these. I think I went to high school with some of the characters - and 45 years later some of them haven't changed. The plays are so funny that I found myself reading out loud (to myself) using different voices for the characters. I have never done that before and it added to my enjoyment to create a \\"play\\" while reading the script.Most enjoyable - maybe I'll tackle some more plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive","review":"This book is very helpful for writters and students. I'm currently reading this book for Fiction English. This book has many advantages because it includes an explanation sentense by sentense of why the author wrote his/her story in a certain way.

This book scared the heck out of me. It has numerous comments in it that are aimed towards war, violence, the Gulf War... I wonder if this book intended a motive other than educational.I also find the book to be not so much about learning, but more about memorizing facts. Not knowing the information behind the facts. And as far as what a child \\"should know\\" per grade level is pretty much underestimating children today.

The book seems to be based on the writers' opinions rather than research. Content organization and layout is confusing, along with a VERY poor index.

At the end of the movie my son (after having kept his ears and eyes covered for a good portion of the movie) asked why it said it was scary on the cover.

Some one told me this was one of the most \\"disturbing \\" movies ever made, i sure was disturbed that I paid 12 bucks for this pile.

Almost an hour & a half of two young women being raped & tortured by pathetic scumbags is not my idea of a good movie. It is unnerving, unsettling & very sad.

The film depicts two girls who are going to see a concert and on the way want to score some pot to enhance the evenings pleasures.

That being understood,I would not classify this as a horror movie. In fact, I don't know what I would classify this as. It's part horror, part exploitation, part action, part drama, and part slapstick.I found it very disturbing and graphic in its depictions of humiliation and savagery. The violence in this film is so gritty and in your face that you can't help but feel as helpless as the films young victims. The film shows no remorse at all for the torture inflicted on the helpless young women, and that is probably why people have such a strong response to this movie.Do yourself a favor and buy this film. It pushes all of the right buttons in your psyche to make you writhe at the torture of the victims, and at the same time love the villans as only a true horror fan can."},{"rating":"1","title":"-100 billion stars","review":"This movie is a painfull experience. I'm really not that pickey when it comes to movies but I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in every sense of the word. This movie has no redeaming qualities other than the fact that it eventually ends. When you start this movie you will wish you never started it. I'm a Wes Craven fan but even he is probably ashamed of this. I'll say it one more time, this is the worst movie I have ever seen and in no way is this frightening. It may be a little disturbing, but even the diturbing parts are not entertaining, they are just terrible. The plot? Honestly, if you have find any plot email me cause I am curious as to what this painful experience is all about.

The story is about three escaped con's who capture,rape and kill a girl in the woods next to her house. The girls parents find out about the killing and take there revenge.This could have been a good revenge movie, even a drama if Craven just put a little effort into it. As we saw this year with In The Bedroom, a fantastic film also along the same premise (they both deal with the loss of a child, and a parents revenge) a movie like this can be a good, serious drama.This movie is not only slow but it also has mabey the worst score I have ever heard.

I was 16 years old. We only made it through about 1/2 the movie. We left when the huge knife flung up. This movie was gruesome, and I can hardley recommend it. I was so shaken up about this movie I could not sleep for weeks. Even now I feel upset writing this. I have since rented the movie to compare how I felt then to how I feel now. It still has an impact, but not as much as it did back then. I believe that is because movie content has changed over the years and there are far more disturbing movies out today. I had no idea what was going to happen in the movie and was shocked to see what happened to the 2 girls that hitch hiked into New York City to see a concert.

It serves no purpose whatsoever. While other horror flicks have some wisdom to impart, if only the partial wisdom that there is real evil in this world, this one has absolutely no merit whatsoever. If one was to infer anything from it, it is that the producers are vile. It seems that audiences enjoy horrible themes because they don't have horror in their own lives: obviously, the distance from the horrible fate of others is a sense of consolation that is mistaken by the viewer as entertainment. Others seem to concede it and embrace it with some dark pleasure. It is only wise counsel that notes all life is destined to death and the second side of the coin: what are people going to do about it? I thank God for Jesus Christ who will resurrect the faithful to new life with incorruptible bodies and the termination of any power of death over such lives. I know of no hospital that can make those guarantees."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars","review":"Last house on the left sucked. Story was about 2 girls who get kidnapped and then try to get away from these psycho druggys and end up dead, then the family of the girls seek revenge. I saw this film once, i could not beleive wes craven did this. This film is horrible, and not cause its low budget either, texas chainsaw massacre was low budget and was an excellent film. I dont know how anyone can find this movie scary, the end of the film isnt shocking at all its just some father coming after them with a chainsaw and then it ends. The characters in texas chainsaw massacre were scary and disturbing and in some parts funny but these characters had no charm or scaryness about them and they certainly are not memorable, just a group of drugged up whackos.

Perhaps living in the early 21st century with terrorists who kill thousands with their cowardly attacks on civilians buildings has blunted my sensitivities and hundred of hours of watching various zombies, euro-demons and power tool wielding revenants has dulled my sense, but I found this movie to be somewhat tame. Sure, the vile murders in this film were the kind of evil that deserves to be eradicated and we occassionally wandered into cruelty and depravity, the whole undertone of the film kept being neutered by a comic relief sheriff duo.I'm sure that this was really disturbing back in the 70's, but I felt the movie hasn't aged well. It is definitely worth watching as historical reference, but I can't say that it was really even disturbing. If this caused folk to flee the theaters throwing-up, I wonder what Hellrazor or Evil Dead would have done if we could have shown it to those audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent if you must, but don't buy.","review":"I am a Wes Craven fan, and I love thrillers and horror movies. However, this movie was a big disappointment. I understand that it was a breakthrough for the genre, but it hasn't aged well at all. The characters are laughable, the script is Wes Craven's worst (albeit his first), the music is unbearable, and the cinematography/editing is amateurish at best.

For an example of skillfully made classic exploitation cinema, check out Craven's followup, \\"The Hills Have Eyes,\\" which shows that he was capable of learning from his mistakes. And please don't pay attention to Craven or the dimwitted \\"film scholars\\" (Robin Wood, e.g.) who claim that \\"Last House\\" is a powerful statement about the Vietnam era (or somesuch nonsense), because it isn't: it's an inept attempt to create a \\"calling-card\\" trashfest, not a piece of profound social commentary.

This original version is boring, i actually fell asleep 4 times. I had to stop it and come back to watch the rest the next day. This is supposed to be a horror/thriller movie, but then the benny hill type circus soundtrack is horrible. Some of the scenes are even humorous, like the police officers trying to hitchhike after they ran out of gas. The new modern version is much better.

Basically it's reputation preceded it and many of us were horrified at the thought of the movie without actually ever seeing it. The trouble is, is that once you did see it, it was a major let down, mainly because it is really poorly shot and most of the script is totally unbelievable(the parents revenge portion anyway). The flipside is that we did'nt come to watch a movie with a good scipt and top notch acting--we came as depraved curiosity seekers and some of what we saw was truly disturbing. Was it as disturbing as we had envisioned---no. Did it live up to it's reputation--no. It's really a toss up I would guess. I think it served a purpose in 72' but now it seems like a student film and I guess to some degree it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment!","review":"Ok, i have heard that this movie is supposed to be so scary, but all it did was disappoint me!

At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it.

I have been told time and time again that this is one of the most disturbing movies ever made. If disturbing means ridiculously cartoonish, bland, poorly edited, complete with amateurish acting - then disturbing it is. I may have half-cringed at a few of the scenes, and maybe it had some cinematic value for 1972 - the year it was released. And sure, it may be strong coffee for the squeamish. But I can't help but remember The Wizard of Oz having more moments of spooky dramatic tension than this. If you want a genuinely disturbing Wes Craven film, watch The Serpent and the Rainbow. I look back now and laugh at how hesitant I was to watch this crap burger of a film out of fear of how frightening it would be.

Seriously, don't buy this. I don't know why it is so highly regarded. The acting, story, and especially the music is terrible. It's like porn quality acting, a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie.

NOT TRUE!! At least in my humble opinion. I watched it when it came on demand (cable people know) and I am so glad I did not waste my money on this ridiculous movie.Two idiot girls are chased and raped and everything else by these dumb convicts. Unless I am wrong, and believe me, I tried to give it a fair chance and watched it twice, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.

So it got stuck next to all of our other DVD's until one day I seen my son stuck it in, so it got turned right off and thrown in the trash where it belongs.

The story...(yawn sip of coffee) slow and boring. Not scary a little psychoish. The soundtrack...well folks its like mixing the theme from the partridge family with Michael Myers in Halloween. It doesnt work. No suspense no buildup in the movie no scares.

I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes.

I don't see how this film can be innovative at all. First of it's kind? Inspiration for many movies ahead of it? I think not. Many people who are in favor of this film point out the sociological perspective of the plot and how it represents a breakdown between cultures, but anyone who really understands the film will agree that it was made to be perverse and exploit, not to teach or innovative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even It's Great Payback Ending Couldn't Save This One","review":"\\"Supposedly\\" based on a true incident, \\"Last House on the Left\\" has an intruiging concept, but the film falls flat on it's face with poor filmaking and too many tasteless and gross scenes.

The ad claimed to be so scary that to avoid fainting you had to keep repeating it's only a movie, it's only a movie. After it was over, we all felt cheated because the movie was not scary and did not make sense. Apparently, we saw an edited version back in '72. The new DVD has the restored version and lived up to it's orginal advertisement. I'm a fan of horror movies and not easily shocked but I had a hard time watching \\"Last House on the Left\\". The first part of the movie concerns the kidnapping, humiliation, tortue and brutal death of two teenage girls. The second part concerns the revenge exacted on the thugs who killed the girls. The brutality seems so real that it's difficult (for even jaded me) to be entertained. I'm giving it two stars because I can recognize it is well made but it's extremely difficult to watch; and being a gore hound/horror movie buff, that's saying alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the last i'm afraid!!!","review":"not just a sick movie but one that tries to pass it's self off as a tale of some greater meaning when mindless death and gore(i love gore movies as much as some other people do but this one is just sick) and really not worth anymore of mine(or yours) time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scary","review":"This isn't scary, disturbing, or disgusting, so what is the big deal about this film?

This movie indeed crossed the boundaries, but I wouldn't exactly call it a horror movie. It felt more like a piece from the 6 O'clock evening news. The antagonists were just four regular people who were very extremely psychologically disturbed.

This was no worse than every other 70s/80s horror films. I was actually quite bored throughout this film. The most sickenly amusing scenes are in the beginning before they go in the woods. I kept expecting something utterly gruesome and terrible to happen. It never did, unless you consider rape (which really wasn't that graphic; never shows anything).

I'm just going to say that it wasn't scary it was kind of just a thriller/drama. Sad kinda really. The music was odd to say the least. I think the movie had a lot of hidden meanings in it, poetic kind of. Don't buy this if you're looking for horror, it's just not in this movie. Yeah there are killings but...that doesn't make it a horror movie by default.

But, no. Why this movie is in the horror category at all is beyond me. It was really just a long, drawn-out, and sad look at the rape and kidnapping of two girls. Not my idea of a good premise for a movie. And yes, I did read the reviews here - and some fans who argue that it symbolizes some kind of middle American nightmare of loss of innocence in the 1970s or whatever - those kinds of films aren't lost on me. This one was just completely un-scary, non-interesting, and devoid of any kind of film viewing pleasure at all.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

Please do not waste your money buying this movie, unless you are willing to sit through the STUPIDEST movie ever made-- It wasn't disturbing at ALL. It wasn't disgusting at ALL.

The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void. In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't seem like a Craven film","review":"After hearing so much about this film, I came across it in a Blockbuster and rented it. I was somewhat disappointed with the film. The idea behind it is good, but it just didn't live up to the standards that people make it seem to have. The music is just, how do I put it, wrong. It simply doesn't fit. A hapy-pitched disco song during a chase through the woods? Come on, they could've done better than that.

It was much more pungent than the watered down movie version. The next best thing is actually reading the script.The off-Broadway play properly casted actors suited for the parts rather than glitzy film stars. You will also find that the movie heavily \\"sanitized\\" the storyline and dialogs. This resulted in a cartoonish movie rather a serious theatrical drama that just happened to be funny.If you saw and or read the play first, you may find the movie rather disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I never got to see the off-Broadway production but I loved the film and reading this play is the next best thing!In many ways, this is a better written story than \\"Wall Street\\" or \\"Barbarians at the Gate.\\" It is technically accurate and really gives you a flavor of high finance in the 1980s.

I did expect to be reasonably entertained. I found instead that the stories were actually boring and dull. What is the difference between these stories and the Retief stories of the early 1960s? For one thing, while the earlier stories were satirical, they were also space opera. They poked fun in a light, entertaining manner. The later stories are all satire, with little adventure. The satire is heavy-handed and aimed at obvious targets, and the stories are much too long. The earlier Retief stories tended to be short, tight novelettes. The stories in this collection (\\"Retief in the Ruins,\\" \\"There is a Tide,\\" and \\"The Woomy\\" ) are all overwritten novellas. Too bad, too bad. Laumer wrote a lot that was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst scifi I've ever read","review":"A collection of stories about the famous Retief character, using the most unwieldly prose writing imaginable. If he eliminated all the \`Swifties' (\`ly' adverbs) from the book, it would probably only be twenty pages long. There isn't much substance there aside from the dialogue, which looks like this:\\"Boy, it's hot out here,\\" Retief said ARIDLY.And, of course, the annoying \\"see issue #500\\" problem, as in the sections of dialogue that go like this:He spoke to them in the tone of an Ambassador With A Severe Bowel Cramp (#2447-ed.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great graphic","review":"graphic is very bright and stands out, fabric wicks away moisture well. sizes run small, may want to buy one size larger then you normally buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit!

It is action packed and an easy read. The author uses very descriptive language to help you understand military concepts, weapons and acronyms. The dossiers are wonderful, it takes me back to the old G.I. Joe series where each member had a Dossier. The good guys are seemingly ordinary folks that are thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Their backgrounds help them, but you will find characters that you can relate to or that are like someone you know. The bad guys are so bad that the author has you wanting to jump into the book to take them on yourself. You will find yourself cheering for the good guys and hoping that the bad guys get what's coming to them.

Also, if your playing it in a continuous loop, the extra tracks come in as a big hassle.

Danzig 1&2 were a call back to stripped down blues based rock and roll-they rock-but didn't leave much room for experimenting. Danzig 3&4 adds change to this, like all musicians-one needs to try new things and expand-understandable. A bit more dramatics at times(which can be a bit silly), but also more complex melodies and structures, more creative production, and we see on Danzig 4, Glenn reeling back his need to impress us, giving way to something a bit more honest-its as if he's realized he's happy. Simply melodies on 4, with more creative production, more mature lyrics, and glipse of a certain calm/with an unsettling storm ahead. If you have any doubts, check out track one-Danzig can still beat over the head, and check out the production-very cool mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is No Barriers","review":"Imagine a simple melody, only 3 or 4 measures, 2/4, that you ask diferente musicians from diferent styles and culture around the world to play it in their own mood.

The rotation still works but the fan is presumed dead. Be aware it may fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR THE MONEY","review":"I was a little concerned about customer complaints that the base was unsteady, but but the item anyway. The fan attaches to the base by three screws. The triangle formed by these screws is not equal on all sides and you have to make sure each hole on the base is aligned with the corresponding well on the fan. I did not note this at first and the fan was very unsteady. Once I assembled it correctly, there is a little play in the base, but the fan does not tilt at all during operation. Although I was it was a bit quieter, it probably makes less noise than the circular fan it replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"we live in Alaska and have no air conditioner or ceiling fans and sometimes it's a little too warm at night in our bedroom. purchased this fan and just recently purchased another for guest room. it does exactly what it needs to do - cools the room nicely and is fairly quiet. it's lightweight and very easy to move around. i wouldn't say flimsy, but just not bulky at all. i'd highly recommend - especially at the good price offered on amazon and super saver shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please fix the description: 30 \\"diameter fan blade\\"","review":"I have not bought this fan, although I am interested and read all the reviews.

However, I was really surprised at how good the quality of the product was. It is solid, and sturdy. It's simple to use; off button, low, medium, high, and rotate buttons. It's pretty quiet, just a low hum while running, but the fan blows hard. I highly recommend this fan. It's about as tall as a an average doorknob. You'll need a screwdriver to attach the base to the tower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool real Cool!!!","review":"Paid 30 bucks worth a lot more. It cools my 22 x 13 living room on low. The air conditioning kicks on less now. Yes it is January and I have my AC on,because I live in Florida. It is quiet and blows better than my old gigantic fan on a stand, or dirt collector that is. It is loud on high, but no more than any other I have owned and a little noise for a lot of cool air is worth it.

Her previous fan of 5 years gave out so I decided to get this one. It was cheap enough....you get what you pay for! She was looking for \\"white noise\\", this was more like a jet engine with a loose screw. The unit shakes and rattles HORRIBLY. I submitted for a return and got a 2nd one within a week. Same problem. This fan is not worth a dime! I will probably try to return it for a full refund this time instead of an exchange.

This fan does what it is intended to do and that is to move air which it does quite well. Don't expect it to move as much air as a large box fan, but it will fit where no other style fan will.

Assembly was quite easy even for a clutz like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"oscillating fan","review":"I had the fan for about a week, and it started to make a \\"knocking noise\\"...although it continued to cool. I checked the base and it was installed correctly. Finally called the company, and I would have to send it back. They would then send a replacement. But I no longer had the boxes that it came in, and the cost of sending it back would have been almost 1/2 the cost of the fan.

It gave me an excuse run out to Bed Bath and Beyond. I picked up a simple Lasko table fan for $17. The air output on this one totally blows away (no pun intended) that of the more expensive Duracraft Tower Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"This fan provides real good air for a pretty good distance.I have no problem with base or whatsoever.

Since I'm a slow reader, because I'm so busy and have lots of books I want to read for business, I bought the audiobook also and it's helped out tremendously(finish a book in 3 days instead of 3 weeks).

These Ronnie Scott recordings are every bit as exciting, sometimes even more freewheeling and electric in character. The sound quality is very good for a live club recording, and renditions of \\"I Do It For Your Love\\", \\"My Romance\\", \\"Peau Douce\\", and \\"But Beautiful\\" are definitive examples of the Evans/Johnson/LaBarbera trio at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative Book!","review":"This book is full of helpful info.

(especially rubberlip plecos)I'm currently using it to drive my homemade water polisher. Here's how to create one yourself using this powerhead:1. Take a small container such as a plastic yogurt container (keep the lid!), rubbermaid container, etc.. and cut a hole in the top lid so that the end of the powerhead intake will fit inside snugly.2.Fill the container with polyester batting (can be found in the fabric section of stores). A huge bag costs $3 or less and will last forever!3. Close the lid and stick the end of the powerhead intake through.4. Turn it on and you are good to go!

A good power head for larger under-gravel filters or foam block bacteriological filtering. Parts are readily available, impeller etc.. One caveat, it appears it is too easy to break off the tabs that secure the impeller assembly rendering the entire device trash.Update after 9 months of use............The tabs securing the impeller assembly to the head have begun to spread causing the jet direction to change while in use, very frustrating.

However these newer ones are now made in China. This may or may not make a difference to some people but here is the issue I came across. I use this pump to feed a reactor for my fishtank. Normally I use a ball valve to throttle down the flow to keep my carbon from grinding itself down to powder. With the old style pump this was no problem, I could dial it back and it would work as quietly as it did unrestricted. With the new style pump made in China the machining process must be a little more laxed or something as ANY back pressure at all makes these pumps rattle horribly!Be aware of this issue if you plan on using this pump to feed a reactor, or skimmer or anything else that might cause some back pressure. The noise will drive you crazy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Homza's work is choppy, incomplete, inaccurate.","review":"I am very familiar with the material discussed in this work, and Homza's interpretations of history are not at all accurate. She completely underemphasizes the brutality of the Spanish Inquisition and, instead, portrays the process as \\"enlightened upholding of social norms.\\" Furthermore, her writing style is choppy and has no flow. It reads something like an old telegram [stop] I was greatly anticipating this work, as it deals with a pet subject of mine, but Homza really failed to live up to my expectations. I hope she is better at teaching than she is at writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Richard","review":"Analysis wassuperficial and prose was lacking. Homza definitely seems to havestrong views about the Renaissance, but she stretches her evidence tofit what she wants the Renaissance to be.

Zippy the Pinhead everyone's heard of. Even Ernie Pook's Comeek, and heck, Trotts and Bonnie... oh, nevermind.Buy this book. Knight's a freaking genius. He's a generation X'er (maybe that's why he doesn't get a lotta press), but that makes him the cartoonist of my generation, as far as I'm concerned. If you were born after the Kennedy assassination, but are old enough to remember the Bicentennial, there outta be a law; you should be REQUIRED to buy this book. Or maybe our parents should be required to buy it for us.Oh, just get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I can't do any better than 1 star","review":"Somehow this book showed up on my daughters bookshelf. I have no idea how it got there. The book is so poorly written it's not even laughable. It's actually quite sad. The fact that it rhymes but doesn't flow rhythmically makes it an incredibly awkward read. Then, just as you start to this that this HAD TO BE written by an 8 year old, he rhymes \\"way\\" with \\"anyway\\" and then you just roll your eyes.The thoughts are totally random, there is no flow, and the structure is just plain bad.Sorry Billy.

Mr. Crystal needs to head back to high school for a course in rhyme scheme and rhythm. A lot of the lines are forced and awkward to read - mediocre, at best. Case in point:\\"I have the feeling that you understand everything I say,like granpa boo boo lee doo, la la la la la lay.\\"Uhm, yeah. Lines like that make me wonder if Mr. Crystal just scribbled out some half thought-out lines just to see if his book would sell based on his name alone.The only redeeming quality that this book has is the beautiful collection of illustrations by Guy Porfirio.

Luckily, Amazon had it, while local booksellers didn't. I don't care how well it's written. I don't teach English. What I love is that it captures much of our first year together, it's from me (unlike Grandma usually buying stuff for her), the pictures are great, and she can snuggle up on my lap while I read it to her, changing the words to personalize it even more to fit just the two of us. Billy Crystal did a great job capturing in words and pictures what I can't. I hope this special gift for my beautiful granddaughter will help her know in the years to come just how special she is to her grandpa! I'm betting she'll focus on that and not if the rhyme is forced (per another reviewer). Grandpa DR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandpa's Little One- a beautiful gift","review":"This book is beautiful.

Each is true and is described in story format. Canning wrote the introduction and had the stories written by several authors. It is likely that some authors made up details in some chapters for literary effect, but from what I know of history the book is true.As with any edited book, some of the accounts are better than others. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Ghengis Khan and the Thugees. Some others were not so good. But then each reader will likely be taken in by a different historical horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT TEXT","review":"I used this book as a supplement to my main text for a graduate level course in colloids and surface physical chemistry. It was by far one of the best texts to use for this area. It makes things easier to understand without all the math in some other texts. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Story That Tries to Throw You Off Its Scent","review":"Remember Me has many meanings. The director or screenwriter tries very hard to throw you off the scent of the surprise ending to this emotionally charged drama.The story it tells unfolds in a fashion you wonder if its a love story or if its an indie film about self introspection. The underlying theme is dealing with loss and making the most of your time here. The film re-affirms this notion by quoting Ghandi several times about people being insignificant in our actions but we must nonetheless just do it.The pace can be slow at times and definitely full of emotions. The acting by the cast is believable and did a good job having us relate. Most memorable emotion for me would be the bond between brother and sister, Tyler (Robert Pattinson) and Caroline.Watch this movie, you'll be touched by the ending and enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember Me","review":"First of all I will be honest and admit my only reason for watching this film was because it stars Robert Pattinson (Edward from Twilight.) But now I know that even if it didn't, it would still be a worthwhile film to see. It deals with serious issues, and tells the story of Tyler whose parents are divorced, and whose dad has provided everything materially, but has never been there emotionally for him or his younger sister. Tyler is somewhat reckless, who lets his temper get the best of him at times, which ultimately gets him into trouble. It deals with family tragedy, the bullying of his little sister at school, his falling in love, and just basically his relationships with everyone he knows. It makes you think, and realize to value the time you have with those you love. I recommend seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember Me","review":"This movie is saddening and uplifting at the same time. Pierce Brosnan truly stood out in this movie. This movie will get your attention the very first ten minutes. Pattinson proved he can beat out his twlight role. This movie is very emotional and will affect everyone differently. Very watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but Sad","review":"It was something different than what I normally watch. I really liked it a lot till the end.

Touched you with emotions of love, anger, doubt and loss, just to name a view.Pattinson was foudroyant in his performance, bringing all the emotions to the screen.

I went to New York in 2002, when there was still a lot of pain everywhere, and I thought the events of 9/11 were handled very thoughtfully. Critics seem to have a hard time giving the Twilight cast a break. That being said, I've read many complimentary articles about Rob's portrayal of Tyler and I agree with them all. If you haven't seen this movie you're missing something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I fell in love with Robert Pattinson in this movie. He played such a different character than the one portrayed on Twilight. He has an excellent talent. I was interested the whole time during the movie. I was amazed by the story line. I was hoping he was going to be able to stand up to his Edward character, and just blew me away. Once this movie drops in price a bit, I will be adding this to my collection. I watched this movie twice within a week. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I was expecting this movie to be a disappointing one, but I was so wrong. Yes, it's melancholy & depressing, but it teaches you about life. It teaches you about the importance of family & communication. I found this movie to be very touching. Robert Pattinson's acting was impressive. The ending was heartbreaking for me. I will probably watch it again. If you can relate to this movie, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, you won't...simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Remember This Movie","review":"Some decent acting, but I found myself not involved witht the characters.

Robert Patterson really outdid himself as well as the girl that played his sister. The success of this picture was not only the acting but the outstanding writing. The story had a natural flow to it and it really does drive home the importance of making the most of today. I won't spoil the plot but just know that this movie is not a wasted 3.99 it's one of the best movies of the year and I really wish I had seen it in theatres. RP's superb acting confirms that the Twilight Series Kristen Stewart is at fault for making the film sometimes cheesy with her spastic gestures and loackluster acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was given a free movie download from Amazon when I bought a couple of CD's from them. I saw this one on the first screen when I logged in, so thought, why not see what it's about. I like RP and the Twilight series.This movie got my attention from the start. I understood the message it was trying to convey early on, but never expected the kind of ending it had. It breaks your heart, not only from a movie standpoint, but from real emotions we all felt on that tragic day. It makes you fully realize that you are really in charge of your own life, the way you live, your accomplishments and failures, the way you treat those you love while you are here. It really taps into your soul and makes you think.I loved the actors in this movie, I thought they all were wonderful. I will see this again and recommend it to friends and family to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film touched me in more ways than one","review":"I'm glad I didn't read the critical reviews before I saw this film or else it would've spoiled the end for me. While the preview plot is nothing surprising (boy makes a bet to make a girl fall for him, trying to outsmart overzealous cop), the relationship between Robert Pattinson's character and his little sister was what I found fascinating. I liked the dynamics between those two and the struggled love between the two siblings and their father, Pierce Brosnan's character. While I was certainly surprised by the turn of events and my heart cracked a little after a slumber party incident, I cheered about the fire extinguisher spot. As far as the end, I didn't see that one coming. This movie was nothing like I expected it to be, and I enjoyed it for that reason. While Robert Pattinson has the same sex appeal in this movie as he does in the \\"Twilight\\" series, my eyes kept resting on Pierce. I'd seen him in other films, but in this one, he was extremely handsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly AWESOME, You will never forget this movie!!","review":"I already LOVED Robert Pattinson and his portrayal of Tyler a young socialite who does not quite fit in is COMPLETELY REMARKABLE. As he teams up with Emilie De Raven there romance is truely believeable and their conflicts true to life.

They all will definately get higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I knew nothing about the movie, only what I had seen on the trailer. I am so glad I didn't!

This movie stayed with me for a long, long time. Great performance by Rob!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Is Intense","review":"All I can really say is \\"UGHHHHH.\\" I didn't like Rob Pattinson in Twilight, but he did great in this, as well as everyone else (I really liked his little sister's character).

This was not the case in the previews just the movie it;s self"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember Me *SPOILERS*","review":"Although the acting was fairly good by all in this film, I found the ending extremely inappropriate. It was not the fact that tragedy struck the characters involved, but it was the manner in which it struck. To have two young lovers cope with loss and confusion through a series of dates, fights, sex scenes and make-ups, to have the family reach some levels of reconciliation and renewed trust, only to have it end with Pattinson dying in the Twin Towers on 9/11 seemed too melodramatic, and unnecessarily so. Much like Titanic and Pearl Harbor (again, decent acting--not criticizing the actors), the film takes a horrifying, devastating tragedy in which thousands actually died and uses it to further a love story/drama. I can't get past that. I'm sure for many it made the film memorable and/or deepened the emotional value of the story, but to me, I think it's taking advantage of a real-life tragedy in order to make entertainment. Again, in my opinion, inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of film reel","review":"I found this movie to be quite dull and boring. I loved the two lead actors and they had great chemistry. Other than that, the storyline lacked a solid direction. The plot was weak and it was just a bunch of good acting in a storyless movie. I don't get what the \\"point\\" of it all was. Leaves the viewer asking \\"why?\\" and \\"what for?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything's forgettable but the ending","review":"Watching Remember Me is a strange and frustrating experience.For most of the time, it's a generic romantic movie about a brooding and troubled guy (Robert Pattinson) falling in love with a cute blonde (Emile de Ravin) and how that love helps lift him out of his funk to become the man we always knew he could be. It's crap, but it's well crafted crap.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 4 stars for me","review":"Couldn't get past 25 minutes of the movie, I didn't like it, it was not interesting (although the story line to me was intriguing).

I don't recommend at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acting was excellent.....the plot :?","review":"I'm not a tween or a fan of Robert pattinson; although I do enjoy Pierce Bronson acting. The movie had excellent acting from all involved. I was quite surprise considering I wasn't expecting much. RP is good with angst and I suspect most of his movies will be similiar going foward. I rated the movie two stars because of the plot, it was so poorly put together; it really didn't make much sense. I also think it was a poorly used ending of 9/11 event; considering the theme of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Plot","review":"This movie starts out pretty well, but fails to deliver anything. There is essentially no plot. It's basically a character study. You find yourself wondering what is going on through most of it because it jumps around all over the place and there seemed to be things that were cut out. Also, the things the characters do don't really make sense and just seemed contrived for drama. It's a character study with a very thin plot and a romance that lacks passion. Even the break up and the reconciliation is not passionate at all and you're left wondering why the characters did what they did. The acting is good, and I love Robert Pattinson, but it's just not a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"s*** happens in life","review":"Unlike other reviewers that reacted negatively to the ending, as exploiting a tragic traumatic event, I thought it was used in good taste. The story is essentially about people just trying to live their lives as best they can, like we all do, unsuspecting, like a lot us are, and not realizing or expecting how cruel life can be sometimes. For most of us, the history-changing event happened on a day that started out like any other day, but it happened for real in real life and may happen again we never can be sure. One point that can be made of the movie is that, rich or poor, no one really is above it all - s*** can happen in life to anyone of us unexpectedly so appreciate what we have while we have it for they can be gone just like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I loved this movie and have suggested it and Amazon unbox to many people.

She said she liked it, but I did not hear anything that would sell me on the movie. So I watched it...no, I tried to watch it and about 30 minutes into it, I had no idea what I was watching, so I gave up.

The story draws you in and the ending is just breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great Little Movie\\"","review":"Its not often I give four stars to a movie these days, but this is a clear exception. Whether you are male or female, it makes no difference on this one. Its what I call a \\"sleeper\\". I don't recall any big promotional pushes or any academy award nominations for this, but here it is.....one of the best films I have seen in recent years.What you have here is a great story, with great actors, and great directing. When you get this combination of ingredients, it becomes film magic. This one is at the Harry Houdini, or David Copperfield level.Multiple, believable characters, each with their own story line combine to produce a fascinating movie that holds your interest and keeps you guessing where it is going to wind up. The ending is an emotional \\"high impact\\", take your breath away, winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!","review":"A friend of mine insisted that we watch this movie (because of the Twilight guy) and I was very skeptical.

It was boring and pointless. the acting seemed really good but the storyline and writing was terrible. Not to mention, the love story was boring and forgettable. and the charactors seemed annoying. and yes, you got that they were complex charactors. you understood that they had been through alot and all of their triumphs connected them. but their was absolutely no chemistry between the actors, either. and if I wanted to watch something even resembling this. I would watch reruns of the oc. Afterall, atleast the two leading actors there had chemistry and the writing was top knotch. I only made it through half of it. it was too boring and pointless.

While it certainly doesn't having an upbeat tempo, he does a terrific job portraying such a brooding, damaged 21 year old student. The cast is amazing, especially the actress playing his younger sister, bringing a poignancy to a character in a difficult family situation.The ending, though, punched me in the gut. No big spoilers here but if your are sensitive to the coverage of 9/11, you might want to skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"It was ok.

She so nicely inserts knowledge and information of the time period as she continues to engage the reader with an exciting, fast-paced plot line and lovable characters. I felt like I was learning stuff while I read for fun.What I really enjoyed was her vast knowledge of the religion practices of that time. It comes out a lot in this book, but she doesn't make it boring. On the contrary, Jinks manages to make the history pretty interesting and surprisingly relatable, to a point that I felt like I could understand the religious figures of that time.Most importantly, though, I loved Pagan's character. As always, Pagan's voice is strong, realistic, and wonderfully sarcastic. If you liked the first two books of the series, you'll enjoy this one as well, especially the growing relationship between Pagan and Roland. Even if you haven't read the others, it's still good to read on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I bought this DVD because a friend let me borrow it.

I hope to see more come this DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but listen to the disc 2 as well","review":"Nicely summarizes Jarre's earlier works, as well as giving us some original tracks as well. It's a pity, though, that they didn't make this and Disc 2 into a single double-CD set. I also like nice little touches such as clips from the publie Chinese radio broadcast on Jarre's show. I would love to own a video of this historic event in pre-capitalist China."},{"rating":"1","title":"A title for your review","review":"Previously available as a double-CD package, and now as a single CD (but not here), this two-volume set of Jean Michel Jarre's live concerts in China is interesting from a historical point of view, but musically less so. All credit to Jarre for reproducing his music live, but the end result is thinner, less lush, and, with booming 80s drums, much more dated than the albums from which the tunes originate. The handful of original tunes are effective ('Arpeggiator' is particularly good), but it's a shame that they were never released in studio form. Essentially, Jarre's decision to include a light show *and* live music was brave, but let down by contemporary technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs from a great young band","review":"This is definetly a band to watch, this record shows limitless promise and really steps outside the normal indie rock bounds to create something different, think R.E.M. meets the Foo Fighters, complimented by beautiful bass lines of almost unimaginable subtlity and grace, definetly worth my 10 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have not received moovee.","review":"Hummmmmm....a review for a video I have not received.

These boys in Concrete Circus are an inspiration - not necessarily to go out and leap from roof to roof, or flip boards - but to start taking risks in life, try something new everyday, to do creative thinking exercises, think positively, and above all have FUN! Concrete Circus is one of the must see films.

But Left Hand Black is potentially one of the greatest songs of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great.","review":"This is one of the better Danzig releases.

When you order sweet almond oil, you assume it will smell like almonds but this smells like cooking oil. Lo and behold, on the bottle it says it has been put through a deodorizing process. How stupid! Who would deodorize something that smells so good, then not tell their customers, um, by the way, this has no smell in case you were expecting, um, a sweet almond oil to have an almond smell!Waste of $$$ but not worth returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun","review":"I saw these guys perform many times in a small bar when I was going to school in Springfield MO- Every time was memorable.

Poor Leon, Lord Savage, comes to Enland and everyone thinks he must be a savage for real as he has lived his life on some Pacific island. That is just period ignorance and I could accept it. I was glad that Leon was actually as well mannered as the next man but did it really need so many chapters for Ariel, the woman hired to \\"tame\\" him, to be acknowledged? That was exceedingly boring. Also, the romance between them just did not happen. I am also finding it more than irksome that so many romance writers insist that the female heroine, who loves our hero, won't marry him because she loves him but is not sure if he loves her. Oh, but she will certainly marry someone else who she can't stand??? That is just stupid. Any girl in her right mind would marry the man she loved - since Leon does ask - and make her life with him.

And when I say \\"sharp\\" I mean that it cuts your fingers just by looking at it. So, when you read the instruction pamphlet and come to the part where it says \\"Watch your fingers\\", take it serious. Now that we have that out of the way, I can honestly say that it is a great gadget to have. I cut pretty much any vegetable with it and ALWAYS use the safe guard, after a few painful encounters.It comes with 3 different parts which can make your veggies from shredded to super fine shredded or you just use the slicer which you can also adjust from big to paperthin slices. Because of the super-sharp blades it cuts even cabbage like butter. It's easy to clean and doesn't need much space on your kitchen counter.The only down thing is that it's not really useful to cut small amounts such as garlic or pieces of ginger. For that you have to use the good old kitchen knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is my second slicer, the first died after 2 decades of loyal service.

I'm certainly not experiencing that. The \\"super sharp\\" blade is apparently extremely dull as it takes a large amount of force to cut anything I've tried, onions, potatoes, apples on any thickness setting. perhaps I've gotten a defective unit, but this is way more dangerous than if it were extremely sharp, and less useful than a knife. And the finger guard doesn't hold anything either. Really, a terrible experience overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rendezvous","review":"Rendezvous~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a very nice album from Jarre. The laser harp tracks are truly amazing and set the tone. Some of the sounds used on tracks like the fourth rendezvous sound very dated and as if he was using toy keyboards instead of the expensive keyboards listed on the album. It has definite vibes of the space music that he created on Equionoxe and some of the sounds harken back all the way back to Oxygene. Still I feel that it is not nearly as even or creative as his prior releases and one wonders aloud if he has become a bit lazy and creates just enough to sell albums instead of the masterworks of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drift with the clouds","review":"Like most of his albums, great for drifting off, eyes closed, to some place with just you and your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb album","review":"I'm certainly surprised by the some of the negative remarks I've read on here regarding Rendezvouz.Commerically speaking, it is one of Jarre's most commercially successful albums ever, spending more time in the album charts than either Oxygene or Equinoxe.Rendezvous is Jean-Michel Jarre at his best with the Fairlight synths. Tracks 1, 2 and 3 are just heavenly, light synths over a melodramatic and orchestral booming background which reaches a crashing crescendo. It really is heady stuff.And then just when you think you can't take anymore, you get some light relief with the cranky part 3 'Laser Harp' followed up by the very popular part 4 (commonly known as Rendezvous Houston).Part 5 is a break from the mould of the album as is part 6, a moving tribute to Astronaut Ron McNair who lost his life aboard Challenger.To me, Rendezvous is well up there as being one of Jarre's best ever albums as it seemed to fit in so well with the mid 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Zoolook but...","review":"As you might think, I am not a die hard fan of JMJ, I think that when only die hard fans rates an album, it makes you think that with such a high rating, everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth.Not everybody like this king of musical experimentation, some do but some don't...I like Oxygene and Equinoxe, and even after all those years, they are still good to listen too.

It's also, with the possible exception of \\"Oxegene\\", his least \\"fun\\". \\"First\\" and \\"Last\\" Rendezvous are haunting , but \\"Second\\" and \\"Fifth\\", while initially stirring and robust, go on too long with precious little variation and left me little in terms of imagery and/or emotion.

It shows up eventually in depression, rebellion, etc. This book will stop many parents in their tracks and help them to slow down and really connect with their children.

I always go back to this cookbook when I'm thinking of modifying or combining other recipes, because Fannie is packed with basic tips and procedures for making sauces, roasting, baking, proofing dough, and so on. This book will tell you the best way to bake a potato, roast chestnuts, and roll out pie-crust. It offers lots of variations, substitutions, and so on for 1000's of recipes that constitute the basics of today's American cooking (including the influence of world cuisines).

Don't get me wrong, the textual content is very good. Other reviewers have so stated. My gripe is with the production values. It's a two-color book. No photos, only so-so technical illustrations, and these aren't even distributed throughout the book effectively. They're all bunched up toward the front-end of the book in a nearly tabular format. The paper stock is on the cheapy side, too. This is all a sure sign of a publisher cutting corners to maximize profits. If other cookbook publishers can go glossy 4-color with photos and a spiral binding, I don't see why these folks can't.

Oxygene and Equinox are much more consistent. Magnetic Fields has some nice tracks but the keyboard sounds are terrible compared to the first two albums. I know that this was one of the first albums to use digital keyboards and for the most part it sounds like using protoype keyboards and that is not a good thing. Jarre is here steering a bit too much in the realm of art for arts sake and it does sound a bit too avantgarde at times, but still nowhere close to the zoolook disaster that he releases some years later. On the whole a pretty decent album that lacks consistency and could have been so much better but it is alright and gets 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal clear synthesizer memories","review":"I had the 33rpm vinyl album of Magnetic Fields as soon as it came out, and played it often enough to wear out the grooves. The quality of the CD is top notch, and definitely holds up to the sound I remember from 1981 (I guess when you're talking about actual digital music, the whole \\"vinyl vs CD\\" is kind of a moot point.As far as the music itself is concerned: this may be the most accessible album Jarre has ever made (aside from Chronology). If you're starting a Jarre collection, start with this one, then ease into his more experimental work.For what it's worth... recommended tags include \\"New age\\" - Jarre has never been \\"new age\\". Electronic, yes. Synthpop, yes. New age... no."},{"rating":"2","title":"So what's wrong with that darn rhumba?","review":"Looks like most listeners believe that electronica musicians should always look dark and serious, looking like they are immersed in deep meditation about the mysteries of the universe (Vangelis?). So this French guy closes the album with a funny sort-of-latino joke, and suddenly the album is rubbish. Well, it's not to me. I've seen Jarre live and he looks like a guy who's having fun, so it doesn't surprise me when he plays this type of thing. In fact, Les Chants... is a very good album, in the same league as Oxygene (where by the way there are \\"silly latin percussion\\" moments too, although a little less obvious)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ve-e-e-ery Interesting... But Interesting!","review":"I first heard this offering in the middle 1980's and fell in love with it. I almost purchased the vinyl version, but was a bit \\"low in the hold\\" for cash. I finally was able to purchase this from Amazon, and I still love it.The music itself is fascinating and you can best enjoy it by letting your imagination flow with it. The sound effects during the gaps between the numbers are, to me, a bit reminiscent of riding the old wooden \\"El\\" trains in Brooklyn as a boy, hearing the different noises as the cars went over switches and sharp curves. He then puts in a cut of a modern subway in action. All the music is very well done, even though Jarre throws us a fast-breaking curve ball on the last track. Still, it's a very well done piece with a very nice Latin rhythm.All in all, this is an album to be enjoyed, and if you're into \\"New Age,\\" then this is for you. It's a very well done offering and is, indeed, worthy of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"Of the eight JMJ albums I have, this is my least favorite. The melodies are not that compelling and the sound textures are a bit odd (the digital sound effects don't seem all that interesting). I bought this after listening to Les Concerts En Chine (The Concerts in China), in which JMJ performs all of these pieces live. I much prefer the live performances, which are not dramatically different but seem to have more punch than the studio versions.Oxygene is still his best, with Oxygene 7-13 an admirable follow-up. Chronologie, Equinoxe and Rendez-Vous are consistently rewarding, and I also like some of the tracks on the 2000 disc, Metamorphoses, a somewhat radical change of pace. But this disc just doesn't ring my chimes.Trivial pursuit: I'm curious as to why Les Chants Magnetiques is translated as Magnetic Fields. Chants is songs or tunes; champs is fields. Both words are pronounced exactly the same, but it's hard to imagine that JMJ would get confused, as French is his native language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant tracks that you can't hear here","review":"A true classic for synth lovers, not to be missed. The CD would be worth the cost of admission if it only contained the first several minutes of the first track. It overlays a somewhat dour and subtle line with a high energy set of lines that in combination is just brilliant. Sounds like something you might expect to hear in an out-of-body experience. The problem is that you can't hear the sample here. The sample for track 1 comes later in the track. So, just get it - and if the last track really ruins the experience for you, just re-burn the CD and leave it out, or leave it off your MP3 playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Society","review":"The book is quite comprehensive to be so small. I was expecting a big wordy book with a lot of adjectives but it turned out to be compact with about the right amount of detail to get the point across. Great reading for anyone that lived through the initial phases of the Great Society, especially in the southern states. It shows you how destructive social engineering is and how bad things can get when you grant priviledge and status to an underclass."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his weaker releases","review":"I am reviewing the entire album of this name....This disc seems very patched together; not a cohesive piece or album like Zoolook, Rendevous, or Chronologie.

Midget actor Angelo Rossitto(a favorite in many John Barrymore classics) follows Lugosi around. To appreciate the \\"Great One\\", see 1932's \\"White Zombie(excellent DVD) or \\"The Black Cat\\".

Katzman, of course, was a master at rehashing the same old story again and again, and this one is no exception. The real villain in this film is the tired, stale plot which, like many others, injects a brassy, annoying newspaper reporter into the story, along with a dim-witted photographer; as always, the reporter eventually solves the mystery. Lugosi does his best with the script, which would have been better had it been approached with a bit of originality. Of course, if it had involved a fresh approach, it wouldn't have been a Sam Katzman film. Still, it is a mildly entertaining film at times, and should be enjoyed as such.

The bits rattle around a bit when the case is jostled, but they don't escape the slots. Time will tell how well the bits stand up to use. They do come oiled, and at leaset in my case, some of it transfered to the inside of the case. NB, a label on the back of the case says the case is made in the USA and the bits are made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"It was hard for me to get through the fawning and the pomposity. The Beatles were not T. S. Eliot. They were brilliant songwriters and musicians and they meant a lot to their generation, self-included, but they were (at their best, anyway) very unselfconscious about it.I suspect they would have laughed at someone like Riley going on about their meaning and motivation without actually asking them. And, by the way, the number of mistakes in the first edition was incredible. For someone who posed as an authority, getting the title of 'How Do You Do It?' wrong, getting so many lyrics and simple facts (like who played what) wrong, etc. - it's just hard to understand.If you really want to learn about the music, read Walter Everett's books instead. They're much more informative. And if you want to learn about what they were really like as personalities in the studio, read Geoff Emerick's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"I was expecting something serious, I mean, a result from a serious RESEARCH. Well, this book is nothing more than a bunch of simplistic THOUGHTS and FEELINGS from the writer about some of Beatles's songs. This guy shold get a job, really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A first-rate book: buy it!!!!","review":"I loved this book. Riley's a musicologist, and his comments on the songs you've always loved are insightful. Think you know a lot about, say, \\"If I Fell\\" or \\"We Can Work It Out\\" or \\"She Loves You\\"? Think again: it's amazing to hear these and other songs again after you've read what Riley has to say. But this is anything but a technical analysis. Riley writes beautifully; this is a book for a fan, and not only the specialist. I've started a new habit when being invited to someone's house for dinner: I no longer bring the wine, I bring Tell Me Why. Funny thing: I only got the most cursory thanks for the wine, but I get genuine words of appreciation for introducing my friends to Tell Me Why. You'll love it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research.","review":"This is a poorly researched book. Here's an example - the author seems to be under the impression that George Harrison played the (excellent) guitar solos on 'Taxman' and 'Good Morning Good Morning', unfortunately in both cases it was Paul. This is such a well known fact I can't believe he got it wrong.If you want a book like this going through all the songs then pick up Ian McDonald's superb 'Revolution In The Head'."},{"rating":"1","title":"How serious can you get?","review":"Remember that famous review of \\"Not a Second Time\\" which mentioned \\"aeolian cadencies\\" and the like? Now imagine ALL Beatles songs analyzed in that sort of language! And each and every lyric - even the simple ones from their early years - scrutinized word by word? How much can you read into a lyric like \\"She Loves You\\"? I think not even the Beatles themselves took their music that seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible, let me Tell You Why","review":"This book looks so deeply at the songs The Beatles wrote that it actually takes away from the magic of the music. The author grants such genius for the way someone claps on a backing track or offers a dull explanation of the teenage longing felt in the lyrics of some of their earlier songs. If The Beatles themselves had given this much thought to the music they were making then the magic would have surely been lost during the recording process. Even John Lennon thought the critical press overanalyzed their music on many occassions. He would probably turn over in his grave laughing at the amount of thought Tim Riley put into his song descriptions. Make no mistake, I am a huge Beatles fan and wanted to like this book. But I could not get through the boring overanalysis of each track by the author. He did something that I thought was impossible. Take the fun out of The Beatles music."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of terrible","review":"I bought two of these and both sets were bent. The packaging was flawless, so I can only assume they were made like this. There's three pieces per rod, the outter rods with the cheap plastic ball on the end, and an inner rod that gives support and allows extension. All three pieces were SERIOUSLY bent in both sets that I bought. I honestly don't understand how they got them in the box; they must have had to straighten them just enough to fit them in the shipping box.This is my first time haning curtains and it looks horrible.

(3) They left Omastar out, with the picture box saying (CAMERA SHY). But that is about it!

I liked the reviews of this title and got it. What a pleasant surprise! All the characters are likable, the story moves fast and while there is more action, then sex, the plot moves and the tension is there. My only quibble (?) is that the ending did seem a little rushed. I am now going to track down the other titles under this name. Try this one, you'll like it--trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real keeper","review":"I don't normally read pirate books. I really hate those long, monotonous voyages where nothing happens and you get the same old stuff, so it was with great reservations that I bought this one. Okay, it was out of desperation I bought this book. I couldn't find anything else to read, so I thought I'd try it for a bit. That bit turned into all day! I could not put this sucker down. I've been reading romance for years and I seriously can't remember the last time I read a book with such vigor. It made me laugh until my sides ached and the hero is absolutely divine. All I can say is wow!! Ms. MacGregor has a new fan who prays she has a long, fruitful career because I need some more good books to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real keeper","review":"One of the best pirate books I've read in a really long time.

For a first time author, Kinley MacGregor has truly hit the mark. This is an author destined for true greatness! I just cannot believe how incredible this book is from an unknown. She must have started out writing when she was in the cradle. Whenever her next book comes out, you better believe I'm going to be the first in line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one!","review":"Terrible! Silly dialogue and an unbelievable story. The large typeface used in the printing makes you feel you are reading a grade school level book and the unrealistic plot furthers this feeling. I love historical romance novels - but definitely not this one! Better to spend your money on something by Lisa Kleypas, Julie Garwood or Julia Quinn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insane","review":"This book drove me absolutely insane. I only finished the book because I loved the hero Morgan Drake. Serenity made me want to rip this book apart, only it wasn't my book to destroy. The woman was infuriating, look I totally enjoy reading books where the women are independent but this was beyond sanity. Also as previous reviewers stated the ending was so RUSHED it didn't make any sense what-so-ever. The book I recommend is Master of Seduction Jakes story aka Jacob Dudley. Know that was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"what else can I say.... silly waste of money. I purchased due to the rating it recieved and since the author has written entertaining stories in the past however I was fooled. I can not even get through the book. Save your money! Amazon also needs to do a better job of verifing someone has actually purchased a book before they are permitted to review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Ending","review":"I mean we aren't reading fantastic literature here but it was like she thought \\"Oh, 100 pages, I can only have 101, I better shove 3 years into 2 pages\\" It was really wierd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pirate of Her Own","review":"Tooooo Sweet for meI thought this was going to be a spicy romp. No way. I read the reviews of others and went on the hunt at my favorite used book stores for this book. This at no time was close to Dara Joy or Christine Feehan. Give me a break. When I read a romance I want sexual tension, this at no time has tension, you knew Serenity was going to remain a virgin for too long, Morgan was to polite to be a pirate. I want my hero to be dark and demanding he was a wuss. I will look at the reviews closer the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author is HOT!","review":"If you like steamy sex scenes to steal your breath and a hero to die for, you have to try this book. WOW. It's a great book from start to finish. I can't say enough good things about this author or her book. This is without a doubt the best book I have ever picked up. I just ordered a copy for my mother and sister. MORE MORE MORE--I WANT MORE!!!! Someone, please tell me there's more to come from Kinley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful romance !","review":"You won't be able to put this book down ! Like other readers, this is the first Kinley MacGregor book I'd read and it certainly won't be the last. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in this story and can only hope that Ms. MacGregor will expand upon each of them. There are so many wonderful tales begun in this book, with so many memorable characters, I'd love to read a book for each of them.The story of Morgan and Serenity is a dynamic one and was enjoyable, humorous, heart warming and captivating. But, I'm hopeful that someday we can also read the tales for Kristen and her husband, George, as well as Serenity's sister, Charity.This is definitely not a book to be missed !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Gift","review":"This is a sweet gift to give to parents that just had a little girl.

I would recommend this any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ground-breaking...for the time","review":"One of the pioneering releases which introduced samplers to a wider public. I was only about 16 at the time and I remember at first hating and then growing to love this album. Interestingly it is the non-sampled elements of this music which sound the most dated today while many of the sampled sounds still sound quite fresh.One thing I've noticed is that many children LOVE \\"Blah Blah Cafe\\" (2nd to last track). Put it on the stereo at a birthday party full of 5-year olds and watch them go wild!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of Jarre's best releases....","review":"Jean Michel Jarre transports the listener to a new place in the realm of this \\"new age\\" genre. The effects and transmutations of various samplings is quite remarkable.

You can build a cheap collection if you buy used. Just make sure to test the CD right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I am not ready for this ?","review":"Too much experiments and not enough melodies. I prefer his previous works like Oxyg��ne and Equinoxe, but I really don't like this one.Call it sounds experimentation but not music. A average of 4,5 stars rating should means an almost perfect album, we are really far from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoolook","review":"Zoolook~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene, Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. I find it a bit too much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. Very disapointing indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woolloomooloo? Yes!","review":"I think this is Jarre's most interesting and ambitious album to date. Some of his albums didn't stand the test of time, but this one still sounds fresh and intriguiung. The basic idea of \\"Zoolook\\" is the combination of vocal samples from over 60 different languages with Jarre's typical synth background. This doesn't always work well, because sometimes it sounds too childish and predictable. But for the most part this album is an adventurous affair, and the keyboard sound is more powerful and direct than on Jarre's other records.. Standout tracks are the highly danceable \\"Zoolookologie\\", \\"Diva\\" with some vocals from American cult singer Laurie Anderson, and the over-the-clouds track \\"Ethnicolor II\\". Even if this album is untypical for Jarre's output, it's really worth buying and will ultimately prove more satisfying than many of his other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful bag","review":"I bought this tote bag for my daughter because she is a very big andy warhol fan.

My first concert was one of his, and anyone else's work was, well, just not worth listening to. Equinoxe was then, and remains, his best work.So why only two stars? Well, in retrospect, I can now see that I fawned over my JMJ tapes not because they were good, but because I didn't know any better. The reality is that anyone with a decent synth and editor could cobble this kind of stuff together in their back bedroom. You can't even say it was ahead of its time, as plenty of other artists were using the technology.The best track is probably #5, which opens with the crack of thunder and downpour of rain. It's a shame the rest of the album isn't more ambient or I might still have been listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"exeptional.","review":"this is one of the recordings that pushed me down the inevetable slipery slope of electronic music making...about 15 years, and a few synths later, I came to brose this site and read the reviews.

Together with Zoolook this is my favorite jarre works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Ride","review":"\\"Equinoxe\\" is the essential Jarre record, combining vintage analog synth sounds with atmospheric samples and effects. It deals with more varied themes than \\"Oxygene\\", and in my opinion has a more textured feel. The most interesting thing is that some of the more subtle themes and melodies in \\"Equinoxe\\" reappear more prominently in \\"Oxygene 7-13\\"--you have to listen quite carefully to discover this strange fact. Overall, the record is probbly not for new Jarre listeners; but for those who are already familiar with his aural vocabulary, \\"Equinoxe\\" is one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Electronic Music CD of all Time!","review":"Equinoxe, by Jean Michel Jarre, in my opinion is the greatest electronic music CD of all time. Jarre's masterpiece flows from the opening track Equinoxe 1 to the finale Equinoxe 8. It was created in the days before CD's so there is the break for both sides of the original vinyl and cassette recording. Otherwise I am sure Mr. Jarre would have made this one seamless piece of extra-ordinary creative music.And yet the break enables one to get one's breath as Equinoxe 5 begins an everflowing journey of sound and sonics. Once into the music, you cannot escape the voyage to the inner recesses of your mind.I have heard thousands of electronic Cd's in my time, and some have maybe more melodic, more evocative tracks. but none, and I reiterate, none flows from start to finish like Equinoxe. In fact as host and producer of the Nightflight a 2 hour radio show devoted to this genre, Equinoxe, was named the first Nightflight Hall of Fame Award in 1997.Good Listening"},{"rating":"2","title":"ISO: REALITY BREAK?","review":"This is one of my all time favorites,even though I'm all jazz now...I got my first recording of Equinoxe in '79/colllege, [from my Turkish boyfriend ooh la la,] and was sooo impressed...and still am.

The book is really a personal essay, a journal-like memoir, as much (or more) about the author as about a gay marriage. As a straight person, I found it eye-opening to hear about the many situations in which Ms. Wescott and her partner, Kathleen, felt they had to hide their relationship. \\"Gayness\\" is a theme of the book in that sense - how it has felt in the life of the author. But I think one reason the story of this marriage comes across as complex and real is that gayness is one element of the story, but it isn't the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesomely bad","review":"This has gotta be one of the most awesomely bad albums ever. all this guy does is fake cough & clear his throat.

If you have the fancier stainless steel grates I don't know what you're meant to do - take a saw and cut one of your grates to size I imagine.In use it works well. But you have to soak the wood chips for a few hours, and then light the BBQ well before you start cooking since it can take 15-20 mins for the woodchips to start burning. Once they start they will burn until they burn up - and yes, they truly do change the taste of the food.

It's only drawback is that some of it is \\"dated\\" information, i.e. the National Catholic Welfare Conference has been replaced by the USCCB, etc. But these are miniscule issues. If you want to learn the Catholic Faith accurately yourself, or teach it unadulterated to your children, MY CATHOLIC FAITH is the book to use. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Trove","review":"Catechism's seem to overwhelm most people don't they? Very rarely do they invite the reader to indulge in it from cover to cover--more often times, you pick up a Catechism and thumb through--seeking a specific reference. However, this one is \\"comfortable\\". Not simplistic by any measure, but friendly and beautiful! I would definately add this to my collection. If there's a non-Catholic in your life asking for scriptural references to our beliefs...this is a treasure trove of insight for them. It will definately leave them scratching their heads. The artwork is an added touch of inspiration too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only thing better than seeing these Plays is reading them","review":"Plays of the Holocaust: An international Anthology, edited by Elinor Fuchs is a book which is one that has been found not only provocative, but also inciteful. It contains the stories of Eli, a Mystery play of the Suffering of Isreal. This story was one of the best, written by Nelly Sashs. Also other stories include, Mister Fugue or Earth Sick, Aushwitz, Replika, Ghetto, and Cathedral of Ice. A book well worth reading, and something that will keep you up at night as well. Prepare to be not only horrified and disgusted, but also entertained by this wonderful piece of literature.

I am disappointed because I had hoped to learn more than the book delivered. I found more information by Googling each organization than what I found in this book. The author appears to have just bundled up generic known information and published it in a book with a few cheesy interviews from a few known members.

Though only general information was detailed, it was inciteful enough for any aspirant to begin to narrow down their own prefrence. At Howard, the official history books of these organizations are avaliable, but this book is compact and thoughtful enough for any researcher to begin their quest.

When I read the book, about 2 years ago, I didn't imagine this world as it is displayed in the movie, and it's something I really like, they left something in suspense...It has everything to be a relaxed, funny and exciting movie: from innocent games at their house until incredibly realistic fights with stange creatures and conversations with beavers. The special effects they used now are incredible and putting it all together, becomes an excellent movie with very high quality.The actors who starr the movie, even though they're really young, act really good and when you watch the movie sometimes you feel like you're in the screen, being someone important in the movie.I think this movie reached the objective: 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"expanded preference","review":"This expanded version, worked better for me than the theatrical version--itself very good.

The film is practically a blueprint of the book, with minor changes, but nothing too altering. The idea of finding a magical land, and being a child again, and good beating out evil...it's all there.I would like to mention though that the widspread problem of the missing booklet was QUITE a hassle....If anyone else had this problem, call the Disney phone number that's listed in the link to the photo of the booklet in product details, or else you'll have the problem I did: A Christmas present missing a piece, many emails back and forth to Amazon customer service, a replacement DVD sent STILL missing the booklet, returns, and eventually finding out I could get the booklet sent to me for free anyway.

This is a must see movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans of the books!","review":"Unfortunately in what I see as a short sighted money grab by Disney they have ruined perhaps the only remake we are likely to see for the next ten years, of this classic story. The original story has been secularised to remove the underlying Christian theme of the book, which has resulted in a poor version of an otherwise deeply rich classic. Such a shame they didn't find someone like Peter Jackson to make this! Unfortunately this is the best out of the three Disney remakes, the others being progressively worse. Bright and Disneyfied, the impression becomes one of a made for tv movie, especially in the later movies. How sad:( the worst thing is it is unlikely to be remade for a very long time, and people think they know the story now through these films but really won't. As for those who say its very close to the book, maybe a reread will be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon failures","review":"Most dissapointed customer for receiving blank CDs.

I found this movie to be a serious disappointment. The plot was meandering and the characters were unappealing. The special effects were marginal and the movie was too long for small children and too juvenile for adults. Honestly, I heard the children sitting behind me ask their mother to leave before the film was over at least a dozen times. I also had problems with the philosophical message of the story. It basically endorses \\"the divine right of kings\\" and the existence of a ruling elite who hold their place by destiny, rather then achievement. I know it is just a film and that it is meant to be fun, but it felt like a propaganda piece to me.Admittedly, I did like some of the white queens dresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might please 5 year olds","review":"I never read the books, nor did I have any idea that the movie and/or books were supposed to be a christian allegory. Therefore I did not have any preconceived ideas or expectations and merely looked at it as a new and highly touted fantasy movie. I was bored to tears. This movie including the fantasy creatures and \\"battle\\" scenes are a bad rip-off of the excellent ring trilogy. The acting is horrible, wooden and emotionless. The kids seem to be reading their lines of cards while staring in the camera. Not one of them had any appealing quality. Background looks fake, especially watching on a large TV. And why are certain animals good and others bad??? Who came up with this crazy idea? Maybe 5-8 year old might like it if they can manage to stay awake during the first 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item sent","review":"Am trying to return this.

The movie would probably be best suited for older children, teens and adults due to the scary figures in places, the good vs. evil theme and the overall plot. Since the movie contained many allegories it could be called a story within a story which lends itself to much learning for kids and adults alike.

The kids don't even act amazed when they enter Narnia. They act like they see fauns and talking beavers every day. The beavers look like giant rats. You can easily tell what was CG and what was not. I have no idea why they got Andrew Adamson to make this movie. He made Shrek and Shrek 2. Why not get a qualified director. Narnia also seems to be an island where you can get everywhere in a day or two. The kids go all over Narnia in a day or two. And why does the professor look like the KFC guy?There are some good things in this movie though. Aslan looks great and Liam Neeson was the right voice. Parts of the battle also looked good but, this was a failure. This could have been great but it isn't.

I just had a few things to point out which made me give the movie four stars, but the mistakes are amusing none the less.First question was, In the scene after Santa told the children winter was almost over and they noticed the ice was melting over the river....why did they walk across it. They could have gone over the top of it on the rocks...LIKE THE WOLVES DID! but I guess they needed another climax, it was a good scene just funny that the wolves could figure it out and not the \\"king and queen\\"Secondly, why did the wolf jump onto the sword and kill himself. He was purty =(Last...and so far I am the only one who caught this, at the beginning of the movie Lucy gave Thomas her hanky. Then when Thomas was captured, the beaver gave it back to her. But amazingly at the end of the movie...Thomas had it and gave it to her....again.....I was amused by it but GREAT MOVIE.

It's slow, predictable, poorly written, with inauthentic characters. The children interact like robots and transmit no real excitement, curiousity, or surprise.

Unfortunately nothing happens there that is worth remembering. The acting isn't bad either. Just unfortunately I did not finding myself caring about any of the kids or anything that happened to them. And unlike many villains both literary and cinematic, I did not find myself dreading Jadis, the ice queen. Likewise, I could not find myself able to cheer for Aslan and his triumph over the white witch. I really wanted to. I just didn't care one way or another.I found the bonus material much more satisfying to watch than the movie itself. I understand a sequel to this movie currently in production.

I thought the Christian symolism is plain to see, especially for Christians. C.S. Lewis' classic collection is very well portrayed. Everyone I've talked to has said they liked it. Although it is not as epic as lord of the rings or star wars, it still moves me every time I watch it. The computer generated characters are by far the best I've seen, maybe because WETA did it. Can we say Lord of the Rings? Yea, well not only was the cinematography and storyline great, so was the music. Thank you Harry-Gregson Williams!!

The second disc has lots of nice documentaries and behind the scenes stuff. The third disc provides an excellent look at CS Lewis' life and how he created the entire Narnia saga. The fourth disc is the best as it takes the \\"audio commentary\\" a step further by showing the theatrical cut of the film alongside clips of the shooting of the film, effects work, wardrobe, comments and more. It's an amazing experience that enhances the movie wonderfully. Even if you have the 2-disc version, the fourth disc on this set makes it a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome movie!","review":"This is the best version of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" I have ever seen.

Spring, yes, Summer maybe, but Winter?!! -- dumb beyond belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set A Must Buy for Fans","review":"Excellent even more than the average DVD films success! with miles of bonus content and footage. Plus commentary and bonus features for children and the family to enjoy for all ages. If i was to give a chritsmas gift this would be one to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Picturesque Fairy Tale","review":"This has all the elements of a classic fairy tale: the entry into another world through the wall of a closet, a witch who was power to freeze everyone, monsters, animal-like warriors, and the like. The parallel between the death of Astlan the Lion for rescuing the people from the power of the witch, and of Jesus Christ for the rescue of His own from Satan, is obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Wonderful movie!! I really recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the series gives it a try. I'm 20 and still love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids or adults","review":"Watched with my family on movie night. It was enjoyed by the adults as well as the kids. The story led to some good discussion afterwards. Looking forward to the next movie in the series for our next movie night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles of Narnia","review":"This movie has gorgeous scenery and music,and the actors and actresses ewere very talented. The scenes and effects of World War II were detailed, and though the beavers did not look realistic,their simple animation seemed to fit their comical role. However, though the graphics for the White Witch's army were very advanced, this made the monsters look very graphic. Also, though the pace was fast, it seemed rather abrupt.Overall, this is a creative movie that would appeal to a wide variety of audiences, as it has both ''family scenes'' and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, a great movie","review":"This as a great book. The movie is so realistic, you'd think you were there! It was one of the best movies I saw this year. It was right up there with Harry Potter and Wallace and gromit. Even if you didn't see it in theaters, don't rent it, buy it! I guarentee you'll like it! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"This is probably one of the best fantasy movies Iv'e ever seen! However, the critics don't think so. This movie takes lots of crap from everyone that it doesn't deserve! However I must admit that there are some slight changes from the book that are slightly annoying, but it's nothing to fuss about. I would say that the best acting performance is probably the girl that plays Lucy, she is just like in the book, (Peter, Edmund, and Susan are changed a little bit), The White Which's acting is also very good. In all, I would say that anyone who read and liked the books would enjoy this film. I recommend it for ages six and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much grander and better","review":"I have read the book and thought it to be too childish and simple in telling, although with awesome message. It is like a story from the Bible, remodeled so that children can understand the values of love, bravery, kindness and hope. So, seeing what a big promotion this movie has, I decided to watch in theatre.I couldn't take my eyes from the screen! The views are so magnificent; the soundtrack beautiful; The actors and actresses played the four children are very good. No awkward moment. With WETA studio's magic, it is a priceless movie that musn't be missed by anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soylent Dick Says: Another Great Story Ruined by Disney","review":"Disney should never be allowed got their hands on these kinds of stories!Amongst a heap of other abuses: The dungeon scene (where Edmond meet Tumnus & we see the witch turn Tumnus into stone) doesn't exist in the book.None of the four kids can act for toffee.Too much time was spent on the journey to meet Aslan (creating absurd scenes which don't exist in the book)Tilda Swinton didn't look the part of the witch. She smiled too much. Apart from her hair being the wrong colour, the witch needs to be tall and thin. The main characteristics of her personality are cold authority and economy. Although she conveys hatred, she never speaks unless necessary.Apart from that, the final battle scene looked to me more like a stupid fight scene from a Lord of the Rings movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is everyone in this movie so darn ugly?","review":"I guess good looking Britain's don't become actors. This is just another movie that gets tons of \\"hype\\" put out about it and then it just becomes another kiddy fantasy with talking animals and hairy half-humans.Even the \\"white queen\\", the adult actor of this film is so butt ugly! Isn't she the same ugly wench that played the angel in \\"Constantine?\\" If they have gotten Elizabeth Hurley to play the role, that might have enhanced the appeal of this movie a tad.Disney seems to like to get British children for their films. It's really beginning to get old. Or maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm just getting tired of the same old predictable casting happenstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good","review":"I hate to say it, but this cinematic spin on C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is simply overrated. While the film version will entertain a younger audience and simultaneously teach positive values, isn't it better for the children to be reading the book anyway? From an execution standpoint the film was flimsy and transparent. The kids acted their hearts out, but sometimes heart doesn't make up for lack of refinery. The visual effects were stunning, yet typical. The filmmakers were obviously trying to ride in on the winds of the Lord of the Rings blockbuster, and were able to post good numbers at the box office by doing so, but the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will not perevere through time. All in all, you probably should see it if you need to keep up with the other soccer moms in gossip hour, or if your child won't behave until you do (and they've read the book!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring Fantasy film","review":"There are no spoilers here in this review except for the fact that I found this film extremly dissapointing. The story has many plot holes and is not engaging. The characters are generic and lack motivation. The visual effects were less than standard. Most of the animals (For the exception of the Lion)looked really fake and it was really easy to spot \\"green screen\\" shots. Most actors did a fine job with the huge exeption of the kids who never seem to realize what a big deal it was to be in a fantasy world or to fight a war. But the biggest problem was the story which was genric, boring and without a purpose. For people who are not fans of the book save yourselves the time and skip this one and wait until it airs on the Disney channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Why I Should NOT Buy New DVDs Too Early","review":"This 4-disc edition is the reason why I should NOT buy new DVDs too early. I really love this movie and I pre-ordered the 2-disc edition as soon as it became available. Boy, I was WRONG!!! I should NOT have done that. I hate the movie studios that do this kind of thing; releasing a 2-disc edition and a few months later releasing a 4-DISC EDITION! Bummer!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Packaging Screw Up","review":"I pre-ordered this set, and I like the way the bookends look and the DVD's are great. The only issue I have is that I did not recieve my 10-page booklet. I believe (and I went through the ENTIRE package) that it was not put in my set. I now have to go and buy the DVD's again in order to get the booklet and I am NOT happy. Everything else about the set is great I'm just upset that I didn't get my booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a good movie","review":"the lion the witch and the wardrobe;is a good movie for people who look for advinture, action and talking animals u should see this movie because if u don't then your missing all those thing's I siad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Version of TLTWATW","review":"This is an excellent version of \\"The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe\\". It is in wide screen format and includes additional scenes. The additional scenes in the battle were very well done, although the scene where Peter skewers a harpy in flight with a spear while riding at a full gallop stretches even this fantasy a bit - but it looked great!The additional features were also very good. I especially liked the biography of CS Lewis. All in all, this was a wonderful package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgust","review":"Since I seem to be deviating from the popular opinion of this forum- I'll stay to the point. The book is excellent. I'm still waiting for Disney to send me a refund for the 2+ hours of my life that I wasted on this transparent/uninspiring garbage that someone has called a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL this is a fantasy epic?","review":"I fell in love with the chronicals of narnia when I was a young child. This movie does the book no justice at all. The computer animations are horrible and nothing near as good as the creatures on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the rings. The actors are terrible and given a terrible script to learn. There is no warmth or love between the children making this movie very boring and annoying to watch. Aslan the lion is portrayed as a real wimp in this movie. The costumes especially the white witch's costume look horrible. I'd say as bad as something from a cheap community play. I do not suggest you waste your money on this atrocious movie unless you are such a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis series and your children don't know any better. Maybe little kids would love this. Who knows for sure. I didn't like this boring and dull movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"well, I dunno","review":"Well, I had read just one of these books. I can't really say that I hated it because then I'd be lying, but I definetely wouldn't call the media for such a great movie. But some of the actors are kinda hot ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"This is a lousy movie and does not follow the book. As an adaption and an individual movie, it doesn't capture the world of C. S. Lewis. The acting is terrible, (especially the casting of the white witch..... I thought she was supposed to be scary) and many of the shooting styles were stolen from lord of the rings. I can only hope that \\"Prince Caspian (coming out in a few years) will be an improvement. However if Andrew Adamson is still directing it probably will be just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Overrated","review":"What happened? They really screwed this up big time. I was bored to tears! And Santa? Why in the world would they put Santa in there? They tried WAY too hard. Go for \\"King Kong\\" as the winter film of 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"disppointing","review":"With Harry Potter as a scale, this movie doesn't come close and isn't worth the purchase. The only thing that makes the movie tolerable is the special effects, but the main boy character is weak, the usual villain is a boy, and the girls are innocent, strong, and smart while boys are portrayed weak, liars, and unsure. Not good role models for boys or girls.The performance of the Wicked Witch was great.The predictable Disney happy ending agaisnt monsterous odds has gotten old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Extended","review":"I am writing this review simply based on the \\"Extended\\" movie as I have not gotten to the extras. After all, people ultimately buy DVDs for the movie and not entirely for the extras.I am quite confused as to how this new edition differs from the original theatrical release. I saw a few extra scenes in the beginning of the children walking around, but there is nothing substantial added. The battle at the end is a bit longer, but the changes overall were so small that you really have to know the original very well to spot all the minor additions. I am not even sure if there was any new dialog.Perhaps the extras will redeem the set, but if you already own the movie (particularly the other special edition), I do not see a need to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie, but missing to much magic.","review":"I am a great fan of the Chronicles of Narnia. Basically this a good movie, the effects are great and so are the actors. But this movie has a serious flaw. Because the Narnian stories are not huge action stories, C.S Lewis relied on depth,feeling,and magic to make his stories the classics they became. Unfortunatley, the movie is robbed of much of the magic that made the story a classic. For example,the witch is turned from an evil and cunning sorceris into a cruel and unstopable warrior queen, Aslan is devoid of his power and authority and is little more than a imposing talking lion. And the movie is minus some of the most powerful scenes in the book. From the battle to the end of the movie was excellent, but the rest of the movie just didn't compare to the book or the audio cd. Final point- don't watch this until you read the book and listen to the dramatised cds by focus on the family. See you on my next review of the 2003 movie Hulk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive version is the Collectors expanded set","review":"Some subtle and not so subtle changes through out the film including a scene with Harpies in the final battle sequence that was either cut to get the pg rating or wasn't ready special fx wise depending who you believe. Who Cares that scene is so cool and this movie just moves me I really enjoy it over and over. Much has been made of it's christian origins and I don't know why this movie just works and instant classic christian or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia","review":"The only reason I bought this particular Narnia DVD was b/c I saw on tv that Disney was going to put it in the vault, so I had to get it before it disappeared and it was a good price for all the special features and everything. I like the box design, it's very cool. I love the movie. Special features are pretty cool if you're that much of a fan, if not, just get the simple DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"This was not a good movie. Why Andrew Adamson?There are so many better directors out there.This was a disaster. Watch this and then watchThe Lord of the Rings, King Kong, or Star WarsEpisode 3. All of which were better than this.I liked the books but this was not good. HopefullyPrince Caspian is better when it comes out in 2007.But Adamson is still directing. Well maybe they'llget The Dawn Treader right."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wackness","review":"Why watch Narnia when you can watch the Wizard Of Oz? They are basically the same movie, lost souls searching for themselves and a better world. The only difference is Wizard Of Oz is a timeless magical tale and there are flying monkies instead of Narnia's talking wolves. Narnia lumbers along with computer generated talking animals that look fake beyond belief. They talk like psycho adults bumbling around like fools on a mission. I'm sure it's great for children, this really is a children's film in the end. The enchantment is missing from this film. instead we get harsh winter scenes and a nasty war towards the end. I never finished the rest of the film, it had me dozing off so I shut it down before the war, I assume. If you want to see good fantasy films I would recommend The Wizard Of Oz, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy or even The Others. Narnia just didn't hit me over the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walt Disney Dropped The Ball on This One...","review":"Walt Disney did I wonderful job of the Pirates of the Carribean series when it was brought to Blu-Ray. They were released as a 2-Disc Special Edition with pretty worth-wild pakaging and features. However, with the The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe on Blu-Ray, it just didn't happen. Why would you shell out good money for something like this when the 4-Disc extended edition on DVD has so much more to offer. Granted you have the superior image and sound quality, but I would expect at least a 2-Disc edition with features of the 4-Disc DVD.It releases like this that make me question if the Blu-Ray version has anything to offer for the money. Shame on you Walt Disney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Acting, Boring Movie, Pretentious, Poor Adaptation","review":"My headline says it all. This movie has none of the mystery and darkness of the book. It's all pretentious American kids pretending they are British, acting in a Disney story which resembles C.S. Lewis' story only in the literal sense. It has no spirit. No soul.It's just a bland Disney movie where everything is too perfect. The acting is just awful!! This is a poor substitute for Harry Potter let alone Lord of the Rings.The earlier 1988 BBC made-for-TV version of this movie has the coldness and menace that this story deserves. This 2005 \\"film\\" on the other hand, is so sappy that I just wanted to barf. Even a 10-year old is too mature for this \\"simplified\\" Disney version of the classic story. Get the BBC version at any cost!! This movie needs a soul. The BBC version (with real British people, no less) is the one to get. Unfortunately, it is not released on DVD and is quite hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - another great escapist movie","review":"After the Star Wars prequels hurt me so bad for being aweful - I just wanted one more great escapist movie.

I am a fan of the books too - and I applaud the adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia","review":"After reading the Chronicles and reviewing movie, I can give this first part a thumbs up on a scale of 1 to 10, a 9 because of the \\"hankie\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids movie!!!","review":"My daughter is 4 years old and absolutely loved this movie!!

I mean, maybe it's cool if you're a little kid, but as an adult it's pretty hard to take a talking beaver seriously. Of course it's a fantasy film so you're supposed to put those things behind you, but when the CGI effects are this awful you can't keep from groaning every time some ridiculous looking animal starts speaking with a British accent. The film is also plagued by horrible acting all around - it's really just a terrible film in every way. Long, slow and boring with a bad Braveheart battlescene rip-off ending. If you want to see talking animals, take mushrooms and go to the zoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disney stuff","review":"This stuff was meant for children. Please do not watch this if you like the phantasy genre as this is like watching Lord of the Rings with only Hobit action. The four children from the cast do give things a try, but the lines that they are to pronounce are deeply annoying and very likely from another century. Especially the youngest girl truly got on my nerves! This is probably the clearest resemblence with Lord of the Rings as Frodo and Sam had lots of these tear jerking lines as well. The only violence you will get to watch in Narnia received a Disney treatment and the creatures Disney's studio came up with here are no fun at all. After half an hour I could not resist to use fast forward anymore. (SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...

Lewis would've been pleased...","review":"It would be difficult to give a \\"detailed and specific\\" review of this movie without filling it with spoilers -- and this movie is worth seeing fresh. In every detail that matters -- the animation, the live action, the props and costuming, the acting, the casting, the setting, the special features, the delightful commentary by the director and the child actors, and on and on -- this film is first-rate. If the appearance of Father Christmas (the UK's version of Santa Claus) seems a tad disconcerting, remember, it's in C.S. Lewis' original story (as much in the film, strictly speaking, is not).Of course, New Zealand is the perfect setting for so much of this film. One climactic scene near the end (given its geographical setting) just might have fans of THE LORD OF THE RINGS expecting Gandalf, Aragorn or the Riders or Rohan coming in from stage left to smite the White Witch and her minions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step into the world of Narnia","review":"I absolutely LOVED this movie!!!!!! I have read the book and loved it as a child and love the movie too. I have read other reviews who complain its not the book, but nothing will ever compare to one's imagination. And as far as the changes from book to screen: there will always be changes when you turn a book into a movie as well as someone elses' interpretation of it. But I thought it was excellent and have watched it over and over. I thought the cast of the children (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, & Anna Popplewell) and Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy) were unbelievably exceptional in this movie. I am of course a fan of James McAvoy but I really hope and can't wait to see more of Georgie Henley.

There's nothing original and the special effects were similar to lord of the ring. The storyline is essentially created to fool people to believe that great achievements come easy. As a matter of fact, the titles of kings and queens were just handed over to the kids for doing nothing. The newspaper said this movie had christian moral values embedded in it. I guess that value is women are the greatest evil (white witch) and the non-christians (note how the good guys wear christian armors and bad guys non-christians) are next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incompleta","review":"Muy buen dise?o, lastima que no sea como la presentan, porque no viene incluido el Libro de la foto"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Classic Tale of Wonder and Joy","review":"The type of propaganda i was raised on.

This movie has a really great atmosphere.This movie very much reminds me of books I read when I was growing up as a kid. (C.S. Lewis's other books, etc.) I wish Disney didn't do this movie, because you'd know they leave so many subliminal messages in their movies, and this movie is already propaganda enough.If you're looking for a good magical adventure quest, then buy this movie, because you'll definently want to revisit it anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie of 2005!","review":"This is now one of my favorite Disney movies.

Although it did capture the basic plot, it did lack some soul to it. Disney and Walden did water down some of the symbolism of the book that made it rich. I do not agree father christmas and the story came when the children came into narnia. Well it did partly happen because of them but because \\"Aslan is on the move.\\" It kind of made Aslan's significance smaller. Still, even if it captures just the surface text, the surface still says a lot. I cried twice over Aslan. Sure, one might say \\"Yeah, right.

The 45 minute ambient piece is simply boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitement and relaxation in one","review":"Waiting for Cousteau is dedicated to Jacques Cousteau and is Jarre's 'water' album. Calpyso part 1 is a frantic steel drum piece (best performed live), Calypsos 2 is a thumping, pounding slower track and Calypso 3 is an even slower 'ballad' track with a 'guitar' solo at the end.The final piece itself \\"Waiting for Cousteau\\" is a 45 minute ambient watery piece. It's very good relaxing / nature / sleep inducing music with a piano providing the limited melody.This is probably one of the last Jarre albums you'll want to add to your collection because most of the real melodies only last for 16 minutes, the rest is the ambient track which may not be everyone's cup of tea. On the flipside, if you're looking for something really thoughful and ambient, get waiting for cousteau simply for this track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more than you think the first time","review":"Is it really 46min 55sec?Pull out all of your JMJ CD's, set them up in the player.

There's one great track (\\"Only Love Remains\\") and a couple of catchy numbers (\\"Press\\" and \\"Angry\\") but most of the songs here are instantly forgettable. It's obvious that Paul was experimenting with a few of the tracks but they mostly come off sounding embarrassing. \\"However Absurd\\" seems to be Paul trying for a Lennon stream-of-consciousness \\"I Am The Walrus\\" vibe, but it just makes me cringe. The majority of tracks here are boring, barely tuneful filler.Avoid this effort and spend your money on CDs like \\"Flowers In The Dirt\\" and \\"Flaming Pie\\". Sure, they also have some pretty average filler between the better tracks, but are far more enjoyable and satisfying than this weak effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I wonder how that goes\\"","review":"This is one of Paul's worst efforts. Having all of his work, I read the tracklist and can't remember what's the tune for each one (except maybe the chorus of \\"Talk more talk\\"). I write this review in order to \\"promote\\" the fact that Paul said he has the same impression with this cd, claiming he didn't know what he was on and wondering \\"how this goes\\" as he reads the tracklists. For fans only, and what a pity, considering this album took about two years to make -one of Paul's greatest efforts-, and Linda McCartney is in the cover. For Paul's best 80s music -'Press to play' is from 1986-, check his 'Flowers in the dirt' (with the extra tracks) and 'Tug of war'. The 1980 album 'McCartney II' is mostly made of demos Paul wasn't even aiming to release in the first place, so it's a take-it-or-leave-it offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Press To Play (1986)","review":"This is by far the worst album of Pauls solo career. BY FAR. This would even dis- appoint die- hard, hardcore fans. This is just a bunch of poorly written, un- inspired songs and it shows very badly when listening. There are two good songs and thats just good, on this album. Those are \\"Press\\", \\"Only Love Remains\\" and \\"Tough on a Tightrope\\". On these songs you just want them to end when your listening to them because there so long and boring. This never should have been released. I hate to say it but its that bad. You really dont know how bad it is until you listen to the whole thing. Maybe someone likes it, I dont know. But I sure dont. Iam a huge fan of his and this just doesnt cut it from such a brilliant musician. If you want good Paul albums from the 1980's get \\"McCartney II\\" (1980), \\"Tug Of War\\" (1982)or maybe \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" (1989)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster album","review":"Press To Play is the low point of Paul McCartney's career. Alot of the criticism lobbied at Mr. McCartney is that he doesn't make music like he made with the Beatles. That is unfair as no one could match those songs and alot of his solo work is high level stuff. The problem with Press To Play is that it's not good by anyone's standards. The songs like Footprints\\", \\"Pretty Little Head\\", \\"angry\\" and \\"Tough On A Tightrope\\" are mostly throwaways. The album doesn't offer much expect the songs \\"Stranglehold\\" and \\"Press\\" which are very good songs. \\"Spies Like Us\\" is a bonus track and was the theme to the Chevy Chase-Dan Ackroyd film of the same name. It's a fun song and went to number 7 in 1985. Shockingly that is, to date, his last top ten song."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Press to Eject\\"","review":"One of Paul McCartney's worst albums, \\"Press to Play\\" (1986) does not contain a noteworthy track. The uninspired singles \\"Press\\" and \\"Stranglehold\\" fizzle - along with everything else. An utterly dispensable effort from Sir Paul. The 1993 reissue gains a star for the welcome inclusion of \\"Spies Like Us\\" (1985) and the extended \\"Once Upon a Long Ago\\" (1987)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough On A Tightrope...but It's Not True!","review":"I find it amazing how many people slam this album as being one of Paul's worst albums that he ever put out. True, it's different than his other albums in that it's very unique which is what Paul's music is - unique. You have rock, pop, jazz, r&b, alternative, grunge, classical...then you have Paul's music which is far advanced and very different than what you hear on the radio today. Some of my favorite songs off of Press to Play are: Stanglehold, Good Times Coming/Feel the Sun, Talk More Talk, Footprints, Only Love Remains, Press, Pretty Little Head, Write Away (Paul is very inventive in this song in that he makes use of the sound of a clicking pen as part of the rhythm of the whole song), It's Not True, Tough On A Tightrope, Spies Like Us, and (my all-time favorite) Once Upon A Long Ago.

I was disappointed that the plants listed were not of the more readily available variety. I had the book with me when I went into Smith and Hawken and the odd thing was some of the plants they had for sale were not listed in the book. So I guess it's not a catalog after all. A great thing about the book is that it offers information on the plant shown so the reader would have an idea what plant would bloom in what size pot.

The choice of words and sentence structures clearly shows the difficulty in translating such text. In these regards the book is fine.This book fails mightily when talking about Mulla Nasuraddin. I understand that Mulla at this stage is mostly considered somewhat fictitious figures and stories about him probably have different origins which are attributed over the times to a single person. At the same time, the author has completely take a leap of faith and almost any anecdote even modern ones about trains and machines had been assigned to Mulla. I was really looking for the charm of those old time stories not a general anecdote. In that sense, this books disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasrudin ain't what he used to be...","review":"Shah's renderings of the stories of the folk character, Nasrudin (aka Nasruddin) were much more charming in the early editions when they were illuminated by the clever pen-and-ink illustrations of the animator Richard Williams. Without those illustrations, these editions are dry and pedantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks so much like the illustrations!","review":"Great replica of the original artwork, yet soft and cuddly, too.

Finally got a response to an e-mail from the company saying they had contacted my e-mail and refunded the money. Unfortunately I did not receive the e-mail until several days later but that is due to problems on my end. I checked with the bank and my check had gone thru so figured Olivia was enroute. After getting a reply from the co. I contacted the bank again and told them the situation. They said sometimes it takes up to a month to get the refund. I was most upset as it was a special present for one of my Grandchildren and I could have tried other places if I had only known she was not available. By the time I got around to that, she was unavailable everywhere. This was not a pleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Images","review":"This one is a weird edition, album backcover says it's 1991 17-track issue, but CD itself contains 1997 20-track remastered version.

Images is a great compilation, and if you want it, get \\"true\\" 17-track or 20-track issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste decides which is \\"best\\"...","review":"I thought this compilation is magnificent. But I also heard of different versions as to this CD's concern. There are several tracks that were remixed and were added the digital synth features of today's music, as opposed to their minimalistic features of the analog synths of the 70's. It worked quite well is some cases, but in others it sounded like just another Radio commercial jingle.The three new tracks that were added are probably why this CD is worth the price tag. They're wonderful. They're like nothing you'd expect from Jarre. Innovative, melodic, rich in sound and variety... simply wonderful.To sum up... Jarre's most popular does most certainly not mean that it's his best, it's a risk. But such a risk is very easy to take. Take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Music Ever","review":"If you like Jarre music, this is the album for you. Made of one of the best of his scores ever. From the beggining to the end. Just put the CD on, sit down, relax, close yor eyes, and let the music do the job. If you're a newbie, you've probobly heard his music before. You're just not aware of what's behind.

When I did a standard stereo connection, I set the volume all the way up and It was just slightly louder than my 150w home stereo. Not at all what I was hoping for. Of course, if you do a bridge mono connection, with 2 cabinet speakers connected in series, It does get louder, but it still sounds more like 400w than 2000w. I think that the \\"2000w\\" claim is misleading, when you can only get about 200w in a regular stereo connection. More or less what you get with a consumer home stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jean's LOVE LESSONS","review":"I received my \\"Love Lessons\\" cassette tape and I am highly disappointed. The music is not soulful at all. Not for JEAN CARNE. That's why I wanted her old music. Classic R&B is just better than contemporary R&B. I do not enjoy contemporary R&B. There is not doubt in my mind that JEAN CARNE, PATTI LABELLE, GLADYS KNIGHT & ARETHA FRANKLIN can sing but, they're not singing with the emotion they sung with years ago. R&B today is so watered down and commercialized. Black music is no longer what it used to be. I'll just stick with the old school jams because to me that was music (Black)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Album","review":"Any chance to hear Jean Carne sing is a wonderful oppertunity to listen to one of the music industry's most underated and under appreciated vocalists.I've been a fan of hers for more than 20 years and was not at all disappointed in this album.She sounds great, looks more beautiful than ever and chose some good songs.My only criticism would be that, although the last 3 songs are good, they seem a little out of place in respect to the rest of the album.This album was recorded in 1995.I only hope we'll have a new Jean Carne album soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stereo but not for a convertible","review":"I've had this stereo for almost a year now and I like everything about it except that I have it in a convertible and the display is totally unreadable when I put the top down.

I read in \\"The Best Recipe\\" that double-acting baking powder doesn't really work in waffles, because there isn't enough time in the short baking cycle for it to really get bubbling, and thus they use only baking soda in their recipes.I thought that Greenspan seemed to use an awful lot of baking powder in her recipes (one tablespoon? I don't even use that in regular baking!), so I modified it to use just a bit more baking soda and no baking powder in the Apple-Gruyere waffles, and it worked fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure punk","review":"I got this as a gift, and it is the best disc I've heard in a long time.

(definitely getting the peanut butter ones from now on)They aren't too dry so you dont need to drink a ton of water to get them down, and they dont feel like a brick in your stomach afterwards.You get the same effects as with other whey and/or combination protein supplements in terms of mussel growth+repair, only difference is that these bars are 100% organic.

Compare that to a Snickers with 271 Calories, 13g fat (5 saturated) and 34g carbohydrates (28g sugar). Also, instead of whey protein (derived from milk) most of the protein in this bar comes from soy, which has some undesirable toxins, like dehydroalanines, nitrosamines, and furan.

I received these melted threw the winter so I don't think it is the delivery company. I have contacted Amazon.com several times without resolution. Eating a melted candy bar doesn't effect the taste but it falls apart when opened. This is a problem when you have pet picking everything up as you drop it. Chocolate and dogs don't mix well.

And, the taste just wasn't as fresh as buying them off the shelf.

They are quite filling and feature mostly natural ingredients with no hydrogenated oils or high fructose.The chocolate mint is the best flavor in my opinion, but you won't go wrong with another flavor. The only negative thing about these is that thet have soy protein, which contains plant estrogen hormones. However, I believe that Soy Isolate is free of these hormones, so it really is nitpicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the best!","review":"I have tried many many different protein bars with little to no success until about a year ago when I found Clif Builder Bars...

An excellent snack that I have daily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes quite good--good price","review":"Of the protein bars I've tasted, and there have been plenty, this is perhaps the best or at least tied. I liked the balance bar a lot, but it was primarily made with ingredients that seemed to come from a biology laboratory rather than someone's kitchen. The Cliff Bar provides 20 grams of protein, which is certainly enough for one bar, and the ingredients appear to be just as touted--largely organic. I like that.The peanut butter crunch flavor is actually quite good, and goes down nice with milk or coffee. I highly recommend this product in this flavor and will buy again.You should note that Cliff bars are available with and without protein, so if you want a protein bar, be sure to order it; not the energy bar. Lastly, the price is quite good, about $1.45 a bar or so. At GNC you'd pay over $3 for protein bars sold separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate Mint","review":"bought some of these from a local Safeway and tried them out for breakfast. they seem to be a LITTLE rich tasting for me for that early in the morning. they would make a better lunch or snack instead.there is 29 grams of protein, but also 20 grams of sugar. they are a little high in potassium and sodium >200 mg and there is 5 grams of saturated fat to go along with all of that.they taste good, texture (not taste) is like eating day old oat meal with a chocolate casing around it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these","review":"I usually have two of the Clif Builder bars every day.

CPB, Chocolate and Chocolate Mint (just like the Girl Scout Cookies) are my three staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better ways to get 20g of protein.","review":"This is a candy bar. Like another reviewer stated -- you do not need 20 grams of sugar to go along with your protein nor do you need 25% of the RDA of saturated fat! Not only are there other protein bars out there, but shakes are very easy to make at home (or take the ingredients with you on the road) and potentially much healthier. You can also get 18g of protein from eating a small container of nonfat yogurt...with zero fat or sugar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat Damaged","review":"I really like these bars.

He seems to focus entirely on the struggles a Westerner will experience, and focuses very little on the daily interaction and culture of a country with several thousand years of cultural history. But hey, if you're a business-person planning on spending six months working in Japan, Culture Shock Japan might be able to tell you how not to embarrass yourself in very specific corporate interactions...but maybe you might just want to skip the experience altogether.Also, with Tokyo being the nexus of technological advancement, the author too often editorializes with a \\"kids these days\\" sort of attitude regarding technology and entertainment.

Can you say arrogant American? (Although he writes as if he was British.) I don't understand why, if he hated the country so, he stayed there so long. Buyer beware: although the publication date is 2008, it appears to merely be a reprint of the original 2004 without edits. There is no indication as to when he made his observations of Japan. Case in point: the book talks about using AOL for internet service and how mobile phones are gaining in popularity.

Yes, the material specifically states that this is not the book to use if you want to memorize those. However, it does cover most of them - but not to a point where you could accurately recite them all. The CD allows you to take the book with you on your computer - so you don't have to lug it around.

So far, I have made 4 different recipes, and they have all come out so dry that they had to be thrown out! The pictures aren't big enough, and there aren't enough to begin with. All it has is one ingredient variations to make it \\"count\\" as another of the 500 recipes....Oh...and they aren't all cupcakes....most are muffins...."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 4 awful tries, the book had to go","review":"I followed AT LEAST 4 recipes in this book (to the \\"T\\"!!) and they ALL came out absolutely disgusting. I'm not exaggerating -- my parents happened to be visiting and I, being the baking fanatic I am, bought this book and immediately began baking them this and that. As polite as they'd try to be, we all agreed that these \\"THINGS\\" were simply inedible! This has got to be one of the worst cookbooks on the market. Don't waste your time, energy, money, or ingredients on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this book, and hoped to have 500 different recipies for cupcakes, instead you have about half recipies with different icings.When I decided to make awesome vanilla cupacakes (the easiest cupcake), well the result was a dry, mealie, terrible cupcake. The worst thing is that, this recipie is the one that gets repeated several times.So I do not recommend this book. You are better off getting reciepies from friends, and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I too, was like most others thinking.. omg the only cupcake book I will EVER need! BIG FAT JOKE! The cupcakes do not taste good! They are mediocre at bestThis book, while having many varieties does not have 500 completely different recipes. The cupcake recipes are mostly all the same with some minor changes, adding chocolate, or vanilla.The book should really advertise as 500 frostings, because that is the only thing that consistently changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes don't work","review":"I found this pretty-looking book in a used book store for a quarter. It looked brand new. The photographs are lovely, and the varieties endless (500? What more could you want?) So I wondered. What was it doing in a used book store? I found out fast. The recipes don't work. Maybe 500 recipes are too many to test. The measurements are off, making the batter too thick or too runny. Other times, whole steps are left out. It tells you to chop dried apricots, for example, but never mentions them again, so you're not sure whether to add them to the batter early, or at the very end (if you remember to add them at all). Steer clear of this book. Better 25 tried and true recipes than 500 flawed ones that waste precious time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty book but....","review":"I wish I read reviews before attempting to make cupcakes for the first time from this book. It's true that what you bake will be more on the dry side...or more like muffins. I always thought Cupcakes as being an inspiring exciting treat and what I created from this book today almost made me cry! I did the peanut butter cupcakes with peanut butter frosting...which I know sounds like a lot of peanut butter but it was for the kids. Anyway, they were a complete dissapointment! So of course I came to Amazon to see what reviewers said (in case it was not me) and sure enough...it was NOT me! I almost gave up as a baker because of this book! But 2 stars I give, again, for the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is a terrible cookbook. Every recipe I've tried is a disappointment. And I'm not new to baking. The recipes seem untested and the results always leave much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cucakes Ever!!","review":"I am an experienced cupcake baker with my own cupcake blog so I'm no amateur when it comes to making cupcakes.I gave this book 1 star only because there is no \\"zero star\\" rating. The White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cupcake has to be one of the worst cupcake recipes on record. Very dry, sweet but with little other flavor. The cupcake is dense and tough, not the least bit appealing.I decided to give it another try to be fair so I made the Chai cupcake. I've made these before with other recipes and they were delicious, tender and light. Not this one. Dry, dry,dry and again with little flavor. Not sure how this book got rated 5 stars by some readers but not by me. Don't bother unless you want to throw out a couple dozen cupcakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dry Recipes","review":"I bought this book for the sheer number of recipes, and I was initially impressed by some of the exciting variations. Unfortunately, of the seven recipes I've tried, not one of them delivered the flavor I expected nor made a cake that was enjoyable to eat. Requiring self-rising flour and containing little or no milk and a few recommended bake times that are too long, these recipes make cakes that are overly-dry with a disappointing crumb and little flavor. The recipes for frosting/icing/toppings also left much to be desired. For me, this book has been relegated to the reject pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea... but fails","review":"I bought this book over a year ago, thrilled at the thought of 500 cupcake recipes. I'd read the reviews which stated there were a lot of muffin recipes, but I was ok with that- they're not cupcakes, but I do like a good muffin now and then. There are some great ideas in this book, with a lot of flavor combinations that I never would have thought of.However, my gripe with the book is that I have yet to have a recipe turn out well. They are almost always dry and tasteless. I have been baking for many years, especially cupcakes, so I know my technique is not the issue. I haven't yet nailed down what the problem with the recipes is, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you're just looking for some inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Cupcakes","review":"I just want to add further corroboration that the recipes contained in the cookbook lead to exceedingly dry cupcakes. I have now tried three different recipes, all with the same results. This cookbook was extremely disappointing, and I will be making sure that I look at more of the specifics of the recipes (i.e., no milk, no separate mixing of wet and dry ingredients) in future cookbooks. Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful pictures/Poor Formulas","review":"I've made several of these recipes, and have generally gotten terrible results. And the quantity each recipe says it makes is way off on the ones I tried.It appears as though the author has taken one recipe and then extrapolated what *might* work in other situations--without actually testing the formulas. I'm not even talking about the \\"variations\\" that help bolster the \\"500 cupcakes\\" claim. The basic recipes simply don't work well.So this is really more of a theoretical cookbook, and unfortunately the theory doesn't hold up in real life.The pictures, however, are lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"This cookbook was not what I expected. First of all the ingredients were not normal ingredients that I bake with. I don't use super fine sugar, I just use granulated and brown sugars. Where I live you don't find a lot of super fine sugar in the grocery store. Other ingredients were not common baking ingredients for me either. If you have all the ingredients at easy access then it is not a bad cookbook, but if you are like me and don't use those ingredients or have access to them than I wouldn't recommend this cookbook.It had some good ideas and suggestions but it is based on a few key recipes and then you add to them. Now for me making some of those just didn't work. They weren't good combos and I felt they would be better with a full recipe instead of just being add-ins to a base recipe. So I give this 2 out 5 stars. Good ideas just not a good outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muffins are Cupcakes Ugly Cousin","review":"Although 500 Cupcakes offer you a ton of recipes, as repetitive as they are, they sadly consider muffins and cupcakes the same thing. This is something I just can not forgive. Any cake (note I said cake, not muffin recipe) can be turned into cupcakes. The only thing left is how are you going to decorate it. For that, I would suggest the book Hey There Cupcake to give you fun ideas. Otherwise, I did enjoy some of the more offbeat recipes and have enjoyed experimenting with cupcake's ugly cousin. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry cupcakes and repetitive recipes","review":"I'm glad to know I'm not crazy here seeing all the other testimonials about dry cupcakes resulting from the recipes in this book. I was very disappointed that many of the entries seem to be the same basic cake recipe with a flavor variation for the frosting. My cupcakes came out very \\"goopy\\" and thick, and they were ultimately dry and hard after baking. Finally, the requirement of quick-rising flour seems inconvenient for the every-day cook.There are better options out there for cupcake recipes or any cake for that matter. I would recommend passing on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and Dry... ick","review":"I only made two of the cupcakes in the book, but as many of the other reviewers pointed out, the vanilla recipe is mostly the same throughout the whole book. I tried a chocolate and vanilla cupcake and I used cake flour. Both were like hockey pucks. Way too dense and dry... like dry pound cake. Even the cream cheese icing was \\"off\\". And the chocolate icing? Dry, too! I love the pictures though. I'm a sucker for a cupcake photo shoot... but I think that's all this book can offer, sadly :( For the same party I made a third cupcake from the \\"Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World\\" book... and they were light, moist and delicious... these were the first to go. Grabbed up by vegan and non-vegan alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Anywhere Near 500 Cupcakes","review":"Besides there being a multitude of \\"variations\\" which are offered as different recipes....A Blueberry Muffins Recipe is followed by two variations of \\"Strawberry Muffins\\" and \\"Blackberry Muffins\\" in which the recipe astutely tells me to substitute the aforementioned berries for the original blueberries. That's 3 of the laughably inflated 500 recipes. I need a cookbook to tell me this??? Oh, and by the way---- A MUFFIN is not a CUPCAKE. Worst cookbook I have ever had the misfortune of wasting my money on. Please Don't Buy This. Just look around a bit more. There are many better cupcake cookbooks out there. Or buy a mix. It beats this ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for those looking for a wide range of baking recipes","review":"The 500 cup cakes provides 125 recipes for a variety of cup cakes from everyday use to special occasions. Each of the 125 recipes has four minor variations that tweak the item into a different version by adding a new flavor profile. Overall it is an average cookbook but for those who are skilled in baking like my wife it provides base recipes that can then be used to make their own variations while using this as a widespread springboard and because the recipes are chosen for easy variations they lend themselves to creating your own as well. We have only found a few recipes to be a little vague on the directions but overall have not had too many problems with this book. Overall well recommended for those that are looking for a lot of cake recipes that can be built on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I buy Slayer to hear Slayer, not punk","review":"Of course any metalhead know that the roots of metal are blues and punk (and classical way before that) but really.... C'mon Slayer. I buy your albums for the evil-sounding riffs, not to hear punk from you. It's great that you love your roots but I could really care less about where it came from and really only care about where it ended up. This is going backwards IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Punk Roots","review":"First of all, 'hardcore punk' is hardly a genre. Old School punk is the technical term, and it's basically early thrash. Slayer does an impressive job covering these classics, though some of the songs aren't so classic to begin with. Highlights include the infectious \\"Abolish Government/Superficial Love\\", \\"Spiritual Law\\", \\"Mr. Freeze\\", and \\"Memories of Tomorrow\\" and \\"Sick Boy\\" off the expanded. The last track \\"Gemini\\" is pure Slayer, not a cover, for those who found this albums disappointing. \\"Gemini\\" features some of Tom's best vocals plus great lyrics and riffing. I recommend this to Slayer fans, metal fans, and 'real punk' fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slayer???","review":"The one star I gave this cd is for the one song that I like: Gemeni. As for the rest of the cd, well... maybe Slayer should have just kept the songs to themselves. However, the rest of their cd's I all gave a well deserved 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nasty and Sloppy","review":"GIVE ME MORE OF THIS!!! As a fan of any music that thrusts a big middle finger into the face of popular music (or a fist up the a** to be more exact), I have to give my big double fingers in the air to Undisputed Attitude. I've been a Slayer fan all the way, and their first couple of albums are only shades away from punk anyway, so the worlds heaviest thrash band covering the worlds nastiest, snottiest, rudest punk only makes the most sense. Rude. Loud. Intense. Ugly. Pissed off. Killer. Put this album on when you're in the mood to hate EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Ass","review":"I love Minor Threat and TSOL of course Slayer rules! As a Punk turned Metal head I know how influencial Hardcore Punk was to the Thrash scene and here Slayer have shown their TRUE roots. I'm dissapointed, however that they did not cover a tune from fellow LA music scene punk band Black Flag who cam eto prominence at the same time as Slayer and was heavier and darker than any punk band out there (Kerry King said none of the bands they covered were heavy). Also noteably absent is a cover of a Dead Kennedys song, the logo of which Jeff sports on his Jackson Soloist live in consert.The origonal tracks are pretty kick ass too, it's kind of a strange twists to hear a punk song and the a metal song back to back. I love spiritual law.If you want to hear more punk like these songs check out Black Flag for sure. If you wanna hear Slayer cover more TSOL and TSOL cover Slayer check out their split (probobly under TSOL) in which they did just that.Awsome album."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNslayer","review":"This album goes against pretty much everything Slayer has accomplished. This is nowhere near as good as their earlier albums. In my opinion this album is a waste of plastic.

On the one hand the tour that this album draws its music from (Europe in Concert as well as the concert in Hong Kong in March 1994) had some of Jarre's best live music, the resulting album is a bit messy.For a start, the mixing is quite poor, Jarre's guitarist, Patrick Rondat can hardly be heard on some tracks which is unfortunate. The superb \\"Digisequencer\\" which is exclusive to this album is a mix of two concert versions and it shows. Other tracks such as \\"Magnetic Fields 2\\" have incredible new intros but are spoiled by weak cheesy sounding synth solos. The running time is 70+ minutes and it's a good album but could have easily been a lot better.This 2-disc version (no longer available in Europe) has the full version of Fishing Junks at Sunset (an extra 4 minutes or so). Worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"If you're a Jarre-fan and you missed this album, it should be only for it's price, because the music is too good to leave in the store.

A great addition for anyone whoenjoys his work in Skeptical Inquiry magazine or is interested in freethinking, atheism and agnosticism. Gardner has made it his life work to expose the dogmatic foundations of illogical thought where ever it may be found and as this collection shows, shoddy logic is alive and well in the Western tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"In this book Gardner tries to answer questions about his own world view - \\"democratic socialist who believes in God\\". His chapters start with questions like: Why am I not a solipsist? Why am I not a determinist? Why do I believe in God? Unfortunately almost all of his answers boil down to \\"just because I believe so\\". I've also found the statement \\"nobody knows better than a democratic socialist\\" (repeated verbatim several times) quite annoying.While I like Gardner's other work this book is really pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort, not rigorous enough","review":"I read parts of this book for a class assignment, where I had to identify the different paradigms which Gardner uses in his assertions. Basically, Gardner's reasoning is science-centric; even his declarations of faith fall back on science and reason. He also does a good job of artifically separating faith and reason. He is surprisingly ethnocentric, as in one of his refutations of cultural relativism that asserts that certain \\"primitive\\" societies do not meet basic needs as well as other societies. He uses pragmatic proofs to refute pragmatism, seemingly without knowing it. Basically, all his conclusions rested on Western principles that are easily deconstructed, that he apparently had not thought about deeply enough. This book shouldn't have survived the 80's. Buy something by Derrida instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Honest","review":"I give this book four stars primarily because of his honesty and his attempt to rationally expound his views (which it seems is all too rare in the current climate of emotionally-charged screaming and shouting at the \\"other side\\"). He freely admits numerous times that \\"I do not know\\" the answers to various human mysteries yet still discusses the logic behind his various views. It was actually refreshing to read such a lucid picture into someone's deeply held beliefs.

At any rate, I will be filling in the blank pages with his favorite recipes that I've either taught him or made for him.Why?Why not!My mother gave me a book akin to this - a \\"make your own\\" cookbook - that she had for about 20 years.

Even vector math itself is not defined!The author, if he must write at all, should team up with a competent technical writer, maybe as a coauthor, especially since the publisher, Wordware (based on my observations, a second-rate outfit in general) doesn't seem keen on providing adequate editorial contribution"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hartz Rawhide Chew Sticks Pack of 20","review":"MADE IN CHINA..Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss.

It looked too good to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low price, good quality, and reasonably fast shipping","review":"I bought this cable because the cable that came with my Wii was built for an AV connection and my TV doesn't have AV ports. When did they start building TV's without the old AV ports?. I needed component or HDMI so this cable was just what I needed. I wasn't expecting much for $6.18 to the door (free shipping) but I got a pleasant surprise to receive a pretty good cable. It's not something I'll be plugging in and unplugging all the time but my guess is that this cable could easily stand up to being moved around between TV's frequently if you have the need. The connectors and all solid and fit snugly. Picture quality is excellent, what I'd expect from a component connection. My neighbor did tell me my picture was much sharper than theirs but I'm not sure if it's because I'm using a component input and they use AV or if it's just that I have a better TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Component Wii Cable","review":"I noticed a slight improvement once I hooked the cord to my HD TV. The cord has good length, which allows for more flexibility in your entertainment setup. I did not know until after I hooked it up that the Nintendo WII only allows for 480P performance. The connections are snug both on the Wii system and on the back of the TV, which means it should continue to offer a quality connection for as long as I own my Wii. Overall, I would recommend this cord.

It might be as low as a 2% failure rate given the reviews, but its just some worthless junk to me when it doesn't do its job right.

Unfortunately, in \\"The Antitrust Paradox\\" Judge Bork misinterprets the word \\"efficiency\\" as it applies to antitrust law.

That misunderstanding leads Judge Bork to propose, in essence, the following Carrollian extended syllogism:Antitrust law advances \\"efficiency\\" and condemns monopolyConsumer welfare is the goal of antitrust lawConsumer welfare is advanced by lower pricesMonopolists are more \\"efficient\\" and provide lower pricesto consumers by economies of scaleMonopolists advance consumer welfareMonopoly is \\"efficient\\" and should be legalLest we forget, John D.

A brine-in-the-face journey via the stormy regions at world's end through the even more tempestuous seascape of the human soul - one littered with deeds of nobility, larceny, altruism, treachery, bravery, faith, and despair.

Murphy weaves in to this account the history of the Cape Horn region, including some of the experiences of the many sailing ships which rounded the Horn and the interactions between natives and Europeans in the region.The historical segments of this book are quite good, although far more information on Magellan and Drake is given than is needed to tell the history of Cape Horn. But by and large, the historical parts of this book work quite well and are satisfying to the reader. Much less interesting is Murphy's account of his wanderings through the archipelago. His 21st century experience is dull and uninteresting when juxtaposed against the rich history of Cape Horn.In spite of this shortcoming, the book is certainly worth a read by those who are interested in learning more about this intriguing part of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad... whets your appetite..","review":"This is a good book for those who are familiar with sign language and want more information that is available in most introductory texts on food signs.

It deals with one specific financial manipulation, that of the reorganization of the Chicago & Alton Railroad in 1899-1900. The book shows that there was nothing particularly different about this reorganization among all of the finanical activities surrounding the railroad industry at the time, nor among the activities of E. H. Harriman and his coterie of establishment figures. However, after a falling-out between Harriman and President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, the Chicago & Alton \\"case\\" became the basis of Roosevelt's claim that Harriman was an \\"undesirable citizen\\".

This was my first encounter with this kind of limitation--hope it's my last!I'd rate the text itself as a 3+, in comparison with other similar books.

The book should have ended there and been published as a technical pamphlet (for which the author appears to qualified to discuss). The remainder of the book contains the authors non-scientific opinions about global warming, Middle Eastern politics and his obvious dislike of the United States. He implies that the world economy is dependent on carbon fuels, not because they are cheap and plentiful, but because the world was duped throughout the 20th century by large multi-national corporations.

Somehow with all this, this Green Slime gets on one of the Astronauts, and then grows into a bunch of what looks like kids in bad alien costumes with big red eyes. If I can remember properly, this crud was produced and filmed in Japan with American actors, and it was completed quickly to try to beat 2001 to theatres.

After that, the implausible string of coincidences that would neatly fit in to the overall story are just left as an implausible string of coincidences.Having said that, the characters are interesting and the novel is very well written.

There is an investigator who is investigating the murders years later. There is nothing special or clever about the stories. If you like murder mysteries, you will enjoy this one. Perhaps it was a bad choice for my taste which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1. Some of the characters have depth, but the reader does not connect with most of the others. Another criticism is that the author puts a lot of of stuff in parentheses which I find annoying.If you like the Lifetime channel or murder mysteries read this book, but do not expect anything particularly special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointed!!","review":"I was anxious to read this book once I read all the great reviews for it, especially the endorsement from Stephen King as a must-read. However, the whole book from start to finish was depressing! I didn't like a single character and I cared even less what happened to them, but I was determined to finish what I start, hoping that the author would pull together a great ending. Nope!!!

It was his #1 choice of all the books he read last year..and went on to say one of the best of the decade! Well, I am not sure if I agree with that, BUT, it's an engrossing story...a book that was difficult to put down. The fact it spanned a course of years -- and to witness very insightful, private views of the main characters made for a very satisfactory read.

Interesting at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Fooled, This Is A Mystery","review":"This book was recommended by none other than Stephen King, his best book pick for 2005 in Entertainment Weekly. His last Best Book pick was Vernon God Little, so I had some trepedation going in. Readers should not be put off by the first 22 pages. They come off as a fey literary novel about English sisters. Boring, right? But the book picks up speed from there and has everything a good book should: 1) Intersting characters, 2) Great writing, & 3) a sense of humor. Atkinson's writing is top notch while her characters continue to surprise. Jackson Brodie, a PI with the same bad luck as any American PI including a troublesome ex-wife, somebody out to kill him, and investigative problems, is a sympathetic character who we don't even meet until Chapter 4, 45 pages in. That's the beauty of this book, there is no hurry, characters are developed as you go, yet the story moves along at a nice pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's not quite a mystery or just a contemporary novel. Jackson Brodie PI is asked to solve 3 cold cases in Cambridge, England. The Land sisters trying to find out what what happened to their youngest sister. She disappeared one night when she was 4 years old in 1970. Another is a lawyer who lost his favorite beloved daughter in 1994. A man off the street killed her on the first day on the job in his office. The last is a woman wanting to find her niece who's mother killed her father with an ax in 1979.I like how Ms. Atkinson developed her main characters. You can't help but like them despite their personal flaws. She also tells you what they think of each other and I like that. The ending is satisfying which is important to me. I hate endings that don't feel or seem right. It's a little far fetched but not unbelievable.

Not so. It came off as trying too hard to be a literate mystery. I wasn't impressed. Even though we get to see things about the different characters, none of them have any redeeming qualities. Now I'm not perfect, but I would hope that most of us have at least some good points along with the bad. That would have made the story more interesting & less sensational.

Just could have been better story-wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of Jackson, please...","review":"Set in Cambridge, England, \\"Case Histories\\", by award winning author Kate Atkinson is a well done series of character studies, accompanied by a mystery that threads its way through each of three cases brought to Jackson Brodie.Brodie's an everyman private eye, who is handed some cold cases through a variety of circumstance -- he's compelling as a flawed hero, and gives us a mix of plot twists, all held together by probably too much coincidence. Still, the book, told from several points of view, is an entertaining mix of plots and characters, and leaves you rooting for Kate Atkinson to bring back Jackson Brodie for more pursuits.Enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case Histories","review":"Kate Atkinson is one of my favorite authors, she always produces amazing stories with very tangible and likeable characters, the plots are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great - understated.

(I should preface this by saying that I finished reading a Cormac McCarthy novel last week, so perhaps my palette is scarred.) The characters wallow about with too much lame dialogue and expected idiosyncrasies. The plot starts out at 80 mph, only to sputter to a geriatric standstill by the 5th chapter. I kept turning pages hoping it would get better, be written better, and seem like less of a Lifetime channel movie you watch on sick days. Sadly, dear potential reader, it never did. When I finished the last page I immediately walked outside and left it on the curb, saddened that it ever occupied a place on my bookshelf. If you want to read it, you can find it outside on the sidewalk and save yourself the shipping charges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caman","review":"I liked the book.

Consequently it has been on my \\"to read\\" list for quite a while and I happen to see it on the shelf at the library.What I Thought About ItIt started off slow, and it seemed to be three independent short stories told one chapter at a time. So much so that I looked through it to see if I could just read the stories one by one by jumping around. After settling my confusion I stuck with it due to all the phenomenal reviews and found the pace and the intertwining of the stories began to happen gradually until the speed and suspense built up to a very satisfying conclusion. This was not necessarily the style of mystery I go for, but I can state all the praise was well deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your usual mystery novel","review":"I was prompted to buy and read Case Histories after hearing it discussed on a radio program on Diane Reems' public broadcasting station. The panel members were almost unanimous in faulting it as a mystery novel, but said the characterizations, wit and style (particularly the details of setting) lifted the novel out of the realm of the ordinary. I have to agree, although I found some of the sexual overtones offensive and unnecessary (unless that's what a young writer has to include in order to sell her book). The \\"solution\\" to the mystery of each case history was disappointing. I understand that a sequel is planned in which the detective will be re-introduced. I do not plan to buy the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Histories: A Novel","review":"This novel was too filled with SEX and perverted scenarios.

We are both HUGE readers and trade off books to save money. Neither of us is too picky about what we read because we read so much. Well, I never got her perspective on the book before I started it so can't say what she thought passing it off to me. I started it and after a few chapters put it down and didn't pick it up again for about 6 months. Until there was nothing at all left to read in my house and then I started it again.It is so tedious. The characters are ugly, with no discernable redeeming qualities. It actually depressed me to read it, however, I was committed to finishing it. I truly can't say anything good.

Cremins shouts that we should halt this cry of progress for 1,000 years as he roasts his character, who would believe the convenient Swiftian fantasy, on the fires of home, love, family, honor, and loyalty. The New Man who would live in the Border Lands of his own Dream Landscape comes to understand the fallacy of youth and the fatigue of age. I really enjoyed this novel and I would appreciate knowing your opinion.

So you could say I couldn't put it down. Characters are upper class Irish Catholics in Dublin. Enlightening view of new territory -- after reading McCourt's nonfiction, Uris, and various native Irish writers, I had no idea such a group existed -- at least not over there. Drinking stories of the pinting-crew are entertaining. No nudity or sex, little violence, one chase scene but whole tale held my attention. It's an entertaining, contemporary look at modern Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wired76","review":"Anyone returning to his or her home country after a prolonged stay abroad should read this book; in fact, airlines should comp it to us. Robert Cremins has perfectly summarized the deflating process that is coming home, of slowly and painfully having the personna you've created while living abroad flayed and tortured, examined and analyzed. At times, he seems to aspire excessively to the brand dropping of \\"American Psycho,\\" and the subplot with Tom's father probably could've been played a bit better. But, I found solace in Tom and Mainie's conversations, particularly their final one, because they seemed to summarize the battle of the two schools of thought held by the expatriates of the world (home [stinks] v. home rules). It makes you think, but you have a great time doing it.

When I saw that two fine citizens rated this book five-star I thought it was going to be a grand read. Possibly a \\"modern\\" reader would enjoy this \\"modern\\" book; I didn't.

But none of them did justice to this master piece like this one. A traditional staging but daring, edgy direction, delivered by superb cast. Alagna in the title role, who has ability of a natural actor, sing with stylish lyric voice, and perfect diction. Terfel is a three-dimensional,fascinating Mephistopheles, and Gheoghiu's tragic Marguerite is fragile and beautiful in both voice and acting, the elegant baritone Simon Keelyside as her doom brother valentin, his death scene was gut-wrenching. The production complete with devilishly disturbing ballet, which intensified the drama towards the thrilling end. This is not your old-fashion faust, this one is with new blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Faust","review":"Never saw Faust before but got this since I always trust the work of Alagna & Gheourgiu. It was wonderful & I really enjoyed the staging & the singing but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that you could find some of the scenes a bit offensive if you are more conservative in your viewing. There's a scene where women lick blood off of a \\"bleeding\\" crucifix - I get that it was representing the devil's doing but some may find it a bit much. What I had trouble with was the scene where they had the talents of their incredible ballet company completely wasted by having the lot of them rolling around on the ground having pretty graphic simulated sex. I just thought it went further than it had to & I wanted to see the dancers DANCE, not roll around on the ground. So for that I give it 4 stars but if something like that wouldn't bother you than it is definitely a 5 star production."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Give it a -10 if I Could","review":"I was so happy to finally see a production of Gounod's Faust available on dvd with a highly regarded cast, that I quickly ordered this.

His approach to imagery and abstraction in this particular film is in a word remarkable. It's a film whose story is secondary to the atmosphere and dialogue. Simply put it's a film whose visual importance and potentcy is absolutely under appreciated. I would consider this film to be one of the top 5 Franco works.

Atlantis have all the features of most early 70s prog bands: mutiple part songs, sneaky time signitures, keyboards, keyboadrs and more keyboadsBut this band had molodic insticts. The songs are almost pop in parts, with hummable melodic lines, played a lot with a delecate chime from a Fender Rhodes. Yet, the long avanues and sudden changes in rhythm in a lot of the numbers will quickly inform you, Atlantis was far from being a pop group. You could compare them to Yes, or Caravan, not so much in their sound, but their emphasis on melody and the pastorial over the disonece of bands like Egg and Vander Graff Generator. But Atalantis could also rock when they wanted, and that is clearly in evidence on this album.Prog far above average.

The techniques revealed by the Berklee faculty have greatly improved my ability as an arranger.

Although a little pricey for my taste, the iH6 has great sound quality, it's easy-to-use, and the ability to utilized two alarms at once, one with the radio/ one with an iPod, made it even better. I particularly like the gradual increase in volume with the iPod alarm, so the music doesn't just blast your ears out at 6 A.M. I found only one thing I didn't like about it. If you are one of those people who like to listen to soft music as you fall asleep, the next morning the alarm will be as soft as you put it the night before.

I have not yet seen any reviewer's mentioning the same issue. My iPod works perfectly in all other settings, so I cannot imagine that the problem is the iPod. I have now sent the second product back to iHome. FM radio reception was also not good, but I think that's the location of my house, not the radio itself.

I love everything about it -- the sound is great, the alarm quiet-to-louder feature works really well for me. The one thing that is kind of odd is that you can't select which type of alarm you want to wake up to for the two alarms. The first one has to be the ipod (or, if there is no ipod connected, the buzzer) and the second one has to be the radio. It works out really well for me since that's how I would set it up anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey for the performance","review":"The device has always been mediocre from a sound quality point of view, quite tinny. Making it do simple things has always been a chore. It charged our iPods quite well and played the correct song when the alarm would sound. For that, I awarded two stars. As for the function of displaying the correct time, the iHome tends to struggle with this important feature, consistently slow. As of yesterday, it has completely \\"lost track of time\\". I hope the other iHome newer products received well needed improvements. Save your money, do not purchase. There are better products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Product.","review":"So far, I really like this product. Pretty good sound and it's quite functional.

However, when a product is advertised as an AM/FM radio, you expect to get exactly that. The AM reception in this device is so pitiful you would think you were listening to an old Japanese transistor radio from the late '60's. Very disappointing to say the least. We still have this player, but the under-counter device from iHome was so bad we donated it to a fund raising auction. There is something wrong with the engineering iHome is putting into their AM receivers - or maybe they're not engineering them at all. Maybe they are left over from an old Japanese warehouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"iPod and Radio Player","review":"works well for iPod and AM.

Last December, we compromised on a king size mattress and bought a $1300 mattress instead of the $4000 Temperpedic. Unfortunately the mattress we have is somewhat hard and after about 10 months of restless sleeping, we decided to purchase this item. I'm just sorry that we didn't buy one sooner.On another note, the pillow is really a joke. But hey, the price for the topper itself is less than half than what you would pay in the store, so I didn't really care about the pillow.Also, the memory foam has a smell to it, but I know it will wear off in a week or two.

A universal tale of man and his environment. This film can be viewed as a social commentary of Southern versus Northern Italy and five different adaptations to modernization. The five brothers are compared to the five fingers on a hand ~ joined, yet each posits alternatives to existence. Structurally, this is shown in the films chapters devoted to each son. Vincenzo elects the petit-bourgeouis mileu; Simone, the brother with initial promise, maladapts, descending to animalism; Rocco chooses sacrifice, holding steadfast to the family clan and nostalgia; Ciro reveals integration within Milanese society; and, finally, Luca offers promise.

Delon's role as the ultimate enabler made him a star, but the performance of Salvatori as the enablee is the standout.

These six imaginative versions of the Rumpelstiltskin story are told from wildly different points of view. There are versions with mean and friendly trolls. In one story there is a haughty king and in another King Gregory has to work hard to evade a rather inept social climbing miller's daughter. One boastful father with an understanding daughter, tries to correct his mistake. In another version, a curious neighbor named Rumpelstiltskin gets involved with a conniving miller's daughter.Teachers often have students write a different end to a story. In this case you can show students how to write an entirely new version telling the story from the differing viewpoints of each character. Vivian Vande Velde has used the holes in the original story to tell an old favorite tale in a range of short stories that go from gruesome to hilarious. Cleverly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring but creative","review":"The beginning of this book is very interesting and entertaining. The voice of the author in his note is very amusing and makes a clear point. His ability to come up with such different and full versions of the classic story, Rumpelstiltskin, is extremely creative and enjoyable, but gets very dull as the book holds six different versions of the same story that we already know of. The questions that the author throws at the reader is what kept me reading the first half of the book, but had to force myself to read to the end.

The story is titled \\" A Fairy Tale in Bad Taste.\\" I think it was in bad tasted to include this book. It was to be a book in my daughters 4th grade classroom, but her teacher and I agreed that children don't need to be exposed to this kind of reading content. It is a reading level 5, and I'm not sure what level would enjoy this story. I sure didn't. The other tales were fine, and had cute twists to them.

He makes his way to a crooked face doctor who has a front as a wax museum curator.The confusion comes when you have pretty much every character acting suspiciously.And the end was not all that interesting except for people mistaking wax dummies for real people or real people posing as wax exhibits.Overall, not a bad entry into the Charlie Chan series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than original.","review":"This remix album is worth buying for the And One Remix alone. Their rendition is far more lyrical than the original and more danceable. Not to take anything away from the original version. I liken it to what James Cameron did with Aliens compared to Ridley's original movie Alien. Two very different movies. Cameron's is just bigger all the way around, more 'fun', but completely dependent on the genius and simplicity of the original movie. Both are wonderful for very different reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine sampler","review":"You should note that all of this music is acoustic, so no Elmore James or J.B. Hutto, but as a collection of early slide guitar blues, \\"Roll And Tumble Blues\\" works very well (the title track, by the way, is the original version of the song most people know as \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'\\").The compilers have made some fine choices, and most of the lesser-known songs are good as well. I would probably have included Son House's \\"Pearline\\" rather than \\"Walking Blues\\", and there are a few other debatable selections as well, but \\"Roll And Tumble Blues\\" remains a fine introduction for the curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Loved It","review":"We used this on several items and we have two puppies. One loved it and even chewed her crate pillow. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"sassybax bralette","review":"This wireless bra works great for me. I have had reconstruction on both breasts due to breast cancer. It has compression in the back which helps control swelling and gives my back a smooth look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it had worked","review":"I had great expectations for the SassyBax, but, alas, they were not met. The product was extremely uncomfortable after about ten minutes of wear. Too high under the arms and the bottom band rolled up. Does anyone make a comfortable bra?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough support!","review":"Oh how I wanted this to work for me. However, since I have major boobage, I need major support. Somehow I thought the sassybax would offer more support since it has so much coverage. Not so. I sag and jiggle . . . it does serve as a 'round the house bra. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution for those of us with bigger bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"My boyfriend's gear was completely wore down on his truck so we bought this one to replace it- everything worked as it was supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Novick Makes Sense","review":"As a physician, I have recommended this video to patients and to friends. Jeff's message is simple, clear and concise. It may change your life, whether your goal is to lose weight or just get more healthy. Check out his Fast Food videos also. Burgers and Fries is my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining","review":"I especially enjoyed and was surprised by the comparisons of quantity and quality of foods. Ultimately we want the most nutrition for the calories we eat and this DVD makes that concept come alive. The more high quality fuel we use in our bodies the better we feel. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read - understand the heart of Our Blessed Mother.","review":"This book/poem beautifully illustrates the heart of Mary, Our Blessed Mother. The reader comes to understand her thoughts, emotions, and, especially, her silence as she watches Jesus grow, enter public life, be crucified and resurrected.The book may be a little difficult to get into, but by the time Jesus is lost in the temple, you can't put the book down. Truly a wonderful insight into Mary as she \\"pondered these things in her heart.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman Wrapped In Silence","review":"This book is a classic, which I have enjoyed for the past thirty years. I misplaced my copy and was pleased to find it available at Amazon. This book is written in narrative poetry style detailing the life of Mary, the Mother of Jesus. As a mother, myself, I can relate to the experiences and feelings of Mary as she lived her life as the Mother of a very special Child."},{"rating":"2","title":"gave as gifts","review":"I bought two used copies of this book as Christmas gifts. They looked brand-new. I received them within four days. Both recipients loved them. Amazon is a first class resource for hard to find books."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing more painful than broken trust.","review":"Based on this premise, this author is amazingly adept at seeing through to our souls, to all the times in our lives we loved and trusted, only to have dreams shattered, lives wrecked and pieces all over the ground. Easy to read and absolutely true to form, this book describes what betrayal is because it comes in so many forms, somes we never even thought of, and how betrayal by trusted loved ones or others can change you, making you a person that you yourself can no longer understand. Painfully, and step by step, as you read this book, there is a high probability you will catch glimpses (maybe even photos!) of yourself. It sometimes wasn't an easy book to read when it really hit home at points, but it definitely is a must read anyhow. Dealing with secrets people keep, nasty gossip, odd behavior and all the way up to infidelity, buy this book and learn to heal. It's the only one to date I've found that at least gives you the desire to do so again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding, but no helpful solutions","review":"I got half way through \\"Love & Betrayal\\" by John Amodeo and had to put it down. While the author seems to fully understand how one who has been betrayed feels, he offered no helpful solutions for the problem. I was looking for ways to help deal with what happened to me so I could move forward without hurting my current relationship. After reading chapter after chapter of the same thing over and over again, I finally threw the book away. It's possible that the final chapters have some kind of solution, but I was looking for something positive and encouraging and didn't find that in the first half of the book. Like I said, and much like the book, I repeat, monotonous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!","review":"Love this Olbas inhaler! Much more aromatic and refreshing than the others. It's part of my sinus-care kit I always take on a plane trip (other items are 4-Way saline mist with eucalyptol & menthol, and Ayr saline nasal gel). I have one next to the computer, one in my car, one next to my bad, and one at work! Can't have enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like your rock n roll snarly....cop this","review":"Having seen Baby Animals go from pub band in perth to international stars all i can say is if you like your rock n roll snarly then this is the one for you. Suzi de Marchi will twist you 'round her little finger, while the rest of the band keeps it tight and pounding. Not a dud track on this album, definitely five star material"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BAND MOCKS RELIGION","review":"I have to say it, in \\"Waste of time\\" they don't even have their facts straight in the lyrics. They say that praying is a waste of time, which just isn't true. They are mocking people with religious beliefs. Read the lyrics and you'll see what I mean.That, for me spoilt an otherwise okay album.Musically it's rocks, lyrically it fails"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],O={key:0},C={key:1};function j(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(R,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-3b5df49e"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/55.md","filePath":"people/55.md"}'),W={name:"people/55.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
